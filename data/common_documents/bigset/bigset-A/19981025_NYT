DOGGED L.A. COLISEUM FINALLY HAS ITS DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They got their wish.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few years, in their efforts to lure an NFL
expansion team to Los Angeles, proponents of the Coliseum were
frustrated by the heavy layer of tarnish the stadium wore in the
minds of most NFL owners and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Football back in the Coliseum? The owners' noses would wrinkle
at the thought of police officers tumbling down stairways wrestling
silver-and-black-clad hooligans, traffic gridlocked for miles and
long lines of intoxicated patrons at the bathroom doors.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, many of the owners had visited the place to play
the Raiders during the team's 13-year reign of terror in this city.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum group knew the facility's image needed a thorough
rehabilitation. But it wasn't easily accomplished. The NFL tends to
route expansion and stadium issues through small committees before
troubling the ownership at large.
</P>
<P>
   That all changes this week. In an unusual move, the NFL has
agreed to conduct its latest expansion survey in open session, with
owners or top executives from all 31 teams set to hear
presentations from two Los Angeles groups and one Houston group at
a meeting Tuesday in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't mean the Coliseum is going to win anyone over, but at
least it has the opportunity to present its case with scale models,
artist's renderings and a one-hour sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we've called the owners and said, `We want to
come and show you our plans,''' said John Semcken, executive vice
president of New Coliseum Partners, a group led by Kings co-owner
Edward Roski Jr. ``It wasn't always easy to get in to those people.
`You should go to this committee, that committee. I'm not on that
committee.'''
</P>
<P>
   What they'll see Tuesday, Semcken promised, ``is 100 percent
opposite of what their image of the Coliseum is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum group, which is competing with a site in Carson
promoted by Hollywood figure Michael Ovitz, recently switched
architects to NBBJ of Los Angeles, the same firm that designed the
Staples Center arena downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The model will feature a stadium built from the ground up inside
the historic walls of the Coliseum _ featuring the requisite luxury
boxes and club seats _ new exposition halls in the park around the
stadium, a razed Sports Arena, and even revitalized construction
across Figueroa to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``The membership is familiar with the Coliseum,'' said Roger
Goodell, NFL executive vice president for league and football
development. ``There are certain aspects of the proposal that
they're going to hear that are different _ one being a new stadium
within the walls. There is also a great deal of political consensus
behind that facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski and his partners will be able to exhibit an agreement
signed just last week in which the Coliseum Commission granted them
two-year exclusivity to negotiate with the NFL for a team. It
demonstrates that ``we have the credentials to go ahead and seek a
team,'' Roski said.
</P>
<P>
   Currying support among the owners will still be a daunting,
uphill climb for this group, though. The NFL strongly favors
starting fresh with new stadium sites _ which is what Ovitz is
proposing in Carson and businessman Robert McNair in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The owners will have to be further convinced that the general
lawlessness at Raiders games was due more to the team's fan
prototype than to the surrounding neighborhood itself.
</P>
<P>
   Roski's group feels its track record with the Staples Center,
future home to basketball's Lakers and Clippers and hockey's Kings,
will serve to alter past perceptions of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The project is well under way, and the arena is already
commanding sponsor revenue and top-end ticket prices commensurate
with the size of L.A.'s market. The Coliseum group will exhibit
market studies that will suggest the same can be achieved, even in
seat-license sales, at a radically renovated football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you're renovating a facility, it is a
marketing challenge to convince people it's worth paying for,''
said a senior NFL official. ``When it's new, people have a
different viewpoint; maybe part of that is the mystery of the
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to the Disney people about their experience with
Edison Field, and that was one issue they said was most difficult
(convincing fans it was no longer Anaheim Stadium).''
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum group says it welcomes the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   All it wanted was an opportunity like this to make its case.

CARSON VOWS NOT TO BE ANOTHER IRWINDALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is difficult to watch the city of Carson become involved in a
bid for an NFL team and not think about Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   Irwindale is a small industrial community in Los Angeles County
with a modest annual budget that briefly courted the Raiders in the
early '80s. Irwindale planned to turn a gravel pit into a stadium
and bring the Greatness of the Raiders to the inland empire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Al Davis spurned the idea but not before walking away
with a $10 million dowry.
</P>
<P>
   Carson is a small industrial community in Los Angeles County,
with an annual budget around $40 million. It committed itself
Thursday to sell $180 million of bonds as its contribution to the
Michael Ovitz-led bid to land a NFL expansion team and plant a
stadium and mall on an old landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Were these two communities separated at birth?
</P>
<P>
   Carson officials say no. They know all about Irwindale's mess,
which serves as a living model of what a city should not do when it
gets involved with grandiose NFL dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Peter Fajardo and Councilman Daryl Sweeney have handled
most of the negotiations with Ovitz, the former Hollywood agent,
and they have four points that separate Carson from Irwindale and
any other city involved in stadium economics:
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; No public funds will be used.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; The bonds will only be placed on the market when
the NFL says it is coming to Carson.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; The Ovitz group must meet seven conditions
included in the resolution, ranging from third-party financial
guarantees to a financial sensitivity model.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Michael Ovitz is not Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council rushed its support of the bond issue Thursday
so Ovitz would have a strong commitment letter to take to Kansas
City for the NFL meetings on Tuesday. The Ovitz/Carson group, the
New Coliseum Partners and a public-private Houston group will make
critical presentations to the league owners.
</P>
<P>
   No one will win a franchise in K.C., but one could be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, a soft letter (of support) would have been
worse than no letter at all,'' said Sweeney, who will go to Kansas
City as Carson's representative. ``Without a significant level of
investment by us, the NFL owners would not support (the Ovitz
proposal).''
</P>
<P>
   The league requires public involvement in new franchises as a
hedge against more franchise free agency. A skeptic might say it's
just plain old extortion. Whatever the case, Carson's investment
seems smaller and safer than other city-stadium-team models.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of the stadium and mall will be around $650
million, not including $35 million in environmental upgrades.
Assuming the NFL exceeds its last franchise fee, $535 million for
the new Cleveland Browns, Ovitz/Carson is proposing, at the least,
a $1.2 billion project to bring football back to greater Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here, the
chance to turn a landfill into something that will return millions
to the city,'' said Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz chose Carson after looking at the land, which has been
unoccupied since 1964, the last year it was used as a landfill. The
Department of Toxic Substance Control has signed off on a $35
million upgrade that should bring the land up to environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
   There is no lack of dollars or star value to the Ovitz group,
either, a facet it believes is a strong selling point. The former
agent is the principal owner. His investment will be at least 30
percent, per NFL rules. Mall real estate mogul Herbert Glimcher,
who has an option on the land, has joined the group as a limited
partner related to the land and mall.
</P>
<P>
   Other part owners include broker Ted Forstmann, Northwest
Airlines chairman Gary Wilson, grocery store owner Ron Burkle and
international business man Gabriel Brener. Actors Tom Cruise and
Kevin Costner and L.A. basketball legends Jerry West, Shaquille
O'Neal and Magic Johnson will also have ownership shares.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz will also go to K.C. with Bank of America executive David
Coulter, who has extended Ovitz a $750 million line of credit for
this project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put a lot of time and effort into this, because I believe
it's worth it,'' Ovitz said, in one of his few public on-the-record
comments. ``I'm motivated to make this work, and I feel I can get
it done.''

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH CRIMINAL HISTORY FACE PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guillermo Sanchez-Regalado, a 30-year-old Mexican with a
sixth-grade education, was among the nearly 50,000 Mexicans picked
up in June for entering Arizona illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most, however, Sanchez was not simply sent back. A
Phoenix federal judge on Thursday sentenced him to two years in
prison for the crime of crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who served a previous U.S. prison term for selling $80
worth of cocaine, is part of a rapidly growing group of illegals
now being targeted for prosecution _ those who re-enter after
having been convicted of a serious crime and deported.
</P>
<P>
   At the current rate, more than 1,000 mostly Mexican illegals
with criminal histories will be sentenced by year's end in Arizona.
The cost to taxpayers: $30,000 per inmate per year.
</P>
<P>
   It is a controversial, expensive program that has stirred strong
feelings at federal courthouses in Arizona and other border states.
Prosecutors argue that the crackdown is a necessary means of
dealing with a dangerous group of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorneys call it a racist policy and a harsh
overreaction. They say it can devastate entire families when
someone who has been established here for years runs afoul of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Another side effect of the prosecutions is that they are
apparently adding to the dangers facing Border Patrol agents along
the U.S.-Mexico line.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Dokken, an assistant U.S. attorney in Phoenix, says the
prosecutions take bad guys off of the streets and give them a
strong incentive to stay out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't immigrants coming here to work,'' he said.
``They're coming here to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys have bad criminal records,'' he said,
including multiple offenses for such crimes as assault, drug
dealing and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   But public defender Alex Navidad thinks otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm outraged at what is happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a racist policy,'' Navidad said, adding that
prosecutors rush defendants into plea agreements that deny them
judicial procedures such as grand jury review and the right to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Navidad said the crackdown dispenses penalties vastly
disproportionate to the crime of re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying just coming into the country is as serious as
manslaughter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Navidad is also alarmed at the cost to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense,'' he said. ``We're saying, `We don't
want you here, but we're going to spend $60,000 to keep you here
for two years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress could achieve the deterrent effect it is after
with less severe sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Elizabeth Overholt, who handles dozens of the cases
each year, says the defendants get what they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to have long and varied criminal histories,'' she
said. Two of her recent cases included a Culiacan man with
convictions for assault and battery, car theft and robbery; and a
37-year-old with convictions on drug and sexual indecency charges.
Another defendant had been apprehended 53 times by police or
immigration authorities, Overholt said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Congress not only stiffened the penalties for criminal
deportees, it broadened the definition of ``aggravated felony'' and
so expanded the ranks of those subject to hefty prison terms for
illegally crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   Then lawmakers funded thousands of new Border Patrol positions
and squadrons of new prosecutors to handle immigration and drug
cases _ which make up about 80 percent of federal caseloads in
border states.
</P>
<P>
   The get-tough effort is also aided by recent computer technology
that allows for rapid fingerprint identification of persons
detained at the border. The IDENT system has thwarted illegals who
simply invented a new alias every time they were picked up. Such
deception had long made it impossible for authorities to determine
their true identity without a prohibitively long records check.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the severity of the new program's sentences, and its
cost to taxpayers, prosecutor Dokken said a public-education
campaign in Mexico may be in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the cost of incarcerating one person, we could probably
run ads down there so that these folks don't come back here and get
surprised and do time in jail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol spokesman Rob Daniels said word of the
prosecutions appears to be spreading slowly. Daniels also said that
the new prospect of jail time ``is part of the mix'' of factors
that has seen a sharp rise in violent confrontations between border
agents and illegals.
</P>
<P>
   The 159 assaults in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 more
than doubled the previous year's tally, he said. Another factor in
the increase is that the beefed-up Border Patrol is encountering
more illegals smuggling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Phoenix public defender Jeanette Alvarado said her
clients are stunned to learn about the prison time that awaits them
after being caught at the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're shocked,'' she said. ``They don't believe us. They
say, `I didn't hurt anyone. I didn't do anything. I just crossed
the border.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado, who was the attorney for Sanchez-Regalado, said her
client was so alarmed at the prospect of a stiff jail sentence that
he had first wanted to take the case to trial. But Alvarado
persuaded him to accept a plea bargain and a couple of years in
prison rather than risk a guilty verdict and possible six-year
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the prosecutions begin with capture by the Border
Patrol. Federal officials also check Maricopa County jail inmates
to determine whether they are here illegally; illegals are screened
for criminal histories and many are referred to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes these screenings pick up people who have been here for
years but have not obtained citizenship. Navidad said he has an
18-year-old client from central Phoenix who immigrated illegally 14
years ago with his family but has lost all his ties to Mexico. He
was arrested for illegal possession of a gun and now faces a prison
sentence and deportation.

   ``He'll be shipped to Mexico where he has no family. He hardly
speaks Spanish and he's American by culture,'' Navidad said. ``He
won't be able to survive down there _ but if he comes back here, he
can be prosecuted for that. They're setting him up for another two
to five years in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sands, the top federal public defender in Phoenix, has his
own tale to tell. It involved a woman who was pregnant and whom
prosecutors wanted to send to prison for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant the baby would have become a U.S. citizen
automatically,'' he said. And because authorities couldn't make
contact with her relatives in Mexico, Sands said, the baby would
have been put up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   When the case came to court, Sands said, Judge Stephen McNamee
decided to sentence the woman to the time she'd already served. &QL;

ILLEGAL _ Guillermo Sanchez-Regalado, a 30-year-old Mexican with a
sixth-grade education, was among the nearly 50,000 Mexicans picked
up in June for entering Arizona illegally. Unlike most, ho wever,
Sanchez was not simply sent back. A Phoenix federal judge sentenced
him to two years in prison for the crime of crossing the border.
Prosecutors argue that the crackdown is a necessary means of
dealing with a dangerous group of criminals. But defense attorneys
call it a racist policy and a harsh overreaction. By JERRY KAMMER.

COLISEUM BACKERS LOOK TO DISMISS RAIDERS' STAINED LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: also moving on the ``s'' sports wire) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- They got their wish.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few years, in their efforts to lure an NFL
expansion team to Los Angeles, proponents of the Memorial Coliseum
as the home site were frustrated by the heavy layer of tarnish the
stadium wore in the minds of most NFL owners and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Football back in the Coliseum? The owners' noses would wrinkle
at the thought of police officers tumbling down stairways wrestling
silver-and-black-clad hooligans, traffic gridlocked for miles and
long lines of intoxicated patrons at the bathroom doors.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, many of the owners had visited the place to play
the Raiders during the team's 13-year reign of terror in this city.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum group knew the facility's image needed a thorough
rehabilitation. But it wasn't easily accomplished. The NFL tends to
route expansion and stadium issues through small committees before
troubling the ownership at large.
</P>
<P>
   That all changes this week. In an unusual move, the NFL has
agreed to conduct its latest expansion survey in open session, with
owners or top executives from all 31 teams set to hear
presentations from two Los Angeles groups and one Houston group at
a meeting Tuesday in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't mean the Coliseum is going to win anyone over, but at
least it has the opportunity to present its case with scale models,
artist's renderings and a one-hour sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we've called the owners and said, We want to come
and show you our plans,'' said John Semcken, executive vice
president of New Coliseum Partners, a group led by Los Angeles
Kings hockey team co-owner Edward Roski Jr. ``It wasn't always easy
to get in to those people. `You should go to this committee, that
committee. I'm not on that committee.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What they'll see Tuesday, Semcken promised, ``is 100 percent
opposite of what their image of the Coliseum is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum group, which is competing with a site in the
neighboring suburb of Carson promoted by Hollywood figure Michael
Ovitz, recently switched architects to NBBJ of Los Angeles, the
same firm that designed the Staples Center basketball/hockey arena
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The model will feature a stadium built from the ground up inside
the historic walls of the Coliseum _ featuring the requisite luxury
boxes and club seats _ new exposition halls in the park around the
stadium, a razed Sports Arena, and even revitalized construction
across the street to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``The membership is familiar with the Coliseum,'' said Roger
Goodell, NFL executive vice president for league and football
development. ``There are certain aspects of the proposal that
they're going to hear that are different _ one being a new stadium
within the walls. There is also a great deal of political consensus
behind that facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski and his partners will be able to exhibit an agreement
signed just last week in which the Coliseum Commission granted them
two-year exclusivity to negotiate with the NFL for a team. It
demonstrates that ``we have the credentials to go ahead and seek a
team,'' Roski said.
</P>
<P>
   Currying support among the owners will still be a daunting,
uphill climb for this group, though. The NFL strongly favors
starting fresh with new stadium sites _ which is what Ovitz is
proposing in Carson and businessman Robert McNair in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The owners will have to be further convinced that the general
lawlessness at Raiders games was due more to the team's fan
prototype than to the surrounding neighborhood itself.
</P>
<P>
   Roski's group feels its track record with the Staples Center,
future home to basketball's Lakers and Clippers and hockey's Kings,
will serve to alter past perceptions of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The project is well under way, and the arena is already
commanding sponsor revenue and top-end ticket prices commensurate
with the size of L.A.'s market. The Coliseum group will exhibit
market studies that will suggest the same can be achieved, even in
seat-license sales, at a radically renovated football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you're renovating a facility, it is a
marketing challenge to convince people it's worth paying for,''
said a senior NFL official. ``When it's new, people have a
different viewpoint; maybe part of that is the mystery of the
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to the Disney people about their experience with
Edison Field, and that was one issue they said was most difficult
(convincing fans it was no longer Anaheim Stadium).''
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum group says it welcomes the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   All it wanted was an opportunity like this to make its case.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It is difficult to watch the city of Carson
become involved in a bid for an NFL team and not think about
Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   Irwindale is a small industrial community in Los Angeles County
with a modest annual budget that briefly courted the Raiders in the
early '80s. Irwindale planned to turn a gravel pit into a stadium
and bring the Greatness of the Raiders to what some like to call
the Inland Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Al Davis spurned the idea, but not before walking away
with a $10 million dowry.
</P>
<P>
   Carson is a small industrial community in Los Angeles County,
with an annual budget around $40 million. It committed itself
Thursday to sell $180 million in bonds as its contribution to the
Michael Ovitz-led bid to land a NFL expansion team and plant a
stadium and mall on an old landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Were these two communities separated at birth?
</P>
<P>
   Carson officials say no. Closer to the sprawling metropolitan
area's core, they nevertheless know all about Irwindale's mess,
which serves as a living model of what a city should not do when it
gets involved with grandiose NFL dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Peter Fajardo and Councilman Daryl Sweeney have handled
most of the negotiations with Ovitz, the former Hollywood agent,
and they have four points that separate Carson from Irwindale and
any other city involved in stadium economics:
</P>
<P>
   --No public funds will be used.
</P>
<P>
   --The bonds will only be placed on the market when the NFL says
it is coming to Carson.
</P>
<P>
   --The Ovitz group must meet seven conditions included in the
resolution, ranging from third-party financial guarantees to a
financial sensitivity model.
</P>
<P>
   --Michael Ovitz is not Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council rushed its support of the bond issue Thursday
so Ovitz would have a strong commitment letter to take to Kansas
City for the NFL meetings on Tuesday. The Ovitz/Carson group, the
New Coliseum Partners and a public-private Houston group will make
critical presentations to the league owners.
</P>
<P>
   No one will win a franchise in Kansas City, but one could be
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, a soft letter (of support) would have been
worse than no letter at all,'' said Sweeney, who will go to Kansas
City as Carson's representative. ``Without a significant level of
investment by us, the NFL owners would not support (the Ovitz
proposal).''
</P>
<P>
   The league requires public involvement in new franchises as a
hedge against more franchise free agency. A skeptic might say it's
just plain old extortion. Whatever the case, Carson's investment
seems smaller and safer than other city-stadium-team models.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of the stadium and mall will be around $650
million, not including $35 million in environmental upgrades.
Assuming the NFL exceeds its last franchise fee, $535 million for
the new Cleveland Browns, Ovitz/Carson is proposing, at the least,
a $1.2 billion project to bring football back to greater Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here, the
chance to turn a landfill into something that will return millions
to the city,'' said Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz chose Carson after looking at the land, which has been
unoccupied since 1964, the last year it was used as a landfill. The
Department of Toxic Substance Control has signed off on a $35
million upgrade that should bring the land up to environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
   There is no lack of dollars or star value to the Ovitz group,
either, a facet it believes is a strong selling point. The former
agent is the principal owner. His investment will be at least 30
percent, per NFL rules. Mall real estate mogul Herbert Glimcher,
who has an option on the land, has joined the group as a limited
partner related to the land and mall.
</P>
<P>
   Other part owners include broker Ted Forstmann, Northwest
Airlines chairman Gary Wilson, grocery store owner Ron Burkle and
international business man Gabriel Brener. Actors Tom Cruise and
Kevin Costner and L.A. basketball legends Jerry West, Shaquille
O'Neal and Magic Johnson will also have ownership shares.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz will also go to Kansas City with Bank of America executive
David Coulter, who has extended Ovitz a $750 million line of credit
for this project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put a lot of time and effort into this, because I believe
it's worth it,'' Ovitz said, in one of his few public on-the-record
comments. ``I'm motivated to make this work, and I feel I can get
it done.''

BRUINS SURVIVE AND ADVANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY _ It rained in Strawberry Canyon. Their bus broke down,
causing a 30-minute delay, and the sure-handed UCLA Bruins fumbled
on their first two touches.
</P>
<P>
   Then it got strange.
</P>
<P>
   Their best runner was the quarterback. Their best passer was the
tailback. Their kicker made a 45-yard extra point and the defense
had two _ count 'em, two _ goal-line stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that amazes me about this team is our attitude,''
UCLA offensive tackle Kris Farris said. ``We really have the belief
that no one can stop us. We don't care if we win by three in
overtime or by 78-7. We don't think we're going to lose. We
stumble, stumble, stumble, then turn it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn it on, turn it up, turn it around _ it seemingly makes no
difference to the Bruins, who defeated Cal 28-16 on Saturday before
55,000 at Memorial Stadium to extend the nation's longest winning
streak to 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, the postseason picture gains focus. The requiem for
success in the NCAA basketball tournament is ``survive and
advance,'' and the same is true for these Bruins (6-0, 4-0). One
loss, and they're out of the Fiesta Bowl hunt. One loss, and their
national championship dreams evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   This is Fall Madness, an 11-round, single-elimination
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each week, there's more pressure,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo
said. ``I feel like the gunslinger. Everybody's out to get us.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why their sense of satisfaction Saturday was
thicker than morning fog. This was hardly their most dominating
victory of the season. They sputtered on offense with their lowest
point and yardage (381) totals of the season. They committed 12
penalties, including three in succession, forcing Chris Sailer to
kick a 45-yard extra point. And they needed a watershed performance
from the defense _ albeit against the Pac-10's most inept offense _
to survive and advance.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the game, in fact, the No. 2 Bruins were outplayed
by a two-touchdown underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely didn't look like the No. 2 team,'' Cal
receiver Dameane Douglas said. ``Maybe No. 27 or 28, but not No.
2.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Six rounds down, five to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team is coming after us,'' linebacker Santi Hall said.
``We just have to find different ways to shut them down or score
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It can't get much different than Saturday, beginning with the
morning rain that caused 88 traffic accidents and a late-arriving
crowd. The Bruins dodged through traffic with their police escort,
but they could not overcome a broken bus and horrific start.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, quarterback Cade McNown fumbled. On the
second, tailback Jermaine Lewis lost a kickoff return. Eventually,
the Bruins found their groove, and McNown found Brian Poli-Dixon
for back-to-back touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   The second, from 35 yards, required Poli-Dixon to make a diving,
full-extension catch on the left sideline _ the prettiest stroke on
the afternoon canvass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cade put it where they couldn't get it,'' Poli-Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the defenses dominated. Cal placed nine defenders on
or near the line of scrimmage and dared the Bruins to beat
man-to-man coverage. Time and again, the Bears pressured McNown
before his receivers could break free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected this,'' Farris said. ``I kept telling people how
close it would be. Cal's defense made Nebraska look silly and they
made Washington look ridiculous last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Horrific field position _ caused by penalties and Cal punter
Nick Harris, whose right leg is a sand wedge _ created rare trouble
for Bruins offensive coordinator Al Borges. Of UCLA's 15
possessions, nine started inside the 20 and six inside the 10.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid turnovers, Borges stuffed half the offense in
his back pocket and waited for a chance to pounce.
</P>
<P>
   It came early in the fourth quarter, after a Cal touchdown
trimmed UCLA's lead to 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis returned the ensuing kickoff 32 yards, and the Bruins
finally had room to maneuver. On first down, McNown hit Poli-Dixon
for 14 yards. Then he found tight end Ryan Neufeld for 6 more. Once
in Cal territory, McNown ran left for 16.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Lewis started to sweep right, stopped, and
fired a 30-yard strike to freshman receiver Jon Dubravac, alone
near the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   !ital!We stumble, stumble, stumble, then turn it on.!off!
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on that in practice,'' Lewis said. ``I knew
(Dubravac's) eyes were really big, and I didn't know if he was
going to drop it or not. It all worked out.''

McNOWN'S GROUND GAME IS KEY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY _ Cade McNown's completion percentage (55.5) and
yardage (182) indicated a mediocre performance Saturday against
Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be more misleading. It was one of McNown's best,
in subtle ways as impressive as his three-touchdown, 395-yard game
last week against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   McNown was under pressure all game _ more pressure than he has
faced this season. Blitzing every chance they got, the Bears hit
McNown from all directions throughout the game. Once, he challenged
four defenders. He cut his left hand. He limped, he staggered, and
he won. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes time to make big plays, Cade McNown makes big
plays,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said after the 28-16 victory over
Cal. ``There's a reason we've won 16 consecutive games, and he's a
big part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown completed 15 of 27 passes, threw two touchdowns and
rushed for 57 yards (without getting sick) _ the first time this
season he's relied on his legs to get things done. He ran 34 yards
on third-and-6, 16 yards on second-and-4, and 11 yards on
third-and-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a good job bailing us out of bad situations,''
offensive coordinator Al Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of McNown's runs salvaged touchdown drives. They weren't by
design. He had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught a seam a couple times and was able to scamper for a
first down,'' he said. ``I don't look to run. But if it's a crucial
situation and everybody's covered, I've got to do what I've got to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Erasing the memory: Give one away, take one back _ that's the
way it's been for receiver Brian Poli-Dixon in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Against Oregon, he dropped an open touchdown that could have
given the Bruins a 31-14 third-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he made a spectacular, diving 35-yard touchdown catch
to give UCLA a 14-7 lead. It was the best catch by a Bruin this
year, by far, and one of the best this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel somewhat redeemed,'' said Poli-Dixon, who caught two
touchdowns despite playing with a bad wrist and sprained toe. ``It
seems people will remember (the drop) for a while. I had to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   What's up? Senior right guard Andy Meyers had several penalties,
including back-to-back offsides on UCLA's first extra point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a personal record,'' he said. ``I kept saying, `What's
going on? Am I focused?' I was focused. I was just doing things
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Short stuff: Center Shawn Stuart sprained his left ankle and
linebacker Tony White may have broken a finger on his left hand _
they'll know more today _ but neither injury is considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Durell Price had a 40-yard run to spark UCLA's first
scoring drive. It was his longest run of the season _ by 34 yards.
</P>
<P>
   White led the Bruins with 10 tackles, but five players combined
for eight tackles-for-loss.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Jason Stephens, starting his first game, had eight
tackles and a sack.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Brad Melsby had two catches _ increasing his season
total to five.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game against Stanford starts at 3:30 p.m. at the Rose
Bowl. &QL;

A CUFF AND A SLAP: HOW THE STARS TAMED TEAL MENACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Grant Marshall talked the talk. So he tried to walk the
walk last night.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't produce what Stars fans wanted _ Bryan Marchment's
head on a stick _ but it did provide a brief and lusty interlude in
the Stars' hard-earned 2-1 victory over the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Marchment escaped unharmed _ refunds, anyone? But there was a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him,'' the Stars' Marshall said, picking up the
narrative, ``and I kind of just gave him a push at first. He flew
back and sort of fell to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already knew at that point that I was getting a penalty, and
so ...''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Marshall cuffed him. Slapped him with his gloves still
on. And when the crowd at Reunion squealed with delight, and with
Marchment on his knees, looking so temptingly vulnerable, Marshall
slapped him again, this time on the chin.
</P>
<P>
   One more punch, we figured, and Marshall gets a banner in the
rafters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already knew I was getting the penalty,'' he continued. ``I
was just getting angry. I don't like what he does to players.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after he got hurt here two years ago and we were all
feeling for him, for him to do what he does to players with his
knees, it's just not fair. It's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was a sellout. The people had come with banners. ``Get
him, Grant,'' one of them read. And a personal favorite, ``Kill the
Teal Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   You know the story, the cheap shots, the doctor bills, the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Stars fans cried for revenge. But along the way, in typical Ken
Hitchcock cold-war fashion, an intriguing hockey game broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Marchment never did punch back.
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall got four minutes in the penalty box for high
sticking and roughing, and cheers from the audience whenever the
arena's Sony big screen flashed him sitting there.
</P>
<P>
   Game? What game?
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Marshall seemed pleased with himself, though he
admitted, ``I was getting down to their level and I'm not
completely happy with that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the buildup to the Sharks' first return to Reunion Arena
since last season's elbowfest playoff series, fourth-liner Marshall
had talked the talk. He announced that he took what Marchment did
to the Stars last season personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something may have to happen,'' Marshall had suggested on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So he cuffed him. Slapped him. And once, and only once, Stars
defenseman Derian Hatcher had a clear plow shot at Marchment on the
boards, only to have the Sharks defender spin partly away.
</P>
<P>
   But as battle royals go, there wasn't one. Marchment never
dropped his gloves. He never seemed to acknowledge the buildup, the
boos or the R-rated crowd chants.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there was Marshall. ``It was an emotional
night for everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Marshall's most ominous threat last night
figured to be head coach Hitchcock, who had to be seething after
the double-slap, double-minor that almost cost the Stars their
first-period lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitch went in the opposite direction, saying that he didn't
rail at Marshall or say anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a players' thing,'' Hitchcock said. ``Players
will do what they have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock is wise to keep the coaches out of this. If he
publicly promotes retaliation, he risks the chance that someone in
Sharks' teal will take another run at Joe Nieuwendyk or Mike
Modano. And Bryan Marchment, hockey nobody, is not worth that.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Marchment has been lionized in print. People have
quoted teammates, his wife, his host of ex-coaches, about what a
swell guy Marchment is.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, puh-leese. A no-talent boor is a no-talent boor. People pay
to see the Modanos, the Nieuwendyks and the Brett Hulls of the
hockey world. Marchment is a burr on the NHL's posterior.
</P>
<P>
   In the first reunion at Reunion, it took fourth-liner Grant
Marshall to stand up for the home team. Someone asked afterward if
Marshall thought this evened things out and meant the feud was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's ever over,'' Marshall said. ``Not with a
player like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Save the banners, in other words. The Teal Menace remains on
their minds.

UCLA'S DEFENSE GROWS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY _ The movable object met the resistible force Saturday
and the result, much to the pleasure of UCLA, was that nothing
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, for the first time this season, had to have a good
defensive performance and they delivered, holding Cal to a
season-low 224 yards and making a pair of goal-line stands that
loomed large in a 28-16 victory before 55,000 at Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (6-0) might be ranked No.2 and own the longest winning
streak in the nation at 16, but the Bruins had done it thus far by
outscoring their opponents. They were ninth in the Pac-10 in
defense and eighth in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense matured today,'' said defensive end Kenyon
Coleman, one of six freshmen or sophomores who started for UCLA.
``We know our offense is going to get it done, so it was time for
us to stand up. If we're looking to win a national championship,
we're going to need a national championship defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who had not gotten a sack from their defensive line
all season, had three on Saturday, including a pair from Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   They kept Cal (4-3) from getting any points on three trips
inside the UCLA 20 and for once, the offense didn't make it easy
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins quarterback Cade McNown fumbled the ball away at his own
2-yard line, leading to one score. The Bears got another when
linebacker Dekou Sanyika dropped Bruins fullback Durell Price in
the end zone for a safety.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cal's average starting position on its 14 possessions was
its own 40.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that this effort came against the Pac-10's worst offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for the defense, we wouldn't have won that
game,'' said UCLA guard Andy Meyers.``The defense was the heart of
the team today.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the heart of the matter were the goal-line stands.
</P>
<P>
   The first one came with 48 seconds left before halftime when
inside linebacker Robert Thomas, a true freshman, belted Cal
fullback Josh White as he tried to leap into the end zone on
second-and-goal at the 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The ball popped loose and safety Larry Atkins, with his knee on
the ground, tried to pick the ball up. As he did, quarterback
Justin Vedder stripped it away and guard Kevin Doherty recovered
the ball, apparently rescuing Cal.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials, after a brief discussion, ruled that Atkins'
knee was on the ground when he had possession of the ball and was
therefore down.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was able to run out the clock and take more than its 21-9
lead into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was huge,'' said Atkins of the play. ``If they score there,
that's a big-time mental shift in their direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' other huge stand came in the third quarter when they
were still nursing a 21-9 lead. Again Thomas was in the middle of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Cal had crisply moved to first-and-goal at the UCLA 2, but
freshman defensive end Santi Hall dropped tailback Marcus Fields
for no gain. Vedder, rolling to his left, then threw to tight end
Corey Smith, who failed to make a sliding catch in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   On third down, Fields took a pitch to his right and cut back,
but Thomas wrapped him up inches shy of the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Cal then brought in backup quarterback Samuel Clemens, who tried
to sneak in, but the Bruins' interior line of Ken Kocher, Micah
Webb and Pete Holland got a great surge and middle linebacker Tony
White flew in over the top for the most important of his
team-leading 10 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just pinched in and guessed right that they were going to
sneak,'' said UCLA defensive coordinator Nick Allioti. ``In that
situation, you've got to play the run and just try to react to the
play-action pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal did manage to score on its next drive, cutting the UCLA lead
to 21-16, but the stand also set the tone for later in the game.
The Bears, trailing 28-16, punted from fourth-and-1 with 11 minutes
to play.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great punt by Nick Harris, dying at the UCLA 2, but Cal
got the ball back only once more and never came close to midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all played good defense,'' Thomas said. ``It wasn't just
me. Everyone plugged their holes. The whole defense was the hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas might be accused of being a deferential freshman, but in
this case he was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins had an interception at the goal line, on a ball that was
tipped by corner Ryan Roques. Redshirt freshman Jason Stephens,
making his first start, had eight tackles at strong safety,
including two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played good defense,'' said Allioti. ``There was no magic.
The kids just stepped up and made big plays.''

STARS GET REVENGE HITCHCOCK'S WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Stars fans wanted the blood of Bryan Marchment last
night. Stars coach Ken Hitchcock wanted a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock won out. The Stars kept their heads, played within the
coach's system and took a 2-1 victory against Marchment and the San
Jose Sharks. The closest fans got to retribution against Marchment,
who last season injured three Stars players, was a first-period
nose thumping applied to Marchment's mug by Grant Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock's revenge was that, at the end of the game, his
team skated off with a 5-1-1 record. Marchment's San Jose Sharks
are winless at 0-4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are tied with the surprising Toronto Maple Leafs for
first place overall in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was, I thought, by far our best game of the year,'' a
glowing Hitchcock said after the Stars followed his lead and didn't
sacrifice a win to get even with Marchment. ``We had effort
throughout our lineup. We were able to play a four-line rotation
throughout the hockey game. In the critical areas, especially on
the forecheck, we were able to some good presence and good
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock praised his team for finally giving a solid effort in
the five-on-five game _ especially in the face of an emotional
contest that could have turned into a special teams extravaganza.
But as happy as Hitchcock was that there were only four power-play
opportunities for each team, the Stars had to rely on the man
advantage to score.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner and Pat Verbeek both scored on the power
play as the Stars continue to tear up the league at a record pace.
The Stars have 13 power-play goals in seven games after scoring 77
in 82 games last season. The franchise record is 91.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to score more at even strength, but the power play is
working right now,'' Verbeek said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars scored at the 2:26 mark of the first period after San
Jose's Stephane Matteau was called for interference 39 seconds into
the game. Verbeek's hard shot was followed by Joe Nieuwendyk
fighting for a rebound, and that left Langenbrunner wide open to
dish a loose puck into an empty net.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for Stars fans, that was about the time Marchment was
tied up with his goaltender, Mike Vernon _ and they let Public
Enemy No. 1 know with a hearty cheer.
</P>
<P>
   At all other junctures, Marchment, who played almost 19 minutes
with four hits and two takeaways, received healthy boos every time
he stepped on the ice. One fan brought a police shooting target
complete with bull's-eyes on the knees, while a trio of fans wore
knee pads that read: ``Marchment Protectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchment took out Mike Modano, Greg Adams and Nieuwendyk last
season with knee injuries, as well as injuring Carolina Hurricanes
forward Kevin Dineen. He was suspended a total of 11 games for the
incidents, and Marshall said before the game last night that
``someone's got to pay for what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock played Marshall on a right wing with Nieuwendyk _
partly because of Marshall's improving play and partly for
protection _ and Marshall found his way into Marchment's face on
several occasions. Although Marshall finished with eight hits, he
was also whistled for a double-minor in the first period for high
sticking and roughing against Marchment.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it was a dangerous play as the Stars had to kill
four minutes of a Sharks power play while clinging to a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock said he did not criticized Marshall for the
retaliatory penalty, and the Stars ended up successfully killing
all four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue with Marchment, the players will do what they
have to do,'' Hitchcock said. ``I felt we were good in the areas
that we need to be, but he was just one of their six \Rdefensemen\S
that we needed to get after.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars did just that, winning battles for the puck, getting
the puck in deep behind the defensemen and dominating attack time.
The Stars had 24 shots on goal and another 21 that missed the net.
The Sharks had 17 shots on goal and five misses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Marshall's eight hits, defenseman Richard
Matvichuk contributed 11, a season high for him, and the Stars
finished with 46.
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of team effort that had the Stars believing that
they had taken plenty of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big picture is we played a hard-fought game,'' Marshall
said. ``It was a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars play next Friday night at home against Anaheim.

A DEAD END FOR BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The best thing about the Bruins' longest
road trip of the season? It's over. Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins lost, 3-1, to the New Jersey Devils Saturday night
and headed for home with a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   They go back out on the road for a game Wednesday night in
Montreal and then return to Boston to meet the Canadiens again
Thursday night at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The trip started promisingly with a 3-0 win at Colorado, one of
two victories in the first three games, and it sputtered at the
end. There was a 3-1 loss in Phoenix, then a 3-0 shutout in
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   And now this one.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Bruins had trouble putting the puck in the net.
Once again, they had trouble even putting the puck on net.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins fell to 3-4-1 after a 2-4 trip. The Devils evened
their record at 3-3, winning back-to-back games for the first time
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was still alive until well into the third period. It was
2-1 until Dave Andreychuk tossed the puck toward the net, followed
it, and clogged up the goalmouth to enable the puck to get by Rob
Tallas with 5:32 left, finishing off the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very frustrating,'' Tallas said. ``It went off a good three
players. I was trying to grab at it. It was kind of unfortunate. A
big guy like that goes to the net, and things happen. That's how he
gets his goals. They worked hard tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal was not posted on the scoreboard until after a long
video review by officials unsure whether Andreychuk had pushed the
puck in with his hands. The goal stood.
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of goal Bruins coach Pat Burns wishes he was
seeing more of from his guys. ``They just throw it at the net and
then find a way to get a rebound,'' he said. ``That's how they
score their goals, whether they're off a glove, off a stomach, or
off a stick. They find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils got the only goal of the first period when Peter
Sykora came from behind the net and poked the puck toward the goal.
It went off the back of Jason Allison's leg and past Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Terreri, making his 1998-99 debut in his return to the
Devils after a couple of years away, turned away 20 shots. Terreri,
who spent the last two years in San Jose and Chicago, was
reacquired by New Jersey in an August trade to back up Martin
Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, outshot, 21-10, through two periods, broke out of a
power-play slump with a second-period score by Sergei Samsonov that
tied it, 1-1. But former Boston University forward Jay Pandolfo got
that one back with his first goal of the year, and it was 2-1,
Devils going into the third.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes into the period, Kevin Dean was called for delay of
game after he closed his hand on the puck, and things were looking
up for the Bruins. But this power play fizzled. The Bruins could
not manage even a shot on net.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute after that power play ended, the Bruins got
another chance when Randy McKay went off for a crosscheck. This
time they controlled the puck, put three shots on net, but couldn't
get one past Terreri.
</P>
<P>
   Things opened up after that, and the Devils put the pressure on.
Bobby Holik had a big bid that broke through and trickled wide of
Tallas and the net. Then Patrik Elias had a shot that hit off the
post.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils got a power-play opportunity when Darren Van Impe was
called for interference at 13:59. Half a minute later, Andreychuk
had his goal and it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas, making his second start of the season, had held off the
Devils at the start of the third period. Holik had a shot from the
side of the net that Tallas smothered. And then Elias broke in
alone, got Tallas down, but lost the puck when he tried to get it
back on his forehand.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the game, the Bruins had scored one goal in their
last 21 power-play chances. On their first man advantage, in the
opening period, they didn't get a shot.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, they had one chance and made goal scoring
look easy. With Krzysztof Oliwa off for a slash on Dave Ellett, Ray
Bourque passed across from the left side to Allison, who moved in a
couple of steps and slid the puck to Samsonov in the middle.
Samsonov had an open net and put in his third goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great play,'' said Steve Heinze. ``But we can't
rely on them every night. We've got four lines dressed and we've
got to get some other guys contributing, including me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who started the season with three goals in each of
their first three games, have scored only two in their last three
games.
</P>
<P>
   They will take Sunday off. And then regroup for the
home-and-home duel with Montreal.

USC'S SOWARD IS SHUT DOWN BY DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Perhaps the key to Oregon's 17-13 victory over
USC on Saturday was the way Trojans wide receiver R. Jay Soward was
completely shut down by the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Soward had just three receptions for 9 yards, his lowest output
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Soward said he stopped himself more than anything that was
done by Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything today. I had a poor performance,'' Soward
said. ``I was stopping myself. I've never been in a game this big
and you can't let emotions take over.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said one reason Soward had a quiet game
was because quarterbacks Mike Van Raaphorst and Carson Palmer
failed to find him on pass plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Mike or Carson gave R. Jay much of a chance,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, Oregon coach Mike Bellotti felt his defense did
an excellent job on Soward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shutting down R. Jay Soward, I don't know if he had any
positive yards, but that's awesome,'' Bellotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward said he felt like throwing up after the game. Asked if it
was from his performance or illness, Soward replied, ``a little bit
of both.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the quarterbacks: USC's quarterback controversy raged on
with full force, as Palmer replaced Van Raaphorst early in the
second quarter and then returned to play the final 19 minutes of
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the two guys played in the first half fairly even,''
Hackett said. ``After (Palmer) made a couple plays outside the
pocket, we felt we needed to stay with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst did not experience any nausea, which had sidelined
him last week against Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking woes: USC senior kicker Adam Abrams said he pulled his
first missed field goal, from 28 yards, and pushed his second
attempt, from 36 yards in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happens. There's not always an explanation for it,''
Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams also missed a 47-yarder, while making field goals from 49
and 25 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: Safety Grant Pearsall was the only injured
Trojan, suffering from a badly swollen knee after a sack of fluid
burst outside the kneecap.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably miss practice today but is expected to play
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Mark Cusano, who has been bothered by a sore thigh,
did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's debut: Taft High graduate Jerry Brown made his first
appearance of the season for Oregon, with 5 yards in two carries. &QL;

TROJANS' UPSET BID FALLS SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ There was disappointment, but not devastation. A
USC team with a we've-been-here-too-many-times attitude couldn't be
that stunned after losing another winnable game.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans came to noisy Autzen Stadium and held the nation's
12th-ranked team 30 points below its scoring average.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans became the first road team to hold a lead over
Oregon this season.
</P>
<P>
   USC did a lot of nice things Saturday, except win, and its 17-13
loss to the Ducks before 45,807 resurrected an all-too-familiar
feeling inside the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like an everyday thing for me,'' USC wide receiver R.
Jay Soward said. ``It's been happening for three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was shocked by the result, but rather the method by which
the Trojans experienced their latest downfall. Oregon (6-1, 3-1),
looking ripe for upset after last week's overtime loss to UCLA, and
without leading rusher Reuben Droughns, struggled offensively
almost the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   And even that wasn't enough for the Trojans (5-3, 3-2) to pull
off the upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team averages 50 points, and you hold them to 17, and
you don't win, your offense was awful,'' USC right guard Travis
Claridge said.
</P>
<P>
   That might be a little strong, but the Trojans offense failed to
convert on several major opportunities, and it cost USC the game
and any chance of reaching the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kicker Adam Abrams missed three field goals, including 28- and
36-yard attempts in the first quarter that robbed USC a chance to
give Oregon something to worry about early.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're very disappointed when you miss two field goals
early,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``You like to think it won't
matter, but it does. When we squandered those two field goals,
there was an ominous feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Trailing 17-10 with less than six minutes left, quarterback
Carson Palmer's 7-yard touchdown pass to Mike Bastianelli was
nullified by a delay-of-game penalty.
</P>
<P>
   It kept Palmer from a possible hero's role, after he played more
than starter Mike Van Raaphorst for the first time this season when
Van Raaphorst was healthy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three plays later, Hackett elected to kick a 25-yard field
goal, instead of going for the touchdown. Hackett reasoned that
with 4:18 remaining, the Trojans would get the ball back, but they
never did as Oregon successfully ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (4:18) left made me think there was enough time,'' Hackett
said. ``I don't know, maybe next time I'd do it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been less than 8 yards, or 5 yards (from the end
zone), we would have gone for it. (But) I thought we could kick the
field goal and the defense could get jacked up from the field
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's decision, reminiscent of his choice to kick a field
goal from the 1-yard line in a 32-31 loss to Cal, was a judgment
call that became magnified because USC lost.
</P>
<P>
   But there wasn't much dissent about the call from the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If coach Hackett wants me to run up in the stands and grab him
a beer, and come back down and a do a pirouette, I'll do it,''
Soward said. ``He's the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to say about that. I'm not the coach,'' added
Claridge.
</P>
<P>
   More costly was the delay-of-game penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer never saw the 25-second clock expire, just before he
threw a perfect pass to Bastianelli in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   He was hardly the scapegoat, however. Things had broken down
earlier, when Palmer was forced to sprint to the huddle after
waiting for the play to be delivered from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the play in faster and he needs to see the
clock,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know (about the clock),'' Palmer said. ``I got the
play and ran in the huddle as fast as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after that miscue, Palmer was confident the Trojans defense
would hold Oregon and allow him one more shot at a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was plenty of time to get the ball back,''
Palmer said. ``Maybe we should have gone for it.''
</P>
<P>
   While USC was coming up short in crunch time, Oregon merely
turned to its star quarterback, Akili Smith, to pull off the play
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 10 and the Ducks facing a third down,
Smith rolled out on the option, kept the ball and raced right up
the middle of the field for a 62-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an option,'' linebacker David Gibson said. ``He
turned it into a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans defense, which held Oregon under 400 yards for the
first time this season, was robbed of any satisfaction from its
effort and left to ponder how close it came to an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left everything out there,'' Gibson said. ``They're a very
good team. But the season's not over. There's other bowls out
there. If we win the rest of our games, we can still salvage the
rest of the season.''

OREGON'S SMITH MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Take away a pair of big plays and Oregon's Akili
Smith had 10 net yards rushing and 176 yards passing Saturday
against USC.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the thing about Smith: No matter how good the defense
or the amount of preparation, it's darn near impossible to take
away his big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Akili's escapability and ability to create plays is what makes
him a special quarterback,'' Oregon coach Mike Bellotti said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, it was Smith's nimble feet and strong right
arm that enabled Oregon to come away with a 17-13 victory at Autzen
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's incredible,'' said Oregon safety Michael Fletcher. ``The
things he can do are fun to watch. He can make a big play at any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning touchdown, a nifty 62-yard option keeper by Smith
with 10:50 left to play, was designed to give the Ducks a new set
of downs. It surely wasn't supposed to turn into 60 yards of open
turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to dive to get the first down if I had to,'' Smith
said. ``All we wanted was the first down. Then I happened to see a
little hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he (begin ital)created(end ital) a little hole.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon was in danger of giving the ball away, facing a
third-and-2, in a game that was tied 10-10. Smith took the snap,
headed down the line to the left and cut upfield after faking a
pitch to freeze defensive end Sultan Abdul-Malik. He received a
crisp block from guard Stefan de Vries and ran it all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I cut it up all I saw was open AstroTurf,'' Smith said.
``Then all I was doing was trying to use what speed I have. I saw a
shadow to my right side and looked that way. I wanted to make sure
somebody wasn't behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was definitely Smith's longest run as a Duck and he believes
his longest run ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``My longest run before was something like 20 yards,'' said
Smith, who gained 97 yards, but also lost 25 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't, however, his only important rush of the night. Just
three plays earlier, Smith had escaped the pressure on a
second-and-13 play and scurried for 17 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the one long run, which obviously was great, but
he had several other (winding) conversions in long-yard
situations,'' Bellotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith certainly didn't have much chance to run in the first 30
minutes on Saturday. With Oregon's three best running backs on the
sideline, the running game was going nowhere and the Trojans (5-3,
3-2) were able to concentrate on chasing Smith. At halftime, Smith,
who directs an offense which entered averaging 48.5 points per
game, had five rushes for minus-14 yards and was sacked twice. He
did manage to throw for 171 yards, but the Ducks only had three
points on the board.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of first-half success was caused by one thing,
according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are probably the best defense in the Pac-10 and maybe the
best we'll face this year,'' said Smith, who completed 15 passes in
28 attempts for 231 yards. ``Their defense is a lot better than
UCLA. They have so much speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's first truly big play of the night came on the Ducks'
first possession of the second half and on third down. Oregon (6-1,
3-1) was 5 yards short of the first-down marker when Smith dropped
back to pass, calmly stepped forward to avoid the rush and hit his
third option, Tony Hartley, on a deep post pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first option was (tight end) Jed Weaver and then I jumped
to the fullback (Chad Chance),'' Smith said. ``I looked up and saw
T. Hartley running wide open. All I had to do was hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Smith might not have hit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure he would have had the patience to do that last
year,'' said Hartley, who finished with six catches for a
career-high 118 yards.

<P>
   It is difficult to watch the city of Carson become involved in a
bid for an NFL team and not think about Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   Irwindale is a small industrial community in Los Angeles County
with a modest annual budget that briefly courted the Raiders in the
early '80s. Irwindale planned to turn a gravel pit into a stadium
and bring the Greatness of the Raiders to what some like to call
the Inland Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Al Davis spurned the idea, but not before walking away
with a $10 million dowry.
</P>
<P>
   Carson is a small industrial community in Los Angeles County,
with an annual budget around $40 million. It committed itself
Thursday to sell $180 million in bonds as its contribution to the
Michael Ovitz-led bid to land a NFL expansion team and plant a
stadium and mall on an old landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Were these two communities separated at birth?
</P>
<P>
   Carson officials say no. Closer to the sprawling metropolitan
area's core, they nevertheless know all about Irwindale's mess,
which serves as a living model of what a city should not do when it
gets involved with grandiose NFL dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Peter Fajardo and Councilman Daryl Sweeney have handled
most of the negotiations with Ovitz, the former Hollywood agent,
and they have four points that separate Carson from Irwindale and
any other city involved in stadium economics:
</P>
<P>
   --No public funds will be used.
</P>
<P>
   --The bonds will only be placed on the market when the NFL says
it is coming to Carson.
</P>
<P>
   --The Ovitz group must meet seven conditions included in theresolution, ranging from third-party financial guarantees to a
financial sensitivity model.
</P>
<P>
   --Michael Ovitz is not Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council rushed its support of the bond issue Thursday
so Ovitz would have a strong commitment letter to take to Kansas
City for the NFL meetings on Tuesday. The Ovitz/Carson group, the
New Coliseum Partners and a public-private Houston group will make
critical presentations to the league owners.
</P>
<P>
   No one will win a franchise in Kansas City, but one could be
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, a soft letter (of support) would have been
worse than no letter at all,'' said Sweeney, who will go to Kansas
City as Carson's representative. ``Without a significant level of
investment by us, the NFL owners would not support (the Ovitz
proposal).''
</P>
<P>
   The league requires public involvement in new franchises as a
hedge against more franchise free agency. A skeptic might say it's
just plain old extortion. Whatever the case, Carson's investment
seems smaller and safer than other city-stadium-team models.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of the stadium and mall will be around $650
million, not including $35 million in environmental upgrades.
Assuming the NFL exceeds its last franchise fee, $535 million for
the new Cleveland Browns, Ovitz/Carson is proposing, at the least,
a $1.2 billion project to bring football back to greater Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here, the
chance to turn a landfill into something that will return millions
to the city,'' said Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz chose Carson after looking at the land, which has been
unoccupied since 1964, the last year it was used as a landfill. The
Department of Toxic Substance Control has signed off on a $35
million upgrade that should bring the land up to environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
   There is no lack of dollars or star value to the Ovitz group,
either, a facet it believes is a strong selling point. The former
agent is the principal owner. His investment will be at least 30
percent, per NFL rules. Mall real estate mogul Herbert Glimcher,
who has an option on the land, has joined the group as a limited
partner related to the land and mall.
</P>
<P>
   Other part owners include broker Ted Forstmann, Northwest
Airlines chairman Gary Wilson, grocery store owner Ron Burkle and
international business man Gabriel Brener. Actors Tom Cruise and
Kevin Costner and L.A. basketball legends Jerry West, Shaquille
O'Neal and Magic Johnson will also have ownership shares.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz will also go to Kansas City with Bank of America executive
David Coulter, who has extended Ovitz a $750 million line of credit
for this project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put a lot of time and effort into this, because I believe
it's worth it,'' Ovitz said, in one of his few public on-the-record
comments. ``I'm motivated to make this work, and I feel I can get
it done.''

NORTHRIDGE TITLE HOPES   TAKE BIG HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 &HT;     c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Two weeks ago, Cal State Northridge was
sitting pretty. Perched atop the Big Sky Conference while everyone
wondered how.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Matadors must fight, claw, scratch, pull hair and do
anything else to save a season that is rapidly slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   After winning by protecting the ball, CSUN is again an
afterthought in the conference race because of its penchant for
giving it away.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, ranked 24th, will tumble from the national
rankings this week thanks to a 32-26 loss to Montana State in front
of a homecoming and season-high crowd of 6,124 on Saturday at North
Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win out,'' CSUN safety Vito Clemente said. ``We win
every game from here. Weber State's next. We beat them and take it
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors turned the ball over four times, and they have done
so nine times in the last two games. And that's in great contrast
to the first half of the season when CSUN (4-3, 3-2 Big Sky)
committed four turnovers in its first five games.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman quarterback Marcus Brady had the worst day of
his young career, throwing for 152 yards and three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to take blame,'' said Brady, who completed 16 of 33.
``I'll get over it. It's hard right now, but I've been through this
situation in high school. I'll get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The final interception capped a rough afternoon for Brady, who
was given one more chance to rally the Matadors in the final minute
after CSUN came to life late.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clemente recovered a fumble and pitched it to Brennen
Swanson, who ran the final 73 yards for a touchdown to pull the
Matadors within 32-26 with 3:35 left.
</P>
<P>
   Then CSUN forced a punt to give Brady one last drive. But after
a pair of first downs moved the ball to the Montana State 40, Brady
was intercepted by Shon Flores on a poorly thrown deep ball with 22
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious issue is the turnovers,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano
said. ``We turn the ball over twice, we win the game. We turn the
ball over three times, maybe even then we win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   However, this one goes beyond just the turnovers. Montana State
(5-2, 3-1) made a bundle of mistakes yet persevered.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN blocked a pair of punts, one of which led to a 5-yard Brady
touchdown run, but saw three drives stall inside the Bobcats'
15-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Marquez booted four field goals, but that underscored the
Matadors' inability to deliver a crushing blow early on.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors led 13-7 two plays into the second quarter, when
Marquez kicked a 30-yard field goal, but could have been up by two
touchdowns had they not squandered touchdown chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, it's a slam to the defense because you
come off the field fired up. You just blocked a punt,'' said safety
Jeremy Golden, who led CSUN with 11 tackles. ``Everybody is (hyped)
up. You take a seat on the sideline and then you're up again. You
don't convert on that, the defense comes out slower and their
offense is more fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   Well then, imagine how the defense felt in the fourth quarter
when the Bobcats scored 13 points in 1:40.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 19, Montana State's Eric Kinnaman (15
carries, 151 yards) broke a 63-yard run on a draw. One play later,
Lathian Tyler scored from 7 yards out to put the Bobcats ahead
26-19.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play from scrimmage, linebacker Kevin Lundstrom
intercepted Brady for the first of two times. Three plays later
quarterback Rob Compson rolled right and fired back down the left
sideline for a 48-yard scoring play to Chip Hobbs. Montana State
botched the PAT but led 32-19 with 7:33 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran the ball better than I thought we would be able to,''
Montana State coach Cliff Hysell said. ``We handled the blitz
really well, and that draw was a big play. When you blitz against
the draw it's either hit or miss, and obviously that was a hit for
us.''

NORTHRIDGE NOT HIS BLUE HEAVEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Maybe Melvin Blue brought it on himself
when he boasted last summer that ``I know I can run for 2,000
(yards)'' _ and said his actual goal was 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Cal State Northridge head coach Ron Ponciano is at fault
for stating flatly he expected a 1,000-yard season from the senior
tailback who transferred from Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should blame the NFL scouts who have shadowed Blue in
games and practices, impressed by his 6-foot, 230-pound body, a
powerful weapon for a between-the-tackles runner.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the coverboy of the Northridge football media guide is
simply a bust.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is _ too-high expectations or too-low yardage or a
combination of both _ Blue is a disappointment, and the fact he
carried the ball only once in the second half of the 32-26
Northridge loss to Montana State on Saturday is the latest
illustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm more hurt than disappointed,'' Blue said after the
game, in which he ran 11 times for 58 yards in the first half and
then watched Jaumal Bradley take most of the handoffs in the
second. ``I'm mad when I'm on the sideline, because I always
wonder, `What would I have done?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess whatever they (the Northridge coaches) think is best
for the team...''
</P>
<P>
   The Northridge coaches said the score is one of the reasons Blue
disappeared to the sideline _ trailing in the second half and
having to pass more, the Matadors turned to Bradley, who's a better
blocker and functions better than Blue in a one-back formation.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, another reason is that Blue had fumbled in the first
half, a continuation of the problem that contributed to last week's
loss to Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect him to not fumble the ball,'' Ponciano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) it doesn't mean he's hitting the bench for the rest of
the season. He's going to win some games for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it looked as if Blue was winning his personal battle
when he rushed for 117 yards on 20 carries and scored on runs of 18
and 15 yards in the game at Sac State.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly party time: 117 is about two-thirds what he'd
need to average to get to 2,000 in the Matadors' 11-game season.
But at least the 100-yard game and his 5.9-yard average that day
were a step up from the first five games, when his totals read 67,
96, 77, 43 and 7, and his averages went 2.4, 3.8, 3.3, 3.1 and 1.2.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden improvement last week suggested that instead of being
buried behind Bradley, in fact Blue was thriving as the coaches
kept him out of the kind of one-back situations that favor niftier
runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melvin is a productive back situationally,'' is the way
running backs coach Keith Borges put it.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging, but not exactly the way Blue was advertised.
</P>
<P>
   All-league at Banning High, he rushed for 741 yards for Utah
State as a junior, including 100-yard games against Idaho State and
Colorado State. A falling out with the coaches and the birth of a
daughter in Hawthorne caused him to look for a way out of Logan.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano was happy to take him, a Division I-A transfer with NFL
potential.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the limitations of a cash-poor Division I-AA program
like Northridge's is that it can't know everything about its
recruits. So it's possible Blue never was as good as his press
clippings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody at Northridge wants to say that.
</P>
<P>
   Borges in particular was worried that ``negative (stuff)'' in
the paper might damage Blue's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just disappointed for him,'' rather than in him, Borges
said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach shouldn't worry about Blue's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old still talks about playing professional football,
something few Matadors have done. Interviewed outside the locker
room after Saturday's game, he worried that he might say the wrong
thing and turn off the NFL, to which he might still be a prospect
if he learns to play fullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to (be seen as) a player that shuts his mouth and
does his job,'' Blue said. ``That's important at the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you don't put it that I'm blaming other people.''
</P>
<P>
   He also points out _ and who can argue? _ that it's hard to make
a splash carrying the ball for a team whose injury-ridden offensive
line hasn't been intact for back-to-back games and which emphasizes
quarterback Marcus Brady's passing in any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could be here next year, it would be different,'' Blue
said. ``We've got some (begin ital)boys(end ital) coming in (to the
offensive line) next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. This year is all a senior's got, the young man with
2,000-yard dreams is on pace for 730, and that's not what anybody
had in mind. &QL;

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Oct. 17,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

 &HT;    Race no cookie-cutter for underdog Coles
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When his turn came to introduce President Clinton to
the state's Democratic elite at a fund-raiser this past summer,
Michael Coles had to pause for a few moments at the podium as he
fought back tears.
</P>
<P>
   Coles, the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate, was overcome
with emotion by Gov. Zell Miller's warm words of introduction for
him, a rags-to-riches kid from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got choked up because of what Zell said about me,'' Coles
recalled recently. ``For a man like me to introduce the president
of the United States and to have the governor say the things he
said, you'd have to be stoic to have it not affect you.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller had labeled Coles a ``smart persistent optimist,'' a
gutsy fighter who'd overcome long odds in recovering from a
near-fatal motorcycle accident. In his first political race in
1996, Miller noted, Coles had taken on House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and won a surprising 47 percent of the vote in Republican-leaning
Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have never done that well there, and Mr. President,
as good as you are, you have never done that well there,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   But as promising as Coles' candidacy may have seemed at the time
_ polls showed his opponent, Sen. Paul Coverdell, was beatable _
his campaign since then has struggled to raise money and energize
the party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not taken off as expected,'' said Charles Bullock, a
political scientist at the University of Georgia. ``In the national
picture, this was a race to keep an eye on. If you're a challenger,
you should be in position to raise a fair amount of money. But if
he didn't have his own wealth to tap into, he would hardly be
visible.''
</P>
<P>
   If Coles loses, as many experts expect, he will have spent a
total of more than $5 million of his personal fortune chasing two
improbable upsets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running against Newt was a long shot, and running against an
incumbent U.S. senator is a long shot,'' said former Rep. Buddy
Darden. ``But Michael's a risk-taker, an entrepreneur. His
philosophy is that if you don't run the race, there's no way you
can win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles, 54, who stands no more than 5 feet 6 inches tall in the
heeled, pointy-toed cowboy boots he wears with fine suits, got rich
making chocolate chip cookies. He has reported a net worth in the
range of $17 million to $51 million.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in blue-collar neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Buffalo and
Miami in a close-knit family that valued hard work. His mother was
one of the fortunate few in her extended family who escaped Poland
and the Nazi death camps of World War II. His father was a rag
merchant who lost his business in a dream-crippling fire when Coles
was 8.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, Coles worked multiple jobs, often to the detriment of
his schoolwork. At age 16, he decided to leave Miami and his job
managing a clothing store to finish high school in Rockport, Mass.,
where his older brother had settled.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to build an academic base for college, but after he
graduated from high school he got an offer he couldn't refuse. The
owner of the Miami store offered him $150 a week to return as
manager, plus one-third ownership of the store.
</P>
<P>
   He took it, married at age 20 and promptly had two children. The
young family lived mostly in Chicago and Detroit as Coles became a
successful men's clothing salesman. He divorced and remarried in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, a visit to a cookie shop during a clothing
trade show in San Diego convinced Coles and his second wife, Donna,
to switch businesses. They teamed with another couple to found the
Great American Cookie Co. with $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   As the often-repeated story goes, the company's first batch of
cookies burned so badly that the fire department was summoned. Even
so, their first store at Perimeter Mall in Sandy Springs mushroomed
into a nationwide franchise operation with sales of more than $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most other cookie stores then looked like bakeries,'' Coles
said. ``The sales people weren't trained to sell and they didn't
offer at lot. We're just loaded with product. As my father used to
say, you can't sell from an empty pushcart.''
</P>
<P>
   The company probably wouldn't have been so successful, Coles
said, if a freak motorcycle accident hadn't forced him to stay in
one spot and focus on organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Coles wrecked his bike after a rock locked his rear
wheel. The cycle hit a curb and he flew into a telephone pole.
Doctors said he'd never be able to walk unaided again.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to settle for that outcome, he began a rigorous rehab
program that started with stationary bikes, evolved into bike
racing and culminated in two world records for cross-country
bicycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rode the stationary bicycle like Superman,'' said
entertainer Isaac Hayes, who bumped into Coles at a Sandy Springs
gym many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael earned his way up and he didn't forget it,'' said
Hayes, composer of the 1971 Oscar-winning theme from the movie
``Shaft'' who also penned a special song for Coles' daughter's bat
mizvah.
</P>
<P>
   Coles helped Hayes out when he ran into financial troubles
several years ago. ``Isaac has gone through some ups and downs,''
Coles said. ``When you go through the ups, you have lots of
friends. When you're down, your Rolodex empties out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes now spends most Thanksgivings with Coles' family and
closest friends at his rambling rustic home in Kennesaw. The couple
bought the house in the 1970s before they were wealthy and have
added on several times. They also own a retreat in Montana, where
Coles enjoys fly-fishing and photography.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Coles sold his interest in the cookie company in
1993, he also was a budding philanthropist and major political
contributor. Donna Coles has been a full partner in those
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't quote me as saying they're joined at the hip, but they
are,'' said James Fleming, president of the Kennesaw State
University Foundation, which Coles chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Coles contributed more than $1 million to the university's
business school, which now carries his name. Appropriately, the
business school is particularly well-known for its entrepreneurship
program. U.S. News &AMP; World Report recently ranked the program 21st
in the country, tied with the University of Chicago and ahead of
Emory University and the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the state's top political figures, including Miller and
House Speaker Tom Murphy, knew Donna Coles before they ever met her
husband. She had lobbied at the state Capitol on a variety of
issues, including the Equal Rights Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was absolutely respected by everybody,'' said Steve
Anthony, executive director of the state Democratic Party and a
longtime former aide to Murphy. ``The speaker didn't agree with
her, but he got to know her and like her.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles considers himself a conservative Democrat in the mold of
Miller and former Sen. Sam Nunn. But he supported Republican Johnny
Isakson over Miller for governor in 1990 and has contributed to
other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, however, Coles had swung back to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to like him very much,'' Miller said. ``He was a very
able person who was committed. I asked him to head up the
(fund-raising) roundtable for the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Coles spent $2.3 million of his own money trying to
unseat Gingrich. He finished with 42 percent of the vote, 47
percent in Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Although Coles had been tapped by Miller to chair the state
party in early 1997, he had to wait his turn to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   When polls showed Coverdell's support was soft, Sen. Bob Kerrey
(D-Neb.), head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,
began hunting for challengers. Miller was Kerrey's first choice,
but he declined, despite Clinton's bid to persuade him.
</P>
<P>
   Darden seriously considered running, but pulled back after
sensing only half-hearted party support. Immediately after Darden
declined in September 1997, Coles stepped down as party chairman to
jump in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Using the slogan ``Georgia Deserves Better,'' he's tried to
paint Coverdell as a Republican Party insider in Washington who's
lost touch with Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serving in the Senate is a not a position, it's a job,'' Coles
told a group of insurance agents at the Dunwoody Country Club
recently. ``It's about working for people, not parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Inviting Clinton to the Atlanta fund-raiser in July was a risky
strategy, but one designed to jump-start fund-raising and raise the
Senate race above the media clutter over competitive contests for
governor and lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Coles had never been completely comfortable with Clinton and had
even refused to answer in 1996 when Gingrich demanded to know whom
he planned to vote for.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton gamble turned sour when full exposure of Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky a few weeks later sent Democrats
who'd associated with him running for cover.
</P>
<P>
   The Coles campaign reported raising more than $500,000 at the
July 9 event with Clinton, but roughly half of that went to the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Recent disclosure
statements show the Coles campaign raised only $244,977 from
contributors between July 2 and Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   To that trickle of money, Coles added $1.26 million of his own
in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, his campaign has raised only about $1.2 million from
outside sources _ less than several candidates running for
lieutenant governor and state insurance commissioner. As of Sept.
30, Coles reported lending $2.27 million to his campaign, and he's
likely to crack $3 million as he funds the stretch run of
television advertising before Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   While Coverdell has run a classic low-key incumbent's race
around the slogan ``Coverdell Works,'' the Coles campaign has
neglected to saturate the market with similar positive ads to
introduce himself statewide.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bullock of UGA, the Coles campaign ``spun its
wheels'' by challenging Coverdell to take a drug test and later,
after Coverdell passed, by implying the senator was hiding
something when he didn't screen himself specifically for
prescription anti-depressants.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell simply took and ``passed'' that test, too.
</P>
<P>
   Coles TV ads attacking Coverdell's positions on HMO reform and
health benefits for veterans told moving personal stories but
failed to underscore the importance of voting for Coles, Bullock
added.

 &HT;    Coverdell moves to Senate center of power
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hours after casting his last vote of the 105th
Congress Wednesday, Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) strode through a
crowd of 300 supporters in the Marietta town square and headed
straight for the big stage erected in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   A momentary cheer surged from the crowd as Coverdell, without
pausing to shake any hands, mounted the platform, festooned with
his campaign slogan ``Coverdell Works'' and packed with local
Republican office holders and the day's featured speaker, former
Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   State school board Chairman Johnny Isakson, who served with
Coverdell in the state Senate in the 1970s, introduced his former
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I were Republicans when being Republicans wasn't
cool,'' Isakson told the crowd. ``Paul puts on his resume that he
was minority leader of the Georgia state Senate, but there weren't
but five of us, so it wasn't very hard. In fact, every Republican
had a job because there were more titles than there were jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have certainly changed for Coverdell. After nearly 30
years in politics, the wiry Republican is at the peak of his
political powers. In less than six years, Coverdell has watched his
party become the majority party in the U.S. Senate; he has gone
from Georgia's junior senator to its senior senator; and he has
moved from the relative of obscurity of a first-term senator to the
center of the Southern Republican leadership that controls
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On this cloudy Wednesday in the GOP stronghold of Cobb County,
Coverdell breezed through his stump speech in less than 10 minutes,
hitting his voter-friendly campaign themes of passing education tax
breaks and renewing the war on drugs without once mentioning his
opponent, Michael Coles.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with Coverdell's 1992 campaign was striking. Then,
Coverdell campaigned as the Washington outsider, a ``change agent''
as he called himself, vowing to reform Congress and relentlessly
attacking the voting record of his incumbent opponent, Wyche
Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's pledge of lower taxes and less government was spiced
with a reformist plan to slash contributions from special interest
political action committees, end perks and automatic pay raises in
Congress and put Congress on a six-month work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell forced Fowler, the top vote getter, into a general
election runoff and went on to win by a tiny margin.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as he campaigns for a second six-year term, Coverdell
is every bit the incumbent Washington politician, more firmly
entrenched in the formal party power structure than any Georgia
senator since Richard Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is the fifth-ranking member of the Senate leadership
and a close confidant of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.). He is second in line to succeed Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.) as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And
he has built a presence in the Senate that earns nothing but praise
from his fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen senators come and go and ... he has established
himself as quickly as any senator as I've ever known,'' said
Quayle. ``He just works hard. He doesn't take no for an answer.
He's smart. He's steeped in policy. He knows more than other
senators, and in the Senate knowledge is power.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, of course, always flatter, particularly around
elections. But Coverdell's work ethic is repeatedly cited by
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a person who is very splashy about telling people
about (what he's done),'' said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas). ``One of
the reasons he is in the leadership is that he is so low key when
it comes to claiming credit. As a result, people like to put Paul
in leadership positions because he makes other people look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 59, embodies an odd mixture of political skill. At
just 5-feet-9-inches tall, he hardly fills the room. He is an
uninspiring speaker who frequently steps on his words in such a way
as to make former President Bush, who was notorious for mangled
rhetoric, seem the essence of lucid delivery.
</P>
<P>
   A shrewd tactician, he nonetheless is uncomfortable with much of
the back-slapping and glad-handing that goes with the office.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's appearance in Cobb County was typical. After the
event, Coverdell remained on stage as voters who had come to hear
him _ many for the first time _ strained to shake his hand from
four feet below where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   He exited the stage quickly, pausing just long enough to
exchange hellos and shake hands with a white-haired veteran who
attempted to draw him into conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism that he doesn't linger enough is one that
Coverdell says he has heard repeatedly. He responds with an example
drawn from his nearly three years in the Peace Corps, where he was
director under Bush before joining the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to show the flag in three countries than spend 10
days in one country,'' Coverdell said. ``It's better to be present,
even if you are not present as long.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet his worker bee style may also explain why Coverdell has
struggled to make a lasting impression on Georgia voters since his
election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Several voters at Wednesday's rally said they couldn't name
anything that Coverdell had done in office and would be voting for
him simply because he was a Republican like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to be doing something, so that's why we are here,''
said Denise Bartlett, who brought her young children to the rally.
``I like the fact that he is a conservative. We vote
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Coverdell spoke the Republican core values of lower
taxes and less spending, but also campaigned hard on his record as
a moderate state senator from Fulton County, highlighting his
support for open meetings laws, ethics legislation and
environmental regulation.
</P>
<P>
   He also campaigned as a pro-abortion rights candidate who said
that if the Supreme Court ever overturned Roe v. Wade, the historic
case deciding a woman's constitutional right to have an abortion,
``I would support reconstituting Roe v. Wade by legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Coverdell quickly established a voting record
that was among the most conservative in the Senate. Although he
maintains that he is still pro-abortion rights, the National
Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) scores Coverdell a zero on
abortion issues, while the conservative Christian Coalition gives
him a 100 percent ranking on their pro-family agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell voted against allowing military personnel to use their
own money for abortions in U.S. military hospitals and against
imposing criminal penalties on people who block access to abortion
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just not pro-choice,'' said NARAL political director
Gloria Totten.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell opposed the bi-partisan effort to reform the nation's
campaign finance laws that was championed by his friend, Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.), although he says he still supports a reduction in
the maximum PAC contribution limit from $5,000 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   On environmental issues, Coverdell has a lifetime ranking from
the League of Conservation Voters of 6 percent, although he voted
to strengthen drinking water laws in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an extremist, and his voting record is out of step with
mainstream, working families,'' said David Worley, chairman of the
Georgia Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell rejects the notion that he has become more
conservative in office, but he acknowledges that the political
environments in Washington and Georgia are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The divisions in Georgia in those days were rural-urban,''
Coverdell said. ``I was an urban (state) senator. In Washington,
they are philosophical. They are left of center, right of center,
more conservative or liberal. It's a different call. You are in a
very different setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said that he hasn't lost his reformist zeal. He noted
that since going to Washington, he has returned $1 million to the
government in unused office expenses _ half of it from his refusal
to exploit Congressional franking privileges for mass mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Coverdell voted against a cost-of-living increase for
members. But the measure passed anyway, and Coverdell accepted the
$3,000 raise beginning this year. He now earns $136,673, in
addition to about $135,000 he receives from his family business in
a special arrangement negotiated with the Senate Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to a possible second term, Coverdell said he will
continue to push his proposal for tax-free savings accounts for
education, which President Clinton vetoed this year, and winning
the war on drugs. In general, however, he said he doesn't spend too
much time looking into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to focus on the work of the day, rather than always
having your mind focused somewhere else,'' Coverdell said. ``Just
do the best you can with the day you were given. I do tend to
function that way.''

 &HT;    Millner ad confused, or trying to confuse?
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some Georgia homeowners might consider a higher
exemption from local property taxes to be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Millner, who doesn't claim a homestead exemption on his
Buckhead residence, apparently does not.
</P>
<P>
   In a new campaign ad, the Republican candidate for governor
tells voters that he will ``eliminate the (car) tag tax and cut
property taxes by 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the ad states that Millner's opponent, Democrat Roy Barnes,
``will increase property tax exemptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes does indeed have a plan to increase the current homestead
exemption, which varies from county to county, by $50,000. An
independent study estimates the plan would save homeowners as much
as $630 million a year in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Millner want to tout Barnes' plan?
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the ad aims to confuse voters by using the word
``increase'' in describing his plan after calling Millner's plan a
``cut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Either they don't know what a property tax exemption is, or
they're just trying to deceive folks,'' said Barnes. ``I think the
people of Georgia will see through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner was not available Friday to comment on the ad, but his
campaign spokesman, Gregg Kenyon, said it was not intended to
mislead voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the truth, isn't it?'' said Kenyon. ``He's going to raise
the homestead exemption.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes compared the ad to the time that a Florida politician
described his opponent's sister, who was an actress, as ``a
well-known thespian.''

   &UR; The Farewell Symphony &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Edmund White. Vintage International, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The final installment of the author's autobiographical trilogy,
which began in 1982 with ``A Boy's Own Story,'' chronicles gay life
in New York in the post-Stonewall years, when the city's cultural
world was ravaged by the AIDS virus. Last year in the Book Review,
Christopher Benfey called this an ``engagingly bittersweet novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where She Came From: A Daughter's Search for Her Mother's
History &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Helen Epstein. Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This memoir, which focuses on the author's great-grandmother,
grandmother and mother, is also a detailed history of Jewish life
in the small towns of western Czechoslovakia in the years leading
up to World War II. ``This book is more than a family portrait,''
Ruth Gay wrote in the Book Review last year. ``It is a moving
evocation of an old world and its destruction.''  &UR; Shtetl: The Life
and Death of a Small Town and the World of Polish Jews &LR; , by Eva
Hoffman (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14), examines the little
village, or shtetl, of Bransk, and its Orthodox Jewish community,
which once formed more than half the population but is nonexistent
today. In the process, the author re-examines the general
condemnation of ordinary Poles for their part in the Holocaust. In
1997 our reviewer, Susan Zuccotti, found the author ``supremely
qualified for her task.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Death of Innocents &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Firstman and Jamie Talan. Bantam, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   This harrowing true account tells of how a mother killed her
five children and got away with it for more than 20 years, thanks
to the unwitting help of misguided scientists who attributed the
deaths to sudden infant death syndrome. ``The book is paced like a
thriller'' and is ''a showcase for superb research and
organization,'' Frederick Busch wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Lover &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Marguerite Duras. Translated by Barbara Bray. Pantheon, $10.
</P>
<P>
   In this compact French novel, an aging woman looks back on her
adolescence in Vietnam and her passionate affair with a wealthy
young Chinese man when she was 15. In 1985 in the Book Review,
Diane Johnson called this an ``authentic and completely successful
work'' that achieves ``a felicitous and masterly balance between
formalism and powerful emotional effect.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Love and Longing in Bombay: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Vikram Chandra. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In a Bombay bar, a callow narrator spins five tales of
glitterati and gritty policemen, high finance and low crime. ``The
author marries his storytelling prowess to a profound understanding
of India's ageless and ever-changing society,'' Shashi Tharoor
wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alonzo L. Hamby. Oxford University, $21.50.
</P>
<P>
   A historian maintains that a thirst for recognition and respect
dominated Truman's life, and the man that emerges here is more
troubled and complicated than the one portrayed in other
biographies. ``'What Mr. Hamby has done, with great skill, is to
remind us of the real Harry Truman, to demythologize him without
slighting his accomplishments or his rough road to success,'' David
Oshinsky said here in 1995. He didn't walk that road alone.  &UR; Dear
Bess: The Letters From Harry to Bess Truman, 1910-1959 &LR; , edited by
Robert H. Ferrell (University of Missouri, $24.95), pulls together
nearly 600 letters to Elizabeth Virginia Wallace Truman, among the
least known of modern First Ladies but the center of her husband's
universe: without her he might have stayed a Missouri dirt farmer
all his life. This large volume provides ``an intimate look into
the heart and mind of the 33rd president,'' Geoffrey C. Ward wrote
here in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Election &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Tom Perrotta. Berkley, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A three-way race for student body president at a New Jersey high
school mutates from the routine into the disastrous, giving the
author an opportunity for lively riffing on teen-age angst and
intrigue. Earlier this year our reviewer, Peter LaSalle, praised
the ``gratifyingly exact and telling portraits'' of the young
characters. A far grimmer portrait of teen-age life is found in
 &UR; The Mao Game &LR; , by Joshua Miller (Bard/Avon, $12), in which a
morbidly witty child actor grapples with heroin addiction, the
aftershock of sexual molestation, psycho parents and Hollywood
vapidity. In 1997 in these pages, J. D. Biersdorfer found this to
be ``a vivid and affecting first novel about a young man's
emotional deprivation -- and his ultimate salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Warrior's Honor: Ethnic War and the Modern Conscience &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Ignatieff. Owl/Holt, $13.
</P>
<P>
   These essays combine reportage and moral and political
speculation to try to make sense of Rwanda, Bosnia and other hot
zones of the new world order, and of the feeling of impotence that
has hamstrung the West. ``The structure of Ignatieff's argument is
simple, and to my mind irresistible,'' Alan Ryan wrote here earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comeback &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Stark. Mysterious Press/Warner, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Donald E. Westlake, writing under his old nom de plume,
resuscitates the master thief Parker in this crime caper about the
rip-off of a television evangelist's haul from a revival meeting.
``In a world of warped values, an honest crook like Parker is a
true treasure,'' Marilyn Stasio said here last year.

receded as voters raised concerns about the Republican nominee, Bob
Dole, and said his party was too extreme. Now, in dozens of random

 &HT;    R.E.M. stages blitz to publicize new CD
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLATNA _ It may not be touring, but Athens-based supergroup
R.E.M. is giving fans a few sneak peeks this fall of its new
trio-based look and sound.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the release of the band's new album, ``Up,'' which
arrives in stores Tuesday, the group has kicked off a media blitz
to promote the project, including a special concert taped for MTV,
a performance on VH1's ``Storytellers'' and even a guest spot on
``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``R.E.M. Uplink,'' which airs at 9 p.m. Wednesday on MTV, is a
60-minute version of a two-hour show the band performed Thursday at
New York's Bowery Ballroom for invited guests, fan club members and
media. It includes several tracks from the new CD, including
``Lotus,'' ``Walk Unafraid'' and the single ``Daysleeper,'' as well
as classic hits such as ``Man in the Moon.'' Legendary punk rocker
Patti Smith drops by for a duet with Michael Stipe on ``E- Bow the
Letter,'' and Joey Waronaker (Beck) sits in on drums. The concert
will also be simulcast on the two Atlanta rock stations that are
playing R.E.M.'s new single, 99X and 96rock.
</P>
<P>
   VH-1 ``Storytellers'' airs at 10 p.m. Dec. 6. Stipe, Peter Buck
and Mike Mills recorded the episode Friday. In the audience: the
entire staff of the band's Athens office, which flew in for the
show. Before leaving New York for London, R.E.M. also dropped by
the set of ``Sesame Street'' to tape a greeting commemorating the
show's 30th anniversary, which will air sometime in January.
</P>
<P>
   Calling on a cell phone Friday during a stroll with his family
in Central Park, R.E.M. manager Bertis Downs said the entourage is
``having a great time. This hasn't been the easiest few months in
our lives, but the guys are starting to have fun. We feel like
we're in the first innings of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   These television appearances are significant to R.E.M. fans
because the band won't be touring to promote the new album. Still,
Downs said, ``It kind of feels like we're touring. But we're
enjoying these shows because they are so intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M. will spend much of November in Europe doing small,
by-invitation-only shows for radio broadcast.

 &HT;    Never too old: Seniors enjoy better, longer lives by keeping
active
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sneakers squeak as guys in their 20s and 30s sprint up
and down the basketball court, passing, shooting, high-fiving _ and
in a few cases _ huffing and puffing. But Richard Miller's hardly
breaking a sweat. Which is noteworthy because, at age 75, he's been
running longer that most of his pals have been breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Ivano Newbill, a former Georgia Tech star who played last year
with the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies and often is one of Miller's
teammates, is in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rebounds. He hits jump shots. If there was a league for
people 70 and older like the NBA, he would be the Michael Jordan,''
Newbill says.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's not alone. As the United States prepares to send a
77-year-old astronaut, Sen. John Glenn, into orbit, millions of
ordinary older Americans are likewise attending to physical
pursuits once thought for youngsters only.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who's 6-foot-2, weighs a trim 183, and he plays despite
health problems. ``I'm recovering from two cancers, but nobody
knows it,'' he says. ``Out here I'm a player, not a patient.''
</P>
<P>
   He shows up three times a week at the YMCA in east Cobb County,
Ga., for pickup games with guys of all ages, sometimes even
teen-age stars of area high school teams.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago he broke his right wrist ``after a guy charged
me.'' But Miller, like Glenn, is more than willing to take chances.
Maybe eager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with older people is, they give up,'' says Miller,
a divorce with four children and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can outrun most of them. I'm not going down without a
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   This Y and many other health clubs are packed daily with men and
women who qualify for senior-citizens discount, but don't act the
part. Here, Fred Poore, 62, is on staff, a stocky, muscular man who
specializes in weight training for older folks. He assists people
such as Les Petherick, (cq) 68, a retired Navy pilot whose biceps
bulge as much as those young jocks' on TV health shows.
</P>
<P>
   Though some have been inspired by Glenn's upcoming spaceflight,
it's been television and heavily promoted health campaigns pushed
by agencies such as the National Institute on Aging that have made
older people more aware of the benefits of exercise, says Elaine
Cress of the Exercise Sciences &AMP; Gerontology Center at the
University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has been a major player in the NIA's push, supporting its
agenda in Congress for more than a decade and demanding increased
funding. By maintaining the hard body he had as America's first man
in orbit 36 years ago, as well as a high public profile, he's also
become a role model for the geriatric set, a very visible example
that it is possible to stay ahead of the Grim Reaper on life's
ever-accelerating treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   Increased physical activity, not just scientific breakthroughs,
is a major reason Americans are living longer, with the average
lifespan rocketing from 69 in 1960 to 76 today. In the last
Peachtree Road Race, which attracted 55,000 runners, 1,061 were 60
or older, and 138 over 70, says Julia Emmons of the Atlanta Track
Club, which puts on the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are increasing annually.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Pilgrim, a 47-year-old executive with the state Department
of Human Resources who's coordinated the Georgia Golden Olympics
for years, says more and more people are competing each year.
Contestants range from 55 to their 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown that aging doesn't mean you're over the hill,''
Pilgrim says. ``Fifty-five or 60 is no longer the end of the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, at the Golden Games in Warner Robins, 560
people participated, and some qualified to attend the national
Golden Olympics next year in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 85 and old enough to be over the hill,'' says Marvin Loyd
of Brookhaven, one of the participants. ``But I qualified to run in
the 5- and 10k (kilometer) races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to doctors, and they say I'm in great shape. I ran the 5k
in 30 minutes flat, just slightly under 10-minute miles. I make it
to nationals just about every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyd hasn't stopped running since he was a track star in high
school. He says he's almost as fast as he was in 1944, when he
sprinted over the beaches and hedgerows of Normandy after D-Day. He
also claims he can outrun two of his three children _ and both of
his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when you get old _ and I don't feel old _ it's clear that
physical fitness is good for the mind, body, soul and spirit,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy L. White, a relative youngster at 61, has been competing
in athletic events since high school. He now teaches phys ed at
Palmetto Elementary School in south Fulton County and runs at a
track daily. He's been competing for years in the Golden Olympics
and any other age-group events he hears about. His specialty: the
pentathlon, a combination of long jump, discus, javelin, triple
jump and a metric-mile run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get old,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude toward staying physically active is no anomaly,
says Douglas Kleiber, head of recreation and leisure studies at
UGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are still playing golf and tennis at 80,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many elders do fall by the wayside physically.
</P>
<P>
   Many, Kleiber maintains, have been indoctrinated by a culture of
``ageism'' that stresses youth and devalues the elderly. ``Not as
many older people do physical activity as they could,'' Kleiber
says.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, chronic health problems move people from
treadmills to recliners.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 percent of adults older than 65 report no physical
activity at all, according to the American Medical Association, and
38 percent suffer chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend is toward more activity, and it's showing up in
various ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disability rate as we increase in our numbers of older
people being active is actually declining,'' UGA's Cress says. ``We
are seeing a decline in heart disease. Hypertension is getting
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn is a motivator,'' she adds, ``but the real motivator is
that people don't want to go live in some nursing home.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that workouts benefit older folks abounds:
</P>
<P>
   _ The average lifespan for Americans has soared from 66 for
males and 73 females in 1960 to 73 for men and 79 for females.
</P>
<P>
   _ A study of 101 men and women ages 60 to 83 found that regular
aerobic exercise for four months increased heart and lung function
up to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A study of 8,000 Japanese-American men ages 45 to 68, begun in
the mid 1960s, found recently that five hours a day of moderate to
heavy activity reduced the incidence of heart disease by 17 percent
and the death rate from heart disease by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Tufts University study of people 60 to 72 who trained with
weights found that most were able to boost the strength of their
hamstring muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiber hopes Glenn's mission will help scientists gain more
control over aging.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he says, after only a few days of weightlessness,
astronauts lose up to 10 percent of their muscle tissue. But will
Glenn lose bone and muscle mass more rapidly, because he is older,
or more slowly, since he already has lost some mass with aging? The
answer could provide clues about how to treat bone loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, people such as Helen Moore will continue to
fight aging on their own. The 90-year-old Atlantan goes to tai chi
classes twice a week and practices daily in her home, flailing her
arms and legs like a karate expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clears your mind. Your body feels better. It can make you
feel positive,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Or Iris Sandham, 72, of Snellville, Ga., the state's champion
horseshoe tosser for several years running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk. I run. I bowl two, three times a week,'' she says. ``I
have a room full of trophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a horseshoe court in my basement and throw the heaviest
you can have, 2 pounds and 10 ounces. I play against men in the top
class and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Harrell, 76, of Eastman has always been active, but Glenn's
trip has inspired her to new heights. In a couple of weeks, she
plans a trip to Kitty Hawk, N.C., where the Wright Brothers first
flew, for a flight of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of John Glenn,'' she says. ``Least I can do is a
little hang-gliding.''

 &HT;    Only PBS delivering `right stuff' on Glenn
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the nation counts down to John Glenn's launch on
the space shuttle Discovery on Thursday, television gears up with a
payload of specials _ four in three nights.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Discovery airs ``Godspeed, John Glenn'' (8 o'clock
(687997)). On Tuesday, CNN has ``The John Glenn Story: Return to
Space'' (10 p.m. (741466)) and there's a ``Biography'' on A&AMP;E (8
p.m. (108737)). GPTV has PBS' ``John Glenn, American Hero'' (8 p.m.
Wednesday on WGTV (27428)).
</P>
<P>
   At 77, Glenn will become the oldest person ever sent into space,
and coupled with his iconic presence from 36 years ago as the first
American(CQ) to orbit the earth, he's a natural for such treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But there's only so much footage to go around, so these specials
become rather repetitive.

   Both PBS and Discovery, for example, dig out Glenn's appearance
in 1957 on the game show ``Name That Tune.'' And Walter Cronkite is
in ample supply, narrating the Discovery special and being
interviewed for CNN's hour. (Cronkite will co-anchor CNN's coverage
of Glenn's flight with Miles O'Brien, who hosts the CNN special.)
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, PBS is the most complete. Despite the rah-rah
title, ``John Glenn, American Hero'' is the only one to talk to
scientists outside NASA who doubt the validity of Glenn's
experiments on how space affects the aging process (as opposed to
the p.r. value, which is beyond doubt). It's also the only one to
mention the sole blot on Glenn's public career, when he was accused
in 1990 of using his influence as a senator to help savings and
loan villian Charles Keating.
</P>
<P>
   CNN was given the most access to Glenn's training for thisflight
(though the others have some). Like the others, it emphasizes the
importance of his wife and life-partner, Annie. (Movie buffs will
remember the tender scenes between Ed Harris and Mary Jo
Deschanel(CQ) as Glenn and Annie in 1983's ``The Right Stuff.'')
</P>
<P>
   Discovery is the weakest of the three, concentrating almost
entirely on the flight of Friendship 7 in 1962. While all the
specials emphasize how risky those early Mercury flights were (two
of the three tests of Glenn's Atlas rocket had exploded), Discovery
goes overboard with a false alarm, during which NASA thought
Friendship 7's heat shield was loose. It was a dicey moment for
ground control, but Discovery gets pretty hot and bothered
considering nothing was ever really wrong.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are just setting the table for the main course,
which starts Thursday and will be the most heavily covered space
launch in years. It will be up to one or more anchors to echo the
words with which Scott Carpenter sent his fellow Mercury astronaut
on his way 36 years ago: ``Godspeed, John Glenn.''

<P>
   The hourlong special is a cheesy rehash of old Hollywood

`GETTING AND SPENDING': COMPLICATIONS ARISE WHEN GREED IS GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are, from time to time, warnings posted in
theater lobbies, advising that strobe lights will be used or that
gunshots will be heard. But shouldn't this trend be expanded?
Shouldn't there, for instance, be a sign in the Helen Hayes Theater
that announces, ``Warning: Cute monks will be featured in this
production''?
</P>
<P>
   The Helen Hayes is where Michael Chepiga's ``Getting and
Spending,'' a play about moral redemption in the age of corporate
greed, opened Sunday night. Its cast of characters does indeed
feature two monks, whose vows of poverty and celibacy make them all
the more adorable and chuckle-worthy when they speak in worldly
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Brother Alfred, who, upon making the sign of the cross
after his first entrance, announces anxiously, ``The market closed
down 47.'' Then there's Brother Thaddeus, who, though old and
easily shocked, can't help observing, when a shapely woman starts
to undress in the sacred halls of his monastery, ``What a babe.''
Thaddeus, by the way, is also partly deaf, which allows for
topically pointed jokes inspired by his mishearing: ``law degree''
becomes, in his rendering, ``lot of greed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Chepiga, a corporate lawyer making his Broadway
debut as a playwright, ``Getting and Spending'' is not trying to be
the male equivalent of ``Nunsense.'' (What would such a work be
called? ``Monk Shines''?) Alfred and Thaddeus are only a sideshow
in this story of a high-powered, manly lawyer who retreats into
their monastery and the high-powered, womanly investment broker who
lures him out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the good brothers, however, provides an accurate
barometer for the overall tone of this play, which has been
directed by John Tillinger and stars Linda Purl and David Rasche.
``Getting and Spending'' considers subjects to which philosophers
have devoted whole lifetimes: the elusive nature of faith, the life
of contemplation versus that of action, the difficulties of being
good in a corrupt universe. But it does so with the by-the-book
facility of a grade-B sitcom. The show aims high thematically, but
every joke and sentiment seems to have come from a can.
</P>
<P>
   You can see why producers might have been intrigued by the idea
of ``Getting and Spending.'' Since the announcement of the death of
the selfish consumerism of the 1980s has turned out to be
premature, why not another play on the ethical toll of raiding and
trading? The intention seems to have been to create a contemporary
variation on ``Other People's Money,'' Jerry Sterner's 1989 hit
about a wicked Wall Street liquidator, but with a spiritual spin
more appropriate to a time in which even Madonna has found
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The production signals its ambitions in its opening seconds,
when the grid of LCDs that transects James Noone's set stops
projecting stock market figures to spell out the lines of the
Wordsworth poem that give the play its name (``The world is too
much with us, late and soon, getting and spending . . .''). We soon
learn that at least one man, Richard O'Neill ( Rasche), has taken
Wordsworth's admonition to heart.
</P>
<P>
   Once called ``the rightful heir to Clarence Darrow,'' this
celebrated defense lawyer has found only emptiness in success and
is now on the verge of taking his monastic vows. The strong-willed
Victoria Phillips (Ms. Purl), who might be called the rightful heir
to Michael Milken but isn't, is determined to bring Richard back to
New York long enough to defend her against charges of insider
trading, something of which she is indeed guilty, though not for
the usual reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the first act is devoted to whether Victoria will
persuade Richard to represent her; and since it's a foregone
conclusion that she will, there's not much for the play to do
except let them trade insults while they fall in love. (Her to him:
``Let me tell you something, you macho monk.'' Him to her: ``Please
spare me your finishing-school sociology.'')
</P>
<P>
   The second act is centered on the trial, which is replete with a
curmudgeonly judge with twinkling eyes (MacIntyre Dixon) and a
ruthless young prosecutor (Deirdre Lovejoy), whose prototypes can
be found at any hour in the ether of reruns on cable television.
Also on hand are Victoria's frustrated suitor (Jack Gilpin) and her
mother (Debra Mooney), a reluctant witness for the prosecution.
Tagging along as Richard's assistant is the ever-lovable Brother
Alfred (Derek Smith), who confides to Victoria: ``Can you keep a
secret? I'm having the time of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   This scenario isn't unlike plots that fueled a host of vintage
screwball film comedies, with stars like James Stewart, Jean
Arthur, Cary Grant and Claudette Colbert. But in ``Getting and
Spending,'' the formula seems to be the end product of years of
recycling through other, lesser movies and television shows. There
ain't nothing left but the bones.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Chepiga's evident success in his day job, he is unable
to generate any suspense out of Richard's unorthodox legal
stratagems. Under Tillinger's direction, the actors seem to have
set their performances on that perky automatic pilot common to
stars of long-running comedy series. Within these limitations, Ms.
Purl comes off best, especially in the first act, where she
carefully limns the contradictions of a corporate go-getter with a
social conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's any consolation, but these actors aren't the first
casualties of a dispiriting month on Broadway that has already
given us Rob Bartlett's ``More to Love,'' which turned out to have
the life span of a mayfly, and the limp, rudderless musical
``Footloose.'' The new season's hipness quotient, at the moment, is
somewhere below that of Kenneth W. Starr.

 &HT;    Latest King adaptation for ``Apt Pupil'' works well
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King's books often make for lousy movies. ``Different
Seasons'' stands among the notable exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The 1982 collection, King's first outside the horror genre, has
produced ``Stand By Me,'' an acclaimed coming-of-age drama based on
``The Body,'' as well as ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' based on
``Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,'' which earned seven
Academy Award nominations, including best picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil'' is the third film derived from ``Different
Seasons''' four novellas. Like its predecessors, the spine-chilling
thriller involves a journey _ in this case, the abandonment of
innocence by a boy who reawakens long-dormant evil. And like the
other films, ``Apt Pupil'' is that rarest of accomplishments, a
superb King adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   Director Bryan Singer, who made an auspicious debut with 1995's
``The Usual Suspects,'' tones down the novella's violence and gore
in favor of an oppressive mood and plausible sense of evil, making
for more of a psychological horror story. The result, though
sometimes slow, is riveting.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a straight-A California high school
student who develops a morbid fascination with the Holocaust. One
evening on the bus, he recognizes an elderly passenger as a Nazi
war criminal. Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), a former concentration
camp commandant, has been quietly living in Todd's hometown under
the assumed identity of Arthur Denker.
</P>
<P>
   Todd confronts Dussander with the truth, blackmailing in the old
man into recounting the atrocities of his past , in exchange for
his silence. As the two develop a bizarre friendship, both travel
to the dark recesses of the soul.
</P>
<P>
   The boy rekindles Dussander's killer instincts, while himself
falling under evil's sway. Implicating himself by not turning the
former SS officer over to authorities, Todd winds up inextricably
bound to the old man, becoming his ``apt pupil.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer crafts a creepy and stylish thriller from the ensuing
psychological warfare, making pointed use of cat-and-mouse imagery.
While less gruesome than King's original, the film delivers its
share of brutal shocks and ironic twists.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers may be put off by the character drama's leisurely
pacing. Others might be unnerved by its horrific descent into the
depths of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil'' earns its greatest marks for the gripping
performances by McKellen (``Richard III'') and Renfro
(``Sleepers''). The latter portrays Todd as sullen and reserved,
hinting at a malevolence that waits to be unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen, a British stage veteran who was knighted in 1991,
gives a wicked performance, showing at once Dussander's anguish at
reliving the horrors of his youth, as well as the exuberance of
emotions that would have been better left undisturbed. Like ``The
Shawshank Redemption's'' Morgan Freeman, McKellen could find
himself nominated for Best Actor for his fascinating depiction of
pure, unbridled evil.

MCI WORLDCOM TALKS TOUGH ON WIRING HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Anxiety has been running high in this former British
colony, which has seen its economy buckle, tourism dry up and
free-market reputation tatter in the 15 months since it reverted to
Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a U.S. telephone company is warning Hong Kong that it could
miss out on the information age if it does not quickly open its
telecommunications market. ``Hong Kong's Back Is Against the
Wall,'' said a Cassandra-like newspaper advertisement recently
taken out here by the company, MCI Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is teetering on the edge,'' asserted Steve Liddell,
president of the MCI Worldcom Asia Pacific unit. ``It will either
embrace the brave new age of telecommunications or return to an age
of protectionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong officials, perhaps not surprisingly, do not share the
American company's alarm. ``It is not our policy goal to be the
most liberal telecommunications hub in Asia; that's a rather empty
thing,'' said Geoffrey Woodhead, a senior adviser to K.C. Kwong,
the secretary for information technology and broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the Hong Kong government will allow new
competitors to offer local telephone service in this territory of
6.8 million people. For the last three years, Hong Kong has
licensed three local companies to provide service, in addition to
the incumbent monopoly, Hong Kong Telecom. A decision on whether to
license further competitors is expected in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, formed in the recent merger of the United States'
second- and fourth-largest long-distance companies, is eager to
wire Hong Kong's teeming business district, so it can offer a
package of voice and data services to the many multinational
corporations here. The company already offers international service
to about 100 customers on lines leased from Hong Kong Telecom. But
it wants to offer corporate customers a complete menu of local and
long-distance offerings. And it is dangling a bushel of carrots
before the government here.
</P>
<P>
   Among other blandishments, MCI Worldcom has promised to make
Hong Kong the hub for an Asian fiber optic network that would
stretch in a vast crescent from Tokyo to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Thursday, the government announced plans to open its
international long-distance market to free-wheeling competition.
But several analysts said they expected Hong Kong not to issue any
more local phone licenses.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom contends that by refusing to let more competitors
provide the actual direct network connections to local customers,
the territory would cut off its nose to spite its face. Without
sophisticated global players, Liddell said, Hong Kong risks losing
its status as a global financial center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the competitors are limited to three local firms,'' he
said, ``it's our view that these services simply won't be
available.''
</P>
<P>
   With its lofty talk and populist appeals to economic growth, MCI
Worldcom's lobbying campaign is no different from campaigns waged
by long-distance and local phone companies in the United States.
But in recession-ravaged Asia, the company's message carries an
edge: For those countries that pursue it, a competitive
telecommunications market can be the road to recovery; for those
that do not, protectionism can lead to economic obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom notes pointedly that Japan and Australia both have
fully liberalized local phone markets. The company is investing
$350 million over 10 years to build a fiber optic network in Tokyo
and $200 million to build one in Sydney. Though Liddell refused to
discuss MCI Worldcom's potential investment in Hong Kong, it could
easily run into hundred of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Liddell makes a good case. ``Hong Kong needs
to jump on opportunities when they present themselves,'' said Lloyd
Fischer, a telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
Hong Kong. ``They've got a good location geographically, but that's
only worth so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these days, analysts noted, Asia can look more
terrifying than tempting to potential investors. Bell Atlantic
Corp. recently took charges of $545 million to write down the value
of its investments in Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, though Hong Kong has suffered along with its neighbors, it
is not about to play the needy supplicant. Regulators here, who
contend that Hong Kong already has one of the more open markets in
Asia, say they can preserve the territory's status as a financial
center without handing out local phone licenses to any and all
comers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see liberalization of telecommunications as a means to an
end, rather than an end in itself,'' Woodhead said. ``We hope our
telecoms policy will attract people to set up their regional
headquarters in Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Hong Kong has taken some steps to open its markets
that go further than other Asian countries. It has four local phone
providers, compared with Singapore's two. And unlike Japan, Hong
Kong has no restrictions on the foreign ownership of local
telephone companies _ a much-contested provision in last year's
landmark World Trade Organization agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the accord, most countries agreed to let foreign companies
acquire major stakes in domestic phone companies. Only Japan
insisted on limiting foreigners to no more than 20 percent
ownership of NTT and KDD, its main local and long-distance
providers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement on Thursday, Hong Kong said it would grant
licenses to all companies that want to provide international
direct-dial service in the territory. After Jan. 1, 2000, the
licensees can build their own international networks here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a free-for-all, but there is no question that Hong
Kong's market is liberalizing,'' said Victor Shvets, head of
telecommunications research at Deutsche Securities in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Having opened its local telephone market ahead of its
long-distance market, Hong Kong presents something of an anomaly in
regulatory circles _ a quirk that is a result of the government's
having granted Hong Kong Telecom a long-term monopoly on
international service. Last February, it paid the company $864
million to terminate that franchise this year rather than letting
the monopoly extend through the original date of 2006.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Hong Kong broke open the local telephone monopoly
in 1995, when it granted licenses to three start-up companies: New
T&AMP;T, New World Telephone and Hutchison Telecom. All three companies
are owned by powerful property developers, a circumstance that has
been no small help in stringing wires into buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But though the gaggle of local providers has made for a
clamorous market, it has barely dented Hong Kong Telecom's
monopoly. Collectively, the three rivals have less than 2 percent
of the market. That is largely because they have been slow to build
networks in Hong Kong's densely populated neighborhoods and hilly
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the upstarts are lobbying Hong Kong not to add to
their struggles by granting additional local licenses. Given that
these companies are owned by some of Hong Kong's most politically
connected tycoons, their arguments carry plenty of influence.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's government has not hesitated to make decisions that
benefited the developers, even when those moves seemed at odds with
the territory's free-market credentials. In June, it suspended
sales of public land; in August, it intervened heavily to prop up
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said the developers might have an ulterior
motive in opposing additional local licenses. If Worldcom cannot
build its own network, it might feel pressed to buy out one of the
tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   But Liddell, who said Worldcom was not interested in such an
acquisition, took an unsubtle swipe at the tycoons by suggesting
that companies that put up apartment towers and ran supermarkets
were not as able to offer up-to-date communications services as a
company that focuses on building networks.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong Telecom has taken a generally low profile in this
debate, perhaps because it has its own economic and political
problems. To ready itself for the deregulation of the market, the
company recently announced plans to slash the wages of its 13,800
workers by 10 percent. But it was forced to back down after Hong
Kong's chief executive, Tung Cheehwa, excoriated the move.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong Telecom is controlled by Cable and Wireless PLC of
Britain; the Chinese government-controlled China Telecom bought 5.5
percent of the company last year.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom is not the only foreign carrier active in Hong Kong.
British Telecommunications has an alliance with Hutchison. And
Global One, the joint venture owned by Sprint, France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom, offers international service on leased lines.
</P>
<P>
   But only MCI Worldcom has ambitions to build a soup-to-nuts
local network. Perhaps that is why the company has chosen to make
its case so fervently and publicly. Besides, Hong Kong may
represent the company's best remaining chance to make its
local-telecommunications mark in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, MCI Worldcom has hit its share of snags breaking into
the local phone business elsewhere in the region. Last year, before
teaming up with MCI, the company bid aggressively for a license to
offer local phone service in Singapore. But it lost out to a
consortium that includes BT and NTT. Before that setback, Woodhead
said Worldcom had suggested that it might move its Asian
headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, there is no talk of moving. It may be that MCI
Worldcom needs Hong Kong as much as Hong Kong needs MCI Worldcom.

   He preached to trees and barn owls _ practicing body language
and learning to modulate his voice.
</P>
<P>
   The serious young man moved on to preaching on street corners in
front of saloons in Tampa and then in little Baptist churches in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he would speak of Christ to presidents and popes, royal
families and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people throughout
the world each year.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the Rev. Billy Graham returns to his roots. A
four-day crusade began Thursday night in the spanking new home of
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the 66,000-seat Raymond James Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Graham will preach every night as his extraordinary ministry
winds down in the place where it began.
</P>
<P>
   The farm boy from North Carolina will be 80 in November. Growing
frail, he has given in to a walking cane. Parkinson's disease is
beginning to takes its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his voice remains remarkably powerful. And,
unsurprisingly, there has been no change in his faith _ or his
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message I preach is one of hope, that Christ offers all of
us a way, and through that way we can find our future in heaven,''
Graham said at a new conference Tuesday at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say with the right diet and plenty of rest, I could
preach well past my 80th birthday and into the 21st century. But I
know my time on Earth may be limited. This may be one of my last
crusades.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter when he steps down from the pulpit, Graham will be
widely remembered as the most powerful evangelical preacher and one
of the most influential men of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   For years, he served as unofficial chaplain to presidents and a
kind of national pastor to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   He preached the Gospel to more than 200 million people but
remained a humble minister in awe of his own success.
</P>
<P>
   His character is unquestioned, his honesty and integrity
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Graham single-handedly made conservative evangelical
Christianity respectable, moving crusades from tents to palaces.
His message resonated with Protestants of all stripes and,
remarkably, with countless Roman Catholics. He impressed untold
numbers of non-Christians around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, started in 1950, is a
$100 million-a-year empire that will continue his work long after
he has gone to his reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Graham has had the greatest influence and the most
positive influence of any individual in Christendom in this
generation,'' said the Rev. Horace Ward, of the Church of God in
Palm Beach Gardens. ``He has had an enormous ministry to oversee,
and he has done it without any attack on his credibility or his
character. He is really a godly man.''
</P>
<P>
   The trappings familiar to most Billy Graham crusades: strong
local church cooperation, meticulous planning, plus entertainers
and political figures who serve to endorse the religious message.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 churches from 70 denominations have worked for
more than a year to attract crowds. The crusade budget is more than
$2.4 million. Not a cent goes to Graham, said Larry Ross from the
Graham organization.
</P>
<P>
   A rally for young people Saturday night will feature Grammy
Award-winning Christian musicians, dc Talk and Jars of Clay. The
event will be broadcast on the internet, an evangelical first.
Graham's use of the latest technology has long marked his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles came Thursday to welcome him.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, an old friend, is scheduled to
join him at the pulpit Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   At a crusade in 1986, then Vice President Bush introduced Graham
to a full house at the convention center in Washington: ``We
welcome to America's city America's pastor, Dr. Billy Graham,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   By nearly any measurement, that bordered on understatement.
</P>
<P>
   It was Billy Graham's words at the memorial service for victims
of the Oklahoma City bombing that most moved Americans in 1995:
</P>
<P>
   ``The wounds of this tragedy are deep, but the courage and the
faith and determination of the people of Oklahoma City are even
deeper. Let the healing begin.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Billy Graham who led a prayer service at the White House
as the first squadron of planes left Saudi Arabia to attack Iraq in
the Gulf War of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It was Billy Graham who conducted nationally televised funeral
services for Richard Nixon in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Graham footnotes to history seem endless. He has known every
president since Truman and was counselor and confidant to most of
them. Forty times, he has been named one of the 10 most admired men
in the world by the Gallup Poll _ more than any other person in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's accomplishments as a Bible-based preacher shatter those
of any evangelist in history. The statistics are staggering:
</P>
<P>
   _ He has preached to more than 210 million people in 185
countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ A London crusade in 1954 drew more people _ 185,000 _ than had
ever gathered for a religious event in England, according to
William Martin, who is a professor of religion and public policy at
Rice University in Houston and the author of A Prophet with Honor,
a 1991 biography of Graham.
</P>
<P>
   _ Graham was well known in South Florida. He preached in Miami
in 1949, 1953 and 1961. He spoke to 12,000 people one day in West
Palm Beach in 1961 and to 11,000 in Boca Raton another day during a
four-month tour of Florida that drew more than 450,000 people. He
returned to Boca Raton in 1981 for a day and drew 8,500 people. An
eight-day crusade in Fort Lauderdale gleaned 166,500 people in
1985. He last was in Tampa in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's first took his crusade behind the Iron Curtain to
Hungary in 1977. That was followed by revivals in Poland, Russia
and China.
</P>
<P>
   His appeal has become nearly universal. The Roman Catholic
Church boycotted his 1957 crusade in Madison Square Garden that
drew more than 2 million people. Priests were instructed to preach
against Graham, Martin said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 100 Roman Catholic churches participated fully in
a 1991 crusade at the Meadowlands in New York, Martin said. Roman
Catholic churches were the largest group to participate in a June
crusade in Ottawa, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Graham and Pope John Paul II are friends who share both a
conviction for Christ and the curse of Parkinson's disease, Graham
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Graham began preaching the evangelical message embracing
liberal denominations and Roman Catholics,'' Ward said. ``He
demonstrated that more binds Christianity together than divides us.
I think that helped us all understand the scope of our faith and
our relationship to Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   William Franklin Graham Jr. was raised on a farm on the
outskirts of Charlotte in the hills of western North Carolina. The
household prayed daily, read scripture and lived in fear of a
Calvinist God, Martin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The young man went to a tent meeting when he was 16. Mordecai
Ham was the preacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened,'' Graham said Tuesday from the perspective of more
than 60 years. ``I saw a man open the Bible and teach from that
book. He made sense of it. That changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent three years at the Florida Bible Institute in Temple
Terrace in what is part of Tampa today. He became a Southern
Baptist and was ordained by the St. John's Baptist Association in
Northern Florida in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He moved on to Wheaton College in Illinois, where he graduated
in 1943 and married a classmate, Ruth Morrow Bell.
</P>
<P>
   They have been married for 55 years, ha . five children, 19
grandchildren and Graham can't remember how many
great-grandchildren, he said.
</P>
<P>
   National attention came to the young preacher in 1949 at a Los
Angeles tent meeting. The three week schedule grew to eight weeks
and drew 350,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper magnate Randolph Hearst took note, giving Graham
front-page mention. Soon Adthe Associated Press, Time, Newseeek and
Life followed. The Billy Graham phenomenon was launched.
</P>
<P>
   He began the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association in 1950 to
support his work. Today, the Minneapolis organization has a staff
of 563 and a budget of $109.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That pays to organize crusades and run a multimedia cornucopia
of Christian books, movies, radio, newspaper, magazine ministries
and training facilities. Graham, who is an employee of the
association, is paid less than $160,000 a year, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of his work, Graham recognized the dangers of
money, popularity and power. So, he established rigid guidelines in
1950 that still serve him well.
</P>
<P>
   He and his associates agreed that local sponsors would handle
all money and that crusade figures would be audited. Graham would
be scrupulous in his dealings with women and never be alone with
any woman except his wife. And Graham put himself under the
direction of an independent board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows that no one is incorruptible,'' Martin said. ``He
understands that everyone has to be accountable to someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's personal integrity has been critical to the success of
his ministry and is an essential part of his ultimate leccy. His
good character has given validity to his message, Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is likely to completely fill his shoes.

 &HT;    Interactive toys sense how they're played with
 &HT;    WITH GRAPHIC
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Imagine what would have happened if an
interactive Barney doll had turned up in a household in the Middle
Ages.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, his owners would have been burned at the
stake for witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   There's something downright spooky about modern interactive
toys. Though they are obviously not alive, many of the things they
do look suspiciously lifelike.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to see, hear and feel what's going on around them, and
they seem to react to their environments in appropriate,
reasonable, intelligent ways.
</P>
<P>
   In the place of eyes, ears and other sensory organs, interactive
toys use light, touch, motion, magnetic, infrared, radio and other
sensors. Instead of mouths and muscles they have digital
recordings, motors and plastic and metal skeletons. In place of
brains they have chips.
</P>
<P>
   And in place of intelligence, they have clever programming,
which is the key to creating the illusion of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the toy isn't fun, if it isn't magical, then all the
high-powered chips in the world won't make any difference,'' said
Karn King, who works for a sound digitizing company. ``You don't
just stuff in the technology; you use the technology to make the
toy pleasing to the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolls with eyes that close are a primitive example of
interactive toys. The eyes are attached to weights and when the
doll is placed in a sleeping position, the weights pull the eyes
into the appropriate sleeping status.
</P>
<P>
   The sense organs of modern interactive toys tend to be much more
sophisticated than simple weights, but the principle is the same.
The child introduces a stimulus; something senses the stimulus and
reacts in an appropriate way.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Amy from Playmates is like a sleeping doll with a degree
from technical school. She not only talks, she seems to know what
she's talking about.
</P>
<P>
   When the child first plays with the toy in the morning, Amazing
Amy may ask for breakfast. If the child tries to give her a piece
of plastic pizza that comes with the toy, Amazing Amy may say, ``I
like pizza but not for breakfast. How about cereal?''
</P>
<P>
   The doll also can tell the difference between her play clothes
and pajamas and will ask for the right outfit at the right time.
Amazing Amy even knows when she's sick or needs a diaper change.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Slate of Playmates' marketing staff said Amazing Amy has
play pieces such as food items and clothing that have built-in
resistors.
</P>
<P>
   Place the play piece against contact pads on the doll's body,
and the doll's internal computer runs a signal through the play
piece and recognizes the piece by the amount the signal is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Amy also uses touch sensors to tell when her nose is
being blown or when she's being hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Touch sensors are among the most common components in
interactive toys. Touch sensors usually have some sort of springy
material that holds two halves of a circuit apart. Squeeze on the
springy material, the circuit is completed, and the ``brain'' of
the toy responds.
</P>
<P>
   Actimates, a division of Microsoft, uses touch sensors in its
popular interactive Barney and in the Arthur and D.W. dolls it
introduced this year, according to Christine Winkel, an Actimates
product manager.
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze the hands or feet of the dolls and they talk or play
games. They have vocabularies of thousands of situation-appropriate
phrases.
</P>
<P>
   The Arthur and D.W. figures, based on the Arthur characters'
public television series, also have touch-sensitive watches.
Children can touch the watches and the figures help them learn to
tell time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recorded speech, Barney, Arthur and D.W. all move
their heads and arms in gestures that match what they're saying,
Winkel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a chassis of 740 different parts,'' Winkel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Barney toy even has a light sensor, according to Winkel.
Cover the toy's eyes and the absence of light triggers it to play
peek-a-boo.
</P>
<P>
   Motion and attitude sensors, which detect vertical or horizontal
orientation, as well as touch sensors are important in toys like
Tickle Me Elmo, according to King.
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew people who designed the Elmo toy, and it took
them a while to get the sensors right.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one of the first prototypes you really had to bang it
hard to get it to activate,'' King said. ``It was more like Thrash
Me About Elmo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite disturbing, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   MIMICKING SPEECH
</P>
<P>
   King is marketing manager for Voxware Inc., a sound recording
compression technology company in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Though Voxware is not directly involved in toy manufacture, King
said the technology of compressing lots of recorded sound for
storage in a small space is critical to making a toy that can speak
thousands of phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Speak and Spell toys had a crude plastic record
inside,'' King said. ``The technology in a modern speaking toy is
more like the technology in a digital answering machine.''
</P>
<P>
   In an analog recording such as an audiotape, the sound
vibrations that hit a microphone are converted into electrical
impulses. Those impulses are impressed onto a physical medium such
as vinyl or magnetic material on the surface of a tape.
</P>
<P>
   King said digital recordings are made by sampling every few
milliseconds the sound vibrations that hit the microphone. The
recorder, in effect, describes the sound energy hitting the
microphone at any given instant as a series of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Sound compression, she said, is a process of isolating
repetitive patterns so they don't have to be described more than
once.
</P>
<P>
   The compresses recordings typically are store in modern toys on
microchips as ROM (read only memory), according to King.
</P>
<P>
   A microchip may look like solid, but actually it is honeycombed
with cells. When information is recorded on a microchip, each cell
becomes either charged and represents the number one or it remains
uncharged and represents the number zero.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns of ones and zero are the basis for all computer
codes and can be used to expression any number.
</P>
<P>
   King said the phrases talking toys can say are usually not
recorded in their entirety. Instead individual words or short
phrases are stored on the chip and linked by an operating program
to build sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Getting dolls to talk is much easier than getting them to
understand spoken speech, King said.
</P>
<P>
   Software exists that can recognize words, but King said it may
not be ready for mass-market toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software only responds correctly within tight limits,''
she said. ``If a little kid has to learn a strict set of rules
before playing with a toy, the magic goes out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   MIMICKING INTELLIGENCE
</P>
<P>
   Owners of Actimates dolls can buy separate activity packs that
will make their toys interact with specially encoded television and
computer programs. Arthur and D.W., designed for slightly older
children than Barney, also interact with an Arthur Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But the dolls naturally can't see, hear or understand what's
going on on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   What is actually happening is the dolls are responding to radio
signals generated in the activity packs that are plugged into the
television or computer, Winkel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nine different patents for Actimates technology,'' she
said. ``We're definitely looking into using radio technology in
other characters and toy applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Toys have no intelligence; they have triggers that call up
responses. A programmer decides which trigger _ a touch sensor, an
attitude sensor, a radio signal _ elicits which response. The
instructions for matching triggers and responses are typically
stored in some kind of memory device like a ROM microchip.
</P>
<P>
   In Barney's case, the toy uses a 4-megabit chip with 512k of ROM
to store its voice and responses, Winkel said. That gives the toy
about as much computing power as an advanced pocket organizer, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Amy has one chip for producing the 10,000 phrases the
doll can say and another chip for other functions like recognizing
clothing, Slate said. Like Barney, she has about 500k of memory.
</P>
<P>
   And all the doll's functions are keyed to an internal timer. In
that way, Amazing Amy is related to the virtual pets that Playmates
also makes. Slate said one of the most important advances that
makes dolls such as Amazing Amy and the Actimates line possible is
miniaturization. The small, lightweight brains can be hidden deep
inside the toy so the dolls can be soft, light and cuddly.
</P>
<P>
   Randomization completes the illusion of intelligence. People
don't say exactly the same thing every time they get thirsty, for
example, so a doll that uses the same words every time a particular
situation arises will seem mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Amy and the Actimates toys also have a range of possible
responses for every set of stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Children playing with the dolls don't have to understand how
they work. In fact it's better if children never have to think
about how their doll knows what to say and when, Slate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a programming standpoint, our doll is very complex,''
Slate said. ``But the programming is complex so the play will be
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know exactly how Amazing Amy works, but it's easy
for a little girl to learn to play with her.

 &HT;    Endangered species to get land
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The terrain was steep, rocky and thick with
junipers, live oaks and spider webs. Steve Paulson pressed on until
he reached his goal: a jaw-dropping view of Hill Country plateaus
and canyons rising from coves that make up the Cypress Creek arm of
Lake Travis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most beautiful pieces of property in Travis
County,'' said Paulson, an environmental consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The tract is also one of the most important parcels in the
breeding range of the golden-cheeked warbler, an endangered
songbird named for its bright yellow face. Come spring, 50 of the
warblers will arrive from Latin America, calling out in buzzy,
lilting tones to stake out their territories. What is more, a
limestone cave harbors endangered bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of debate, the owners of Vista Point, as the
tract is known, have reached an agreement with a nonprofit group
and Travis County to sell the property for permanent preservation
at a cost expected to total $6 million to $7 million, officials
said Friday. A $2 million federal grant and $666,000 in county
money have been earmarked for the first phase of the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reflects new momentum in the Balcones Canyonlands
Conservation Plan, a 2 1/2-year-old effort to set aside about
30,000 acres for the warbler, another endangered bird known as the
black-capped vireo and cave bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The public-private plan under the Endangered Species Act seeks
to preserve prime habitat in western Travis County while allowing
residential and commercial development in lower-quality habitat.
Landowners and developers who want to build in lower-quality
habitat may obtain the right to do so by paying acreage fees. Those
fees, in turn, are used by Travis County and the City of Austin to
buy prime habitat, such as Vista Point, for preservation.
</P>
<P>
   But high fees and testy relations between landowners and
government officials all but halted progress until a few months
ago. A reduction in fees _ to $3,000 an acre from $5,500 _ and a
new spirit of cooperation have prompted landowners to participate.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four months, landowners have paid nearly $500,000 in
fees, more than in the previous two years combined.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dunnam, managing partner of another Cypress Creek tract to
be enrolled in the Balcones preserves, attributed the positive
attitude to County Commissioner Margaret Moore, who was appointed
to her position in December when Valarie Bristol resigned to run
for county judge. Moore called a meeting in February at the Oasis
Restaurant, overlooking Lake Travis. For many of the two dozen
landowners who attended, it was the first time that a county or
city official had spoken to them on the Balcones plan.
</P>
<P>
   Vista Point is the county's first acquisition. The property
nearly became the subject of a federal court case. Alan Glen, a
lawyer for the Shellberg Tract Joint Venture, a real-estate
partnership that owns the land, said he was pleased it didn't. Glen
drafted a lawsuit claiming that the federal government had taken
the property without just compensation in violation of the
Constitution. His reasoning: The joint venture applied in 1994 for
a permit to develop part of the tract and preserve other parts, but
the U.S. Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service never
acted on the application.
</P>
<P>
   David Frederick, the service's Texas supervisor, said the agency
was prepared to allow development on a small fraction of the land
but preferred to work out an acquisition plan. ``Their patience was
outstanding,'' he said of the venture partners. The $2 million
federal outlay represents a third of the sum authorized by Congress
last year for habitat plans nationwide, said Rep. Lloyd Doggett,
D-Austin, who helped arrange the grant. The county money comes from
developers' habitat fees and increased tax revenue from development
under the Balcones plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Trust for Public Land is acting as a middleman between the
joint venture and the county, said Ted Siff, director of the Texas
field office for the nonprofit land-conservation group.

 &HT;    Amendment would make Fla. death penalty permanent fixture
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida's death penalty would become a
permanent fixture in its constitution under Amendment Two.
</P>
<P>
   Already law in the state, the death penalty would be further
bolstered by putting it beyond the reach of the state's Supreme
Court and allowing the continued use of the state's 75-year-old
electric chair unless banned by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment also revises the state's definition of cruel
and/or unusual punishment to simply cruel and unusual as defined by
the federal court.
</P>
<P>
   One of four amendments on the Nov. 3 ballot to come from the
legislature, it has sparked the most intense legal wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, opponents asked Florida justices to remove
it from the ballot. Justices refused and told lawyers to take it to
circuit court. On Friday a Tallahassee judge refused to remove it
from the ballot. Attorneys now say they will file an appeal in the
1st District Court of Appeal, which could send it back to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   While parts of the amendment may seem a matter of semantics,
opponents warn its effect could be far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an amendment here that really doesn't tell the
voters what is going to take place in terms of change in the
Constitution and we want voters to reject it,'' said D. Michael
McCarron, executive director of the Florida Catholic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida also opposes it,
saying the amendment surrenders the state's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worded to suggest it's a referendum on the death penalty
and it really isn't,'' said Larry Spalding, the ACLU's legislative
staff counsel. ``If this thing is defeated 10-1, we still have a
death penalty. What it is is a bill to preserve or protect the
electric chair and that to me is just a bizarre thing to put in a
state constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators sponsored the amendment after repeated challenges to
the constitutionality of the electric chair stalled executions for
more than a year. Death Row attorneys argued that when Pedro
Medina's head caught fire in a March 1997 execution, that met the
standard of cruel or unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Florida justices eventually upheld the chair by a narrow vote.
</P>
<P>
   Initially legislators considered replacing the chair with lethal
injection, but ultimately passed a law making lethal injection the
state's means of execution only if the courts banned the chair.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Victor Crist, R-Temple Terrace, argues the amendment simply
reinforces what the law already allows and clears up ambiguities
that consistently provide grounds of appeals to defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are saying these things are diehard opponents to
the death penalty, who are overreaching in every direction to try
and derail capital punishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say the amendment does more than just reinforce
the death penalty without adequately informing voters on the ballot
summary.
</P>
<P>
   The second sentence of the amendment says capital punishment
would be the authorized punishment for ``crimes designated by the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In doing so, and this is open to interpretation by the court,
but an English teacher would say new power is going to the
Legislature that would create a breach in the separation of powers
we now have,'' McCarron said. ``There's no reflection of that in
the summary or title.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Crist: ``The legislature already designates who qualifies
for capital punishment. . . . We're not changing anything here. It
wasn't our intent. It was to provide insurance that the death
penalty stays intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also say changing the definition of cruel and unusual
punishment to reflect the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation
further restricts the powers of the Florida Supreme Court. Without
the word or, the Florida Supreme Court can no longer review
sentences for proportionality, which insures that crimes of similar
circumstances receive the same punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proportionality is not a right, nor is it a law,'' Crist said.
``It was never meant to be an option.''

 &HT;    State law allows home schoolers to play sports, music
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ One problem with home schooling: There
are too many parts in the school play for one little family.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-year-old Kaemmerle Fitzpatrick must be a red-scarfed sailor
set sail for Roanoke Island, as well as an aproned lady expecting
the first English baby in the colony. She and her sister,
10-year-old Annika, the white-wigged captain, take off for the New
World on a lawn chair.
</P>
<P>
   But it's their mother, Freya Fitzpatrick, who thinks of herself
as the real pioneer in this suburban Lantana back yard. She has
taught her two girls at home for the past seven years _ before the
home-schooling magazines sold, the Orlando conventions opened, and
the trendy (and home-schooled) Hanson brothers inspired widespread
teen love.
</P>
<P>
   The Fitzpatrick sisters are two of the 2,240 Palm Beach County
students who may sit barefoot at their kitchen desks this year,
while their parents put on teaching caps. Since 1994, their numbers
have tripled in Palm Beach County and nearly doubled statewide.
There were 31,440 Florida students home schooled last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, home-schooled students must register with
the district superintendent's office. State law also requires them
to keep a portfolio that can be shown to the superintendent on 15
days' notice.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly increasing numbers may be due, in part, to new state
laws. In 1996, home-schooled students were allowed to participate
in sports and music programs at high schools. And as of May 1997,
they may apply to two-year colleges with merely an affidavit signed
by their parent.
</P>
<P>
   The school district doesn't keep figures on how many
home-schooling students participate in public school activities or
enroll in high school classes, but a few do, said district
spokesman Nat Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   The home-schooling community here offers at least six support
groups from Boca Raton to Palm Beach Gardens. They meet weekly for
martial arts in Royal Palm Beach; they buy blocks of tickets for
Kravis Center events; and they hold their own spelling bees. There
are chess and stock market clubs, field trips to the Space Center
and SeaWorld, and special classes taught by parents: How to measure
temperature using a cricket.
</P>
<P>
   As the home-schooling community has grown, it has become more
diverse. It is not exclusively white or Christian anymore. And the
reasons parents are choosing it also are becoming more varied.
</P>
<P>
   When state specialist Mary Lou Carruthers started talking to
home-schooling parents three years ago, there were mainly two
reasons for their choice: They had wanted the little ones to learn
about Christ in the classroom, or they worried about drugs, knives
and guns. More and more, parents talk about the latter, the safety
issue, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, parents also talk about crowded classrooms
and they worry their children might not get their teacher's
attention, said Beth Kramer, local director of the Florida Parent
Educators Association, who has taught five children at home.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding to home school, Freya Fitzpatrick considered
Indian Pines Elementary, less than a mile from her home. But
administrators said no when she asked to spend a day in a
kindergarten class, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not willing to let me see school in action, I'm not
comfortable sending my daughter there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick, who has a master's degree in education, taught five
years in public and private schools. When she first heard about
home schooling, she thought it was a terrible idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it just had to be one of the craziest things that
parents who weren't educators could think they could teach. It was
presumptuous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But out of desperation, she bought alphabet posters and
measuring cups, and then realized she'd have plenty of help. Her
father gives tennis lessons, her former Latin professor advises,
and other parents offer geology and Spanish classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the general contractor and I know how I want the house to
turn out. Not everybody wants to build a Christian child; they
might want a non-religious or Muslim child. That's the nice thing
about home schooling, you can choose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For an educator like Fitzpatrick, it's an exciting opportunity.
She can build an entire human being as if she were painting a whole
picture, not just the corner, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their day starts at 8:15 a.m. with violin lessons. At 8:30,
Fitzpatrick and her girls kneel under a homemade time line that
notes both Moses and William Tell, and recite the Lord's Prayer.
They belong to the New Church _ the girls' father and grandfather
were missionaries _ which broke from the Methodists 200 years ago.
The church emphasizes independent thinking, Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick's schedule, which she plans months ahead, sets out
15 or 30-minute blocks for Russian, Swedish, Spanish and
traditional subjects like math and dictation. When they fall
minutes behind, she says, ``We're wasting time! And that's what
life is made of.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all home schoolers are so organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unschoolers,'' who believe learning should be naturally led by
the children, wouldn't have planned classes. They might spend a
week learning about bats, if their children felt like it, and go to
the zoo, build a bat house, and read bat books.
</P>
<P>
   During spring break, home-schooled students can take a
standardized test, or a certified teacher can gauge their progress
by looking at a student's portfolio at the end of the year. The
Florida Parent Educators Association encourages parents to find a
teacher who ``understands home-schooling philosophies.'' The
students only have to show appropriate progress for their age,
according to state law.
</P>
<P>
   The state has never been able to compare the achievement of
home-schooled students against public school students, as much as
they'd like to, Carruthers said. One national study shows the
average home schooler scores at the 73rd percentile on the Iowa
Test of Basic Skills. The national average is 50. Those results are
unreliable because the students in the study were selected by the
researcher, a home schooler himself, Carruthers said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoons, Annika has chemistry _ she wants to live
on a Mars colony some day _ and she skips around the kitchen
wearing safety glasses. For an experiment on the atomic weight of
magnesium, the Fitzpatrick's gas stove must be a home-schooling
Bunsen (cq) burner.
</P>
<P>
   Annika would be a fifth-grader, if enrolled in public school,
but she works at a sixth-grade level, sometimes seventh- and
eighth-grade, her mother said. Socially, she may not be comfortable
with her peers in a public school unless they were gifted, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   The girls do socialize. They take karate on Monday afternoons
with 30 other students and roller skate on Fridays. They belong to
a New Church youth group, a home-schooling aviation club and 4-H
Explorers Club. When neighbor kids stop by, Annika flops down on
the carpet with a board game and offers to teach the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need sixth grade, I've already done all their work and
some of the work I do is high-school work,'' Annika said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her sister work unsupervised for much of the day. Freya
Fitzpatrick wants them to learn responsibility, as well as their
spelling words. Kaemmerle still needs a little help.
</P>
<P>
   Each plastic block holds one flea, according to today's fanciful
lesson plan, but Kaemmerle has no idea how many fleas fit in her
seven-story hotel. (It has four rooms on each level.) She doesn't
remember yesterday's math equation _ volume equals height times
area _ and she doesn't want to admit it. So she cries at the dining
room table and snaps at her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't taught me,'' she accuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I haven't taught you, you don't remember,''
replies Freya Fitzpatrick. ``We've talked about this before, but
every so often you get confused, which is OK. It's why we're
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick has uncommon patience, but it breaks occasionally.
She is the only authority for her children for much of the day.
When they stop listening to her, it might be time for regular
school, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls say never.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like home schooling. We can have some decision in what we
learn and she can focus on just us, not a whole class,'' Kaemmerle
said. ``She's our mother, we have her attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But their mother is clear-eyed about the whole adventure.
Someday her children might need lessons that she's unable to teach.
Someday her husband, an accountant at Office Depot, might not want
to shoulder the financial burden alone. But right now, she believes
there's no better education for her girls.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Kaemmerle figures it out _ yes, it's 28 fleas _ and
tosses the paper across the dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy?'' the 9-year-old asks her mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' comes the reply.

 &HT;    No more delays: Center will detain youth offenders
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The walk to the state's woodshed for
kids who break the law gets a lot shorter next week.
</P>
<P>
   The new Juvenile Assessment Center at 3400 Belvedere Road will
do away with the sometimes weeks-long delays in dealing with kids
charged with misdemeanors such as vandalism, theft and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, an estimated 500 minors are arrested for
misdemeanors and released to their parents. Now, those young
offenders will be taken to the new center and dealt with swiftly,
said officials from the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting four to five weeks to get a letter in the mail isn't
the same as walking down the hallway and getting the sanctions
imposed right away,'' said David Kerr, the department's operations
manager in Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency will run the center, but the staff also
includes school police, prosecutors and counselors The center also
will be the county's first public detox and treatment center for
adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   The juvenile justice department rents the building west of Palm
Beach International Airport from the county for $205,000 a year,
minus a $61,500 discount for renovations. The state spent $1.6
million on the redesign, adding a gated sallyport and a booking
room with a jail-like control room and two holding cells for
disruptive kids.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr said the estimated 300 children arrested each month for
felonies will go to the center before being driven to the 93-bed
Juvenile Detention Center on 45th Street. They are now taken
directly to the detention center.
</P>
<P>
   Parents whose kids are arrested but not detained must drive to
the assessment center to pick them up, Kerr said. If the parents
cannot be located, transportation is available. ?do we mean an
officer or someone else will take them home?
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents will have to get into their car, whether they live in
Boca Raton, Tequesta or Belle Glade,'' Kerr said. ``They have a
responsibility in raising these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, police officers must drive the kids to the center
unless the officer decides to turn the minors over to their parents
at the municipal police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no obligation for the officer to take the juvenile to
the center,'' School District Police Chief Jim Kelly said. ``They
can use discretion on how many they want to transport.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, chairman of the county's Law Enforcement Planning
Council, said the center is a big step for law officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the focus on juvenile crime, kids were pushed to the
side,'' Kelly said. ``Now, we're at the front end, rather than
waiting until they commit 40 crimes before doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   But Juvenile Court Judge Ron Alvarez said he's skeptical because
the state has not budgeted enough money to treat the mental health
or drug problems the center will detect. The state has budgeted
only $33,000 this year for psychological assessments for
delinquents under 18, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could spend that in a month,'' Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials agree more services for drug and mental health
treatment are needed and say the assessment center will emphasize
the need.
</P>
<P>
   The center will give more urgency to the minor's entry into the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it can take days for a police report to reach the State
Attorney's Office, which decides if prosecution is warranted. If
it's not, the prosecutor sends a report to the Department of
Juvenile Justice, which then refers the offender to a
rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
   When the center opens on Nov. 2, offenders will come with the
arresting officer, who will have a police report in hand. The minor
will see a case manager, prosecutor and counselor within a few
hours.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecutor agrees there no need to take the case to
Juvenile Court, the minor could agree on the spot to community
service, counseling or an appearance before the Youth Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``When dealing with kids, the sooner you can attach punishment
to bad behavior, the better,'' said Jeanne Howard, chief prosecutor
for juvenile crimes for the state attorney. Howard said two
prosectors and an aide are assigned to the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``An arrest will have a substantial effort on a child, more than
it has been in the past,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   All kids walking through the center's 24-hour sallyport will be
booked, fingerprinted and photographed. One of 16 screeners
employed by the juvenile justice department will interview the
offender after looking at the police report, records from the
school police and any previous arrest records.
</P>
<P>
   If alcohol or drug abuse is determined, the youth will be sent
to an adjoining wing staffed by substance-abuse counselors under
contract with the state.
</P>
<P>
   The detox and stabilization wing, with 20 beds in semi-private
rooms, is the first for juveniles in the county, said Camille
Franzoni, director of alcohol, drug abuse and mental health
services for the state Department of Children and Families, or DCF.
</P>
<P>
   The wing is staffed by 26 nurses and case managers and takes up
nearly a third of the building. The average stay will be five days,
said Robert Bozzone, executive director for Comprehensive
Alcoholism Rehabilitation Program, which contracts with DCF. Kids
can stay at the center for up to 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   Kids do not have to be arrested to get attention in the alcohol
and drug wing. Parents can bring their children to the center with
or without an appointment. Appoints can be made from 8 a.m. to 6
p.m. Monday to Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We function like an emergency room,'' Bozzone said. ``The only
requirement for admission is that the patient arrives.''

 &HT;    Living longer may not mean living better
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ An American rite of passage is turning
into a logistical nightmare for Willard Scott.
</P>
<P>
   The jovial weatherman who has faithfully broadcast birthday
greetings to America's handful of centenarians on the Today show
for more than a decade now turns down 95 percent of the requests he
receives.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that he's getting pickier, a spokeswoman said, there
just isn't enough air time for all the seniors tripping the triple
digits.
</P>
<P>
   Centenarians are no longer the rarities they used to be. At 106,
Frances Beoninger of Delray Beach was quick to point that out when
congratulated on her longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty like me,'' she said with an aw-shucks smile.
``Being 100 isn't such a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be positively passe down the road. Some of the thousands
of geneticists, immunologists, gerontologists and molecular
biologists trying to push the envelope of longevity project that
one in three children born today will reach 100. Some even think
the oldest of the old will one day live to be 130, 140 _ perhaps
150.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the search for the fountain of youth is racing ahead
faster now than at any other time in human history. Andrew Monjan,
the chief neurobiologist at the National Institute on Aging,
compares progress in the field to the rate of change in the
computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate between 2,000 and 3,000 scientists are studying
how to increase life expectancy on dozens of fronts that generally
fall into three areas of research.
</P>
<P>
   Curing diseases,probing genetics
</P>
<P>
   The most concentrated is efforts to cure diabetes, heart
disease, cancer and Alzheimer's disease _ the leading causes of
death among older people.
</P>
<P>
   Not as promising in the near term but potentially more dramatic
are efforts by scientists to isolate the genes that control the
biological clocks that regulate our bodies.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally accepted that our genetic code controls between
20 percent and 35 percent of our life expectancy _ though the
importance of genetics seems to increase into very old age. But a
breakthrough at the genetic level, some scientists say, could stop
the aging process altogether and open the threshold to immortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason people shouldn't one day live to be 150,''
said James Mortimer, the director of the Institute on Aging at the
University of South Florida. ``It is the fulfillment of our natural
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the road to immortality is already laid out. About 25
years ago it was discovered that if cells are taken from the body
of a fetus, they will multiply and divide a finite number of times.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, researchers learned why: A small piece of
genetic material inside cells decreased every time the cell
divided. When that DNA was exhausted, cell division ceased. The DNA
provided what appeared to be a built-in life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   This process, however, is circumvented by a recently-identified
compound that enables cells to reproduce indefinitely. The catch?
The process has been found only in cancerous tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding cancer key to 150-year lives
</P>
<P>
   ``At the cellular level, immortality is cancer,'' said Dr.
Richard Sprott, a former director of the National Institute on
Aging and now the executive director of the Ellison Medical
Foundation, which pays for aging research in this third broad area
of study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer cells will grow forever and we're beginning to
understand how that works,'' he said. ``When we do, we could
control ... cancer. We're also beginning to understand which genes
control which parts of this (aging) process. If we can ... walk
this genetic tightrope, we will dramatically increase life
expectancy.''
</P>
<P>
   That breakthrough, Sprott said, is the key that scientists refer
to when they theorize that life spans could one day exceed 150. It
is, he added, nowhere on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   `Why should there be a limit on life span?'
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the absolute length to which humans may one day live is
a fiercely debated question in the scientific community.
</P>
<P>
   One camp believes that a wall exists beyond which human life
cannot extend. The other contends that there is an
as-yet-to-be-discovered magic bullet that may one day challenge the
notion of mortality altogether.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference of about 75 leading age-research scientists last
weekend in San Francisco, the question took center stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was highly divided,'' said Rudolph Tanzi, the director of
the Genetics Aging Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people were showing pictures of Methuselah from the Bible
and saying, as long as we preserve enough tissue, why should there
be a limit on our life span. Others say, after a while organs are
going to (age), and since nerve cells don't divide, how could they
last past 200 years without conking out?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a subject Michal (cq) Jazwinski, a professor of
biochemistry and molecular biology at Louisiana State University,
is addressing. Jazwinski is working to isolate longevity genes in
yeast.
</P>
<P>
   There are specific genes commonly found in centenarians, but
present in just 5 percent to 10 percent of the general population.
If those genes can be isolated, and the products that they instruct
the body to build duplicated, an anti-aging pill could be made.
</P>
<P>
   More realistically, Jazwinski said, genes that help control
aging in particular systems of the body _ like the
muscular-skeletal or nervous system _ will be isolated first. At
the earliest, a drug like that could be on the market in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what sort of makes your juices flow,'' Jazwinski said.
``You'd like to have something that makes a significant difference
for the baby boomer population, especially since I'm one.''
</P>
<P>
   While scientists debate the probability of extreme longevity, an
increase in life expectancy already is predicted. The U.S. Census
projects that by 2050, when the 75 million-strong baby boom
generation arrives, the number of centenarians will have increased
from the approximately 30,000 alive today to 834,000.
</P>
<P>
   Will life be better as well as longer?
</P>
<P>
   What society looks like in 50 years will partly be determined by
how this new generation of elderly feels.
</P>
<P>
   Only 30 percent of the centenarians alive today live
independently, begging the question: Will researchers be able to
improve quality of life at the end of this prolonged life cycle?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't,'' said Sprott, of the Ellison Foundation, ``then
what we've created is a huge disaster. If we dramatically increase
lifespan without increasing health span, then what we've done is
dramatically increase human misery, not decrease it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Perls, a Harvard University-based geriatrician who has
headed a five-year study of 169 centenarians, said the vast
majority of them were exceptionally healthy for most of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to get to 100 you have to have excellent health,''
Perls said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that the human body is built for about 100 years
and you're not going to extend life much beyond that. But what we
will do is compress (sickness at the end of life) if we can get
people to pay much closer attention to their health.''
</P>
<P>
   How society copes with this massive wave of the very, very old
is a critical question. People will almost certainly work for more
years. Kenneth Manton, a demographer from Duke University who
believes the average life span for children born today will be 95,
guesses by 2098, the federal retirement age will be 80.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one suggests the 100-year-olds of the future will
supply the timber industry with its lumberjacks, the less
physically taxing areas of teaching and technology likely will be
filled by older and older men and women, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Said Monjan, of the NIA: ``I think it's foreseeable that people
could one day be living to 120 and acting like they are in their
70s. I think Sen. John Glenn is an excellent role model today for
successful aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Bortz, a gerontologist at Stanford University and author
of the book Dare to Be 100, said baby boomers will change society's
attitudes, but it will be the generations that follow that will
really benefit from their trailblazing. The most basic change,
Bortz said, is that the definition of old and the role of older
people will have to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society is going to have ask itself if old people are a
resource or a liability,'' Bortz said. ``If they are a resource,
then they are going to have to have tasks to perform. ... We can
achieve justification for being alive only if we matter.''

 &HT;    TV ads no flop for politicians
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Turn on a television set today and chances are
you'll see Bob Taft or Lee Fisher more often than the Taco Bell
Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   The final weeks of the 1998 campaign are bringing a slew of
political commercials to the airwaves, as well-funded candidates
try to capture the hearts and minds of the state's voters.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ohio's politicians are expected to spend a record $35
million on television advertising, according to one consultant who
purchases advertizing time. It's a number experts say will do
nothing but rise in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight years after Sen. William Benton of Connecticut
produced the world's first televised campaign commercial, the
30-second spot has become the coin of the political realm, and for
good reason: Major race candidates without a TV presence often
become election year roadkill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't mount a credible media campaign and get your name
in front of the viewers, you might as well not try,'' said Lee
Sigelman, a political scientist at George Washington University in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio politics provide a window through which to view the rules
of television: why candidates need it, why they spend so much, and
why they stoop so low.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, ex-astronaut John Glenn was running for Ohio's
Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. It seemed a sure thing.
Glenn was a national hero. His opponent was a little-known
Cleveland businessman named Howard Metzenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   But then Metzenbaum dropped $1 million on television
advertising, an astonishing amount in those days. He went on to win
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that was the difference between victory and
defeat,'' says David Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In a world addicted to the tube, television is the most
efficient way to communicate with voters. Candidates can hit a
week's worth of barbecues, pep rallies, and meet-and-greets and
still fail to reach a fraction of the people they could with a
commercial on ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Herb Asher, professor emeritus of political science at Ohio
State University, says candidates also use television to define
themselves and the issues they wish to emphasize. Opponents without
the money to buy air time have a much harder time setting the tone
of the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most races, you'll hear from one side,'' Asher says. ``The
other side will be lucky to have a presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the Ohio race for the U.S. Senate has been that kind
of affair.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George Voinovich began running commercials in
early September. His opponent, Democrat Mary Boyle, did not air a
single TV ad this fall until Friday (though the Ohio Democratic
Party had run its own spots attacking Voinovich).
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fought, Boyle's spokesman, acknowledges her absence from
television was because of money: Boyle, far outmatched in the
fund-raising department, simply can't match Voinovich ad for ad.
</P>
<P>
   But, Fought adds, Boyle will spend $400,000 on a television
blitz this week and perhaps as much next week. Her late entry to
the airwaves, he says hopefully, could turn out to be a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without over analyzing it, people don't like political ads,''
Fought says. ``I think the electorate has developed an interesting
mental clicker. When an ad comes on, they click off their brains.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign contribution scandals that dog politicians these
days have a single origin: the need to get onto television.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates in major races spend multiple millions on their
broadcast commercials. In California this year, three contenders
for governor spent about $64 million on television ads _and that
was just for the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why it's so expensive, take a look at how an ad
gets on the air. According to Patty Russell, a media buyer at the
Columbus-based Midwest Communications and Media, this is how it
works:
</P>
<P>
   A campaign selects a package of shows watched by a target
audience. Morning news shows are coveted because of their link with
``opinion makers'' _ early-rising hard-chargers who vote and sway
others' choices. ``Oprah'' is a good way to communicate with women,
while football is a good way to reach men.
</P>
<P>
   They pay for advertising by rating points (a 20-point sitcom
means 20 percent of households in the viewing area watch it).
Dayton-area stations charge about $60 a point, Russell said, while
those in Cleveland, the state's most expensive market, charge about
$180.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, a 1,000-point buy, which scatters commercials across
numerous shows, would cost around $60,000 in Dayton and $180,000 in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, politicians figure a viewer must see a commercial
10 times before its message resonates. Multiply that by the Ohio's
eight television markets, and it is easy to see how a campaign can
quickly blow a few million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Republican gubernatorial candidate Bob Taft is
gobbling ratings points like M&AMP;M's. He plans to spend at least $7
million on television ads statewide, $811,000 of it in Dayton.
That's likely to be more than any other Ohio political candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the typical voter will see all of our ads a
combined 150 times,'' says campaign spokesman Brett Buerck. ``As
chaotic as life is, you have to run ads that many times to break
through the clutter that complicates the average voter's life.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the documentary, A Perfect Candidate, a cameraman
follows political consultant Mark Goodin as he stalks into the
Richmond, Va., night.
</P>
<P>
   The man who hired him, Oliver North, had just lost a tight 1994
senate race to incumbent Chuck Robb in what many considered a
particularly nasty campaign. One North commercial featured a
Playboy magazine cover photo of a woman who said she had an affair
with Robb.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson Goodin took from the defeat? He was too nice. As he
strides away from North's concession speech, he vows never to make
that mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous studies have shown the public's distaste for attack
ads, and some suggest negative commercials even erode voter
turnout. Yet candidates continue to use such advertising for what
experts say is a simple reason: It works.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it,'' says Dan Mowbray, whose Columbus-based
company, The Media Group, produces commercials for Democrats.
``It's regrettable that it occurs at all, but it is sort of a fact
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Bob Bennett, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party: ``A lot
of people say to me that they'd wish they'd see less negative
advertising. ... The fact that they're even mentioning it to you
means that they're paying attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, one race went negative from the start. Foes of Issue
1, which would prohibit the hunting of mourning doves, began
running a blistering series of ads in September. The commercials
warned that ``extremists'' want to close down farms, prohibit
meat-eating, and end medical research on animals.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell what impact the commercials have had on the
electorate. Each side says their polls show a close contest.
</P>
<P>
   But University of Cincinnati professor Al Tuchfarber, who heads
the Ohio Poll, says television ads are even more crucial in issue
races than they are for office seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good, effective TV ad (on an issue) can change the numbers
30 or 40 points in a week,'' he says. ``On an issue, where the
voters have little or no information, a TV campaign can be
overwhelming in its power.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, politicians have talked about changing the rules
governing today's television-fueled campaigns. But little has been
done.
</P>
<P>
   The current system gives great advantages to incumbents. Since
they are already in positions of power, they have an easier time
raising campaign funds which they can pour into television ads.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the U.S. Senate killed a bill to ban
unregulated contributions that fund third-party ads _ the kind the
Ohio Democratic Party has produced on Boyle's behalf and that the
Republican National Committee is airing in Ohio's 6th congressional
district race.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the answer is for the television industry to offer
candidates free airtime, but broadcasters _ who earn millions from
campaign commercials _ oppose mandatory donations.
</P>
<P>
   As far as negative ads go, a new wrinkle in Ohio this year is
the involvement of the judicial system. A Franklin County judge
earlier this month temporarily banned a Taft ad for being
misleading. The Ohio Supreme Court later ruled the judge had no
jurisdiction in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   One civic group simply hopes the public will reward those who
take the high road.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Project on Campaign Conduct is asking candidates to
sign a clean-campaign pledge. So far, those running for secretary
of state, state auditor, and an Ohio house seat in Clark County
have agreed to run only upright commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Long Rhodes, project spokeswoman, says she hopes to
sign up others before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of weeks can be potentially the worst (for
negative ads),'' she says. ``We're continuing to negotiate, and I
think the fact that campaigns are still talking to us marks the
fact that they're interested in it and realize that the voters are
interested in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The project this week will unveil a radio and print ad blitz
asking voters to cast their ballots for those who run clean
campaigns. However, Rhodes said, none of the ads will be on
television.
</P>
<P>
   The group can't afford it.

`BLOOD AND VENGEANCE': THE BOSNIAN HORRORS, SEEN CLOSE UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
(Eds.: Publication notes are at the end of review.) 
AUTHOR ID: Herbert S. Okun, former U.S. ambassador to East Germany
and the United Nations, was a U.N. negotiator in Croatia, Bosnia
and Macedonia from 1991 to 1997. By HERBERT S. OKUN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1992-95 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina left an indelible imprint
on most of the foreign journalists who covered it. Serbian shelling
of defenseless cities, brutal concentration camps and, above all,
ethnic cleansing could not be forgotten, and many journalists
sought to sum up their experiences in books. Understandably, the
quality varied from transient reports resting between hard covers
to powerful first-hand accounts enhanced by an enlarging vision. In
the latter category, among others, one thinks of the Americans Roy
Gutman, David Rieff and Laura Silber, and Martin Bell and Misha
Glenny of Britain
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Sudetic's superb ``Blood and Vengeance'' joins that short
list and is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand
the war in Bosnia. The book masterfully traces in masterly fashion
the course of the larger war through its impact on one Muslim
family, and Sudetic's magnifying approach illuminates both the
darker corners and the larger framework of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim family whose tragic destiny he chronicles is that of
Huso and Hiba Celik and their three sons and a daughter. Related to
the family by marriage, Sudetic is an American of Croatian descent
who arrived in Yugoslavia in 1990 and covered the fighting in
Croatia and Bosnia for The New York Times from 1990 to 1995. Over
the following years, he returned to the former Yugoslavia in an
effort to ascertain the fate of the Celiks, who had been driven by
Serbian ethnic cleansing from their mountain village of Kupusovici
to the nearby eastern Bosnian mining town of Srebrenica, one of the
U.N. safe areas.
</P>
<P>
   Through the histories of the extended Celik family and their
neighbors, Serb and Muslim alike, Sudetic draws a compelling
portrait of life in the ancient Bosnian villages and towns along
the Drina River, for centuries the border between Bosnia and
Serbia. He records with a novelist's eye and a journalist's terse
prose the lazy rhythms of country life. But these historical
sections are not a nostalgic country idyll. Sudetic also records
``life along a troubled border,'' the mutual fears and antagonisms,
as well as the persisting blood feuds. He notes without comment
that both the grandfather and father of Huso Celik died violent
deaths: his grandfather, a conscript in the Austrian Army, was
killed by Serbian neighbors at the beginning of World War I; his
father, a farmer, was killed by Serbian guerrillas in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Huso and his family's turn came in the spring of 1992 when,
after an ill-fated referendum on Bosnian independence,
Serbian-inspired violence exploded. Little reported upon at the
time, in eastern Bosnia the Bosnian Serb leaders and their mentors
in Belgrade were carrying out a calculated plan to create an
ethnically based Bosnian Serb Republic _ Republika Srpska, they
called it _ next door to Serbia. Ethnically based meant ethnic
cleansing for these majority-Muslim areas. The early parts of
``Blood and Vengeance'' focus on the fighting in 1992-93,
culminating in the declaration of Srebrenica as a safe area by the
U. N. Security Council in April 1993. Sudetic is particularly
critical of the permanent members of the council, for he sees their
decision as a cynical ploy to avoid decisive politico-military
action, thereby turning Srebrenica into ``something worse than a
concentration camp.'' Like thousands of other Muslims, Huso and
most of the Celik family huddled in Srebrenica for years, surviving
on humanitarian aid until the Bosnian Serb army launched a
large-scale attack and took the town in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of the Srebrenica safe area, with U.N. peacekeeping
troops standing by impotently, forms the calamitous denouement of
``Blood and Vengeance.'' Sudetic recounts in detail the events
leading up to the fall of the town and the subsequent massacres of
the Muslims, overwhelmingly civilians, who had sought refuge there,
the largest mass murder in Europe since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Huso Celik and his son-in-law, Muhamed, along with 7,000 to
8,000 other Muslim men, were rounded up and taken away by the
Bosnian Serb forces of Gen. Ratko Mladic and have not been seen
again. Almost certainly they are dead. Huso's four children
survived the Srebrenica massacres. His daughter and two sons went
to live in Canada, and another son resettled in ``a characterless
place'' south of Sarajevo, a former Serbian area now part of the
Muslim-Croat Federation that makes up half of a divided Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   The Celik family has not returned home. Sudetic does not cavil
at their decision, noting that the Dayton peace accords ``left the
Bosnian Serb nationalists . . . the very thugs who had started the
violence in the first place'' in de facto control of the other half
of Bosnia, including Srebrenica and other former Muslim-majority
towns in eastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Celik family unique. In the three years since Dayton,
somewhat fewer than 30,000 of those expelled have returned to their
original homes, and they have almost all been Bosnian Croats and
Bosnian Serbs who have gone to Muslim-controlled areas. Of the more
than 250,000 Muslims expelled, the principal victims of the war,
virtually none have returned to their former homes in what is now
the Republika Srpska. Has ethnic cleansing been ratified? Has
aggression been rewarded?
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, there are more villains than heroes in ``Blood
and Vengeance.'' The villains are headed by the Serbian, now
Yugoslav, president, Slobodan Milosevic, ``the prime mover'' of the
Yugoslav disaster, closely followed by Mladic. There are others as
well: President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia; some nationalist Muslim
leaders; and feckless U.N.officials like Yasushi Akashi, the
secretary-general's special representative in the former
Yugoslavia. Among the few heroes are the last U.N. military
commander in Bosnia, Gen. Rupert Smith of Britain, as well as the
nameless ordinary Bosnians who behaved decently amid the prevailing
bestiality.
</P>
<P>
   The book is not without its imperfections. The eye-blurring
profusion of names makes it read at times like Dostoyevsky on an
off day, in spite of a 14-page listing of ``main characters.'' Some
of Sudetic's historical material is of the potted variety. One
would also like to have been told why the brutal but effective
Muslim military commander of Srebrenica, Naser Oric, was flown out
to safety shortly before the final Serbian assault. The Celik
family tree has a confusing error, and one map places their home
village in Serbia. But these are minor points.
</P>
<P>
   Sudetic tells us that in ``Blood and Vengeance'' he sought to
delve beneath surface events and to uncover ``the deep structure''
of the Bosnian war. In this vital narrative he has succeeded
magnificently.

A NEW BROOM SWEEPS THE WORLD OF WITCHERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mo., Pa.)  (js) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   From broom closet to book jacket comes an evolving literary
definition of the thoroughly mainstream witch: a teen-age girl
casting economy spells on crabby teachers, or a sleek Wiccan high
priestess with a coven, a law degree and three press agents to
promote the resulting spiritual memoir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I writing this book?'' said Phyllis Curott, 44, a New
York lawyer with her own practice and a Circle of Ara coven, whose
``Book of Shadows'' shares with readers her religious enlightenment
as well as mugwort potions for psychic dreams. ``You don't want to
get hate mail, but you make choices. And I feel that we're at a
critical moment in our history, and I really deeply believe that
people may change their attitudes by reading about an educated
professional who is a witch.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this goal, she has carefully cultivated an image as a
hip, upwardly mobile witch, wearing a strappy brown Morgan leFay
dress and wispy blond hair for her dust jacket, Donna Karan for the
publicity photos. She hired one independent public relations agency
to promote her book among readers of New Age spiritual books,
another to work with the mainstream audience. A media coach
provided her with tips on demeanor and earthly sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to shine the light of truth on
this and dispose the negative stereotypes of the green-faced
hideous hag,'' she said. ``What I'm hoping to reveal is that behind
the mask of an evil witch is the ancient and very beautiful face of
the goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   And so are an assortment of other young and middle-aged witches
whose rising literary output of self-help titles and memoirs is
propelled, in part, by a yearning for social acceptance and a
growing demand for information about the highly individual,
nature-based folk religion of Wicca, which worships ancient deities
and, as one author put it, has suffered from ``centuries of bad
press.''
</P>
<P>
   The wide assortment of books has reaped some authors six-figure
advances and contracts with large publishing houses. Other writers
complain that literary openness has cost them friends and, in some
cases, day jobs that augmented meager royalty checks.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing demand has also inspired some smaller publishers to
stack their lists with witchcraft titles and to haunt New Age trade
shows and witch camps and retreats in search of new talent and
themes that are reaching _ and in some cases targeting _ an
audience of teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   No title has actually soared on a broomstick to the top of a
best-seller list, but publishers large and small have found that
many of the books are steady perennial sellers. Over the last two
decades, the literature has evolved from academic and scholarly
books to more practical titles that young women and housewives are
willing to buy, said Karen Bouris, director of marketing for Harper
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, sales of Wicca titles averaged about 3,000 to
4,000 copies a year at Carol Publishing Group, but in the last two
years sales have increased, with some of the popular titles selling
up to 40,000, said Steven Schragis, the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning I put a spell on Random House and Simon &AMP;
Schuster, using nothing you can't buy in a regular grocery store _
Velveeta, paprika and Orange Crush,'' joked Schragis, who has
expanded the company's list of Wiccan titles from 2 to 29,
including guides for men, young witches and gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   But no spell could stop the large publishing houses, which are
also pursuing literary witches. In November, Bantam Books is
preparing to publish ``Circle Round,'' Starhawk's how-to book on
raising a second generation of witches, while Harper San Francisco
is promoting its ``fun and empowering'' guide, ``Be a Goddess!''
</P>
<P>
   For $9.99, St. Martin's Press is offering ``The Supermarket
Sorceress' Enchanted Evenings,'' by Lexa Rosean, who manages
Enchantment, a white-magic shop in Manhattan. The paperback
provides easy-mix recipes for spells concocted from widely
available ingredients. (Apartment-hunting spell: tinfoil, cinnamon,
salt, sugar, bread, pennies.)
</P>
<P>
   With its lack of a central hierarchy and rigid rules, the
earth-based religion of Wicca draws members from a mix of
movements: feminists, environmentalists and New Age seekers who
worship the gods and goddesses of nature by casting sacred circles
and celebrating the changing seasons. This leaves wide room for
interpretation of rituals, some dating back to pre-Christian
religions, others rising from merely mundane modern issues like
dealing with a balky computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rituals today come from a variety of places,'' said Helen
Berger, an associate professor of sociology at West Chester
University in Pennsylvania, who has written a book about modern
witchcraft. ``These are very avid readers who have recreated older
practices throughout the world and usually mixed them with modern
issues and concerns about gender equity. Some of the rituals come
from people's re-creations or from movies and novels and poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Wicca members tend to be white, college-educated, middle-class
women, many of whom have families, said Ms. Berger, who said the
religion was becoming more institutionalized as the members aged.
``It was fun to be an outsider and a witch in their 20s,'' she
said, ``and now they are in their 40s and they want acceptance for
their children.''

</P>
<P>
   The fear of a backlash has never disappeared, said Ms. Berger,
who added that the false stereotype that witches worship Satan
endures. She cited several examples of women whose religious views
raised anxiety in Texas and Tennessee, where she said a mother
joined a Christian church to avoid losing her children in a custody
case that uncovered her interest in Wiccan themes and books.

who has just published a guide called ``Teen Witch,'' intended
precisely for a new generation of witches.
</P>
<P>
   Her own children have been initiated into the religion, but she
said they have faced taunts from their peers for their beliefs. She
said her sons had been teased and her daughter's school locker had
been painted with derogatory slogans. Her daughters actually
advised her, she said, in writing her book, which offers 30 spells
made with low-cost and accessible ingredients. Still, she
discourages young would-be witches from starting their own covens
until they are adults who can train with older witches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have letters from kids saying their parents have burned
their books and destroyed their altars,'' the author said.
``Basically, it's because of a misconception, and what they fear
isn't true. Hollywood movies and bad publicity have made witches
look evil and that they hurt people and they really don't. I'm just
as worried about my own kids out there in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, other publishers express wariness about publishing a
book that is so clearly intended for the teen-age market. ``We
talked about, and we didn't do it,'' said Schragis, of Carol
Publishing. ``We have stayed away from publishing a book that
specifically uses the word teen or teen-ager'' in the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen Witch'' is published by Llewellyn International, a
company based in St. Paul with a long history of publishing
astrology books and annual revenues of $17 million. Two years ago,
the company's executives noticed a surge in sales with the
popularity of ``The Craft,'' a B-movie about a small coven of good,
bad and moderately well-behaved teen-age witches dressed in
knee-highs and school uniforms by day, hip clothes by night.
</P>
<P>
   Llewellyn responded by publishing a variety of books on
witchcraft for beginners, including ``Teen Witch,'' with a cover of
bemused 15-year-old girls in jeans and short skirts posed like a
movie poster for ``The Craft.'' Today, more than half of the 100
titles that Llewellyn publishes annually revolve around Wiccan
themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our typical reader had been a boomer who grew up in the '60s
who had been looking for a more appealing explanation of
spirituality,'' said Von Braschler, Llewellyn's director of trade
sales. ``Now our typical reader is becoming a very young woman in
her teens. We're basing this on the letters we get for the
authors.''
</P>
<P>
   Llewellyn's authors typically receive no advances and hold other
jobs to supplement their royalties. Their experiences are far less
glamorous than those of authors like Ms. Curott, who was able to
sell her memoir on the strength of her background to a large
publisher after a competitive auction with five bidding companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me tremendous credibility,'' Ms. Curott said of her
education at Brown University and her law degree from New York
University. ``When people think of Wicca, they think of either
Satanism or silly mumbo jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Morrison, 43, a Llewellyn author of ``Everyday Magic''
and ``Everyday Needlework,'' said she learned this lesson the hard
way in the Missouri town where she lives and has tried to promote
her work as a budding author of witchcraft titles. She suspects
that she was dismissed in June from her job at an animal shelter
near Jackson, Mo., after a bookstore clerk recognized her name and
picture on one of the books that described her as a Wiccan high
priestess.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid of what they don't understand,'' said Ms.
Morrison, 43, a former Roman Catholic whose books offer spells for
coping with computer crashes or speeding up modems.
``Unfortunately, it does no good to educate people in this area
because they don't want to be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New Age authors really don't make a lot of money,'' she added.
``I'm fortunate my husband makes good money, and yes, I'm missing
my salary from the animal shelter. I read cards when I go to book
signings. I'm allowed to do workshops, and _ goddess willing _ I'll
be able to find a job to work full time.''

(JT) 
 By LAURA MANSNERUS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first commandment for couples wanting to adopt babies is:
Put yourselves across. And they do, in spunky performances on
videotapes, in lush scrapbooks and in professional portraiture
smiling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Many speak on the Web pages that crowd electronic registries of
``waiting families.'' Gloyd and Penny, for example, say, ``We pray
daily for our birth mother and baby _ whoever and wherever they
are.'' David and Paula promise, ``This child will be overwhelmed by
love and affection.'' Rex and Carol wait, after 14 years of
marriage, with a spaniel named Brittney and a vacation home four
miles from Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   This is the essence of demand _ unhappily infertile couples _
competing for a smaller and smaller supply of white American-born
infants. It is an imbalance that professionals in the adoption
world are calling a crisis, allowing money to play a defining role
in determining who will succeed in this desperate quest for that
which cannot be legally bought or sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this marketplace, it's a sad reality,'' said Graham Wright,
president of the California Association of Adoption Agencies.
``Luck enters into it, but it's like anything else in life: If you
have enough money, you'll get what you think you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Many couples in search of a child are already depleted,
emotionally and financially, by drawn-out fertility treatments.
Still, they will pay $15,000 to $20,000 on average, even if they
have to mortgage their futures, to find their babies. Some will
spend much more before the day they appear in court to take legal
custody of their children. And a few, people who have the money for
intermediaries to do the work, pay up to $100,000 to bring home a
newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption is, in a rough analogy to organ transplants, a legal
transfer not subject to purchase or bidding. Nowhere in the United
States is it legal to sell a child, and few say it should be. Nor
can anyone sell the right to be an adoptive parent: that is
conferred by the state, based on home studies conducted by social
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But scarcity has created a cast of thousands of intermediaries,
who can and do sell access to the young women who might relinquish
babies.
</P>
<P>
   Access can be sold indirectly, by an Internet service that sells
advertising space to couples, for example, or directly, by lawyers
or unlicensed brokers known as ``facilitators,'' who will either
shop couples to pregnant women or recruit those who agree to let
adoptive families be chosen for them.
</P>
<P>
   This has left only the thinnest line between buying a child and
buying adoption services that lead to a child. ``The effect is the
same,'' said Wright, whose agency, Future Families of Monterey Bay,
Calif., places older children for adoption and foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere the baby boomers set their feet, a cottage industry
springs up,'' said Bernie Riff, an adoptive father. Riff and his
wife, Vicki Young, adopted their daughter, Jessi, 2 1/2, with the
help of a facilitator after waiting a long time with an agency that
gave them, in Ms. Young's words, ``nothing but a binder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are consultants and facilitators,'' Riff said. ``There
are photographers, there are all these little marketing things.
People do videos. There's no limit to what you can spend on these
things if you're inclined to and have the resources.''
</P>
<P>
   State-licensed adoption agencies, once strictly controlled
charitable and paternalistic institutions, may be pained by the
intrusion of commerce, but now they, too, advertise on bus shelters
and billboards, and collect scrapbooks and videos from would-be
parents to show to birth mothers. They mine connections with
foreign orphanages. They do what they can do to increase their
supply of children. It is just one measure of growth within this
fragmented industry that the number of licensed child placement
agencies has increased by several hundred in just three years, to
1,764, according to the National Adoption Information
Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The states impose standards on child-placement agencies
requiring certified social workers to evaluate prospective parents,
counsel birth mothers and get relinquishment papers signed. They
limit payments that can go to birth mothers, who, above all, are
not supposed to profit from adoption, and they require reports to
the courts of all payments made by the adopting family.
</P>
<P>
   But the laws differ from state to state, creating a tangle that
itself keeps lawyers busy and would-be parents confounded. A few
states, like Massachusetts and Connecticut, prohibit independent
adoptions altogether; some that do allow it, like New York, hew to
the traditional model and limit lawyers' roles; California, the
most hospitable to the new entrepreneurialism, allows lawyers and
facilitators to recruit prospective birth mothers on clients'
behalf. Louisiana, known for its laxity, allows nonresidents to
adopt and to pay extensive living expenses for pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The process, while hardly simple, is basically the same
everywhere. Every adopting couple typically begins with a home
study. If parents adopt independently, they will probably
advertise, although about a dozen states prohibit it. Pregnant
women who respond or are referred to them are screened, and
adoptive and biological parents exchange basic biographies. If all
goes well, the adoptive parents pay modest pregnancy-related
expenses for the birth mother and, shortly after birth, she legally
relinquishes the child. (If all does not go well, the biological
mother decides not to place the child, or, worse, tries to revoke
her consent later, the adoptive parents have gambled and lost.) Six
months to a year later, a court finalizes the adoption.
</P>
<P>
   An agency will bundle these services, with employees making
matches, counseling both biological parents and adopting couples,
coordinating medical care and legal services.
</P>
<P>
   The costs for domestic infant adoptions range widely. Some
people adopt infants, joyously and quickly, for $5,000 or $10,000.
They might, in an independent adoption, locate a woman in their own
state who has minimal expenses and is certain she wants to place
her child; without any legal or medical complications, the total
cost might be several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Placements by state agencies often cost nothing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Then there are couples who pay sums approaching $100,000 for a
closed adoption of a white newborn. These gray-market placements,
which usually involve questionable payments to birth mothers and
the brokers who find them, have prompted much legislation and
public attention; still, they are a tiny percentage of adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the stamp of the marketplace is apparent in one
troubling fact: In the baby bazaar, with children of varying
colors, cultures and conditions, something resembling a price
schedule has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   At many agencies, race determines fees, said William Pierce,
president of the National Council for Adoption, an advocacy group
for agencies. ``If you have 40 white couples chasing every white
newborn, you don't need a lesson in economics,'' Pierce said. ``The
only way to stay afloat is to reduce your charge for a black baby
and charge more for the white ones.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Product: Not Enough Babies To Meet the Demand &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If adoption is a growth industry, it is not because of any
significant increase in adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, according to a rare report on adoptions published by
the National Center for State Courts, the number of adoptions was
127,441, a figure that demographers believe has not changed
appreciably. The authors of the report estimated that two-thirds
were adopted by stepparents or relatives, or were older children
placed from foster-care programs.
</P>
<P>
   The other third, or about 43,000, constitute the heart of the
industry: children, domestic and foreign, placed with nonrelatives.
The National Council for Adoption estimates that infants, which it
defines as children under age 2, account for 48 percent of all
unrelated domestic adoptions or about 24,000 a year. At the same
time, according to a rough estimate by the adoption council, about
1 million families are seeking to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adoption from a domestic standpoint is in a period of
crisis,'' said Paige McCoy Smith, marketing coordinator for the
Gladney Center in Fort Worth, Texas, one of the nation's biggest
and oldest adoption agencies. Because less than 2 percent of
unmarried pregnant women are placing their babies for adoption,
they now have ``the option to be very, very selective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bartholet, a Harvard University law professor and
adoption specialist with two adopted children, agrees. Among young
pregnant women, she said, ``most of the pressure they are subjected
to is to either abort or keep.''
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, unmarried, pregnant women did not have many
options. Some went to places like Gladney or the Salvation Army's
Booth homes, where they awaited birth while social workers chose
adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1973, the year that abortion was legalized, about 9
percent of births to unmarried women in the United States resulted
in adoptions. By 1981 that percentage dropped to 4 percent, and by
1988 to 2 percent. While the number of unmarried women giving birth
has risen each year at least since 1965, the net result is a slight
decline in the number of American-born infants available for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, according to a rough estimate by the adoption
council, about 1 million families are seeking to adopt. The
old-line agencies tried to adapt by letting birth mothers choose
adoptive parents. But in the late 1970s, would-be parents began
defecting to lawyers who could help them adopt independently if
they _ or the lawyers _ could find a birth mother directly. The
scramble also invited a new type of adoption agency, promising some
kind of edge.
</P>
<P>
   American Adoptions of Overland Park, Kan., for example, has a
``traditional program'' in which pregnant women choose from an
array of profiles of families, but it advises many clients to sign
up instead for another program in which parents pay directly for
advertisements, and young women who respond are shown the profile
of that family first. In its letter to applicants, the agency says:
``Most traditional adoption programs provide the birth parents with
the opportunity to select their `ideal' family. Where does that
leave you?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Marketing: Advertising on Buses, Benches and Beyond &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Marketing came naturally to Arty Elgart, who started a
facilitation service after he adopted his son (from Gladney) 20
years ago. It was a matter of enthusiasm and altruism: Working out
of his auto-parts warehouse in Philadelphia, he made matches as a
favor for couples he knew, or friends of friends. By most accounts,
including his own, no one had seen anything quite like it before.
Elgart placed a small newspaper ad that asked, ``PREGNANT? Young
couple wishes to adopt baby. Call Mary, 289-2229.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the sedate nonprofits that dominated the adoption
community, this crossed a line of propriety. Elgart's matchmaking
was legal, since he charged no fee and advertising was not
prohibited in Pennsylvania. But his marketing, which progressed to
benches, buses and Burger King tray liners, was called everything
from unusual to appalling.
</P>
<P>
   Elgart has long since turned his mission into a full-service
licensed adoption agency, named Golden Cradle, now in Cherry Hill,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golden Cradle started something,'' said Maxine Chalker,
executive director of Adoptions from the Heart, of Wynnewood, Pa.
When she started her agency in 1984, she said, ``in the phone book
there were maybe three ads under Adoption Services. Now there must
be 40.''
</P>
<P>
   A modest display ad for Adoptions From the Heart is among them.
The agency also advertises on bus shelters and in malls, and has
tried radio and television, though the response was disappointing.
``We're always trying to find new things,'' Ms. Chalker said. ``It
gets harder every year because of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the competition comes from lawyers who handle
independent adoptions: ``Now everybody thinks adoption is easy
money, especially the attorneys,'' Ms. Chalker said. ``Now they're
hiring counselors to work in their offices, and setting up as
agencies without being licensed.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoptions From the Heart has 33 staff members and seven offices
in five states. The agency has an advertising budget of $371,000
this year, accounting for 16 percent of its total expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad budget,'' Ms. Chalker mused. ``It's so embarrassing.
It's so much money, and that's just to stay in business.''
</P>
<P>
   To stay in business, Adoptions From the Heart has also extended
its connections in China and Vietnam; it has placed 114 babies from
China and 16 from Vietnam this year, compared with 47 American-born
infants. The agency charges a fee of $14,700 for placement of a
white American infant or toddler; legal fees are an additional
$2,000 to $3,000, and parents pay any medical costs not covered by
insurance. The cost of adopting from China is $17,235 and adopting
from Vietnam is $22,100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our facilitator in Vietnam charges $10,000 per baby,'' Ms.
Chalker said. ``Can you imagine how rich she must be?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Sales Agents: Facilitators or Lawyers Help With the
Process &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The frontier state for the adoption business is California. The
state has long permitted lawyers to recruit pregnant women. Now,
facilitation services, which are unlicensed, are also recruiting
and screening birth parents, as well as coaching prospective
parents and finding them professional help.
</P>
<P>
   Facilitators operate in many states. While their activities
often come close to legal definitions of child placement, they are
generally too new or too few to prompt regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, legislation enacted last year to clarify
their role ended up legitimizing a whole new class of
entrepreneurs. Lil Snee, a facilitator in Los Gatos who co-founded
an informal trade organization, estimates that 40 to 50 are
operating in the state.
</P>
<P>
   For Ellen Roseman, a facilitator in San Anselmo, the main job is
coaching prospective parents. ``I make them read everything,'' she
said. ``It's like taking a college course.'' Then she helps them
piece together deals with pregnant women, lawyers and agencies,
often in other states. She charges a flat fee of $3,450.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At a recent support-group meeting at Ms. Roseman's house on a
winding lane in Marin County, casually dressed current and former
clients, many with babies in hand, exchanged stories of false
starts and disappointments. ``I think it will get easier with time
as people know what to expect, but for now, it's a free-for-all,''
said Riff, the father from Berkeley said over the potluck dinner
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Roseman, a former flight attendant and representative in
union negotiations, the enterprise is more like putting together a
business deal. ``You sit down and move around the pieces to do two
things,'' she said, ``to make sure it's legal and to save money.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not recruit pregnant women, but she gets referrals and
interviews candidates. ``To really get the birth parents ready,''
she said, ``you do what's called shaking them out of the trees. You
say, `If you have a little feeling down here telling you to keep
your baby, we've got to talk about that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roseman hounds prospective parents, too. With one, she said,
``I insisted that she hit a therapist's office two or three times a
week, get into meditation and get a massage to relieve her
anxieties.''
</P>
<P>
   Lil Snee, the Los Gatos facilitator, also does what she calls
``hand-holding,'' charging $2,900 for an 18-month contract.
Occasionally, clients pay her $95 a hour to interview a birth
mother. ``It just feels wrong'' for prospective parents to ask
questions ``about sexual partners, about how many men might be the
father of this baby,'' Ms. Snee said, so she asks the questions
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring the clients and the birth parents the kinds of
families they're looking for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That, Ms. Snee said, is her metier. ``Let's say you have a
Hispanic-black baby and you have 20 waiting families,'' she said.
``This birth mother is committed, intelligent, clean, but every
single waiting family wants an Anglo baby with blond hair. Or I
probably have about six cases where the babies are white, but maybe
the mother wanted a certain religion, or a home with no children in
the family. Maybe she did a little drugs and people are afraid of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In some states, matchmaking for a fee is illegal except by
licensed agencies. Among them is New York, where lawyers can handle
independent adoptions and advise their clients on finding pregnant
women, but not make such an introduction themselves. In New Jersey,
an individual _ say, a lawyer or social worker _ may make a match,
but may not charge for it.
</P>
<P>
   California's new law does restrict facilitators' practices. They
must identify themselves as such in their advertising and must tell
prospective parents that they are not licensed adoption agencies.
They must obtain a $10,000 insurance bond to cover claims. But the
state does not register nor license them, and it does not limit
their fees.
</P>
<P>
   Randall B. Hicks, an adoption lawyer in Riverside, Calif., and
the author of ``Adopting in America'' (Wordslinger Press, 1995)
calls facilitators ``a garage industry,'' he said, ``not licensed
nor trained to do anything.'' He also finds their fees, which can
exceed $12,000, out of line. ``They find a baby for you,'' he said,
``then they have to turn it over to a lawyer or an agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snee, who lobbied for a licensing system to give
facilitators credibility, accepts that that only lawyers can
transact the actual adoption. But she argues: ``We get so bashed.
We provide a service, and just because it involves adoption doesn't
mean we should be the saviors of the world and do everything for
free.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roseman contends that California's competitive marketplace
keeps fees down and that expenses for birth mothers are fairly
limited by the state courts. In the adoptions she handles, she
said, ``very little money changes hands.'' She earns about $100,000
a year from her business. ``This is a beautiful house in a
beautiful, expensive area,'' she said. ``But it's not from the
booty of adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana, on the other hand, ``is wide open,'' Ms. Roseman
said. ``I always joke, when I want to make a million dollars, I'm
going to open an agency in Louisiana and I'll be charging $30,000,
$40,000, $50,000. I'm going to get fat eating bonbons in
Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Factory: Low on Regulations, Louisiana Lures Many &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana is where Misty and Donnie Smoot ended up two years
ago, when an agency installed them in a slightly down-at-the-heels
apartment complex in Baton Rouge. ``I was down there the second
weekend after I found out I was pregnant,'' said Mrs. Smoot, who
lives in Nashville. Her husband added: ``They try to get you down
there and get you stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to find a birth mother anywhere in the country,
send her to live in Louisiana, pay her expenses and fees to
intermediaries, have her relinquish the child in Louisiana and
finalize the adoption there, all while living elsewhere. And some
couples who can afford it, most of them in the Northeast, do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Most states limit payments to medical, legal and strictly
defined living expenses. Louisiana does not, though all expenses
must be reported to the court that finalizes the adoption. The
state does not prohibit payments to intermediaries, and its
Department of Social Services, which regulates adoption, receives
no information on agencies' fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Smoots were recruited as birth parents for a couple whose
names they never knew. They were living in Tennessee and having
marital problems, Mrs. Smoot said, when she became pregnant.
Responding to a newspaper classified ad, they said, they spoke to a
man named Richard in Florida who explained that he had clients
interesting in adopting, and who referred them to an agency outside
Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   They were given first-class plane tickets for themselves and
their two young sons and moved into an apartment rented by the
agency, Beacon House. The agency paid rent and utilities, gave them
$150 a week for groceries and ferried Mrs. Smoot to doctor's
appointments and group meetings. Mrs. Smoot estimated that Beacon
House had 12 to 20 birth mothers in Baton Rouge while she was
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Smoots were never told much about the adoptive parents
assigned to them; they said they were given a copy of the couple's
home study and brief profile, without pictures. They spoke to the
couple once, by telephone. ``The father was the CEO of his company,
and their net worth was some ungodly number,'' Smoot said. ``The
whole home study was about money, money, money.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement unraveled when Mrs. Smoot was found to be
carrying twins. Beacon House assured them that both babies would be
adopted by the chosen parents, but the Smoots heard through the
birth-mother grapevine that, in the past, the agency had separated
twins without telling the birth parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Smoots switched agencies and went through with a semi-open
adoption, then returned to Tennessee. A month later, Beacon House
sued them for breach of a contract that obligated them to pay back
expenses if they placed their child through an agency or lawyer
other than Beacon House.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which sought $24,774, was dropped. Beacon House and
its director, Anne R. Hughes, who also acts as the agency's
attorney, declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   As the Smoots explained it, some women they met were drug users
who sought a means of support. Some never had any intention of
placing their children, Smoot said, ``but there was one girl there
who was giving up her sixth baby to Beacon House. There's several
who do that. It's like an employer-employee relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something the adopting parents need to know,'' he
continued. He said he and his wife were barely screened, either by
Beacon House or by the intermediary named Richard. ``They should
investigate the birth parents a whole lot more than they do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One source of referrals to Louisiana, according to lawyers and
investigators, was Richard Gitelman, whose facilitation service in
Florida was investigated in the 1980s after complaints were made.
The Smoots said that the ``Richard'' they talked to never gave his
last name, but several adoption professionals, who asked not to be
named, said he has referred birth parents to Beacon House.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Gitelman is said to be favored by older, moneyed couples who
want quick, closed adoptions. Investigators have placed his fees at
$50,000 and up; Pierce at the National Council for Adoption said he
had seen a photocopy of a check written to Gitelman, with
endorsement, ``in the range of $75,000 to $90,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Gitelman, reached at his office number in Coral Springs, Fla.,
refused to discuss his fees or even to say whether he is still in
business. (His National Adoption Counseling Service was declared
inactive by the State of Florida in 1996 for failing to file its
annual report with the state.)
</P>
<P>
   Gitelman has never been convicted of anything, though he was
indicted and he agreed to a $7,500 fine and a year's probation in
Pennsylvania for interfering with the custody of a minor, a
pregnant Pennsylvania teen-ager he briefly moved to Louisiana in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Fees paid in Louisiana are difficult to track. Adoption
proceedings are sealed and courts do not submit records to state
regulators. But James Best, a district court judge in West Baton
Rouge Parish, where Beacon House is situated, said most infant
adoptions he had reviewed were smooth and unremarkable. When asked
if he had ever seen a $50,000 fee to a facilitator, Judge Best
said, ``If I ever did, I'd probably roll out of my chair and say
I'm in the wrong business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lucy McGough, a law professor at Louisiana State University
and head of the legislature's advisory committee on adoption laws,
said a few judges told her they had seen $50,000 fees and did not
know how to handle them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was infuriated,'' Ms. McGough said, ``because they were
reporting high charges and saying, `So what's it to you, Mac? All
the code says is we have to report it, and that's what were
doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGough's committee is drawing up amendments to the adoption
laws; in a memo to the committee, Ms. McGough voiced concern over
``prime baby adoptions that can bring $75,000 to $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she said, none of the parties are complaining: ``The
adoptive parents are happy as clams.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Market Price: Children Are Children, But Some Cost More &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For the old-line agencies in this marketplace, ``there are
Catch-22's everywhere,'' said Pierce of the National Council for
Adoption. They are torn between the principle that children should
not be discounted by race or disability and the reality that that
is how one creates a larger pool of parents. They are torn between
the principle that parenthood should not be charged for and the
reality that social services are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies, many of which receive donations or government
subsidies, say that parents' fees could not cover their costs.
Wright in California notes that when licensed agencies work with
pregnant women, about 80 percent end up keeping their babies. And
for most agencies, he said, ``the cost of serving the 80 percent
can't be paid for by the fees of the other 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Gladney Center, fees do not come close to covering costs.
Thanks to its endowment and its large campus, where about half its
birth mothers live, Gladney can offer an array of services: three
dormitories, a health clinic, chapel, dining hall, swimming pool
and greenhouse, as well as high school and community college
courses, vocational training, legal representation and counseling
to be available for the rest of the birth mothers' lives.
</P>
<P>
   All of this costs the agency, on average, $32,000 per resident.
But Ms. Smith, the marketing coordinator, said the average
placement fee is $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many agencies, including Gladney, use sliding scales to
accommodate lower-income families. Still, Pierce said, ``the
economics of adoption is going to cause you to prefer the people
who pay the higher fee.''
</P>
<P>
   High fees help subsidize the work necessary to find homes for
hard-to-place children, at least in the agencies that undertake the
job, he said, adding that, in some states, agencies receive
``bounties'' to recruit adoptive families for children in foster
care or to place disabled children who are costly to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you have a kid who's HIV-positive in the hospital costing
$1,000 a day,'' Pierce said. ``To pay someone to find adoptive
parents is entirely reasonable, but what does that look like to the
public?''
</P>
<P>
   It may also look terrible to charge less to place minority or
special-needs children, but many agencies say they have little
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Gladney, for one, has a lower-cost program for African-American
and biracial children. ``Unfortunately, we had to create a separate
program because adoptive parents were simply not coming forward,''
Ms. Smith said. Under that program, the agency charges $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever handles them, adoptions in the over-$50,000 range almost
always involve American-born white infants. While most are
independent placements handled by lawyers, a few agencies market
themselves by at least hinting at results. Easter House, a Chicago
agency, notes in a letter to prospective parents that those
approved this year have waited an average of 34 days to be offered
a baby. The agency charges $45,000, ``plus some incidentals.''
</P>
<P>
   But high-priced agencies, whether blue-ribbon or gray-market,
have no shortage of customers. ``I hate to say this, because it's
going to sound crass,'' said Debra Harder, network director for
Adoptive Families of America, a Minneapolis-based support
organization. ``But there are people who have the basic philosophy
that the more I pay for something, the better it will be, not just
in terms of the product but in terms of appearances. It says a lot
about me if I drive a Lexus.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Imports: A Rise in Enterprise Taps Foreign Supply &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In international adoption, the scramble is entirely different:
it is for parents. The Adoptive Families of America's current
``Guide to Adoption'' contains ads for 35 agencies, 33 of which
advertise foreign programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your child is waiting for you,'' the headline on one
announces. ``We go with you to China!''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the long-established agencies involved in international
adoptions have ``an altruistic, mission-driven sense that every
child deserves a family,'' Ms. Harder said. ``Now, with additional
programs opening up in Russia and China in particular, folks are
seeing it as an entrepreneurial venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoption experts say international adoptions have generated lots
of new businesses, from charitable, church-affiliated agencies to
walkup offices run by people who make money change hands in
Bulgaria. Fees to foreign expediters, translators, lawyers and
orphanages are usually beyond the control of the American-based
agencies that make the placements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many prospective parents, not wanting the uncertainty of
dealing with birth mothers, never even consider domestic adoption
seriously. Adoptions from foreign countries are expected to
approach 15,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the supply in foreign countries now exceeds the demand
here. Susan Soon-Keum Cox, director of public policy at Holt
International Children's Services in Eugene, Ore., said the
increase comes largely from Eastern Europe and China. Russia, which
had no program five years ago, placed more children last year than
any other country, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As recently as five or ten years ago, there were many more
parents waiting to adopt than there were children,'' said Ms. Cox,
whose agency has placed more than 100,000 children. ``Now that's
entirely turned around. We're searching for families.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Irvin, state director of Family Adoption Consultants in
Macedonia, Ohio, is uneasy about having more children than families
waiting for placement. ``There are some real tensions now between
the child focus and the consumer orientation, the human services
model and the market forces,'' she said. ``Some families start
looking for the cheapest, the fastest, the `we promise you a child
that meets your quote-unquote specifications in so many months.'
Some of us who have been in the field for 20 years get worried
about this shift.''

 By LAURA MANSNERUS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first commandment for couples wanting to adopt babies is:
Put yourselves across. And they do, in spunky performances on
videotapes, in lush scrapbooks and in professional portraiture
smiling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Many speak on the Web pages that crowd electronic registries of
``waiting families.'' Gloyd and Penny, for example, say, ``We pray
daily for our birth mother and baby _ whoever and wherever they
are.'' David and Paula promise, ``This child will be overwhelmed by
love and affection.'' Rex and Carol wait, after 14 years of
marriage, with a spaniel named Brittney and a vacation home four
miles from Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   This is the essence of demand _ unhappily infertile couples _
competing for a smaller and smaller supply of white American-born
infants. It is an imbalance that professionals in the adoption
world are calling a crisis, allowing money to play a defining role
in determining who will succeed in this desperate quest for that
which cannot be legally bought or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Many couples in search of a child are already depleted,
emotionally and financially, by drawn-out fertility treatments.
Still, they will pay $15,000 to $20,000 on average, even if they
have to mortgage their futures, to find their babies. Some will
spend much more before the day they appear in court to take legal
custody of their children. And a few, people who have the money for
intermediaries to do the work, pay up to $100,000 to bring home a
newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption is, in a rough analogy to organ transplants, a legal
transfer not subject to purchase or bidding. Nowhere in the United
States is it legal to sell a child, and few say it should be. Nor
can anyone sell the right to be an adoptive parent: that is
conferred by the state, based on home studies conducted by social
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But scarcity has created a cast of thousands of intermediaries,
who can and do sell access to the young women who might relinquish
babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere the baby boomers set their feet, a cottage industry
springs up,'' said Bernie Riff, an adoptive father. Riff and his
wife, Vicki Young, adopted their daughter, Jessi, 2 1/2, with the
help of a facilitator after waiting a long time with an agency that
gave them, in Ms. Young's words, ``nothing but a binder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are consultants and facilitators,'' Riff said. ``There
are photographers, there are all these little marketing things.
People do videos. There's no limit to what you can spend on these
things if you're inclined to and have the resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The process, while hardly simple, is basically the same
everywhere. Every adopting couple typically begins with a home
study. If parents adopt independently, they will probably
advertise, although about a dozen states prohibit it. Pregnant
women who respond or are referred to them are screened, and
adoptive and biological parents exchange basic biographies. If all
goes well, the adoptive parents pay modest pregnancy-related
expenses for the birth mother and, shortly after birth, she legally
relinquishes the child. (If all does not go well, the biological
mother decides not to place the child, or, worse, tries to revoke
her consent later, the adoptive parents have gambled and lost.) Six
months to a year later, a court finalizes the adoption.
</P>
<P>
   An agency will bundle these services, with employees making
matches, counseling both biological parents and adopting couples,
coordinating medical care and legal services.
</P>
<P>
   The costs for domestic infant adoptions range widely. Some
people adopt infants, joyously and quickly, for $5,000 or $10,000.
They might, in an independent adoption, locate a woman in their own
state who has minimal expenses and is certain she wants to place
her child; without any legal or medical complications, the total
cost might be several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Placements by state agencies often cost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are couples who pay sums approaching $100,000 for a
closed adoption of a white newborn. These gray-market placements,
which usually involve questionable payments to birth mothers and
the brokers who find them, have prompted much legislation and
public attention; still, they are a tiny percentage of adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the stamp of the marketplace is apparent in one
troubling fact: In the baby bazaar, with children of varying
colors, cultures and conditions, something resembling a price
schedule has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   At many agencies, race determines fees, said William Pierce,
president of the National Council for Adoption, an advocacy group
for agencies. ``If you have 40 white couples chasing every white
newborn, you don't need a lesson in economics,'' Pierce said. ``The
only way to stay afloat is to reduce your charge for a black baby
and charge more for the white ones.''
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, unmarried, pregnant women did not have many
options. Some went to places like the Gladney Center in Fort Worth,
Texas or the Salvation Army's Booth homes, where they awaited birth
while social workers chose adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1973, the year that abortion was legalized, about 9
percent of births to unmarried women in the United States resulted
in adoptions. By 1981 that percentage dropped to 4 percent, and by
1988 to 2 percent. While the number of unmarried women giving birth
has risen each year at least since 1965, the net result is a slight
decline in the number of American-born infants available for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, according to a rough estimate by the adoption
council, about 1 million families are seeking to adopt. The
old-line agencies tried to adapt by letting birth mothers choose
adoptive parents. But in the late 1970s, would-be parents began
defecting to lawyers who could help them adopt independently if
they _ or the lawyers _ could find a birth mother directly. The
scramble also invited a new type of adoption agency, promising some
kind of edge.
</P>
<P>
   American Adoptions of Overland Park, Kan., for example, has a
``traditional program'' in which pregnant women choose from an
array of profiles of families, but it advises many clients to sign
up instead for another program in which parents pay directly for
advertisements, and young women who respond are shown the profile
of that family first. In its letter to applicants, the agency says:
``Most traditional adoption programs provide the birth parents with
the opportunity to select their `ideal' family. Where does that
leave you?''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing came naturally to Arty Elgart, who started a
facilitation service after he adopted his son (from Gladney) 20
years ago. It was a matter of enthusiasm and altruism: Working out
of his auto-parts warehouse in Philadelphia, he made matches as a
favor for couples he knew, or friends of friends. By most accounts,
including his own, no one had seen anything quite like it before.
Elgart placed a small newspaper ad that asked, ``PREGNANT? Young
couple wishes to adopt baby. Call Mary, 289-2229.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the sedate nonprofits that dominated the adoption
community, this crossed a line of propriety. Elgart's matchmaking
was legal, since he charged no fee and advertising was not
prohibited in Pennsylvania. But his marketing, which progressed to
benches, buses and Burger King tray liners, was called everything
from unusual to appalling.
</P>
<P>
   Elgart has long since turned his mission into a full-service
licensed adoption agency, named Golden Cradle, now in Cherry Hill,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Golden Cradle started something,'' said Maxine Chalker,
executive director of Adoptions from the Heart, of Wynnewood, Pa.
When she started her agency in 1984, she said, ``in the phone book
there were maybe three ads under Adoption Services. Now there must
be 40.''
</P>
<P>
   A modest display ad for Adoptions From the Heart is among them.
The agency also advertises on bus shelters and in malls, and has
tried radio and television, though the response was disappointing.
``We're always trying to find new things,'' Ms. Chalker said. ``It
gets harder every year because of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the competition comes from lawyers who handle
independent adoptions: ``Now everybody thinks adoption is easy
money, especially the attorneys,'' Ms. Chalker said. ``Now they're
hiring counselors to work in their offices, and setting up as
agencies without being licensed.''
</P>
<P>
   The frontier state for the adoption business is California. The
state has long permitted lawyers to recruit pregnant women. Now,
facilitation services, which are unlicensed, are also recruiting
and screening birth parents, as well as coaching prospective
parents and finding them professional help.
</P>
<P>
   Facilitators operate in many states. While their activities
often come close to legal definitions of child placement, they are
generally too new or too few to prompt regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, legislation enacted last year to clarify
their role ended up legitimizing a whole new class of
entrepreneurs. Lil Snee, a facilitator in Los Gatos who co-founded
an informal trade organization, estimates that 40 to 50 are
operating in the state.
</P>
<P>
   For Ellen Roseman, a facilitator in San Anselmo, the main job is
coaching prospective parents. ``I make them read everything,'' she
said. ``It's like taking a college course.'' Then she helps them
piece together deals with pregnant women, lawyers and agencies,
often in other states. She charges a flat fee of $3,450.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent support-group meeting at Ms. Roseman's house on a
winding lane in Marin County, casually dressed current and former
clients, many with babies in hand, exchanged stories of false
starts and disappointments. ``I think it will get easier with time
as people know what to expect, but for now, it's a free-for-all,''
said Riff, the father from Berkeley said over the potluck dinner
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Roseman, a former flight attendant and representative in
union negotiations, the enterprise is more like putting together a
business deal. ``You sit down and move around the pieces to do two
things,'' she said, ``to make sure it's legal and to save money.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Hicks, an adoption lawyer in Riverside, Calif., and the
author of ``Adopting in America'' (Wordslinger Press, 1995) calls
facilitators ``a garage industry,'' he said, ``not licensed nor
trained to do anything.'' He also finds their fees, which can
exceed $12,000, out of line. ``They find a baby for you,'' he said,
``then they have to turn it over to a lawyer or an agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snee, who lobbied for a licensing system to give
facilitators credibility, accepts that that only lawyers can
transact the actual adoption. But she argues: ``We get so bashed.
We provide a service, and just because it involves adoption doesn't
mean we should be the saviors of the world and do everything for
free.''
</P>
<P>
   For the old-line agencies, ``there are Catch-22's everywhere,''
said Pierce of the National Council for Adoption. They are torn
between the principle that children should not be discounted by
race or disability and the reality that that is how one creates a
larger pool of parents. They are torn between the principle that
parenthood should not be charged for and the reality that social
services are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gladney Center, fees do not come close to covering costs.
Thanks to its endowment and its large campus, where about half its
birth mothers live, Gladney can offer an array of services: three
dormitories, a health clinic, chapel, dining hall, swimming pool
and greenhouse, as well as high school and community college
courses, vocational training, legal representation and counseling
to be available for the rest of the birth mothers' lives.
</P>
<P>
   All of this costs the agency, on average, $32,000 per resident.
But Ms. Smith, the marketing coordinator, said the average
placement fee is $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many agencies, including Gladney, use sliding scales to
accommodate lower-income families. Still, Pierce said, ``the
economics of adoption is going to cause you to prefer the people
who pay the higher fee.''
</P>
<P>
   High fees help subsidize the work necessary to find homes for
hard-to-place children, at least in the agencies that undertake the
job, he said, adding that, in some states, agencies receive
``bounties'' to recruit adoptive families for children in foster
care or to place disabled children who are costly to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you have a kid who's HIV-positive in the hospital costing
$1,000 a day,'' Pierce said. ``To pay someone to find adoptive
parents is entirely reasonable, but what does that look like to the
public?''
</P>
<P>
   It may also look terrible to charge less to place minority or
special-needs children, but many agencies say they have little
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Gladney, for one, has a lower-cost program for African-American
and biracial children. ``Unfortunately, we had to create a separate
program because adoptive parents were simply not coming forward,''
Ms. Smith said. Under that program, the agency charges $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   In international adoption, the scramble is entirely different:
it is for parents. The Adoptive Families of America's current
``Guide to Adoption'' contains ads for 35 agencies, 33 of which
advertise foreign programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your child is waiting for you,'' the headline on one
announces. ``We go with you to China!''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the long-established agencies involved in international
adoptions have ``an altruistic, mission-driven sense that every
child deserves a family,'' Ms. Harder said. ``Now, with additional
programs opening up in Russia and China in particular, folks are
seeing it as an entrepreneurial venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoption experts say international adoptions have generated lots
of new businesses, from charitable, church-affiliated agencies to
walkup offices run by people who make money change hands in
Bulgaria. Fees to foreign expediters, translators, lawyers and
orphanages are usually beyond the control of the American-based
agencies that make the placements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many prospective parents, not wanting the uncertainty of
dealing with birth mothers, never even consider domestic adoption
seriously. Adoptions from foreign countries are expected to
approach 15,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the supply in foreign countries now exceeds the demand
here. Susan Soon-Keum Cox, director of public policy at Holt
International Children's Services in Eugene, Ore., said the
increase comes largely from Eastern Europe and China. Russia, which
had no program five years ago, placed more children last year than
any other country, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As recently as five or ten years ago, there were many more
parents waiting to adopt than there were children,'' said Ms. Cox,
whose agency has placed more than 100,000 children. ``Now that's
entirely turned around. We're searching for families.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Irvin, state director of Family Adoption Consultants in
Macedonia, Ohio, is uneasy about having more children than families
waiting for placement. ``There are some real tensions now between
the child focus and the consumer orientation, the human services
model and the market forces,'' she said. ``Some families start
looking for the cheapest, the fastest, the `we promise you a child
that meets your quote-unquote specifications in so many months.'
Some of us who have been in the field for 20 years get worried
about this shift.''

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Their play outfits and their faces scrubbed, they
bounded out of their caseworkers' cars at the North Ward Cultural
Center here, which was decked out on this late-summer Saturday with
a big striped tent worthy of a wedding. Twenty-one children, 4 to
12, were reporting for a party _ hamburgers and hot dogs, sack
races and musical chairs, bags of goodies to be collected.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, they were here to be seen. This party was what
the New Jersey Department of Human Services calls a ``match
event,'' and the honored guests were seven adults who had completed
orientation sessions for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   While couples around the nation, in their classified ads and
``dear birth mother'' letters, plead for a baby to love, the state
of New Jersey pleads for families to love these children:
8-year-old Saraelle, looking quizzical as she peered at grown-ups
through coke-bottle glasses; Nije, also 8, smile blazing, busily
tugging his caseworker around; the brothers Milo and Omar, 12 and
10, sticking together all day, Omar in a royal blue t-shirt and
Milo in a red one that announced, ``The children are our future.''
</P>
<P>
   They were among about 100 children in foster care or group homes
who have no immediate prospects for families. The Division of Youth
and Family Services is campaigning on their behalf, with a $600,000
recruitment budget that the state provided last year and renewed
this summer: It has ads on buses and billboards, in public service
announcements and on flyers to be mailed with motor-vehicle renewal
forms. The children's pictures and profiles are published in a
glossy book (call 1-800-99-ADOPT). These are also on a web site
(http://206.228.220.32/njadopt_static/), which will soon have audio
and video clips.
</P>
<P>
   The department places about 700 children a year in permanent
homes, 85 percent to 90 percent of them ``special needs'' children
whose care continues to be subsidized: adoptive families are given
the same monthly stipend that foster parents receive until the
child is 18. Still, there are never enough parents. Donna Younkin,
the administrator of the adoption office, said New Jersey's state's
foster care population had grown 56 percent since 1994; ``we're
closing in on 3,000 kids,'' she said. Once adoptive parents are
interested and qualified, Ms. Younkin said, the social events are
among the happier methods of promoting matches. ``People get queasy
about it and say, isn't this terrible and awkward? But the kids
have a nice day out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Newark party, the hovering social workers acknowledged
the hopes and fears in play here. ``They know why they're here,''
said Zavier Mauldin. Some of them, he said, ``have been through
this over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospective parents were nervous themselves, with the
possible exception of Kendra Orta, a day-care worker, and her
husband, Orlando, who quickly fell in with bunches of kids. ``I'm
22 and my husband is 25,'' Mrs. Orta said. ``We want a family. We
decided to go this route first.'' The Ortas just moved to a
two-bedroom apartment and outfitted the bigger bedroom for their
first two children. ``We have one picked out, and we came here to
get another one,'' said Orta, a security guard who has already
advised his boss that the four-year-old boy they hope to bring home
soon will be spending time with him at work.
</P>
<P>
   Luce Ramirez, 48, who lives near the Ortas in East Orange, was
making plans for a daughter: ``I've got the school picked out, Our
Lady of Mount Carmel -- good Catholic discipline. Is this
obsessive? I already know what pediatrician to go to. I got the
name of a pediatric dentist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous,'' she added. ``I'm trying really hard not to let
my hopes get too high. What if I fall in love with this child, and
this child doesn't want any part of me?'' she mused, referring to
the face-to-face meetings that follow in the match-making.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children, they understand, need a lot of healing.
It's a point made in the children's biographies: ``Behaviors which
Taiesha struggles with are enuresis, hiding food and acting out as
a result of past abuse,'' one says. The description of Naim, a
``mannerly and very likable'' 13-year old, notes that other
children ``have teased and ridiculed him, taken advantage of him
and even physically attacked him because of his thick glasses, poor
motor skills and low academic performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But this party was short on burdens. After the sack races and
lunch warm-up, the cupcake decorating and water-balloon lobbing, it
reached a crescendo with a boisterous musical chairs scramble to
the boom-box accompaniment of Kirk Franklin's ``Stomp.''
</P>
<P>
   As they left, the adults filled out forms on which they could
name one or two children they wanted to know more about, and
perhaps to meet again. Altogether, the seven chose 10 children.

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 ADVERTISING: A MIDLIFE CRISIS FOR SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, advertisers and agencies could confidently assume
that sports would bring them the kinds of consumers they so
ardently desired: millions of men who usually limited their own
athletic pursuits to dashing to the store to buy whatever products
were sponsoring the games played by their favorite teams.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, sports coverage has been delivering marketers more
air balls and fumbles than slam dunks and touchdowns. That could
cost the media millions of dollars later if fading interest
requires them to lower their advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Even as fans debated last week whether the 1998 Yankees were the
best team ever, for example, ratings for the 1998 World Series were
the worst ever _ below even those for the 1989 Oakland-San
Francisco series, which was disrupted for 10 days by an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   So far, viewership for most National Football League games,
through eight weeks of the 1998-99 season, is down. Even the
venerable ``Monday Night Football'' on ABC has seen its ratings
slump 9 percent from last season.
</P>
<P>
   And marketers hoping to reach hoops fans have been left dangling
by a labor dispute that has canceled the first two weeks of
National Basketball Association games and threatens the entire
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports as an advertising and marketing vehicle is going
through a midlife crisis,'' said David Verklin, chief executive at
Carat North America in New York, a unit of Aegis Group PLC that
buys time and space for marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ad people have so fallen in love with sports that they assume
no matter what you buy, it will be fantastic,'' Verklin added.
``But sports does not have unlimited viewer loyalty, unlimited
program capacity or unlimited price elasticity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Igiel, a top executive at the media agency owned by the
giant Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports was once impervious, but some of its cachet may have
disappeared,'' said Igiel, who is executive vice president and
director for U.S. broadcast at the Media Edge unit of Y&AMP;R in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports has held up better than most programming,'' he added,
``but it's now suffering some of the same erosion of viewership
that everything else on television has.''
</P>
<P>
   Igiel described himself as especially concerned about the
interruption of the NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just throwing my hands up,'' he said, because the viewers
lost with the disappearance of pro basketball will be ``very tough
to replace.'' That is particularly true for men ages 18 to 34, a
demographic group that is watching less prime-time television.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Solomon, president for national broadcast and sports
marketing at SFM Media in New York, a media agency owned by Havas
Advertising, said, ``We're not abandoning sports, but we may be
buying it less.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the agony of defeat is not entirely overwhelming the
thrill of victory for sports advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never say that we're at a point where sports are less
attractive,'' said John Muszynski, executive director for the
national television buying group at Starcom Media Services, a unit
of Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sports is no longer sure-fire, guaranteed,'' Muszynski
said, particularly for advertisers coveting men ages 18 to 24 as
well as 18 to 34. ``It's a tougher time.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side for sports, Anheuser-Busch Inc. decided last
week to extend its sponsorship of Major League Baseball so that
Budweiser remained the ``official beer'' of the league, the
all-star game and the World Series through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of News Corp. owes advertisers
an estimated $15 million in ``make-good'' commercials because the
World Series did not go to five games, the network is charging _
and getting _ record prices for Super Bowl XXXIII in January. Each
30-second spot is going for $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   And American Football Conference games are drawing more viewers
this year, when they are being broadcast by CBS, than they did last
year, when they were on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Some factors curbing the appeal of sports may be short-term
problems. The football season, for example, has so far been marred
by mismatches like that between the defending Super Bowl-champion
Denver Broncos and the Philadelphia Eagles on Oct. 4, in which the
Broncos drubbed the hapless Eagles, 41-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is going through a cycle where the major-market teams
are not performing that well,'' said Neal Pilson, president at
Pilson Communications, a sports television consulting company in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal problem the NFL is dealing with is the collapse
of teams in Chicago, Washington and Philadelphia,'' he said. ``And
the late-season strength of baseball took a little bite out of
football.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in ratings for ``Monday Night Football'' is being
attributed in part to its time slot this season having changed, to
8 p.m. in the East rather than 9 p.m., in the hopes of pulling in a
larger audience during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Showing football ``when it's 5 o'clock in Los Angeles and 7
o'clock in Chicago was a calculated risk,'' Igiel said. And the
earlier start pits Monday football against wrestling shows on cable
television that are increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Muszynski said, ``I don't consider wrestling a sport, but it's
definitely a choice for young men for entertainment, and it's doing
great.''
</P>
<P>
   A problem for one sport may even be an opportunity for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the NBA not around, people may pour money into
football,'' said Vince Wladika, a spokesman for the Fox Sports unit
of Fox Broadcasting in New York. His network broadcasts National
Football Conference games.
</P>
<P>
   As Verklin, the Carat North America chief, put it, ``Sports is
still a desirable property'' because ``a sporting event is the
final place where Americans gather around the television all at one
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the very success of sports in the past is a primary reason
for its difficulties now, Verklin asserted, because the number of
sporting events has proliferated as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that there's an unlimited capacity for
anything having to do with sports,'' Verklin said, ``an attitude of
`If you produce it, they will consume it.' And that's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The seasons for traditional sports are longer. The pre- and
postgame shows on television are longer. Other sports, like auto
racing, are adding more events. And activities ranging from women's
basketball and the coming Women's World Cup soccer tournament to
the so-called extreme sports offer new games to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Some old-time sports are even making comebacks; the Nashville
Network cable channel owned by CBS Corp. is reviving roller derby
in January with a weekly two-hour ``Roller Jam'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a trend toward a sports glut,'' said Ron Fredrick,
executive director for the national broadcast group at J. Walter
Thompson USA in New York, an agency owned by WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have to get used to similar ratings numbers in the
sports area that we have been getting used to in prime time,'' he
added, referring to the declining viewership of entertainment fare
as choices multiply.
</P>
<P>
   Igiel of the Media Edge gave another reason for the blows to the
hegemony of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now lots of other activities going on in people's
lives,'' he said, from using computers to playing video games to
even participating in sports rather than passively watching them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Solomon of SFM Media predicted further erosion of
interest in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was weaned on sports, but young people have other things to
do,'' he said. ``So sports will continue to decline as they grow up
without being committed sports fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Another theory involves the transformation of sports into big
business. Upheavals in the pro leagues range from higher salaries
and labor unrest to abrupt franchise moves and free agency's
weakening of the ties between fans and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans are fed up,'' said Jeffrey Steinhour, vice president and
account service director at Crispin Porter &AMP; Bogusky, a Miami ad
agency. ``We need to get back to the roots of what motivates
athletes, back to the authenticity of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Crispin Porter is creating a $4 million campaign for the And 1
brand of basketball shoes that will proceed despite the forced
timeout in NBA play. The ads will be focused on ``the basketball
fan and player at the core of the sport,'' said Steinhour, who said
he was unswayed by ``the endorsement deals, the hype, the
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the increased fees that networks must pay for rights
to broadcast games are a factor, too. The costs are typically
passed on to advertisers in the form of higher prices for
commercials. That leads their agencies to search for alternate ways
to garner audiences and ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not going to get 15s anymore,'' said Fredrick of
Thompson USA, referring to a rating indicating that 15 percent of
all television sets are tuned to a certain program, ``we can buy
three 5's or four 4's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I long for the days of three choices,'' he added. ``Now there
are a hundred.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, the SFM Media executive, who is a former president of
Busch Media, the in-house media arm of Anheuser-Busch, echoed
Fredrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone to much more cable TV this year than we have ever
gone to before,'' he said. Among the networks on which he is buying
more commercial time are those ``that deliver high numbers of
men,'' he added, like the History Channel and the Discovery
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job used to be easy and glamorous,'' Solomon said with a
chuckle. ``Now it's work.''

 By JANET STITES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Scott Kurnit, the founder and chief executive of
the Mining Co., ever finds himself feeling insignificant or
questioning his new business endeavor, he can bolster his
self-esteem by catching the F train from his offices in midtown
Manhattan to SoHo and there gaze upon his company's latest
marketing effort: a giant mural on a building on Houston Street
near Broadway touting ``miningco.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Cater-cornered to the famous DKNY ad, the mural is just one
piece of evidence that New York companies like his that deal with
Internet-related media are beginning to understand the need to
promote their online brands in the off-line world.
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Co., an Internet search engine that offers personal
guides to Web sites, joins such other companies as iVillage, N2K,
theglobe.com and Connecticut-based priceline.com that have recently
undertaken national advertising blitzes _ broadcast, cable TV,
outdoor and print _ intended to make their brands household names,
the likes of ESPN or (dare they wish) Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of these companies existed five years ago. Nor did their
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, iVillage advertises its Women's Network on several cable TV
channels.
</P>
<P>
   N2K, which agreed last week to merge with its biggest
competitor, CDNow, has its own huge billboards in Times Square and
on Sunset Strip in Hollywood for its Web-based retail business,
Music Boulevard. It also introduced a broadcast, cable and radio
campaign during the Grammy Awards show this year.
</P>
<P>
   Theglobe.com invested $8 million to plaster its logo on
everything from bus stops to cable to the T-shirt of a waiter in
SoHo at the trendy Jerry's restaurant, a popular lunch spot for
Silicon Alley denizens.
</P>
<P>
   All these companies have established a presence on the World
Wide Web through banner advertising and strategic relationships
with other sites. But to build the critical mass they have promised
their investors _ and in the case of N2K, its shareholders _ they
must have a presence in the nonvirtual world, too. Survival demands
that they drive traffic to their Web sites to increase ``viewer
impressions,'' the count of how many times the pages on a site are
seen.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Mining Co., iVillage and theglobe.com are focusing
most of their advertising dollars on markets with a ``wired''
population, primarily New York, San Francisco, Boston and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, an airline ticket broker in Stamford, Conn., has
taken a more ambitious and focused approach. Eschewing TV and
online advertising, the 6-month-old company has spent $20 million
to buy national radio spots featuring William Shatner and full-page
ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know about us before they get on line,''
said Jay Walker, priceline.com's founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   To Walker, radio and newspapers are the most efficient media for
his particular brand because ``you don't need a lot of pictures or
motion to convey'' his company's simple message, that ``as long as
you're flexible, you can name your price on an airline ticket, a
car or, shortly, a hotel room.''
</P>
<P>
   James Dettore, chief executive of Brand Institute, a New York
consulting firm, says the cost of creating an online brand for
Internet companies is inherently cheaper than creating a brand for,
say, cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, companies will spend 8 to 10 percent of their
budget on marketing,'' Dettore said. But he contends that Internet
companies have two advantages over others: The medium is global,
and it is fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, it takes 15 to 20 years to establish a
megabrand,'' Dettore said. ``The software industry _ Microsoft,
Dell and Gateway _ accelerated this to three to five years. And
Internet brands are growing even faster.'' Even so, he says,
building a national brand is expensive, costing ``anywhere from $50
million to $100 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is finding an efficient way to allocate limited
resources. iVillage has raised some $67 million in capital _ an
impressive amount but not nearly enough to cover the cost of
building the brand, developing the product and meeting payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Co. has raised about $20 million, as has
theglobe.com, which filed for a public offering in July.
Priceline.com has raised $52 million, and N2K has raised more than
$160 million through two public offerings and private financing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Internet companies often find it hard to accept the vague,
imprecise measurements of a campaign's effectiveness in traditional
media.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Newman, N2K's vice president for marketing, advertising
and sales, describes the frustration of assigning a value to a
brand's image _ and of conveying that value to her bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has become a response-based, customer acquisition
buy,'' she said. ``It's become pretty scientific. We can count how
many customers we acquired for every banner we place.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, she said, ``The off-line advertising is more
intangible, but it builds confidence and trust in our virtual
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, Ms. Newman has larger, equally intangible,
problems to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   With the N2K-CDNow merger, the brand she has worked so hard to
create may become obsolete if the management of the newly formed
company deems CDNow, or an entirely new name, more valuable than
N2K or its Music Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Diamond, co-founder of N2K and chairman of the new company,
said Friday: ``We have agreed to a process to work with senior
management and consultants to assess our brand equities and a third
brand. We'll continue to market our respective services through the
holiday season.''
</P>

   If all goes as planned, the merger will be complete in January
and the new name _ and new branding campaign _ will be announced

   Back down in SoHo, Kurnit of the Mining Co. has issues of his
own. Just days after the paint dried on his mural, the gasoline
station in front of the building where it resides sold its air
rights to a billboard company. Now, a cigarette ad blocks a part of
the Mining Co.'s mural _ and perhaps its chance to make a fleeting
impression amid the noise.

FRETTING OVER A MAGAZINE RECESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is safe to say that the mood of the conference sponsored by
the Magazine Publishers of America in Orlando, Fla., last week was
one of caution.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 800 publishers, editors, subscription agents,
advertising directors and investment bankers who gathered at the
conference expressed trepidation about the potential for sluggish
advertising sales in 1999; they were concerned about the European
and Asian economies and how the downturn of those economies will
affect marketers' budgets; they sweated over newsstand
consolidation, which is making distribution more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are generally feeling scared to pessimistic about next
year,'' said Michael Lafavore, the editor in chief of Men's Health,
which is published by Rodale Press.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to be too gloomy in a world where most people
wear mouse ears and there's a 60-foot-high plaster swan perched
atop the neighboring hotel. Disney World, the Walt Disney Co.
flagship where the conference was held, does not provide the most
serious environment for thought-provoking, chin-in-hand discourse.
</P>
<P>
   So while Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, spoke gravely
about the economy (``the global economy is rooted in deep political
imbalances,'' was one phrase), some found it difficult to regard
him as soberly as they would have had he been speaking from a U.N.
podium. He was, after all, at the Disney Yacht and Beach Resort,
and remember, this is central Florida _ with no places to anchor a
genuine yacht and no beaches, save for the Disney-manufactured
ones, upon which to sun.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees could watch Steven Brill, the editor of Brill's
Content, and Norman Pearlstine, editor-in-chief of Time Inc.,
debate the issues raised by the CNN Tailwind controversy, typical
enough fare for a magazine convention.
</P>
<P>
   But this conference also featured a unique combination: the
chance to speculate about the economy, and the chance to watch an
animated cartoon in a screening room in the base of an enormous,
fake baobab tree at Animal Kingdom. While Michael Clinton, senior
vice president and chief marketing officer for Hearst Magazines,
shared his concerns with other publishers on a panel, he also got
to ride Space Mountain for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that 1997 and 1998 were such stellar years for the
magazine industry that it was natural for publishers to wonder how
long the good times would last, especially after the recent
fluctuations in the stock market. It has been a good decade, over
all. In 1997, magazine advertisers spent more than $12.7 billion in
the publications tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau; in
1990, they spent only $6.7 billion. In 1997, magazine advertising
pages topped 231,000, according to the Publishers Information
Bureau _ up 35 percent from 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all asking ourselves, `How high is high?''' Clinton
said. ``So as we look around at all the global markets, it keeps us
very concerned about next year. Certainly, I think that the market
in the last week or two has been encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   The real tell-tale sign will be retail sales this Christmas
season, he said, ``because that's a great barometer of consumer
confidence, and when consumers are spending, marketers will feel
more comfortable about increasing their spending.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lafavore expressed concern about the 12 international editions
of his magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to worry about only one economy,'' he said. ``Now I
have to worry about a whole bunch of them. Certainly, in Russia we
launched less than a year ago and we came in late to a booming
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafavore said that he was also concerned about the editions his
company publishes in Peru, Colombia and Mexico. ``And we were
talking about starting up in Brazil, but things have taken a turn
for the worse there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Reilly, chairman and chief executive of Primedia, which
is controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., the buyout firm,
shocked some guests by saying in the conference's closing speech
that he welcomed a recession because it might allow him to snatch
up some new properties.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Phillips III, an investment banker with Da Silva &AMP;
Phillips, suggested another benefit of downturns. ``A recession
tends to lead to a shake-out,'' he said. ``There are probably too
many magazines, and after a recession you would have fewer
magazines. In some markets, you might have eight competitors where
you should only have four or five.'' When those extra magazines
close, he said, they stop diluting the ad market for the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Michael Kelly, the editor of National Journal, summed up
the conference's surreality most eloquently, if half-jokingly.
Kelly said that holding the publishers' conference at Disney World
was ``akin to that sensation you get when you're standing at the
edge of a vast ocean, and people always say that kind of moment
puts your life in perspective. You realize you're one small
mortal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Disney effect like that,'' he continued. ``All these
people are going to panels and earnestly discussing the magazine
industry and brilliant launches and how to conduct research, but at
the same time you're surrounded by this endless Disney world that
goes on forever all around you. And you begin to get this feeling.
What does all of this matter? In five years, Disney will just own
us anyway. We'll all just be another subsidiary.''

AUDIENCE LEFT WONDERING AS RADIO HOST DISAPPEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)  (js) 
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Extra-dimensional beings, disasters foretold and government
conspiracies are standard fare on Art Bell's late-night radio talk
show. In the last two weeks, though, the host provided listeners
with a mystery of his own, signing off his nationally syndicated
program in the small hours of Oct. 13 by saying that a
life-threatening event meant this would be his last broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed listeners, who apparently thought Bell was in physical
danger, called a sheriff's office near the host's isolated desert
home and studio in Pahrump, Nev. The sheriff, Wade Lieseke Jr.,
found him safe and unharmed. ``It's got nothing to do with
government threats or aliens,'' Lieseke said. ``It's been taken way
out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   But the broadcast by the nation's fourth-most-listened-to radio
host set off a two-week whirl of conspiracy theories and
counter-theories. Many of Bell's 6 million weekly listeners started
phoning and faxing the 400 affiliates nationwide that carried his
five-hour nightly marathon. In radio industry circles, cynics
sniped that the broadcast was a hoax to break a contract or to lay
the groundwork for an increase in advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, the editor of the online publication Ufoseek
declared that Bell quit rather than compromise over the program's
creative control. One satirist put out a mocking news article
reporting that Bell was abducted by aliens and that President
Clinton had ordered a Delta Force rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   Bell solved a portion of the mystery last Friday night, saying
he would return this Wednesday to the broadcast, acquired earlier
this year for $10 million by Jacor Communications Inc. ``While all
the difficulties that caused me to so unexpectedly and quickly
leave the air haven't been resolved yet, they remain as grave as
any family could face,'' he said in a prerecorded segment played
during his show, which has been broadcast since Oct. 13 with a
substitute host.
</P>
<P>
   But the mystery continues to the extent that he has declined to
elaborate on his crisis, saying its disclosure would only make
matters worse. ``This was not a hoax or a stunt,'' Bell said.
``This was and is a family crisis, period.''
</P>
<P>
   As Orson Welles' famous ``War of the Worlds'' broadcast in
October 1938 proved, radio listeners can mistake fiction for fact.
Bell's audience may have jumped to fanciful conclusions because his
talk-show topics are the equivalent of urban campfire stories, said
Walter Sabo, a talk-radio programming consultant in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was a deejay doing a normal show and said, `I have to
take time off for my family,' no one would notice,'' Sabo said.
``Coming out of his mouth, we assume it's aliens.''

EDITORS DELAY GOAL ON DIVERSITY AND ADD A CONCERN FOR WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Kan.)   (jw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After six months of intensive discussions about the extent to
which newsrooms fail to reflect the ethnic diversity of the
country, the governing board of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors agreed last week that ``the nation's newsrooms must reflect
the racial diversity of American society by 2025 or sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   The board, which met in Miami, also agreed to include women in
its annual census of newsrooms, an attempt to monitor the extent to
which a ``glass ceiling'' prevents them from rising to the highest
positions in American newsrooms. Until now, the 20-year-old census
has tracked only employment and general job categories for black,
Asian-American, Hispanic and Native American employees. Some board
members had expressed concern that adding women could distract from
the goal of increasing the number of minority journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The society, made up of 860 editors from around the country, has
no power to force any of its members to pursue its goals.
Nevertheless, the reconsideration of the goals and timetables
established by the group in 1978 was an emotionally charged
process, in part because it was increasingly clear that the
original goal _ ethnic parity of newsroom populations with the
country at large by 2000 _was unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the goal was set, only about 4 percent of newsroom
employees were from minority groups and it was anticipated that 15
percent of the national population would be minorities in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of 1998, the society's census showed that
minority journalists made up 11.5 percent of newsroom employees.
But minorities comprise about 26 percent of the national
population.
</P>
<P>
   The new goal is considered ambitious by some in the profession
who point to an annual attrition rate of about 10 percent in
newsrooms and to the difficulty in attracting minority students to
journalism schools. Edward Seaton, society president and editor of
The Manhattan (Kan.) Mercury, said in a statement, ``In the end, we
will be measured as much for our efforts as for our aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's new mission statement also calls for setting
benchmarks and monitoring progress every three years in such areas
as reducing turnover among minority employees and increasing
minority scholarships and internships.

HIGHER-SPEED INTERNET STANDARD IS APPROVED
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as Microsoft battles the U.S. government, it can celebrate
an incremental victory in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months ago, Microsoft, Compaq Computer and Intel joined
with the large local phone companies in an effort to enable
consumers to receive Internet data over regular telephone lines at
speeds much faster than now possible.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the consortium achieved its initial goal: winning
preliminary approval of its technical standard from the
International Telecommunications Union, a U.N. group. The
technology is known as digital subscriber line, or DSL. The version
of DSL that won approval promises to deliver 1.5 million bits of
data to homes every second.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that it took the computing and communications
industries about two years to settle on a universal standard for
modems that deliver 56,000 bits a second, the industry consensus on
DSL was quite a quick step.
</P>
<P>
   But the phone companies must continue to step lively if they are
to beat back the threat to their future posed by cable modems.
There may be half a million people using cable modems for access to
the Internet over cable television systems, while only a fraction
of that number use DSL technology.
</P>
<P>
   The new standard will allow consumers to install the advanced
modems without help from a technician. Many cable modems require
expert help for installation. The consortium hopes to have the
modems in stores by the middle of next year, priced about $150.

AN ADORED FANTASY SERIES NOW HINTS AT 1990S ANGST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been almost two years since I was last summoned to the
land of Andor or asked to contemplate the conspiracies tearing
apart Tar Valon. In that time, I have hardly given a thought to
Darkfriends and the Forsaken, to the Dragon Reborn or the Age of
Legends. And the manners and mythologies of the desert-dwelling
Aiel or the seafaring Seanchan have come to seem the
half-remembered stuff of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But having already read almost 6,000 pages about these
fantastical lands and beings, who could turn away from another mere
600 in ``The Path of Daggers'' (Tor/Doherty), the newly published
eighth and far-from-last volume in Robert Jordan's ``Wheel of
Time'' fantasy epic? More than 7 million copies of these tomes have
been sold in North America; more than 100,000 copies of each volume
are sold in paperback each year, and the series is translated into
16 languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wheel'' demands an almost religious attention from its readers
and seems to get it. There is an Internet Usenet group devoted to
speculations about its plot lines and its puzzles, its female
priesthood and its Messianic figure who may well destroy the known
world before he saves it. The glossaries and plot summaries found
on various Internet sites are almost required reading before
picking up this latest volume, which assumes that after two years
of ordinary life one retains an intimate acquaintance with these
varied cultures, their ancient tongues, magical powers, political
intrigues and a multicultural cast of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The younger devotees of the series, who seem to be legion, have
a habit of dutifully rereading the complete gospel before each
addition.
</P>
<P>
   I assumed, in fact, that those on the cusp of adulthood formed
the core of this audience. I was, after all, inducted into the
first volume, ``The Eye of the World,'' on the urgings of one of my
children.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a coming of age quality to the entire series, in
which innocents are gradually led into the heart of esoteric
knowledge. One also has to suspend some well-honed critical
faculties when entering this odd realm, as if the reader had agreed
to become engrossed in a decade-long strategic game whose rules are
unfolding in the midst of play and whose end will not be in sight
before the millennium's end. Abandon reality, all ye who enter
here.
</P>
<P>
   Escape is, after all, one of the appealing aspects of fantasy
fiction, a genre spawned by J.R.R. Tolkien, and now dominated by
Jordan. Fantasy creates a world with a seemingly autonomous set of
laws, establishes premises for its invented cultures, makes sharp
boundaries between Good and Evil and then sets the wheels in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy fiction is mechanical (and characters can become cogs),
but it is also magical, evoking a realm of lost knowledge. Power is
at stake, and out of struggles for power come cataclysmic battles.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that Jordan, who was in New York last week to
begin promoting his new book, was drawn to the genre with its
mixture of system and strategy. He received a degree in physics at
the Citadel in South Carolina and served two tours of duty in
Vietnam, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross and other medals.
``Wheel'' draws on both his abstract knowledge and concrete
experience; he creates a universe simple enough to master and then
challenges the characters to do the same in meticulously
choreographed battles against chaos and dissolution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, readers have taken the challenge so seriously that
there are some who, in New Agish devotion, think the books really
are histories of alternative realities. In an interview, Jordan
mentioned one Malaysian medical student who expressed a desire to
abandon his training in order to become the author's spiritual
disciple. He was swiftly discouraged.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But fantasy fiction, for all its artificial premises and
cartoonish book jackets, is not as simple as it seems, nor is its
audience. The 450 cognoscenti who turned out for Jordan's book
signing at a Barnes &AMP; Noble last week were not easily classifiable
by age. His publisher claims a broad spread of readers, and Jordan
tells of a letter he received from an 88-year-old fan who urged him
to write faster.
</P>
<P>
   And Jordan, who on the book jacket gives off the aura of a
self-styled character who would not be out of place among the
itinerant wanderers and warriors of the books, in real-world flesh
is more like a slightly eccentric Southern storyteller who reads
Dorothy Sayers and Jared Diamond, Louis L'Amour and Jane Austen;
who is both proud and a bit wary of the fanaticism of his
followers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what may be most interesting is how his books,
particularly this one, strain against the limitations of the
fantasy epic. The genre's standard setting is a pre-modern, even
medieval universe, with guilds and taverns, horse-drawn carts and
monasteries. It is governed not by technology or science, but by
myth and faith and custom.
</P>
<P>
   This pastoral world, with its clans, villages and shires, may
have already lost some of its ancient wisdom, but it is about to
lose much more: the forces of Darkness are massing. That great
enemy also resembles what we think of as modernity. It has no
patience for long apprenticeship and mastery. It supplants the
subtleties of magic with the brutalities of power. It promises
disintegration and chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In this way the genre is atavistic; nation building and
tradition are its themes. But it is also mournful and resigned,
recognizing that even as Darkness is fended off transformations are
inevitable. The evils that modernity threatens may be overcome, but
nothing will be left untouched. The genre's founding masterworks by
Tolkien, who fought in World War I, were begun on the eve of
Britain's entry into World War II and are fraught with nostalgia.
Jordan, the Vietnam vet, is creating an American, late-20th-century
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   But something different is also happening in Jordan's series,
where nostalgia is replaced by somberness. The latest book in
particular would hardly stand as fantasy fiction on its own. There
has even been some early, qualified complaint among fans that
intrigue is getting the upper hand as the saga turns inward. More
than any other of his volumes, it is less concerned with the battle
of good and evil than with chronicling the social transformations
being wrought by the approaching apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Cultures long isolated are coming into contact. The courtly
hierarchies of one are challenged by the clans and strict rituals
of another or the institutional pride of a third. Ancient
traditions of inheritance and leadership are undone. Refugees,
traitors, traders and soldiers permanently scar the social
landscape. All this is taking place at the very moment when unity
is most needed to defeat a demonic enemy. But even if unity is
achieved, the old ways will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if, in the midst of spinning his web, Jordan had turned
fantasy fiction into a game of anthropological Risk played out in
the post-modern age. There are precedents: even the Wizard Gandalf
must unite the disparate forces of Tolkien's Middle Earth to defeat
Mordor. But in the ``Wheel of Time,'' the promise of the great
battles, which are still a book or two or three away, is less a
matter of fantasy than of surety, for even in victory what will
remain will be a world as messy, unsettled and full of cultural
conflict as our own.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In six days, the nation begins the
government-mandated changeover to digital broadcasting _ a
transition with no real precedent.
</P>
<P>
   No other national technological transition has ever been backed
by this sort of government decree. Nobody was forced to trade a
horse for an automobile, a Victrola for a radio, a typewriter for a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   But this change will eventually affect almost every household in
the nation. Sometime in the next decade or so, by federal mandate,
today's television stations will go off the air, to be replaced by
all-digital stations. At that point, everyone will need a digital
receiver to continue watching television.
</P>
<P>
   The change will enable viewers to receive vividly sharper and
clearer television images. But digital television receivers also
hold the potential to enrich the medium with user interaction of
the sort now available on computers.
</P>
<P>
   Cataclysmic as the shift may seem, however, when the transition
begins on Sunday _ and for a good number of months to come _ it
will be exceedingly hard to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, more than three dozen stations intend to begin some sort of
digital broadcasts on Sunday or in the days that follow. And ABC
plans to broadcast the first network high-definition program on
Sunday evening _ the 1996 remake of the Disney film ``101
Dalmatians.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect many people actually to see the HDTV pictures.
About two-thirds of the nation's television households receive
their programs by cable, and the cable industry is fighting hard to
avert any federal requirement that they transmit the broadcast
networks' digital programming.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, despite promises by broadcasters and manufacturers
over the last year, hardly any digital HDTV receivers are on sale
today. As the transition begins, broadcasters will offer only the
tiniest amount of high-definition programming _ probably fewer than
five hours most weeks from all five major television networks
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Television manufacturers and many broadcasters have long argued
that HDTV, the premium service that digital broadcasting can offer,
will be the primary feature motivating people to buy digital sets.
Nonetheless, for the foreseeable future, most networks and local
stations will simply be transmitting digital versions of their
regular programs with no increase in the resolution, though digital
broadcasting does, by itself, improve the quality of the picture a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   At least 42 stations nationwide will begin digital broadcasting
in November, many of them starting on Sunday morning. The National
Association of Broadcasters trumpeted the number at a news
conference earlier this month, since it is nearly double the number
of stations that promised the Federal Communications Commission
last year to begin broadcasting now. The FCC had pushed 23 stations
in the 10 largest cities to go on the air by Nov. 1 so that
consumers would have a reason to buy the first high-definition sets
during the Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   One digital station, WCBS, will start up in New York on Sunday.
Four other stations will start on Sunday or soon after, one each in
Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington. And a
scattering of additional stations will begin on Sunday or soon
after in 18 other cities, including Honolulu, Milwaukee and
Jackson, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The head of one of those stations, Terry Shockley, president of
Shockley Communications, owner of WKOW, an ABC affiliate in
Madison, Wis., said, ``We are prepared and ready on Nov. 1 to carry
the first high-definition programming,'' the ``101 Dalmatians''
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers with conventional sets will be able to watch the ABC
movie, as usual. Only viewers with new digital television receivers
will be able to receive the high-definition version. For several
years, digital broadcasts will be transmitted over a second channel
that each station has received on loan from the FCC. Eventually,
stations will be able to use only a single digital channel _ and
consumers will then have no choice but to use digital sets.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, television manufacturers _ which have much more
to gain from this transition than broadcasters do _ have fallen
behind in the rollout schedule. Only one manufacturer, Mitsubishi,
has begun delivering HDTV receivers to stores, and most of the
stores are using those $7,000 sets as display models, taking orders
from customers who want to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, several network leaders grumbled that their first
broadcasts faced a ``tree falling in the forest'' problem. The
momentous start of digital broadcasting will be seen by perhaps a
smattering of consumers who may have bought sets as well as a
handful of industry executives and others who have been lent
prototype receivers by the manufacturers. That is one reason the
networks are making no great effort to broadcast high-definition
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be able to count our viewers on our fingers
and toes,'' said Martin Franks, a senior vice president for CBS.
``It's fairly clear that there are more transmitters than receivers
at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Production costs are another consideration. To create a
high-definition version of a movie for television, for example, a
studio must transfer the film to a videotape with a high-definition
recorder, a process that costs about $100,000 a film. ``We don't
want to spend money on high-definition movies unless there's
someone out there to watch them,'' said Charles Jablonski, an NBC
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has no firm plans to broadcast any high-definition
programming in the next few weeks, except ``maybe a movie,
`Twister,' sometime in November,'' Jablonski said. The rest of the
program day will be filled with digital duplicates of the
programming being broadcast on the network's conventional analog
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Analog transmissions, so-called because they use electronic
signals analogous to lightwaves and soundwaves, have long been the
technology used in television. For much of the early days of
digital broadcasting at NBC, the analog signal will be run through
a device that converts it to the precise digital form that is known
to the computing world and that in the process also improves the
resolution, simulating a high-definition picture.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some local stations for the other networks also plan similarly
to ``upconvert'' their analog programming to simulate HDTV.
Simulated HDTV programs, however, will not be of the same quality
as those that actually originate in high definition.
</P>
<P>
   CBS intends to broadcast four of this season's National Football
League games in high definition, the first on Nov. 8, a New York
Jets-Buffalo Bills game _ but only in the area around New York
City. One other high-definition CBS broadcast is planned: the Nov.
18 episode of the medical drama ``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, CBS has been the loudest proponent of
HDTV, and early this year the network promised to broadcast five
hours of it each week at the start. But Franks explained: ``We
decided to put our energies into the live broadcast of football
games rather than sitcoms. We think that will be more effective.''
As it is, CBS is the only network with current plans to offer any
live high-definition broadcasts. Since those broadcasts require
high-definition cameras and a host of related equipment, they are
much more expensive and complicated to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the network owned by News Corp., plans no high-definition
programming in the coming months. Long resistant to the whole idea
of HDTV, Fox executives early this year unsuccessfully lobbied
Congress to drop its insistence that broadcasters offer it.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Lawrence Jacobson, the network's president,
said only, ``We're working with some of our movie suppliers, and I
think we will have some high-definition programming in the
broadcast year,'' which runs through the spring. Until then, the
network will simply convert its conventional analog programs to
digital form. Fox plans no other enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   PBS stations are not required to begin digital broadcasting
until 2003. Nonetheless, seven of them say they will begin
broadcasting next month. On Nov. 9, the network plans to offer its
first high-definition program, a documentary about a glass blower
in Venice. PBS says that show will kick off ``digital week,''
featuring several special digital shows and World Wide Web site
offerings. Afterward, Ervin Duggan, the network's president, said,
PBS stations will broadcast one HDTV show a month.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, ABC has the fullest high-definition schedule.
Last year, the network got in trouble with Congress when its
president at the time, Preston Padden, suggested that ABC would
forgo HDTV and broadcast several channels of pay programming
instead. Now, as it turns out, ABC is taking the lead, not only
with its ``101 Dalmatians'' kickoff on Sunday but also with one or
two high-definition movies weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our target is three to four hours of high definition a week,''
Davis said. Last week, the network released a list of 27 movies
that ABC will broadcast in high definition in coming months; no
other network is promising even one hour of HDTV each week.
</P>
<P>
   But viewers who own an HDTV set are still not assured of seeing
ABC's high-definition broadcasts. The network is dependent on its
affiliate stations to carry them, and not every one of them will.
WJLA, for example, the ABC affiliate in Washington, will begin
digital broadcasting on Sunday to meet the letter of the federal
law. But digital does not necessarily mean HDTV, and WJLA has
declined to go to the expense of buying high-definition equipment,
despite repeated entreaties from the network executives, who are
eager for members of Congress to see their high-definition
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   So on WJLA, ``101 Dalmatians'' will be converted down to a
standard-resolution digital show. Jerald Fritz, a vice president
for Allbritton Communications Co., which owns WJLA, said Allbritton
did not want to spend $250,000 for a high-definition encoder on top
of the millions of dollars it had already invested in digital
transmission equipment. All other ABC stations beginning digital
broadcasts next month have bought the high-definition equipment,
network executives said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the networks say they plan to experiment with
multi-channel broadcasting, partly because ABC was severely
criticized in Congress for proposing the multi-channel concept last
year. Using digital compression, broadcasters can squeeze three or
four standard-definition digital programs in the space filled by
one HDTV show; but that is not the way Congress intended
broadcasters to use their second channels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only one network, PBS, plans to experiment with
digital interactivity, in cooperation with Intel Corp. When PBS
broadcasts a documentary on Frank Lloyd Wright during ``digital
week,'' Duggan said, any viewers who have television tuner cards in
their personal computers will be able to download blueprints,
bibliographies and other data.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Shapiro, head of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers
Association, said that his industry shares responsibility for the
paucity of high-definition programming on the broadcast networks.
``It doesn't make sense for them to do more until there are more
sets out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he, like every other executive interviewed, said the public
should be patient. ``This is like putting a man on the moon _ it's
a big technological change,'' he said. ``And like getting a man on
the moon, you have to take small steps at the beginning.''

EUROPEAN LEADERS PUSH FOR LOWER INTEREST RATES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KLAGENFURT, Austria _ With left-center majorities now in power
in most of the 15 countries of the European Union, its leaders
ended a weekend summit meeting Sunday in broad agreement that it
was time to pursue less restrictive economic and monetary policies
to guard against a world recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe now has the means to be a growth factor in the world,''
said French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, a Socialist. He spoke
after many government heads, meeting at the Alpine lakeside resort
of Portschach, urged coordinated reductions of world interest rates
to end the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing unemployment is the most important single question
for the people of Europe,'' German Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder said Saturday in his debut before his fellow European
Union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, who presided over the
discussions, said Sunday that leaders here agreed conditions were
now right for interest rate cuts in all 11 countries that will
start introducing a common European currency, the euro, next year.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, a Social Democrat who led his party to victory in
last month's German elections and will formally replace Chancellor
Helmut Kohl on Tuesday after 16 years of conservative rule, left
many fellow leaders here with the clear impression that Germany was
determined to strike a new course after years of harping on the
dangers of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after years of scrimping and cutting government deficits
to get ready for the common currency, the euro, Germany and
countries that have followed its lead now seem set to press the
independent European central bank to let up a little and allow them
to use the new currency to stimulate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Oskar Lafontaine, Schroeder's choice as finance minister,
sharply criticized Germany's independent Bundesbank on Sunday in a
speech in Bonn, saying it should ensure growth and employment as
well as price stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have a change of course, it will be difficult to
achieve the necessary growth rates and cut unemployment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   France and Germany have always thought of themselves as the
European Union's prime movers, and leaders in both countries agreed
last week that Europe could now follow less restrictive fiscal and
economic policies and encourage consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinated growth policies, Jospin told his counterparts here,
would preserve Europe as an island of growth in a global market
economy severely shaken by recession in Asia, financial collapse in
Russia and looming trouble in Brazil. Inflation is negligible now,
Jospin said, in so many words, so why not go for growth?
</P>
<P>
   But European governments do not have the last word about
interest rates _ central banks do.
</P>
<P>
   The independent European central bank in Frankfurt will decide
those for the euro. The bank's chairman, Wim Duisenberg, has been
skeptical in the past week about joining a global push to lower
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Floor rates set by central banks in Germany and France are at
their lowest levels since the 1980s, between 3.2 and 3.3 percent,
but are now higher in Britain and countries like Italy and Portugal
where inflation was long a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is right to cut interest rates,'' said Massimo
D'Alema, Italy's prime minister-designate and a former Communist.
``The hope is for a general reduction in rates, starting in
Germany,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres agreed. ``We are all
convinced that conditions exist for a significant reduction of
interest rates at the international level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The key European problem is unemployment, which at an average of
more than 10 percent _ 18 million workers in all _ has stubbornly
resisted measures by conservative and leftist governments alike.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Conservatives like Kohl blamed it on the rigidities and high
payroll taxes of the European welfare state, an argument that among
leftists only Tony Blair, Britain's Labor Prime Minister, by and
large accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said that he would call for a special summit meeting of
the world's seven most powerful industrial democracies, a group
that includes the United States, Canada and Japan as well as the
biggest Western European economies, by the end of this year to
discuss the global crisis, if there was enough consensus on what a
meeting should accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   France and Germany are pressing the United States for changes in
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that would give
European governments a bigger say in their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Although their left-wing majorities are trying for a common
front in economic policy, European states have had a much harder
time presenting a united face to the rest of the world in foreign
policy and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Blair told his fellow leaders that the European Union had far
too often shown itself to be ``dithering and indecisive'' in the
crisis over Kosovo, leaving the American-led NATO alliance as the
only effective leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said that Europe should think about ways to develop a
capability to use military force in situations where the United
States did not consider its own interests directly involved.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested a separable European defense identity within NATO.
But President Jacques Chirac said that France would prefer to
develop a military arm for the European Union, a step resisted by
many of its partners.

 ABC NEWS AT ODDS WITH PARENT NETWORK  
 NEW ASSIGNMENTS UNDER ZUCKERMAN  
 MICHAEL EISNER WAITS FOR THE RIGHT PRICE  
 ASTROLOGY IN, POLITICS OUT AT GLAMOUR  
 A QUESTION OF CONTROL FOR PBS STATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many journalists at ABC News are annoyed, to say the least,
about the parent network's decision to commission a one-hour
prime-time special from the filmmaker Oliver Stone that will deal,
among other things, with the theory that long-range missiles caused
the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since the accident, assorted theories about
bombs and missiles have been widely discredited. ``Absolutely,
completely groundless,'' is how Peter Goelz, managing director of
the National Transportation Safety Board, described them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it interesting that ABC News, knowing that the whole
speculation about conspiracy and missiles is completely unfounded,
has reported it as such, and yet ABC Entertainment is proceeding to
promote it,'' Goelz said. ``Which tail wags the dog at ABC?''
</P>
<P>
   Although ABC News spokesmen point out that the special will be
clearly identified as coming from the entertainment division, the
feeling among the network's journalists is that the public will be
confused _ just as their own sources were. Several aviation
industry specialists who got telephone calls from producers for
Stone mistakenly believed that the Stone crew was developing a
report for ABC News, and called there to ask what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Goelz of the safety board said that Lisa Stark and Tina
Babarovic, the ABC News correspondent and producer, respectively,
who cover aviation, had been ``very responsible about reporting the
complexities'' of this crash investigation. Broadcasting the Stone
special, he said, ``does a disservice to them and is really
insulting to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Babarovic declined to comment on the subject, and Ms. Stark
did not return a phone call seeking comment. The special, called
``Oliver Stone's Declassified,'' has not been given a broadcast
date yet.

<P>
   `Story From the Moon'
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City's tabloids can't seem to agree on much
of anything. On Thursday, The New York Post reported that Fred
Drasner, the chief executive at The Daily News, was resigning as
group publisher of the three magazines owned by Mort Zuckerman _
U.S. News &AMP; World Report, The Atlantic Monthly and Fast Company, a
business magazine. The Post said the move represented a loss of
power for Drasner.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Zuckerman called the article ``a total fabrication.''
Drasner will continue to serve as co-chairman of the magazine
group; Zuckerman will continue as chairman. ``It's a story from the
moon made of green cheese,'' Zuckerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Zuckerman and Drasner have different management
styles. Zuckerman is an urbane intellectual, and Drasner enjoys
playing up a New York street-tough attitude. People close to them
say that the two have disagreed at times, for example, over the
hiring of Harry Evans as editorial director of Zuckerman's media
holdings. But Drasner and Zuckerman say they are happily compatible
work partners. ``We've worked together for 25 years,'' Zuckerman
said. ``How can we not get along?''
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of getting along: Drasner will assume the role of
chief operating officer of Applied Graphics Technologies Inc., a
developer of digital technology and services, of which he is
already chief executive, and of which Zuckerman, who owns close to
5 million shares of stock, is chairman of the board. The stock,
which reached a high of $61 on February 26, had sunk to $8.375, as
of Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members at Zuckerman's organization said that the crisis
at Applied Graphics, including the recent departure of Drasner's
predecessor as chief executive, is why Drasner has shifted his
focus.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Ellenthal, who was associate publisher of The Daily News,
will now hold the title of chief executive of the magazine group,
replacing Drasner in the day-to-day supervision of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   _ ALEX KUCZYNSKI &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Taking Stock
</P>
<P>
   If Walt Disney Co. shareholders are unhappy about the stock's
34.4 percent decline since May 4, probably none are less happy than
the company's chairman, Michael Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner secured one of the largest option grants ever made in a
single serving when the company gave him 8 million options in 1996.
But Eisner cannot start to exercise those options before September
2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very unusual to have an option schedule where the first
share is not exercisable for seven years,'' Graef Crystal, the
executive compensation expert, said. ``In 98 percent of option
grants, all are exercisable in no more than four years, sometimes
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Disney stock has split 3 for 1 since Eisner made his
deal, the options are now equal to 24 million shares. The so-called
strike price of the options _ the price he will pay for the shares
when he is able to claim them _ is $21.18 a share. But that
discounted price looked a lot sweeter on May 4, when Disney stock
hit its 52-week high of $42.79, than it did last Friday, when the
shares closed at $27.75. Who knows where the price will be five
years from now? Eisner will no doubt be doing what he can to have
it back well above $21.18 by then _ which leads to another
remarkable twist in this Disney tale.
</P>
<P>
   For even as Eisner's options sit on the shelf, the ones granted
to his banished lieutenant, Michael Ovitz, are a different story.
Ovitz, the powerful Hollywood agent whom Eisner wooed to Disney and
then booted out 14 months later, in December 1996, received a
severance payment of $38.8 million. Ovitz also received stock
options that, since the split, are equal to 9 million shares with a
strike price of $19 each _ exercisable at any time.
</P>
<P>
   If Ovitz had the good timing to cash them in at the high last
May of $42.79 a share, he would have realized a pretax profit of
about $214 million. If he has held them all, his potential pretax
profit was worth only $78.7 million by last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz must exercise his options before Sept. 30, 2002. That is
one year before Eisner's options expire. As Crystal points out,
though, if Ovitz still holds any of the options, it behooves him to
root for Eisner to rally Disney.

   New Editor of Glamour Kills Politics Column
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Conde Nast magazine Glamour long prided itself on
the fact that it was the only women's magazine that had a column
about women in politics, written by contributors based in
Washington. The column ``Women in Washington: What Have They Done
for Us Lately?'' was one of the hallmarks of Ruth Whitney,
Glamour's editor of 31 years, who was replaced in September by
Bonnie Fuller, the former editor of Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Fuller has decided the column should go. And Ms. Fuller
_ who attracted readers by injecting an energetic sexuality into
the pages of Cosmopolitan _ has also decided to add an astrology
column, which will make its debut in the January issue, the first
issue that will bear, from the cover to the back page, Ms. Fuller's
editorial mark.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the Washington column, which Ms. Whitney
originated in 1993, from the magazine's pages and the new astrology
column are not the only changes. This month's cover, with the ample
decolletage of the actress Halle Berry, the cover model, more
closely resembles the Cosmopolitan of Ms. Fuller than the Glamour
of Ms. Whitney. (Ms. Fuller said the cover was entirely the
creation of Ms. Whitney.)
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen staff members have left since Ms. Fuller came on board,
including Judith Coyne, Glamour's executive editor for the last 12
years, who resigned on Oct. 16 to become editor in chief of New
Woman, a Rodale Press magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But departing Glamour staff members are not the only ones
disappointed in the new guard. In September, the National Council
of Women's Organizations, a Washington-based coalition of more than
100 groups, sent a letter to S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Advance
Publications, which owns Conde Nast, expressing its concern about
Ms. Whitney's departure. The letter was signed by, among others,
Betty Friedan, the author and feminist, and Eleanor Smeal,
president of the Feminist Majority Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Two Washington Post reporters, Hanna Rosin and Juliet Eilperin,
wrote the monthly column until August, when Mary Dixon, editor of
America's Community Banker, a trade journal in Washington, and
Nurith Aizenman, an editor at The New Republic, were hired to write
it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fuller said the idea for killing the column came from
longtime Glamour editors. ``We want to have more impact with the
coverage when we have news that's really important for readers,''
she said. ``I think that what was happening _ and this is what I
heard from the editors who were working on it every month _ was
that there wasn't enough strong news every single month.'' The
astrology column, she said, was an idea that originated with
readers and focus groups: ``They were clamoring for it. They all
said they wanted horoscopes.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Symbolic Importance
</P>
<P>
   With so many channels competing ever more fiercely for viewers,
even soft-spoken public television must find ways to make its name
stand out in the crowd. But which name _ the individual station's,
or PBS'?
</P>
<P>
   Should the ``brought to you by'' underwriting credit at the end
of PBS national programs finish with the words, ``... and viewers
like you'' or with ``... and PBS viewers like you''?
</P>
<P>
   That question _ silly, perhaps, but symbolic _ is one of nine
raised in a grass-roots petition drive by three dozen or so general
managers at PBS stations. Monday and Tuesday in Washington, at an
annual meeting of station executives, these petitions' draft
resolutions will be debated, and some may be voted as concrete
recommendations to the PBS board.
</P>
<P>
   Most people think of the Public Broadcasting Service as a
network, but it is really a membership organization, designed to
provide programs, promotion and technical and educational services
for its 350 public television stations. And Some stations gripe
that they are not consulted enough by PBS. For example, PBS
recently ruled that rerun scheduling of future programs by Ken
Burns, the documentary filmmaker, and Robert Cringley, host of the
popular computer ``Nerds'' specials, would be made by PBS, not
individual stations.
</P>
<P>
   Stations would get those programs for just one week; then PBS
would decide when to allow future showings. PBS says this is to
coordinate promotion and get the biggest impact; stations say this
hampers their scheduling freedom.
</P>
<P>
   More important, to most general managers, is whether or not PBS
should be able to sell its national programs to direct-satellite
companies in regions where there is already an over-the-air PBS
station.

 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, advertisers and agencies could confidently assume
that sports would bring them the kinds of consumers they so
ardently desired: millions of men who usually limited their own
athletic pursuits to dashing to the store to buy whatever products
were sponsoring the games played by their favorite teams.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, sports coverage has been delivering marketers more
air balls and fumbles than slam dunks and touchdowns. That could
cost the media millions of dollars later if fading interest
requires them to lower their advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Even as fans debated last week whether the 1998 Yankees were the
best team ever, for example, ratings for the 1998 World Series were
the worst ever _ below even those for the 1989 Oakland-San
Francisco series, which was disrupted for 10 days by an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   So far, viewership for most National Football League games,
through eight weeks of the 1998-99 season, is down. Even the
venerable ``Monday Night Football'' on ABC has seen its ratings
slump 9 percent from last season.
</P>
<P>
   And marketers hoping to reach hoops fans have been left dangling
by a labor dispute that has canceled the first two weeks of
National Basketball Association games and threatens the entire
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports as an advertising and marketing vehicle is going
through a midlife crisis,'' said David Verklin, chief executive at
Carat North America in New York, a unit of Aegis Group PLC that
buys time and space for marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ad people have so fallen in love with sports that they assume
no matter what you buy, it will be fantastic,'' Verklin added.
``But sports does not have unlimited viewer loyalty, unlimited
program capacity or unlimited price elasticity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Igiel, a top executive at the media agency owned by the
giant Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports was once impervious, but some of its cachet may have
disappeared,'' said Igiel, who is executive vice president and
director for U.S. broadcast at the Media Edge unit of Y&AMP;R in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports has held up better than most programming,'' he added,
``but it's now suffering some of the same erosion of viewership
that everything else on television has.''
</P>
<P>
   Igiel described himself as especially concerned about the
interruption of the NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just throwing my hands up,'' he said, because the viewers
lost with the disappearance of pro basketball will be ``very tough
to replace.'' That is particularly true for men ages 18 to 34, a
demographic group that is watching less prime-time television.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Solomon, president for national broadcast and sports
marketing at SFM Media in New York, a media agency owned by Havas
Advertising, said, ``We're not abandoning sports, but we may be
buying it less.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the agony of defeat is not entirely overwhelming the
thrill of victory for sports advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never say that we're at a point where sports are less
attractive,'' said John Muszynski, executive director for the
national television buying group at Starcom Media Services, a unit
of Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sports is no longer sure-fire, guaranteed,'' Muszynski
said, particularly for advertisers coveting men ages 18 to 24 as
well as 18 to 34. ``It's a tougher time.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side for sports, Anheuser-Busch Inc. decided last
week to extend its sponsorship of Major League Baseball so that
Budweiser remained the ``official beer'' of the league, the
all-star game and the World Series through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of News Corp. owes advertisers
an estimated $15 million in ``make-good'' commercials because the
World Series did not go to five games, the network is charging _
and getting _ record prices for Super Bowl XXXIII in January. Each
30-second spot is going for $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   And American Football Conference games are drawing more viewers
this year, when they are being broadcast by CBS, than they did last
year, when they were on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Some factors curbing the appeal of sports may be short-term
problems. The football season, for example, has so far been marred
by mismatches like that between the defending Super Bowl-champion
Denver Broncos and the Philadelphia Eagles on Oct. 4, in which the
Broncos drubbed the hapless Eagles, 41-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is going through a cycle where the major-market teams
are not performing that well,'' said Neal Pilson, president at
Pilson Communications, a sports television consulting company in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal problem the NFL is dealing with is the collapse
of teams in Chicago, Washington and Philadelphia,'' he said. ``And
the late-season strength of baseball took a little bite out of
football.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in ratings for ``Monday Night Football'' is being
attributed in part to its time slot this season having changed, to
8 p.m. in the East rather than 9 p.m., in the hopes of pulling in a
larger audience during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Showing football ``when it's 5 o'clock in Los Angeles and 7
o'clock in Chicago was a calculated risk,'' Igiel said. And the
earlier start pits Monday football against wrestling shows on cable
television that are increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Muszynski said, ``I don't consider wrestling a sport, but it's
definitely a choice for young men for entertainment, and it's doing
great.''
</P>
<P>
   A problem for one sport may even be an opportunity for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the NBA not around, people may pour money into
football,'' said Vince Wladika, a spokesman for the Fox Sports unit
of Fox Broadcasting in New York. His network broadcasts National
Football Conference games.
</P>
<P>
   As Verklin, the Carat North America chief, put it, ``Sports is
still a desirable property'' because ``a sporting event is the
final place where Americans gather around the television all at one
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the very success of sports in the past is a primary reason
for its difficulties now, Verklin asserted, because the number of
sporting events has proliferated as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that there's an unlimited capacity for
anything having to do with sports,'' Verklin said, ``an attitude of
`If you produce it, they will consume it.' And that's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The seasons for traditional sports are longer. The pre- and
postgame shows on television are longer. Other sports, like auto
racing, are adding more events. And activities ranging from women's
basketball and the coming Women's World Cup soccer tournament to
the so-called extreme sports offer new games to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Some old-time sports are even making comebacks; the Nashville
Network cable channel owned by CBS Corp. is reviving roller derby
in January with a weekly two-hour ``Roller Jam'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a trend toward a sports glut,'' said Ron Fredrick,
executive director for the national broadcast group at J. Walter
Thompson USA in New York, an agency owned by WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have to get used to similar ratings numbers in the
sports area that we have been getting used to in prime time,'' he
added, referring to the declining viewership of entertainment fare
as choices multiply.
</P>
<P>
   Igiel of the Media Edge gave another reason for the blows to the
hegemony of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now lots of other activities going on in people's
lives,'' he said, from using computers to playing video games to
even participating in sports rather than passively watching them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Solomon of SFM Media predicted further erosion of
interest in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was weaned on sports, but young people have other things to
do,'' he said. ``So sports will continue to decline as they grow up
without being committed sports fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Another theory involves the transformation of sports into big
business. Upheavals in the pro leagues range from higher salaries
and labor unrest to abrupt franchise moves and free agency's
weakening of the ties between fans and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans are fed up,'' said Jeffrey Steinhour, vice president and
account service director at Crispin Porter &AMP; Bogusky, a Miami ad
agency. ``We need to get back to the roots of what motivates
athletes, back to the authenticity of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Crispin Porter is creating a $4 million campaign for the And 1
brand of basketball shoes that will proceed despite the forced
timeout in NBA play. The ads will be focused on ``the basketball
fan and player at the core of the sport,'' said Steinhour, who said
he was unswayed by ``the endorsement deals, the hype, the
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the increased fees that networks must pay for rights
to broadcast games are a factor, too. The costs are typically
passed on to advertisers in the form of higher prices for
commercials. That leads their agencies to search for alternate ways
to garner audiences and ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not going to get 15s anymore,'' said Fredrick of
Thompson USA, referring to a rating indicating that 15 percent of
all television sets are tuned to a certain program, ``we can buy
three 5's or four 4's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I long for the days of three choices,'' he added. ``Now there
are a hundred.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, the SFM Media executive, who is a former president of
Busch Media, the in-house media arm of Anheuser-Busch, echoed
Fredrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone to much more cable TV this year than we have ever
gone to before,'' he said. Among the networks on which he is buying
more commercial time are those ``that deliver high numbers of
men,'' he added, like the History Channel and the Discovery
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job used to be easy and glamorous,'' Solomon said with a
chuckle. ``Now it's work.''

TALENT AGENCY RECASTS EXECUTIVE RANKS AND STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In crucial steps in the evolution of one of the
largest and more unusual talent agencies in Hollywood,
International Creative Management Inc. has announced the naming of
new co-presidents and the adoption of a more forward-looking
strategy after a decade of focusing on debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Friday that Nancy Josephson, who runs its
television business, and Ed Limato, who heads the motion picture
business, will become co-presidents. In a reflection of the
creativity suggested by the firm's name, the former president, Jim
Wiatt, will take on the new titles of co-chairman and co-chief
executive, but he will hold those positions alone. Jeffrey Berg
will retain his longstanding titles of chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ICM, as it is known, is not only one of the most influential
talent agencies, but also the only agency to have once been part of
a public company and then to have gone through a leveraged buyout _
something quite unusual for a service business with few tangible
assets.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the agency was part of Josephson International, a
publicly traded diversified media and financial concern. The
company had been founded by Marvin Josephson, the father of Ms.
Josephson, the new co-president. ICM split off from the other
companies and went through a $70 million buyout in 1988, in which
the management put up about $10 million of the purchase price and
borrowed the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Berg said ICM had now paid off most of the debt and was making
the management changes as it turned its focus toward new
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental dynamic at the firm is shifting from the debt
model to the equity model,'' he said. ``We're broadening the
management base so we can think about new markets, online
businesses, telecommunications opportunities. We now have the
ability to grow in a different way.'' ICM will remain a private
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Limato is a well-known agent, representing actors like Mel
Gibson, Michelle Pfeiffer and Denzel Washington. Invitations to his
annual Oscar parties are among the most sought-after in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Josephson now becomes one of the highest-ranking women in
the agency world. Among her better-known clients are Marta Kaufman,
David Crane and Kevin Bright, the creators of ``Friends'' and
``Veronica's Closet.''

PATENTS: COMMISSIONER OF PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Lehman, who announced Friday that he would step down as
commissioner of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, is not a man
many people feel lukewarm about. His loyalists defend him as a
visionary who has served the public admirably. His critics dismiss
him as an intemperate despot who does the bidding of big business.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders and detractors tend to agree on one point: that
Lehman has raised the visibility of intellectual property by
transforming what was formerly a bench-warming position into a
prominent perch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been savvy about making important people understand why
patents matter,'' said Robert Merges, professor of law at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``He essentially has made
Washington understand that patent issues are important to overall
economic strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who was appointed in 1993 by President Clinton, said he
would resign by the end of the year because he had accomplished his
goals as commissioner. But there has been speculation for nearly a
year that Secretary of Commerce William Daley, who is Lehman's
boss, was pushing him to leave, after Lehman became embroiled in a
bitter feud with his assistant commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good riddance,'' said Jamie Love, director of the Consumer
Project on Technology, which is based in Washington. ``He was
terrible on the issue of making patents accessible to everyone on
the Internet. And whatever Hollywood or the biotechnology industry
wanted, he would do. His responsibility should have been to the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, whose background was in copyrights rather than patents,
fashioned himself into an intellectual-property czar.
</P>
<P>
   And clearly he would most like to be remembered for his
contributions in the copyright arena. He helped, for example, to
negotiate the World Intellectual Property Organization copyright
agreements, which were recently approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said the agreements were Lehman's main achievements.
``He foresaw the need to adapt copyright law to the needs of the
digital age,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Some others agreed. ``From a software industry perspective, the
legacy he leaves goes well into the new millennium,'' said Robert
Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance, a trade
association. ``I couldn't overemphasize the importance of that
treaty, which he was so instrumental in negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman championed a broad array of copyright changes, in what he
hoped would be a precedent-setting White Paper on Intellectual
Property and the National Information Infrastructure. But most of
those proposals have been rejected, according to James Boyle, now a
visiting professor at Yale University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ideas, since abandoned, that were set forth in the
1995 white paper: a proposal that Internet providers be responsible
for the copyright violations of subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle helped persuade 100 law professors to sign a letter
criticizing the white paper. ``You couldn't get 100 law professors
to sign a letter agreeing that the sun will rise tomorrow,'' he
said. ``But they signed this letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was instrumental in trying to harmonize U.S. patent laws
with those of other countries. He was a driving force behind a 1995
law _ long sought by industry and other countries _ which changed
the term of a patent.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new law, the life of a patent extended 17 years from
the date it was issued. Now, a patent lasts for 20 years from the
date of the application _ regardless of how quickly or slowly it
was granted.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the change was to discourage so-called submarine
patents, which popped up after having been submerged at the Patent
Office for years or decades, often because of delaying tactics by
inventors who wanted to wait for a particular technology to become
widespread so as to receive maximum royalties.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehman's efforts drew the ire of independent inventors,
whose cause was taken up by such unlikely allies as Phyllis
Schlafly, the right-wing opponent of abortion rights; Ross Perot,
the Texas billionaire and sometime presidential candidate, and
Francis Modigliani, a Nobel Prize-winning economist.
</P>
<P>
   The organized resistance of independent inventors is the main
reason that other so-called harmonization legislation that was
favored by Lehman has lingered on Capitol Hill for several years
without becoming law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the first openly gay man to be confirmed by the Senate for a
presidential appointment, Lehman entered his post with the stated
goal of transforming the Patent Office into an agency that
celebrated diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two of his top officials were black men, Lawrence
Goffney and Philip Hampton. But at some point, Lehman's
relationship with his lieutenants went awry. Last fall, the three
met with Daley in an effort to settle their differences.
</P>
<P>
   By March of this year, Goffney and Lehman had become embroiled
in a bitter, public dispute. Lehman accused Goffney of
incompetence, while Goffney accused Lehman of cronyism and racism.
Both Hampton and Goffney have subsequently left the Patent Office
for private business.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's departure means that soon four of the top five
positions in the agency will be vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members representing Vice President Al Gore have privately
sought potential nominees to succeed Lehman. An obvious candidate
is Todd Dickinson, a Philadelphia patent lawyer who earlier this
year was appointed deputy commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   But the real question is not so much who will be on the Clinton
administration's short list but whether anyone will really want the
job.
</P>
<P>
   The new commissioner will have little time to focus on grand
policy initiatives. Instead, his time will be consumed by the
mundane logistics of moving a 5,500-person agency into new office
space and by shoring up the agency's trouble-ridden, billion-dollar
effort to update its technological structure.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no assurance that the new commissioner would have a
great deal of time to take care of even this business: If a
Republican wins the presidency in 2000, a Democratic-appointed
commissioner would probably be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman ``is a very smart guy, a very aggressive guy, and he
couldn't get past some of these issues,'' Merges said. ``It's bound
to scare off the next person.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Silicon Valley, there's a term for this,'' he said. ``It's
called an insurmountable opportunity.''

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Anxiety has been running high in this former British
colony, which has seen its economy buckle, tourism dry up and
free-market reputation tatter in the 15 months since it reverted to
Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a U.S. telephone company is warning Hong Kong that it could
miss out on the information age if it does not quickly open its
telecommunications market. ``Hong Kong's Back Is Against the
Wall,'' said a Cassandra-like newspaper advertisement recently
taken out here by the company, MCI Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is teetering on the edge,'' asserted Steve Liddell,
president of the MCI Worldcom Asia Pacific unit. ``It will either
embrace the brave new age of telecommunications or return to an age
of protectionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong officials, perhaps not surprisingly, do not share the
American company's alarm. ``It is not our policy goal to be the
most liberal telecommunications hub in Asia; that's a rather empty
thing,'' said Geoffrey Woodhead, a senior adviser to K.C. Kwong,
the secretary for information technology and broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the Hong Kong government will allow new
competitors to offer local telephone service in this territory of
6.8 million people. For the last three years, Hong Kong has
licensed three local companies to provide service, in addition to
the incumbent monopoly, Hong Kong Telecom. A decision on whether to
license further competitors is expected in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, formed in the recent merger of the United States'
second- and fourth-largest long-distance companies, is eager to
wire Hong Kong's teeming business district, so it can offer a
package of voice and data services to the many multinational
corporations here. The company already offers international service
to about 100 customers on lines leased from Hong Kong Telecom. But
it wants to offer corporate customers a complete menu of local and
long-distance offerings. And it is dangling a bushel of carrots
before the government here.
</P>
<P>
   Among other blandishments, MCI Worldcom has promised to make
Hong Kong the hub for an Asian fiber optic network that would
stretch in a vast crescent from Tokyo to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Thursday, the government announced plans to open its
international long-distance market to free-wheeling competition.
But several analysts said they expected Hong Kong not to issue any
more local phone licenses.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom contends that by refusing to let more competitors
provide the actual direct network connections to local customers,
the territory would cut off its nose to spite its face. Without
sophisticated global players, Liddell said, Hong Kong risks losing
its status as a global financial center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the competitors are limited to three local firms,'' he
said, ``it's our view that these services simply won't be
available.''
</P>
<P>
   With its lofty talk and populist appeals to economic growth, MCI
Worldcom's lobbying campaign is no different from campaigns waged
by long-distance and local phone companies in the United States.
But in recession-ravaged Asia, the company's message carries an
edge: For those countries that pursue it, a competitive
telecommunications market can be the road to recovery; for those
that do not, protectionism can lead to economic obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom notes pointedly that Japan and Australia both have
fully liberalized local phone markets. The company is investing
$350 million over 10 years to build a fiber optic network in Tokyo
and $200 million to build one in Sydney. Though Liddell refused to
discuss MCI Worldcom's potential investment in Hong Kong, it could
easily run into hundred of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Liddell makes a good case. ``Hong Kong needs
to jump on opportunities when they present themselves,'' said Lloyd
Fischer, a telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
Hong Kong. ``They've got a good location geographically, but that's
only worth so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these days, analysts noted, Asia can look more
terrifying than tempting to potential investors. Bell Atlantic
Corp. recently took charges of $545 million to write down the value
of its investments in Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, though Hong Kong has suffered along with its neighbors, it
is not about to play the needy supplicant. Regulators here, who
contend that Hong Kong already has one of the more open markets in
Asia, say they can preserve the territory's status as a financial
center without handing out local phone licenses to any and all
comers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see liberalization of telecommunications as a means to an
end, rather than an end in itself,'' Woodhead said. ``We hope our
telecoms policy will attract people to set up their regional
headquarters in Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Hong Kong has taken some steps to open its markets
that go further than other Asian countries. It has four local phone
providers, compared with Singapore's two. And unlike Japan, Hong
Kong has no restrictions on the foreign ownership of local
telephone companies _ a much-contested provision in last year's
landmark World Trade Organization agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the accord, most countries agreed to let foreign companies
acquire major stakes in domestic phone companies. Only Japan
insisted on limiting foreigners to no more than 20 percent
ownership of NTT and KDD, its main local and long-distance
providers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement on Thursday, Hong Kong said it would grant
licenses to all companies that want to provide international
direct-dial service in the territory. After Jan. 1, 2000, the
licensees can build their own international networks here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a free-for-all, but there is no question that Hong
Kong's market is liberalizing,'' said Victor Shvets, head of
telecommunications research at Deutsche Securities in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Having opened its local telephone market ahead of its
long-distance market, Hong Kong presents something of an anomaly in
regulatory circles _ a quirk that is a result of the government's
having granted Hong Kong Telecom a long-term monopoly on
international service. Last February, it paid the company $864
million to terminate that franchise this year rather than letting
the monopoly extend through the original date of 2006.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Hong Kong broke open the local telephone monopoly
in 1995, when it granted licenses to three start-up companies: New
T&AMP;T, New World Telephone and Hutchison Telecom. All three companies
are owned by powerful property developers, a circumstance that has
been no small help in stringing wires into buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But though the gaggle of local providers has made for a
clamorous market, it has barely dented Hong Kong Telecom's
monopoly. Collectively, the three rivals have less than 2 percent
of the market. That is largely because they have been slow to build
networks in Hong Kong's densely populated neighborhoods and hilly
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the upstarts are lobbying Hong Kong not to add to
their struggles by granting additional local licenses. Given that
these companies are owned by some of Hong Kong's most politically
connected tycoons, their arguments carry plenty of influence.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's government has not hesitated to make decisions that
benefited the developers, even when those moves seemed at odds with
the territory's free-market credentials. In June, it suspended
sales of public land; in August, it intervened heavily to prop up
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said the developers might have an ulterior
motive in opposing additional local licenses. If Worldcom cannot
build its own network, it might feel pressed to buy out one of the
tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   But Liddell, who said Worldcom was not interested in such an
acquisition, took an unsubtle swipe at the tycoons by suggesting
that companies that put up apartment towers and ran supermarkets
were not as able to offer up-to-date communications services as a
company that focuses on building networks.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong Telecom has taken a generally low profile in this
debate, perhaps because it has its own economic and political
problems. To ready itself for the deregulation of the market, the
company recently announced plans to slash the wages of its 13,800
workers by 10 percent. But it was forced to back down after Hong
Kong's chief executive, Tung Cheehwa, excoriated the move.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong Telecom is controlled by Cable and Wireless PLC of
Britain; the Chinese government-controlled China Telecom bought 5.5
percent of the company last year.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom is not the only foreign carrier active in Hong Kong.
British Telecommunications has an alliance with Hutchison. And
Global One, the joint venture owned by Sprint, France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom, offers international service on leased lines.
</P>
<P>
   But only MCI Worldcom has ambitions to build a soup-to-nuts
local network. Perhaps that is why the company has chosen to make
its case so fervently and publicly. Besides, Hong Kong may
represent the company's best remaining chance to make its
local-telecommunications mark in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, MCI Worldcom has hit its share of snags breaking into
the local phone business elsewhere in the region. Last year, before
teaming up with MCI, the company bid aggressively for a license to
offer local phone service in Singapore. But it lost out to a
consortium that includes BT and NTT. Before that setback, Woodhead
said Worldcom had suggested that it might move its Asian
headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, there is no talk of moving. It may be that MCI
Worldcom needs Hong Kong as much as Hong Kong needs MCI Worldcom.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of locally heavy showers and a few potent thunderstorms
will sweep across the southern Rockies as advancing cold air at
high levels encounters increasingly moist air over the region.
Gusty winds will accompany many of the showers. Farther north,
heavy snow will fall at elevations above 8,000 feet across the
central Rockies where accumulations over a foot will occur.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the storm system, the West Coast states will be
mainly dry. Areas of low clouds and fog will occur Monday morning
from the Central Valley of California to the northwest coast.
Otherwise, a mixture of clouds and sunshine will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing flow of warm air from the south will rise over
slightly cooler air, resulting in clouds and patchy rain over parts
of Nebraska and South Dakota. The southern Plains will be partly
cloudy and mild, though a few thunderstorms will develop in western
sections later Monday as a jet-stream disturbance arrives from the
southwest.
</P>
<P>
   After a cool dawn, the Southeast will have another mainly sunny
and warm day. Sunshine will be abundant although some puffy clouds
and a few isolated showers are expected near the east coast of
Florida
</P>
<P>
   Dry, chilly air will surge into New England in the wake of a
front. A band of clouds and some isolated sprinkles will occur near
the edge of the cool air mass from the northern Great Lakes to the
interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, intense Hurricane Mitch with central winds over 140
miles an hour will drift slowly to the northwest over the western
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Pollution Season
</P>
<P>
   Fair weather can bring about severe pollution. In late October
1948, Donora, Pa., was in the midst of the worst air-quality
disaster in the nation's history as 20 people died from a fog
poisoned with industrial smoke. The tranquil high-pressure systems
of fall favor pollution. Sinking air that accompanies autumn's
high-pressure systems acts like a tight lid to trap pollutants near
the ground. Light winds, another hallmark of high pressure, cannot
disperse pollutants. Autumn highs often move slowly, allowing
pollution episodes to sometimes last a week.

Microsoft's lead lawyer, posed the question in hundreds of ways as
he cross-examined the government's lead witness, James Barksdale,
the president and chief executive of Netscape Communications.
Warden sought to establish that while Microsoft is assuredly
aggressive and powerful, there is scant evidence that its behavior
raises prices or restricts output so that consumers suffer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ As competition for pipeline routes out of the
oil-rich Caspian Sea basin intensifies, Turkey announced new
restrictions over the weekend on use of the Bosporus, the strategic
waterway that divides Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said 4,500 tankers passed through
last year, and the straits will not be able to handle that number
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey will not grant any priority to oil tankers,'' Cem said
in a statement issued Saturday. ``It has the right and duty to take
all measures to protect the ecological system, history, cultural
heritage and safety of those who live along the straits.''
</P>
<P>
   In case oil executives missed his message, Cem pointed out that
these new measures ``could slow down current traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's announcement was the latest move in a high-stakes
rivalry among regional and world powers for influence in the
volatile Caspian region.
</P>
<P>
   Political pressures are mounting as major oil companies prepare
to decide where they want to lay the main export pipeline for their
Caspian crude. Policy makers in Washington and elsewhere believe
the decision could have long-term strategic implications for the
region, which is made up of former Soviet states wedged between
Iran and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey and the United States are waging a last-minute campaign
to persuade oil companies to build their pipeline along a route
that would favor Western interests. Oil companies are resisting
because they say such a pipeline would cost too much to build.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials have evidently decided to warn oil companies
that they cannot count on sending their tankers through the
Bosporus if they use an alternate route. Turkey says that because
the 19-mile channel runs through the center of Istanbul, which is
home to more than 10 million people, increases in tanker traffic
are impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton administration officials summoned top oil
executives from Amoco, Chevron and other companies active in the
Caspian to a meeting in Washington at which they laid out the case
for their favored pipeline. It would run from the Azerbaijani
capital of Baku, where the Caspian oil boom is centered, across
Georgia and Turkey to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   The administration favors this route because it would strengthen
Turkey while pulling Azerbaijan and Georgia away from the Russian
sphere of influence and toward the West. It would also keep Caspian
oil out of Iran and bring it to a port within easy sailing distance
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russia and Iran oppose the Baku-Ceyhan route, and each has
offered an alternative of its own. Each bidder claims its
alternative is cheapest.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's special envoy to the Caspian region, Richard
Morningstar, is scheduled to arrive in Istanbul on Monday for a
round of meetings at which he will press oil executives to look
more favorably on the Baku-Ceyhan route.
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives say they want to build a pipeline along that
route, but that given low oil prices and the years it will take
before Caspian oil is flowing in large amounts, they cannot commit
several billion dollars to it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies are reportedly leaning toward building a
shorter route running from Baku to the Georgian port of Supsa on
the Black Sea. From there the crude might be shipped through the
Bosporus to the Mediterranean and the open ocean beyond.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Turkey's environmental argument dovetails neatly with its desire
to promote the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline route. If the Turks and
Americans can convince oil companies that the Bosporus is already
full to capacity, prospects for the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline would
improve.
</P>
<P>
   The legality of the tighter regulations that Turkey has
announced may be questionable, however. Under a convention signed
in 1936, Turkey has very limited power to regulate traffic on the
Bosporus.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently by coincidence, Turkey's announcement came only hours
after an oil tanker collided with another vessel on the Bosporus.
No oil was spilled.
</P>
<P>
   Port officials said a tanker of Turkish registry, the Osman
Bahri, reported trouble with its steering mechanism on Friday
night, and soon afterward collided with an anchored water tanker.

 Dreyer's Initiates Cutbacks  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. of Oakland is taking a $60 million to
$65 million charge to earnings in the third and fourth quarters of
this year and laying off several dozen sales and distribution staff
as part of a new restructuring plan.
<P>
   High butterfat prices and the termination of a distribution
agreement with Vermont's Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. contributed to
a third-quarter loss of $6.3 million (23 cents per common
share), &UR;  &LR; the company said late Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter ended September 26 rose 6 percent to $303
million, said Dreyer's, the largest maker of premium ice cream in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Total charges in the third quarter include $10.6 million for the
restructuring and termination of Ben &AMP; Jerry's distribution
agreement and an additional $2.38 million for the settlement of
several supplier disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 100 employees will be laid off nationwide, and fewer
than 10 of those will be in the Bay Area, said Timothy Kahn,
Dreyer's chief financial office. No jobs will be lost from the
company's Oakland headquarters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   High dairy prices drove down gross profits in the third quarter
by $8 million, the company said. For the year, higher commodity
prices will cost Dreyer's an estimated $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another drag on earnings are higher-than-expected costs related
to the company's efforts to penetrate Texas, a stronghold of the
Blue Bell brand of ice creams. Dreyer's will write down part of the
value of a distribution center in Houston to account for excess
capacity there.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn is forecasting a net loss this year, but a return to
profitability in 1999 as butter fat prices are expected to
moderate. He declined to disclose estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the battery of problems Dreyer's is wrestling with,
Lewis Alton, managing partner of the San Francisco investment bank
L.H. Alton &AMP; Co., said he believes the ice cream maker is poised
for growth.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the distribution agreement with Ben &AMP; Jerry's, which
the Vermont company announced in August, leaves Dreyer's free to
launch its own super-premium line of ice creams, said Alton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This creates a great opportunity ... and the history of their
business shows they have the ability to come out with incredible
national launches,'' said Alton. He cited the company's 1986
introduction of its Grand Light low-calorie ice cream and its 1989
launch of frozen yogurt, both very successful products.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said ``it's more likely than not'' that the company will
enter the super-premium business, which is about twice as
profitable as selling lower butterfat premium ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously already we have hundreds of delivery trucks and
sales people'' that could be used to ship super-premium products at
the same time as they distribute the regular ice creams, said Kahn.
``I think we've been a major factor in the growth of the Ben &AMP;
Jerry's business, so we know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's stock closed unchanged yesterday at $13.38.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's sells ice cream under the Dreyer's name on the West
Coast and the Edy's name in other parts of the country. In
addition, it makes and distributes Starbucks brand coffee-flavored
ice cream and Portofino Italian-style ice cream.

 Feinstein Says Foreign Crisis Affecting California  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The first tremors of the global economic crisis are beginning to
shake California's economy, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein said
yesterday.
<P>
   Calling for U.S. action to bolster troubled nations, Feinstein
said California exports to Asia, job creation in Silicon Valley and
the market value of many of the largest high-tech companies already
have slipped in response to economic weakness in Asia, Russia and
South America.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley has become the nation's top exporting region,
with $40 billion in goods exported a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is the only nation with the resources and the
leadership capabilities to develop the programs and forge the
alliances necessary to stabilize, reform and eventually help
reverse this deterioration'' in global economies, Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The California Democrat spoke at the 20th anniversary
celebration of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, a business
organization that has worked for improvements in transportation,
housing and education in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein urged modernization of institutions that regulate the
international economy. Although she did not specifically mention
the 53-year-old International Monetary Fund, she said America
should work to create a group ``able to deal with the new
economy.'' Over the past few decades, the economies of individual
nations have become increasingly interwoven and the global economy
has become increasingly digital.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also called for the nation to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Work with G-7 countries to develop a coordinated international
response to stimulate economies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maintain interest rates and liquidity levels that allow the
U.S. economy to grow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prevent dumping of computer chips and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   _ Push for accountability, banking and securities reform in
international business transactions ``every chance we get.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Find ways to encourage long-term, rather than short-term
investing.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator said California has some work of its own to do
if its economy is to remain competitive. Although she recently
voted in favor of the increase in H-1B visas to allow high-tech
companies to bring in more foreign workers, she said she'd rather
the state improve its educational system so its own residents get
these jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our state ranks last in the nation in percentage of young
adults with a high school diploma. Our classrooms have the highest
student-to-teacher ratio in the nation,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The state also ranks last in the ratio of books and librarians
to students, Feinstein said, and despite Silicon Valley's status as
the birthplace of the digital economy, the state ranks last in
spending per student on computers.
</P>
<P>
   She said she plans to introduce in Congress a bill to withhold
federal funds from school districts that promote students who
haven't mastered set criteria for each grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also called for lengthening the school year by seven
teaching days, requiring that every teacher in the state is
credentialed and lowering the two-thirds requirement it takes to
pass local school bonds.

YOUNG AND OLD EXPRESS DIFFERENT VIEWS OF JOHN GLENN'S MISSION,
LEGACY
<TEXT>
<P>
   By KIM COBB
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can read all the historical accounts, watch every Hollywood
treatment of those early NASA years, and still not get it.
</P>
<P>
   You simply had to be there when John Glenn made his rocket-fired
lap around the Earth to understand the wonder of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were _ listening to the radio at work, or glued to a
grainy, black-and-white television image _ have probably got a
pretty good crop of gray hair by now.
</P>
<P>
   But even when memory fails on other topics, many from Glenn's
generation remember exactly where they were and who they were with
when the clean-cut astronaut took his famous ride. And they
remember the pure joy of that shared experience. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I admire him so much for his commitment to this country,''
gushed Fred Sweat, 80. ``God bless him!``
</P>
<P>
   But at Houston's Challenger Center, where kids get to fly a
simulated space shuttle mission, the youngsters are less than
bowled over by Glenn's return to orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids my age don't think much about Mercury and John Glenn,''
said Seabrook Intermediate School student Jeff Nickeson, 13. ``They
know about Apollo because of the Tom Hanks movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking to people like Sweat, people who wear the passage of
time more obviously than Glenn, is a reminder of just how
remarkable the astronaut's current mission is.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of his age group admire Glenn's mental agility and
agree that he's in much better shape than the average 77-year-old,
but they are far from being of one mind when it comes to his making
a return trip into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that age, I'd think it was a cinch,'' cracked Abe Bogart,
94. ``It'd be easier than at my age!``
</P>
<P>
   Bogart and some of his neighbors at The Hampton at Post Oak, a
high-rise retirement community near the Galleria shopping center,
were meeting for happy hour on a recent afternoon. They were young
like Glenn when he made the first flight, and many remembered the
event in snapshot detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were visiting there in Florida _ in Miami,'' said
80-year-old Joyce Brewer. ``We were on vacation. One of the big
bands was playing in the hotel. We went out and watched the
television in the lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said she'd be scared to death to travel into space at her
age. ``I think it's great he wants to go, but I wonder why,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' countered Lenore Hart, 73. ``I don't know how
anyone could think otherwise,'' she said, adding with a grin, ``I
like adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Glenn, 86, says he's from Ohio, like his astronaut
namesake, but not related. He was working for Transco Energy in the
early '60s, and remembers being fascinated with every detail of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course. It was a first,'' Glenn said. ``I'm an engineer and
I just love that stuff. But I think he's too old (now), I really
do. I'd love to go,'' he said, ``but what it costs to put him up
there, no, I wouldn't spend the money on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Selma Geller, 80, was a secretary at a Houston insurance agency
when Glenn made his first orbit. ``I remember hearing it on the
radio and thinking, how fantastic!''
</P>
<P>
   But now, Geller said she thinks Glenn's taking a terrible
chance. Nevertheless, she said she and her husband will be watching
when he lifts off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope he comes back,'' giggled 76-year-old Lorraine Boehme,
tucked in next to her husband, Herman, 79. A former professor at
Texas Woman's University, Boehme is fatalistic about the potential
dangers of the flight and doesn't think it should hold Glenn back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, why not?'' Boehme asked. ``You've got to die some way
_ I'd just as soon go in a big experiment. What a happy way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's flight was a seminal moment in U.S. history, but many
children say they aren't necessarily learning about it in school.
Quizzing the recent group at the Challenger Center revealed that
about three-fourths of the children knew who Glenn is.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Ruiz, a 12-year-old student at Hamilton Middle School
said, no, she didn't know who John Glenn is and hadn't studied
about him in school. And she isn't really interested in space, she
said, ``unless they take kids like me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Katie Nava, another 12-year-old from Hamilton, passed the
pop quiz with flying colors. ``He used to be an astronaut. Then he
went into Congress. Now he wants to go back into outer space,''
Nava said. She expressed concern about his health and thinks maybe
he's too old.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Parker, an 11-year-old Boy Scout from Pershing Middle
School, said he really didn't have much interest in space _
especially when it comes to the kind of missions that are standard
for the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like going to Mars and stuff,'' Parker said. ``But when
you go up and study science and stuff, it gets kind of boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Moore, 13, from Seabrook Intermediate, lives in a
community where astronauts are neighbors. Her father is a NASA
contractor and she's jazzed enough about the space program that she
attended the Space Academy in Huntsville, Ala., last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But while the coordinator of the Seabrook Science Magnet Program
says astronauts occasionally come to speak at the school and her
students are easily interested in space, Moore said she was never
taught about Glenn in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even cover it (space) much in history,'' Moore
said.``I probably learned most of what I know from Space Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't expect her friends to pay much attention to Glenn's
flight. ``The average kid doesn't care,'' she said. ``They have
other things to worry about.''

YUGOSLAVIA WILL WITHDRAW FORCES BY NATO DEADLINE, MILOSEVIC
ASSURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE O'CONNOR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ After brandishing yet another threat of
Western air power, NATO's top two generals left Belgrade on Sunday
with assurances that Yugoslavia will withdraw enough of its forces
from the province of Kosovo by a Tuesday deadline to avoid punitive
air strikes, according to Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   On their third visit to press Western demands for the force
reductions, and after 18 hours of meetings with President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia and his military chiefs, senior NATO
officers agreed on the specific military and police units to be
withdrawn and were promised that the speed of withdrawal will
increase, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   If the promises are kept, they will probably avert a showdown
between Yugoslavia and NATO that the alliance seems anxious to
avoid _ not only because it means taking military action against a
sovereign country but because, Western diplomats say, it would
greatly complicate efforts to solve the problems in Kosovo
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The first of as many as 2,000 international monitors who are to
spread out across Kosovo are beginning to arrive there. While they
may enhance the chances of peace, both they and the increasing
number of relief workers could easily be taken hostage in the event
of NATO military action.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the American who is NATO's supreme commander,
and Gen. Klaus Naumann, a German who is the alliance's highest
ranking European officer, arrived here on Saturday to tell
Yugoslavia that it must move much more quickly to reduce its forces
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO civilian officials said it would not be necessary for all
the forces to be removed by Tuesday's deadline if the pace of
withdrawal quickened enough to suggest that they would all be gone
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know exactly the names and locations of every unit we want
out of there,'' a NATO officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Another NATO officer said Yugoslavia would also have to remove
all its artillery from Kosovo or shift the weapons to a narrow area
along the border with Albania. ``Those weapons have no business
where they are because right now they can only be used against
civilian targets,''the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats say that while some Yugoslav forces have been
withdrawn already, the number is far from enough to comply with the
agreement reached between the U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Milosevic on Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   To get that agreement, NATO also threatened air strikes, then
suspended the threat until this Tuesday to give Milosevic time to
reduce his forces to the level demanded by a U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be little enthusiasm for air or missile strikes
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on British television Sunday, Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook indicated that the deadline would pass without an order to
bomb, Agence France-Presse reported from London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that when on Tuesday we review this, we may well come
to the conclusion we cannot yet relax our guard, we cannot stand
down the planes, we need further progress before we relax that
order,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations said Yugoslavia must bring down the level of
police and army forces in Kosovo to what it was in February, before
a military offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels who want Kosovo
to be an independent country. Dozens of towns and villages were
destroyed, and hundreds of people, many of them civilians, were
killed in the offensive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than 250,000 civilians who fled during the offensive are
afraid to return to their homes, and some are living in the open.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO official said that about 25,000 soldiers and
policemen are still in Kosovo, 10,000 fewer than at the height of
the offensive, but 9,000 more than Milosevic agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these are the same people responsible for the attacks
on civilians and the looting,'' the NATO official said. ``People
quite rightly are afraid to go home with these men still in the
field. Milosevic may not be able to get them all out by the Tuesday
deadline, but he must pick up the speed of the withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hill, the U.S. diplomat trying to get a peace
agreement between Yugoslav officials and ethnic Albanians said on
Thursday that there is no chance of serious negotiations until
Yugoslavia reduces its forces and the fighting stops.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening military action to make the government reduce its
forces will not bring peace if the separatist guerrillas continue
to mount military actions. While Kosovo is part of Serbia and is
ruled by Serbian officials and security forces, ethnic Albanians
make up roughly 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can expect the Serbs to leave and let the KLA take
over,'' a senior Western diplomat said, referring to the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as an estimated 1,000 soldiers and several
artillery pieces were being withdrawn from a position guarding one
of Kosovo's main roads, a Western diplomat said: ''There are strong
KLA units all over that area. If they want to cut that road, it's
now wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   While the level of fighting in Kosovo has declined
substantially, both sides have initiated attacks, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats concede that while they have been able to
persuade the Yugoslav government at least to begin reducing its
forces, they have little with which to threaten the guerrillas, who
are dispersed in small units and often intermingled with civilians.

 Some Recommended Reading for the Serious High-Tech Player  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
If you want to be a serious player in the tech industry, here are
two books for your reading list. The first will explain how to
throttle the competition. The second will blow your mind.
<P>
   ``Information Rules'' is the title of the new book by University
of California at Berkeley economists Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian,
two of the most highly regarded authorities on doing business in an
economy based of  &LR; on software, information and other intangible
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who once served as chief economist for the U.S.
Department of Justice, and Varian, dean of Berkeley's School of
Information Management and Systems, lay out a series of
prescriptions for how to wage a standards war with competitors and
how to lock in customers with technical tricks so they stick with
you instead of flirting with Brand X.
</P>
<P>
   The book is surprisingly readable, considering it's about
economics. Information Rules goes beyond examining case studies of
smart and stupid tactics, and actually provides specific do's and
don'ts at the end of each chapter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For instance, the authors recommend what they call Goldilocks
pricing _ taking a basic product and offering several versions at
low, medium and high prices.
</P>
<P>
   They use the example of Kurzweil voice recognition software. The
consumer version sells for $79 and contains a 20,000-word
vocabulary. There are six stronger flavors, some containing
specialized legal or medical vocabularies, that cost up to $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to offer versions of the product to the broadest
possible markets. Goldilocks pricing refers to their rule: When in
doubt about how many levels of service to offer, pick three. This
way, customers who find the lowest level too cheap, and the highest
level too dear, will find a middle ground that's just right.
</P>
<P>
   Information Rules (Harvard Business School Press, $29.95) is
already out in the bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to wait a while to pick up my second recommendation:
``The Age of Spiritual Machines,'' by computer scientist Ray
Kurzweil, whose credits include the voice recognition system cited
above.
</P>
<P>
   I got my hands on an advance copy, and it made my eyes bug out.
</P>
<P>
   Kurzweil lays out a scenario that might seem like science
fiction if it weren't coming from a proven entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Within 20 years, he predicts, computers costing $1,000 will have
roughly the same intelligence as the human brain. These artificial
minds will be able to talk with us, recognize us when we come home
and keep us company when we're lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Within an additional 10 years, by 2029, a $1,000 computer brain
will have the power of a thousand human minds. These machines will
be so smart, Kurzweil predicts, they'll start claiming
consciousness _ the digital equivalent of cogito ergo sum. He
thinks courts will recognize that machine minds will have certain
inalienable rights _ an issue even Star Fleet Command didn't have
to confront until 2365!
</P>
<P>
   ``The specter is not yet here,'' he writes, adding: ``The
emergence in the early 21st century of a new form of intelligence
on Earth that can compete with, and ultimately exceed that of human
intelligence, will be a development of greater import than any of
the events that have shaped human history.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but while we wait for ``The Age of Spiritual
Machines'' (Viking, $24.95) to reach the bookstores in January,
consider this: If Kurzweil is right and computers are poised to
out-think us, soon, maybe we ought not fix that Year 2000 flaw. Our
last chance may be to take these electronic brains down a peg, by
sending them back to 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Just a thought.

   ICHINOSETAKAHASHI, Japan _ The principal's office in the little
country school here has a gleaming new bell and loudspeaker system
to broadcast messages and summon the student body from recess. But
it would be simpler to yell through the window for Daiki Saito to
come in.
</P>
<P>
   Daiki, an impetuous 7-year-old with a mischievous sparkle in
black eyes that dance beneath bushy eyebrows, is the only student
in the entire school.
</P>
<P>
   This boxy, cream-colored schoolhouse is a monument to Japan's
commitment to equality _ and also to Japanese inefficiency. Daiki
is the sole child living in this little village surrounded by
forests in the foothills of Mount Fuji, but the government spent
more than $100,000 renovating an abandoned old schoolhouse for
Daiki and then assigned him his own first grade teacher and
principal. It costs $175,000 a year to run Daiki's school.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan struggles to revive its economy and avert a global
recession, it is under enormous pressure to make itself more
efficient and thus stimulate a new burst of economic growth. But it
finds itself profoundly torn, for efficiency would come at the
price of egalitarianism and other values that many Japanese regard
as at least as important as economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, everybody calls for reforms and efficiency,'' said
Tomishige Yazaki, Daiki's principal. ``But if we just pursue
efficiency, the world would become a very dry place, with no
sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is often denounced as recalcitrant and paralyzed as its
economy sinks into its worst recession in six decades, and it is
true that Japanese leaders have spent years denying the existence
of economic nettles instead of grasping them. But in some respects
this is a principled paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economic catastrophe has harmed all of Asia and arises
largely from political incompetence, endemic corruption, webs of
relationships that misallocate resources and a parliamentary system
that hugely overrepresents the most backward parts of the country.
Some of Japan's most serious delays, such as confronting its bad
debts and banking instability, have involved more paralysis than
principle. Yet while everyone around the globe is complaining about
how bad Japan is, in other respects the problem is that it has been
too good.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have long known of the ``paradox of thrift,'' which
states that although it is admirable to save, a country that saves
too much ends up hurting itself. That is one of Japan's ailments,
but more broadly it is being pummeled by what might be called a
``paradox of virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy is in deep recession in part for reasons that, in an
old-fashioned way, seem honorable: a passion for prudent fiscal
planning, for stamping out inflation, for saving for the future and
perhaps most important of all, concern for the human flotsam of
capitalism and for equality for all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's commitment to equality is intricately linked in at least
two ways to its economic crisis _ and the world's. First, it is
producing a welfare state for the inefficient, leading to a growing
misallocation of resources in the world's second-largest economy.
Second, the impulse to improve the quality of life in remote areas
by building tiny schools and countless mountain roads has helped
send costs spiraling out of control. Soaring budget deficits and
concern about how to pay for the retirement of Japan's baby boomers
led the government to raise taxes last year.
</P>
<P>
   There is now broad agreement that the tax increase was a fatal
misstep that plunged Japan into recession. But even if its timing
was catastrophic, Japan was trying to do what economists believe is
in principle the right thing: reduce budget deficits and plan for
the aging of the baby-boom generation. All industrialized countries
face this challenge but most have put off the hard decisions, while
Japan's leaders last year ignored its economic weakness and
confronted the problem by raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, this was as foolish as it was well-intentioned,
and the results were calamitous: Japan's economy fell to pieces,
and the government now says that economic output will contract this
fiscal year for the second year in a row. The stock market is at a
12-year low, and Japan's biggest banks _ eight of which have assets
worth as much as the entire Russian gross national product _ are
wobbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has found itself in the position of fighting the last
major economic war, the Great Depression,'' said Adam Posen, a
scholar at the Institute for International Economics in Washington
and author of a new book on Japan's economy. ``And its government
has chosen to pursue the strategy that lost that war.''
</P>
<P>
   Posen and many other economists here and abroad recommend a
gigantic fiscal stimulus, such as a huge new spending program
coupled with tax cuts. Japan has reluctantly taken steps in that
direction, but it has dithered because huge spending increases seem
so, well, irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Japan finds itself hampered as well in its monetary policy,
because in the past it attacked inflation so relentlessly that
interest rates are extremely low. That makes it difficult to ease
monetary policy by lowering rates further, and so some experts are
urging Japan to get out of this box by pledging to be irresponsible
and taking steps to nurture inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that for a diligent, serious nation like Japan,
the present economic crisis is a nightmare: it is being scolded on
all sides and advised that it must be more fiscally reckless and
monetarily irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   A fiscal or monetary stimulus may rescue Japan in the short run,
but most economists here and abroad say that in the longer term
Japan must restructure its economy and pay much more attention to
efficiency rather than equality. Yet the calls for efficiency run
smack into the egalitarianism that has been a national ideology
since the end of World War II, when a defeated Japan was told of
the evils of its traditions of authoritarianism and hierarchy.

 ICHINOSETAKAHASHI, Japan: and hierarchy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many economists and business leaders say that an obsession with
equality is stifling Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Take the government's building projects. They are partly a way
of showing thanks to construction companies, which contribute
mightily to the Liberal Democrats. Yet these projects also seem to
reflect an egalitarian commitment to improve the lives of people in
remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Ikarajima, a sleepy little islet in southern Japan that is
home to only 350 people, a dazzling new $125 million steel bridge
rises like a mirage, to connect one end of the island with a
neighboring island. The bridge, built in 1996 to replace a ferry
that used to take 15 minutes, cost $357,000 for each resident of
Ikarajima.
</P>
<P>
   That led to some sniping about waste of money, and so plans for
a $250 million bridge on the other side of Ikarajima have been put
on hold for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The island people have been eagerly waiting for this new
bridge, but now because of reports of waste, they are deprived even
of their dreams,'' Kenzo Uehara, a town official on the island,
said. ``I don't know that you can criticize these projects just by
the logic of numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most breathtaking economic inefficiencies is the
expenditure on tiny schools with just a handful of students. While
Daiki's case is unusual, another school near Ichinosetakahashi also
has just a single pupil, and so does a school in the southern city
of Kumamoto.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Ministry says it does not know how many
single-student schools there are in Japan. But it says that the
country has 3,324 elementary schools _ 14 percent of the total _
with fewer than 50 students in all grades put together.
</P>
<P>
   Why run an entire school for a single student, regardless of
cost? The main reason is obliviousness to costs, coupled with a
feeling of obligation to rural communities that want their children
to have a neighborhood school just like city kids. But Japan's
sometimes rigid bureaucracy can also be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   In Daiki's case, the neighboring town operates an elementary
school just 20 minutes away. But the authorities say that because
that school falls under a different administrative region, it is
inconceivable that Daiki go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be less costly, and we would be happy to make such an
arrangement if it were possible,'' said Tadashi Michibayashi, an
official in the Enzan board of education. ``But we in the
administration have to draw the line somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the various elements of egalitarianism, Japan is particularly
proud of its even distribution of income. The richest fifth of the
population in Japan enjoys a total income four times as great as
that of the poorest fifth _ compared to almost nine times as much
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several global studies have found that an egalitarian
distribution of income helps promote economic growth within a
country. But by most counts Japan takes it too far.
</P>
<P>
   Japan relies on 65 percent marginal tax rates _ its tax system
is among the most progressive in the world _ and Japanese companies
suppress income differentials by paying employees according to
seniority rather than merit. These tax rates and corporate
practices reflect a psychology of egalitarianism, many say, that
has tended to suppress entrepreneurship and hold back the most
talented sector of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was here in high school, there were four classes of
about 50 kids each in my 11th-grade class,'' said Robert Alan
Feldman, who first came to Japan as an exchange student and is now
chief economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo. ``And as I looked
around, it struck me that there were a couple of really bright kids
in each class, and a bunch of medium kids and a bunch of dumb kids.
And I asked the teacher, `Well, why don't you track the kids in
some way, like have a bright class?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``And he gave me an answer I'll never forget. He said: `It
wouldn't be democratic.' And I thought, gee, these people define
democracy very differently.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Japan seems troubled by economic changes that are
beneficial overall but that make losers out of some people.
Creating losers would upset the society's ``wa,'' or harmony, a
value that has been central to Japanese society at least since
Prince Shotoku in 604 proclaimed a constitution decreeing ``Wa must
be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on wa often impresses visitors, but it also
results in paralysis. Japan has difficulty carrying out changes
that benefit the majority but that are vigorously opposed by a
small group of prospective losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is a society of consensus, and as long as 30 percent of
the population holds out against a decision, the government will
not act,'' said Yoshio Hatano, a former ambassador to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions between the United States and Japan thus seem to
arise from not just Tokyo's political paralysis but more
fundamentally from a set of enormously different attitudes and
values, not just about economics but about life itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at two ends of the spectrum, the U.S. and Japan,'' said
Masaru Yoshitomi, one of Japan's leading economists.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshitomi noted that Japan's egalitarianism runs so deep that
when schoolchildren take part in Sports Day activities, the prizes
often go not just to the winners of the races but to absolutely
every child who takes part. He suggested that this takes equality
too far, breeding cohesion but suppressing the excellence that
drives a modern economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no outstanding people in Japan,'' Yoshitomi said,
only partly joking, ``and that has to change.''

<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Despite this year's peace accord and efforts
by Protestant and Catholic leaders to persuade it to disarm, the
Irish Republican Army continues to maintain a huge secret arsenal,
according to Irish and British officials and other experts.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelmingly Catholic IRA, the officials and experts said
in a series of interviews, still has enough machine guns, automatic
rifles and Semtex explosive to carry on well into the new century
what it calls ``the armed struggle'' to force the British
authorities out of Northern Ireland, the predominantly Protestant
British province to the north. Twice in recent months the outlawed
guerrilla group has said that it will not disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, notes, accurately, that the
Belfast agreement, approved last spring, does not require
disarmament, known here as ``decommissioning,'' until the agreement
is fully enacted in the spring of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The officials and experts said that while some token disarmament
may take place in coming months, the IRA is virtually certain to
retain enough weapons to mount a new offensive if it becomes
dissatisfied with the progress of the new peace agreement. In the
meantime, though, the IRA has declared itself committed to a
cease-fire for the last 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have enough resources to continue the war, if they want,
for some decades, even if there is some token decommissioning,''
said Andy Wood, a political consultant and former information
director for the British government in Northern Ireland. He and
other officials said the IRA position was rooted in the traditional
Irish rebel belief in ``keeping a pike in the thatch,'' in case
peace efforts collapse, which they all have since the current
violence began 29 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland said that
because of the dispute over disarmament, the two governments and
the northern political parties would miss the Oct. 31 deadline for
the creation of a new North-South Ministerial Council. The council,
which is to give the Irish Republic more influence in the affairs
of the North, was one of the major concessions made in the peace
agreement to the Catholics of the IRA and Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   A disarmament commission headed by Gen. John de Chastelain,
former chief of the Canadian armed forces and former ambassador to
the United States, is believed to be suggesting two ways of
disarming with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   One plan foresees the destruction of weapons to be verified by
neutral experts. The other would have the IRA tell officials where
they can find arms dumps and destroy them. De Chastelain and other
officials would then decide whether the amount of arms offered for
destruction fulfilled the requirements of the Belfast agreement.
Officials said they did not expect any disarmament to take place
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fed up,'' said Monica McWilliams, a member of the new
Northern Ireland Assembly from the Women's Coalition, made up of
Catholics and Protestants. ``What are they waiting for? This stuff
costs a lot of money. Do they want to sell it? Are they afraid to
lose their assets? But how can you legitimately sell Semtex?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was elected four months ago,'' she continued. ``But instead
of governing and leading I'm sitting around waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament issue has been blocking political progress for
months as the principal Protestant leader in Northern Ireland,
First Minister David Trimble, insists that some disarmament must
begin before Sinn Fein is allowed to take part fully in the new
Assembly created by the agreement and intended to give more power
to Catholics in Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, notes that there is no
time deadline for disarmament in the Belfast agreement. That is
where the Northern Ireland peace effort has been stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the officials and experts provided an ominous picture
of the IRA's military power. Since 1969, when the sectarian
violence erupted in the province, the IRA has killed more than half
of the 3,200 victims of the conflict, including about 800 British
soldiers and police officers. They have lost about 300 of their
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Their arms are hidden in bunkers and tunnels on both sides of
the border, but mostly here in the Irish Republic. The arsenal,
estimated at 100 tons, includes several tons of Semtex, the
explosive used to give added power to homemade bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the weapons are buried in holes and caves in farmland in
lightly populated areas in the Irish counties of Louth and Cavan. A
year ago, the police discovered an underground practice shooting
range.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish police and army have found dozens of arms caches over
the years, and often seem able to make such finds at a politically
opportune moment, to reassure the public when the peace process
seems particularly threatened, or at the time of an important
meeting between London and Dublin. There is a suspicion among
experts that the Irish sometimes get tips from informers, but do
not act immediately.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Irish police and army are occasionally alerted to arms
caches by civilian hikers and picnickers who report that they heard
shooting in the hills and meadows. Other discoveries have been made
after the police notice or are informed of electric lights burning
late at a usually derelict, uninhabited farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   In such hiding places, IRA operatives, using ordinary coffee
grinders, pulverize nitrate fertilizer widely used in farming and
mix in sugar to control the burn rate of the eventual blast. A few
pounds of Semtex adds to the bomb's power. A video-cassette-sized
packet of Semtex can blow a car to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   In August in the town of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, such a bomb
placed by an IRA splinter group killed 29 people. The IRA denounced
the attack, but retains the means to make a bomb of its own if it
became impatient about the peace effort. In 1996, the IRA became
impatient with the stalled peace talks and killed two people and
caused millions of dollars in damage with an explosion in the
Docklands area of London. Within 10 days, the British government
made a significant political concession.
</P>
<P>
   The skilled use of Semtex has rendered obsolete IRA weapons like
the ``drogue bomb,'' an armor-piercing projectile, used against
police and army vehicles, made from a baked-bean can with a copper
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant guerrillas, by comparison, are only lightly armed. At
the start of the conflict, some of them were still using
Martini-Henri rifles, so old that the guns are noted by Rudyard
Kipling in a poem on the Zulu War.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA arsenal comes largely, officials said, from shipments
from Libya in the early 1980s. The Libyan leader, Muammar
el-Gadhafi, said publicly that he was arming the IRA as a response
to the decision by Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, to help
the U.S. bombing raids on Libya.
</P>
<P>
   At least three shiploads of machine guns, surface-to-air
missiles and Kalashnikov rifles arrived undetected in the Irish
Republic. In 1987, the French intercepted a Panama-registered ship,
the Eksund, bound for Ireland with several tons of weaponry. The
estimates of the present arsenal are based partly on what was found
on that ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate the impact of folk memory on the
psychology of Republicanism,'' said Paul Arthur, a politics
professor at Ulster University in Belfast. ``The Republican
attitude toward decommissioning is more emotional than a matter of
security. Fathers tell sons what happened in the earlier
generation. The natural tendency was and is to be fundamentally
suspicious of the British.''

 `Free' Can Cost You  &HT;       
 By Steve Rubenstein 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Only in America can you watch free satellite TV while wearing a
free toupee.
<P>
   Only in America can you get a free electronic pager for buying a
pair of dungarees.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is a catch. There is always a catch when an
entrepreneur trots out ``free'' _ the most sublime and
heaviest-hitting word in the Madison Avenue arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the word ``free'' is being taken to places it never
went before. It is being used not to sell hard goods but to sell
service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a year's worth of toupee maintenance, for $2,000, and get a
free toupee, scream the ads from Hair Club for Men, which operates
80 toupee parlors across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a year's worth of electronic pager service and get a free
pager, says Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a year's worth of satellite TV programming and get a free TV
satellite dish, says Dish Satellite TV.
</P>
<P>
   The toupee deal goes to the heart of the
free-if-you-make-a-yearlong-commitment scheme, for making
commitments are nearly as scary to some men as losing their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing director Mike Smith said Hair Club decided to switch
to the ``free hair concept'' to move the toupees because the toupee
business is ``all about packaging.''
</P>
<P>
   A man with a toupee needs to come in every month or so, so the
wigmakers can check for loose strands and the stylists can cut what
remains of the customers own tresses.
</P>
<P>
   A typical session used to cost $65. Now the company is selling a
package of 10 sessions for an average of $2,000 _ including the
``free'' toupee, which Smith said is not really a toupee but a
``hair system.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't the figures mean that the toupee isn't really free?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look at it that way,'' said Smith. ``We're selling a
package. We're selling value. Like McDonald's does when they sell
you the hamburger and the fries and the soft drink all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Committing to a pager is cheaper than committing to fake hair.
That deal only costs $109 but, because this is America, you have to
buy a pair of $35 pants first.
</P>
<P>
   After buying the pants, you call the toll-free number and tell
the lady you bought the pants. Then you pay $109 for a year's worth
of pages and the company mails you the ``free'' pager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a string attached?'' said Jamie Lockard, advertising
director for the Lee pants company. ``I don't think so. Consumers
understand that it's not really free because you have to buy the
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is the company calling it free if it isn't really free?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to get the pager and our pants out there in
the marketplace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another outfit in search of commitment from the undecided is the
Dish Network, a satellite TV company that is offering a $249 dish
system for free to anyone buying a year's worth of programming for
$588.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``free'' is so complicated in the TV deal that it
requires a 466-word explanation in fine print at the bottom of the
ads. If you don't like the programming, according to the
explanation, tough. No refunds on the $588 part of the free deal
that isn't free.
</P>
<P>
   Asking for commitments is nothing new, of course. For years,
health clubs have waived initiation fees for members buying a
year's membership in advance. Furniture and electronics stores have
waived a year's worth of interest for buyers of high-ticket items.
Newspapers hand out trinkets _ tote bags, soccer balls, Chronicle
umbrellas _ to subscribers who pay for a few months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   But an initiation fee or a tote bag isn't really the same as a
toupee, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From us, you actually receive something of value up front,''
said the toupee marketing director. ``It's nothing like waiving a
fee or getting free interest. It's actual hair. You can swim in
it.''

 Minister Touts Philippine Economy  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Philippine President Joseph Estrada was personally hurt by
international criticism that he failed his first major leadership
test when beleaguered Philippine Airlines shut down last month,
according to one of his top aides.
<P>
   At the same time, Jose Pardo, Estrada's trade secretary, said in
an interview that Philippine business leaders were putting heavy
pressure on the former movie star-turned-politician to use
government funds to bail out the airline, considered a keystone to
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with PAL preparing to resume flights to San Francisco and
Los Angeles as soon as next week, Pardo insisted during a visit to
San Francisco that Estrada has been ``redeemed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Little did they know where he was coming from, the fact that
he was very concerned that a bailout (costing an estimated) $1
million a day would put the government in more debt and make things
more difficult for the economy,'' Pardo said. ``He did not budge,
he stood his ground. At the end of the day, he was held as a
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardo, the country's secretary of trade and industry, visited
the Bay Area Thursday and yesterday on the tail end of a nine-day
mission to the United States to try to convince businesses
representatives, investors and government leaders that the
Philippines was in a better position to weather Asia's stormy
economic climate than other countries like Indonesia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada has previously sent other top officials, including the
vice president, on similar trips to shore up the Philippines'
image.
</P>
<P>
   Pardo downplayed this month's collapse of Orient Commercial
Banking Corp., the first commercial bank closure in the Philippines
in a decade. He said it was one of the country's smaller banks and
that major institutions remained sound and were still stronger than
their counterparts in most Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   He also stressed that Seagate Technologies Inc.'s decision to
drop a $200 million disk drive project in the Philippines earlier
this year was due to a drop in demand for the storage devices and
not the country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   And while the unemployment rate has hit nearly 9 percent and
while 32 percent of the population live in poverty, Philippine
exports _ led by computer and electronic goods _ are expected to
increase by about 20 percent this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that gross domestic product is expected to increase by
a slight 1 percent this year, better than the declines forecast for
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some overseas companies say the government hasn't gone
far enough. Ford Motor Co. hinted yesterday that it may scale down
its planned operations in the Philippines if the U.S. automaker
does not receive duty-free import privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has a car assembly plant in Laguna province south of Manila
that is expected to be operational by September 1999. The plant
will not only assemble cars, pickup trucks and vans for the
Philippine market but it also will produce car parts for export.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Emrick, president of Ford Motor Co. in the Philippines,
warned that if the capital equipment that it proposes to import is
subjected to tariff, changes could be made in the scope of its
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Manila newspapers said the company plans to bring in $50 million
of capital equipment as part of its $333 million investment in the
Philippines over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   They quoted a Ford official as saying the company is paying as
much as 20 percent in tariffs for capital goods in the Philippines
that are duty-free in other countries. As an investor brought in by
the Philippine Export Processing Zone Authority, Ford was given a
six-year holiday on all income taxes early this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines seemed poised to finally become an Asian tiger
like its neighboring countries when the Asian economic crisis hit
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pardo said the crisis set the Philippines back, but economic and
governmental reforms begun by former President Fidel Ramos have
cushioned the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible problem Estrada has dealt with so far has been
PAL, which was rocked by financial losses caused by Asia's economic
problems and labor strife. Asia's oldest commercial airline halted
domestic and international flights September 23.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada had Pardo negotiate with Cathay Pacific Airways to pick
up PAL's domestic routes, restoring key cargo and passenger links
inside the island nation until PAL resumed domestic service October
7.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cathay Pacific is close to putting the final touches on a
deal to buy a 40 percent stake in PAL and take control of the
airline's management, Pardo said.
</P>
<P>
   PAL plans to resume service from Manila to San Francisco and Los
Angeles on Thursday, although two Boeing 747-400s are still being
held by the U.S. Export-Import Bank because they were used to
secure financing for the airline.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Bay Area, which is home to about 260,000 Filipino
Americans, Pardo met with representatives of companies such as
American President Lines, Lockheed Martin and Bechtel.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming trade minister, Pardo was president of several
Philippine companies, including the country's licensee of 7-Eleven
stores and Wendy's restaurants.

 Glitch at Cal Fed Affected 30,000 Mortgage Payments  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
California Federal Bank said it delayed posting mortgage payments
from about 30,000 customers following its recent takeover of
Glendale Federal Bank, a glitch that may have caused customers who
made timely payments to receive delinquency notices.
<P>
   The borrowers who were affected were all former customers of
Glendale Federal Bank, which Cal Fed acquired September 11,
spokeswoman Mary Rische said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a delay in posting payments because of a computer
systems conversion on October 2,'' Rische said. ``It's been
resolved and all payments have now been posted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rische said she wasn't aware of any attempts to collect payments
that had already been made.
</P>
<P>
   But Susie Bright, a Glendale customer from Santa Cruz, said she
got a series of automated telephone calls from Cal Fed's mortgage
affiliate beginning this week notifying her that her account was in
default and had been forwarded to the collection department, even
though she paid on time.
</P>
<P>
   When she called Cal Fed customer service, a representative said
a manager had instructed employees to halt the automated collection
calls.

ON ROMAN STREETS, A MOTORBIKE ADDICTION, A HELMET AVERSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Lifting her 4-year-old son from the seat of a blue Honda
moped, Federica Frontani, 33, tenderly kissed him and warned him to
play carefully at preschool.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she risked driving her child by moped through Rome's
notoriously speedy and chaotic traffic, Mrs. Frontani said that the
distance was too long to walk and that the streets were too clogged
for cars. Asked why neither she nor he wore a helmet, she replied,
``They do not make helmets small enough for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? ``Well, actually it is illegal to put children on
mopeds,'' she said with a sheepish smile. ``But in this city, what
else can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Italians, and particularly Romans, are addicted to motorbikes.
As cars frozen in mile-long traffic jams honk angrily, Vespas,
Hondas and Piaggios career forward, scattering pedestrians like
pigeons in St. Peter's Square. Mopeds dart around buses, speed
through red lights and zoom the wrong way on one-way streets,
buzzing the Colosseum like Audrey Hepburn in ``Roman Holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody drives them. Teen-agers and businessmen alike smoke
and talk on cell phones as they drive. Mothers sometimes pile on
two children, one in front and one clinging behind.
</P>
<P>
   Until he was elected in 1993, the mayor of Rome, Francesco
Rutelli, proudly drove his Honda SF Fifty moped around the capital.
His security detail dissuaded him from driving it to City Hall _
but they were worried about terrorist attacks, not traffic
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and government agencies battling to
bring safety standards up to a European par find themselves
fighting some of Italy's most entrenched cultural traits.
``Unfortunately, we are a nation of scofflaws,'' said Giuseppe
Cesaro, spokesman for the Automobile Club of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Cesaro said many of the mothers who fearlessly ferry their
bareheaded toddlers on mopeds are the same who, at the beach, run
screaming into the water to pluck out children who try to go
swimming less than an hour after their lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to list all the contradictions of Italy,'' he
said wearily, ``it would fill an encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the consequences are lethal. Between 1989 and 1995, European
countries on average brought down the mortality rates from traffic
accidents by 14 percent. In Italy, however, deaths rose by 2
percent, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the
European Commission. Safety laws and even common-sense precautions
are routinely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sicurstrada, a traffic safety research center in
Bologna, only about 36 percent of moped drivers in Italy wear
helmets, which are not mandatory for drivers over 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the numbers change drastically from North to
South,'' said Sandro Vedovi, national coordinator of Sicurstrada.
``I've been told that in southern Italy, police stop you if you are
wearing a helmet _ because they suspect you are about to commit a
crime.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government hopes that if and when amendments are made to the
traffic code that will require all drivers of mopeds to wear
helmets, people will start complying.
</P>
<P>
   Many Italians are skeptical. Despite a 1988 law requiring seat
belts, only 10 percent of Italians buckle up, compared with 92
percent of Germans and 68 percent of Americans, according to a 1997
study conducted by the University of Birmingham, in England.
</P>
<P>
   All cars in Italy are required to provide seat belts in front
and in back, but that has not prompted Italians to fasten them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised my men that if they ever found one Italian who
buckled his back seat belt, I'd buy him the best fish dinner in
Rimini,'' said Chief Inspector Giordano Biserni, president of the
Association of Supporters and Friends of the Traffic Police. ``So
far, not one has succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy has passed laws requiring all motorcycle drivers to wear
helmets. Children under 18 are also required to wear helmets on
mopeds. Italian law also prohibits children or even adults from
being passengers on mopeds. But on any street in Rome, and
particularly in Naples, it is obvious that there are more toddlers
and adult passengers on mopeds than there are helmets on drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more public awareness,'' Biserni said. ``And we need
tighter enforcement. We have to give tickets without hesitation.''
He sighed. ``The Italian traffic police are too nice, particularly
to women.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there have been attempts to increase both public
awareness and police ruthlessness. It is no longer uncommon to see
police road traps on major streets of Rome, where groups of police
officers, finding severity in numbers, flag down offenders and
ignore their pleas for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Ministry of Public Works began Italy's biggest
public awareness campaign with television and radio ads and
billboards that for the first time pressed helmet use.
</P>
<P>
   The ads showed a caption that read: ``What helmet? I never
fall.'' It was placed above a white chalk police outline of a
corpse. But experts say such campaigns have so far not yielded much
change.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents are beginning to pay heed. Too often, it comes too
late. One of the most noticed helmet campaigns was the one mounted
by the parents of Andrea Bordignon, an 18-year-old high school
senior in Treviso who was killed this summer on his motorcycle. A
collision caused him to hit his unprotected head on cement.
</P>
<P>
   Before his funeral and on the day of his funeral, his family and
friends posted signs all over town with a picture of a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath, the caption read: ``I forgot to put on my helmet.
And now it is too late to do it. Let my memory be a warning to
you.''

 Portugal Pinning High-Tech Hopes on Intel  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Intel soon may decide to build a chip assembly plant in Portugal.
It would be no big deal to Intel, which has lots of plants. But it
would a major step for Portugal, a small country trying like crazy
to attract foreign investment.
<P>
   Once a colonial power, Portugal has been asleep at the wheel for
most of the past 500 years, content to rest on past greatness and
keep to itself on the southwestern edge of Europe. But since
joining the European Union in 1986, it has been catching up fast &LR; ,
posting one of the fastest economic growth rates on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent trip to Lisbon for a technology conference, I
was surprised at how readily the Portuguese have taken to
technology. In some ways, they even surpass us.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Lisbon, for example, cars equipped with special
electronic cards whiz past toll plazas, where lasers scan the cards
and instantly take the toll out of the driver's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think we use ATM machines a lot, you ain't seen
nothin'. The Portuguese routinely use their ATM cards to pay
utility bills, transfer money between accounts and pay their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Underpinning these technologies is one of the most advanced
telecommunications systems in Europe _ more than 95 percent of the
country is wired with fiber-optic cable. Among other things, that
makes for terrific network access _ including solid 56K Internet
connections from almost any phone.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Portuguese are turning their attention outward, trying
to lure foreign investors. This is not a new concept, of course,
but Portugal appears better-positioned to pull it off than most
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese trade officials tout the country's lovely climate,
its telecommunications, and a transportation system that avails
itself of air, land and sea. They also boast that their government
will bend over backward for foreigners, with some of the best tax
breaks and the least red tape in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of that, they point to a new chip assembly plant
outside Porto. Siemens, the big German computer and electronics
company, put up the plant in just eight months _ less than half the
time it would have taken elsewhere, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it without compromising the environment. The new
plant exceeds all emission standards set by the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's trump card, however, is its labor force. Portuguese
workers are fairly well educated, yet they're the lowest-paid in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors also love the fact that unionization is
minimal. Portuguese workers work more hours in a year than workers
anywhere else in Europe, and fewer days are lost to strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portugal provides one of the best workforces in Europe,'' said
Carlos de Melo Ribeiro, a local executive with Siemens. ``It is
experienced and can learn and adapt quickly. It is highly
productive, and yet labor costs are low.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they're about half what they are in Ireland, which has
set the standard for attracting foreign technology companies. With
Ireland now facing a labor shortage of its own, Portugal may start
to look more appealing as a place to set up shop in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's main competition could come from Eastern Europe _
especially the Czech Republic _ where labor costs are even lower.
Industry experts say the Czechs have been battling Portugal for the
new Intel plant.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the biggest foreign investments in Portugal are in
the automotive industry. The largest single operation is Auto
Europa, a joint venture of Ford and Volkswagen that employs more
than 4,500 workers and turns out minivans for the European market.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese trade officials are delighted to be the outsourcing
capital of the European auto industry. But they also understand
that the future lies in high tech _ and that an Intel plant really
would put them on the map.

NEWS ANALYSIS: MICROSOFT'S REFRAIN: WHERE'S THE HARM? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp.'s defense in the antitrust trial that began last
week boils down to one question: Where's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, never quite uttered those
words. But he nonetheless posed the question in hundreds of ways in
his raspy baritone drawl during three days of cross-examining the
government's lead witness, James Barksdale, executive of Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states accuse Microsoft of being a
new-age monopolist, bullying other companies so that it could
stifle competition in the Internet software market. Netscape, the
early leader in the market for software used to browse the World
Wide Web, was the main target of Microsoft's illegal campaign, the
government contends.
</P>
<P>
   Warden used his combative cross-examination of Barksdale as a
forum for trying to make Microsoft's case. With his pointed
questions, Warden sought to establish that while Microsoft was
assuredly aggressive and powerful, there was scant evidence that
its behavior resulted in the effects that classic antitrust
doctrine deems illegal _ namely, raising prices or restricting
output so that consumers suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft bundled its Internet
Explorer browser with its industry-standard Windows operating
system and gave the browser away free to crush Netscape. Microsoft
replies that it folded its browser into its operating system as a
convenience to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Warden tried to drive home the point with a sarcastic question:
``Mr. Barksdale, do you think consumers would be better off if
Microsoft had not given the browser away free, in your hypothetical
world?''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale replied that in the long run he thought consumers
would benefit if Microsoft had not made the browser free because
the move had eliminated the incentives for other companies to enter
the browser market with innovative products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Warden made his point: To side with the government, a
court must favor a would-have-been world of hypothetically greater
innovation instead of the present, which has not yet created
widespread consumer dissatisfaction. Where's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   From every imaginable angle of interrogation, Warden hit the
same theme.
</P>
<P>
   The government has contended that through exclusionary deals
with computer makers and gateway services to the Internet like
America Online, Microsoft made it more difficult and expensive for
Netscape to distribute its browser. Microsoft's power to engage in
this exclusionary behavior, the government adds, derives from the
``chokehold'' monopoly the company enjoys because 90 percent of all
personal computers run the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it true, Warden asked pointedly, that 26 million
copies of Netscape's browser were downloaded over the Internet
during the first eight months of this year? ``I wouldn't dispute
the number,'' Barksdale replied.
</P>
<P>
   Warden then introduced internal Netscape documents showing that
the company plans to distribute 159 million copies of its browser
over the next 12 months. He asked Barksdale for an estimate of the
number of Web sites from which computer users can download Netscape
software, and Barksdale replied that there were said to be more
than 20,000 such Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it true,'' Warden asked, ``that any home user who has a
PC and an Internet connection may freely choose at no cost
Netscape's Web-browsing software?''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale replied testily, and reasonably, that most people
don't take the time and trouble to download software. That, he
said, gives Microsoft a big advantage because of its deals making
Internet Explorer the main browser offered by leading personal
computer companies and America Online, which are the key
distribution channels to home users.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Warden's point was made. Microsoft's monopoly appears to
be a pretty leaky chokehold, at least when it comes to software
distribution in the Internet era. Where's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   And Warden got personal with Barksdale. Microsoft's strategy
against Netscape may have been to ``cut off their air supply,'' in
the memorable phrase of one senior Microsoft executive. And
competing with Microsoft has been difficult, but the result could
scarcely be characterized as financial ruin for Netscape and its
leaders. Warden asked Barksdale to calculate the value of his
Netscape shares. More than $100 million, he replied. Where's the
harm?
</P>
<P>
   With this line of defense, antitrust experts say, Microsoft is
playing a strong hand. As William Kovacic, a visiting professor at
the George Washington University Law School observes: Since the
mid-1970s, when the United States began facing more global economic
competition, federal courts have tended to view big companies as
engines of innovation and economic efficiency that should be left
alone, unless their behavior can be proved to harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment of the courts, Kovacic notes, has been that the
antitrust laws should not be used to put ``saddlebags on
thoroughbreds.''
</P>
<P>
   But in its case, the government is asking the court to weigh
considerations beyond the current welfare of consumers and health
of the industry that Microsoft dominates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department is saying that we want the race of
modern capitalism to be a fast one, but we also want to make sure
that the winner succeeds because he is the fastest runner not
because he tripped the guy next to him,'' said Carl Shapiro, a
professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a former
senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   The government has contended that in specific meetings with
Netscape, Intel and Apple Computer, for example, Microsoft sought
to intimidate rivals and bully its partners to help it curb
competition. Look closely at what Microsoft did, the prosecutors
say, and the picture that emerges is of a monopolist at work,
illegally using its market power to squelch competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's strategy for refuting these contentions is twofold:
fiercely dispute the Justice Department's evidence by mustering any
available e-mail or snippet of deposition testimony that can be
used to undermine the government's interpretation of events, and
constantly return to the theme that even if Microsoft behaved
badly, there is little evidence to show that the economy or
consumers were hurt as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The linchpin of the Microsoft defense is that, yes, the company
may be big, powerful and even nasty at times _ ``the antitrust laws
are not a code of civility in business,'' Warden reminded the court
_ but the company presides over a sector of the economy for which
it is hard to argue that the ``dead hand of monopoly'' is at work.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Microsoft is asking: Where's the harm?

GORE HELPS BREAK GROUND FOR OKLAHOMA BOMBING MEMORIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Standing upon the flattened ground where a
federal office building stood until a bomb brought it down more
than three years ago, Vice President Al Gore broke ground Sunday on
a memorial to the 168 people killed as well as the ordinary people
who helped Oklahoma City's physical and spiritual rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we gather to seek the light, to find in this soil,
nourished with a million tears, the harvest of God's healing
grace,'' Gore said before he and about two dozen local, state and
federal officials, as well as relatives of some who were killed,
dug out the first shovelfuls of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma City National Memorial, which is planned to include
an empty chair for everyone who died, a reflecting pool and a
National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism and
Violence, is expected to open late next year. Former Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney, who is serving as national fund-raising
chairman for the memorial, said officials have raised about $18
million of the $24.1 million needed to build the project.
</P>
<P>
   At once, the scene of the ground-breaking was haunting and
hopeful. Still surrounding the three acres where the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building once stood were shells of other places
devastated by the blast, including a YMCA and the main office of
The Oklahoma City Journal-Record, a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary stage from which Gore, Attorney General Janet
Reno, Gov. Frank Keating and other officials spoke was erected
almost at the very spot where a Ryder rental truck was parked at
9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, when it disintegrated from the power
of the bomb it carried.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Blanchard, who worked at the U.S. Army recruiting office
in the Murrah building and spoke on behalf of the victims, said the
day of the explosion would ``burn hot in the hearts, minds, bodies
and souls of many Americans across this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other reminders of the tragedy, ones that symbolize
the spirit of Oklahomans who have vowed not to let the worst act of
domestic terrorism in the nation's history blunt the memories of
those who died. A chain-link fence surrounding the site that grew
to life with cards, flowers and other condolences will become part
of the memorial. So will a small elm tree nearby that survived the
blast. Locals have named it the Survivor Tree.
</P>
<P>
   Unmentioned by name through the ceremonies were the two men
responsible for the bombing. One, Timothy McVeigh, was found guilty
of conspiracy and murder in a federal trial last year in Denver and
was sentenced to death; the other, Terry Nichols, was convicted of
conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to life
without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But their acts provided Gore and Ms. Reno yet another
opportunity to promote the federal government's efforts against all
forms of terrorist activity. The budget signed last week included
an increase of nearly $3 billion to combat terrorism, largely as a
result of the recent bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar
Es-Saalam, but also, Gore said, as a result of the bombing here.
</P>
<P>
   `'We will not back down in the face of terrorism,'' Ms. Reno
said. `'We will carry on and do our duty to the country and the
people we serve, and we will not be intimidated by terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the trip to Oklahoma City was one of his few outside
Washington in recent months for nonpolitical purposes. Indeed, but
for the administration officials who traveled here with him, he was
virtually surrounded by Oklahoma Republicans through the
ceremonies, including Keating, Sen. Don Nickles and Reps. J.C.
Watts, Ernest Istook and Frank Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's entire congressional delegation is Republican, and
all those running for re-election this year _ six House members and
Nickles _ are expected to defeat their Democratic opponents without
much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gore made a point of the nonpartisan nature of efforts
to help Oklahoma heal. He praised the strength of all the ordinary
citizens who pitched in and credited Republicans for helping the
administration win the extra money to fight terrorism.

IN FLORIDA KEYS, HURRICANE EXPOSED SAFETY HAZARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JIM CARRIER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG PINE KEY, Fla. _ It was not the 5 inches of gray muck that
covered their once-green lawn or even their water-sopped mobile
home _ its floors gone, its furniture ruined _ that disheartened
Bob Dagnall and Dawn Kawzinsky.
</P>
<P>
   One month after Hurricane Georges pushed 6 feet of water across
the sea-level Sands subdivision, leaving the couple an
uninhabitable shell with a $39,000 mortgage, they learned that
rebuilding here would require a special home on 12-foot pillars on
a downsized lot.
</P>
<P>
   The likely cost, under present codes, is $80,000. Their
insurance may pay only $12,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before the storm, we were legal,'' said Dagnall, a
mechanic. ``Today, it's a no-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For people in the Florida Keys, Georges revealed the fragility
of a 100-mile archipelago connected to the mainland by wires, a
pipe and a single highway. In scattered places on Big Pine Key, 30
miles from Key West, power is still out, water is unsafe to drink
and hundreds are homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But the hurricane also exposed here what Bob Herman, director of
growth management for Monroe County calls ``sins of yesterday'':
grandfathered or unenforced sanitation, and building and flood
regulations that, for years, allowed uncontrolled and unsafe
development.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said the storm damaged 150 to 200 mobile homes so badly
that they would require new building permits, kicking in federal
regulations for elevated foundations in flood zones and state
requirements to replace any illegal cesspools with $8,000 septic
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The storm also flooded scores of illegal ground-floor apartments
in raised houses. ``There may be 6,000 of these mother-in-law
rooms, many of them rented to people who work in the tourist
business,'' Herman said. After the storm, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency provided temporary housing for 1,600 people.
</P>
<P>
   To help homeowners recover, Monroe County is allowing them to
spend up to $2,500 for storm repairs without a permit. But there is
evidence that some residents are hurriedly patching up homes and
apartments to avoid the tougher regulations. There is also
political pressure to relax codes for people already hard-hit.
</P>
<P>
   In Key West, for example, a high-profile fight is under way to
preserve the 11 surviving floating homes on the quaint but
controversial Houseboat Row. Before the hurricane, its 26 units
dumped raw sewage into shallow water along a seawall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm is an opportunity for this community to make some
important decisions about their future, as we try to reconstruct
ourselves,'' said Jack Teague, the state Health Department's
environmental administrator in the Keys. ``The question will be
`Will we use it to improve ourselves or simply perpetuate the
problems that we've been facing before the storm?'''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups say the storm only made obvious their
long-standing argument that the Keys are overdeveloped. ``The fact
is, these waste water systems are leaching into canals and
near-shore waters every day,'' said David Holtz, the local
representative of the Center for Marine Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 4,000 illegal
cesspools remain in the Keys, but studies show that conventional
septic drain fields also leak into the sea within 12 to 24 hours
after a toilet is flushed. When they were built in the 1950s and
1960s, homeowners routinely knocked a hole in the bottom of septic
tanks to prevent the tanks from floating out of the ground during
storm surges, said Gene Shinn of the U.S. Geological Survey, who
grew up in the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Shinn told a federal task force led by Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt that the sewage is contributing to the
decline of the Keys coral reef, visited by 1.5 million tourists a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The waste issue has become more urgent after preliminary
findings by scientists working for the environmental agency that
virus pathogens from waste water exist in sea water near shore. Dr.
Joan Rose of the University of South Florida said levels are high
enough that residents who swim year-round in canals contaminated by
septic systems are likely to get sick.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of government agencies and environmental groups has
asked a reluctant Congress for $200 million to build central sewer
systems in the Keys. They argue that the law creating the Florida
Keys National Marine Sanctuary in 1990 demands federal protection
of its waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people have put in too many illegal fixtures, and
that has to be corrected. The party's over,'' said John Hankinson
Jr., the environmental agency's regional administrator who chairs
the group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If Congress declines, the coalition is suggesting a toll on U.S.
1, the highway built by the federal government to encourage
visitors after the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The road, paralleled by power lines and a water pipe from the
mainland, fueled growth in the 1960s. By 1976, whole islands had
been stripped of vegetation and hundreds of miles of canals had
been dug for developments. That year, the state took legal control
of Keys growth, although lawsuits delayed a growth management plan
until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the county's growth-management plan, 255 new homes can be
built a year outside Key West, provided each homeowner pays for the
removal of a cesspool somewhere in the county. All construction has
been halted on Big Pine Key. The plan also requires a study, now
being carried out by the Army Corps of Engineers, to determine the
Keys' carrying capacity, or the number of residents and tourists it
would take to irreversibly harm the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Georges caused widespread devastation, for some
residents its timing was impeccable. Donna Hastie, for one, is
looking forward to a new home to replace a trailer crushed by a
tree on a tiny lot in the Saddlebunch Keys. Ms. Hastie, who works
as a controller for a restaurant, had just received a notice to
replace her cesspool.
</P>
<P>
   She expects to get a federal low-interest loan that will cover
both the cost of a new home 8 feet off the ground and a new aerobic
waste-water system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a disaster can ever come at a good time,'' Ms. Hastie said,
``this was it.''

<P>
   ROME _ Lifting her 4-year-old son from the seat of a blue Honda
moped, Federica Frontani, 33, tenderly kissed him and warned him to
play carefully at preschool.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she risked driving her child by moped through Rome's
notoriously speedy and chaotic traffic, Mrs. Frontani said that the
distance was too long to walk and that the streets were too clogged
for cars. Asked why neither she nor he wore a helmet, she replied,
``They do not make helmets small enough for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? ``Well, actually it is illegal to put children on
mopeds,'' she said with a sheepish smile. ``But in this city, what
else can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Italians, and particularly Romans, are addicted to motorbikes.
As cars frozen in mile-long traffic jams honk angrily, Vespas,
Hondas and Piaggios career forward, scattering pedestrians like
pigeons in St. Peter's Square. Mopeds dart around buses, speed
through red lights and zoom the wrong way on one-way streets,
buzzing the Colosseum like Audrey Hepburn in ``Roman Holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody drives them. Teen-agers and businessmen alike smoke
and talk on cell phones as they drive. Mothers sometimes pile on
two children, one in front and one clinging behind.
</P>
<P>
   Until he was elected in 1993, the mayor of Rome, Francesco
Rutelli, proudly drove his Honda SF Fifty moped around the capital.
His security detail dissuaded him from driving it to City Hall _
but they were worried about terrorist attacks, not traffic
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and government agencies battling to
bring safety standards up to a European par find themselves
fighting some of Italy's most entrenched cultural traits.
``Unfortunately, we are a nation of scofflaws,'' said Giuseppe
Cesaro, spokesman for the Automobile Club of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Cesaro said many of the mothers who fearlessly ferry their
bareheaded toddlers on mopeds are the same who, at the beach, run
screaming into the water to pluck out children who try to go
swimming less than an hour after their lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to list all the contradictions of Italy,'' he
said wearily, ``it would fill an encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the consequences are lethal. Between 1989 and 1995, European
countries on average brought down the mortality rates from traffic
accidents by 14 percent. In Italy, however, deaths rose by 2
percent, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the
European Commission. Safety laws and even common-sense precautions
are routinely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sicurstrada, a traffic safety research center in
Bologna, only about 36 percent of moped drivers in Italy wear
helmets, which are not mandatory for drivers over 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the numbers change drastically from North to
South,'' said Sandro Vedovi, national coordinator of Sicurstrada.
``I've been told that in southern Italy, police stop you if you are
wearing a helmet _ because they suspect you are about to commit a
crime.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government hopes that if and when amendments are made to the
traffic code that will require all drivers of mopeds to wear
helmets, people will start complying.
</P>
<P>
   Many Italians are skeptical. Despite a 1988 law requiring seat
belts, only 10 percent of Italians buckle up, compared with 92
percent of Germans and 68 percent of Americans, according to a 1997
study conducted by the University of Birmingham, in England.
</P>
<P>
   All cars in Italy are required to provide seat belts in front
and in back, but that has not prompted Italians to fasten them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised my men that if they ever found one Italian who
buckled his back seat belt, I'd buy him the best fish dinner in
Rimini,'' said Chief Inspector Giordano Biserni, president of the
Association of Supporters and Friends of the Traffic Police. ``So
far, not one has succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy has passed laws requiring all motorcycle drivers to wear
helmets. Children under 18 are also required to wear helmets on
mopeds. Italian law also prohibits children or even adults from
being passengers on mopeds. But on any street in Rome, and
particularly in Naples, it is obvious that there are more toddlers
and adult passengers on mopeds than there are helmets on drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more public awareness,'' Biserni said. ``And we need
tighter enforcement. We have to give tickets without hesitation.''
He sighed. ``The Italian traffic police are too nice, particularly
to women.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there have been attempts to increase both public
awareness and police ruthlessness. It is no longer uncommon to see
police road traps on major streets of Rome, where groups of police
officers, finding severity in numbers, flag down offenders and
ignore their pleas for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Ministry of Public Works began Italy's biggest
public awareness campaign with television and radio ads and
billboards that for the first time pressed helmet use.
</P>
<P>
   The ads showed a caption that read: ``What helmet? I never
fall.'' It was placed above a white chalk police outline of a
corpse. But experts say such campaigns have so far not yielded much
change.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents are beginning to pay heed. Too often, it comes too
late. One of the most noticed helmet campaigns was the one mounted
by the parents of Andrea Bordignon, an 18-year-old high school
senior in Treviso who was killed this summer on his motorcycle. A
collision caused him to hit his unprotected head on cement.
</P>
<P>
   Before his funeral and on the day of his funeral, his family and
friends posted signs all over town with a picture of a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath, the caption read: ``I forgot to put on my helmet.
And now it is too late to do it. Let my memory be a warning to
you.''

   ICHINOSETAKAHASHI, Japan _ The principal's office in the little
country school here has a gleaming new bell and loudspeaker system
to broadcast messages and summon the student body from recess. But
it would be simpler to yell through the window for Daiki Saito to
come in.
</P>
<P>
   Daiki, an impetuous 7-year-old with a mischievous sparkle in
black eyes that dance beneath bushy eyebrows, is the only student
in the entire school.
</P>
<P>
   This boxy, cream-colored schoolhouse is a monument to Japan's
commitment to equality _ and also to Japanese inefficiency. Daiki
is the sole child living in this little village surrounded by
forests in the foothills of Mount Fuji, but the government spent
more than $100,000 renovating an abandoned old schoolhouse for
Daiki and then assigned him his own first grade teacher and
principal. It costs $175,000 a year to run Daiki's school.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan struggles to revive its economy and avert a global
recession, it is under enormous pressure to make itself more
efficient and thus stimulate a new burst of economic growth. But it
finds itself profoundly torn, for efficiency would come at the
price of egalitarianism and other values that many Japanese regard
as at least as important as economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, everybody calls for reforms and efficiency,'' said
Tomishige Yazaki, Daiki's principal. ``But if we just pursue
efficiency, the world would become a very dry place, with no
sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is often denounced as recalcitrant and paralyzed as its
economy sinks into its worst recession in six decades, and it is
true that Japanese leaders have spent years denying the existence
of economic nettles instead of grasping them. But in some respects
this is a principled paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economic catastrophe has harmed all of Asia and arises
largely from political incompetence, endemic corruption, webs of
relationships that misallocate resources and a parliamentary system
that hugely overrepresents the most backward parts of the country.
Some of Japan's most serious delays, such as confronting its bad
debts and banking instability, have involved more paralysis than
principle. Yet while everyone around the globe is complaining about
how bad Japan is, in other respects the problem is that it has been
too good.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have long known of the ``paradox of thrift,'' which
states that although it is admirable to save, a country that saves
too much ends up hurting itself. That is one of Japan's ailments,
but more broadly it is being pummeled by what might be called a
``paradox of virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy is in deep recession in part for reasons that, in an
old-fashioned way, seem honorable: a passion for prudent fiscal
planning, for stamping out inflation, for saving for the future and
perhaps most important of all, concern for the human flotsam of
capitalism and for equality for all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's commitment to equality is intricately linked in at least
two ways to its economic crisis _ and the world's. First, it is
producing a welfare state for the inefficient, leading to a growing
misallocation of resources in the world's second-largest economy.
Second, the impulse to improve the quality of life in remote areas
by building tiny schools and countless mountain roads has helped
send costs spiraling out of control. Soaring budget deficits and
concern about how to pay for the retirement of Japan's baby boomers
led the government to raise taxes last year.
</P>
<P>
   There is now broad agreement that the tax increase was a fatal
misstep that plunged Japan into recession. But even if its timing
was catastrophic, Japan was trying to do what economists believe is
in principle the right thing: reduce budget deficits and plan for
the aging of the baby-boom generation. All industrialized countries
face this challenge but most have put off the hard decisions, while
Japan's leaders last year ignored its economic weakness and
confronted the problem by raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, this was as foolish as it was well-intentioned,
and the results were calamitous: Japan's economy fell to pieces,
and the government now says that economic output will contract this
fiscal year for the second year in a row. The stock market is at a
12-year low, and Japan's biggest banks _ eight of which have assets
worth as much as the entire Russian gross national product _ are
wobbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has found itself in the position of fighting the last
major economic war, the Great Depression,'' said Adam Posen, a
scholar at the Institute for International Economics in Washington
and author of a new book on Japan's economy. ``And its government
has chosen to pursue the strategy that lost that war.''
</P>
<P>
   Posen and many other economists here and abroad recommend a
gigantic fiscal stimulus, such as a huge new spending program
coupled with tax cuts. Japan has reluctantly taken steps in that
direction, but it has dithered because huge spending increases seem
so, well, irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Japan finds itself hampered as well in its monetary policy,
because in the past it attacked inflation so relentlessly that
interest rates are extremely low. That makes it difficult to ease
monetary policy by lowering rates further, and so some experts are
urging Japan to get out of this box by pledging to be irresponsible
and taking steps to nurture inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that for a diligent, serious nation like Japan,
the present economic crisis is a nightmare: it is being scolded on
all sides and advised that it must be more fiscally reckless and
monetarily irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   A fiscal or monetary stimulus may rescue Japan in the short run,
but most economists here and abroad say that in the longer term
Japan must restructure its economy and pay much more attention to
efficiency rather than equality. Yet the calls for efficiency run
smack into the egalitarianism that has been a national ideology
since the end of World War II, when a defeated Japan was told of
the evils of its traditions of authoritarianism and hierarchy.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Many economists and business leaders say that an obsession with
equality is stifling Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Take the government's building projects. They are partly a way
of showing thanks to construction companies, which contribute
mightily to the Liberal Democrats. Yet these projects also seem to
reflect an egalitarian commitment to improve the lives of people in
remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Ikarajima, a sleepy little islet in southern Japan that is
home to only 350 people, a dazzling new $125 million steel bridge
rises like a mirage, to connect one end of the island with a
neighboring island. The bridge, built in 1996 to replace a ferry
that used to take 15 minutes, cost $357,000 for each resident of
Ikarajima.
</P>
<P>
   That led to some sniping about waste of money, and so plans for
a $250 million bridge on the other side of Ikarajima have been put
on hold for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The island people have been eagerly waiting for this new
bridge, but now because of reports of waste, they are deprived even
of their dreams,'' Kenzo Uehara, a town official on the island,
said. ``I don't know that you can criticize these projects just by
the logic of numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most breathtaking economic inefficiencies is the
expenditure on tiny schools with just a handful of students. While
Daiki's case is unusual, another school near Ichinosetakahashi also
has just a single pupil, and so does a school in the southern city
of Kumamoto.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Ministry says it does not know how many
single-student schools there are in Japan. But it says that the
country has 3,324 elementary schools _ 14 percent of the total _
with fewer than 50 students in all grades put together.
</P>
<P>
   Why run an entire school for a single student, regardless of
cost? The main reason is obliviousness to costs, coupled with a
feeling of obligation to rural communities that want their children
to have a neighborhood school just like city kids. But Japan's
sometimes rigid bureaucracy can also be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   In Daiki's case, the neighboring town operates an elementary
school just 20 minutes away. But the authorities say that because
that school falls under a different administrative region, it is
inconceivable that Daiki go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be less costly, and we would be happy to make such an
arrangement if it were possible,'' said Tadashi Michibayashi, an
official in the Enzan board of education. ``But we in the
administration have to draw the line somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the various elements of egalitarianism, Japan is particularly
proud of its even distribution of income. The richest fifth of the
population in Japan enjoys a total income four times as great as
that of the poorest fifth _ compared to almost nine times as much
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several global studies have found that an egalitarian
distribution of income helps promote economic growth within a
country. But by most counts Japan takes it too far.
</P>
<P>
   Japan relies on 65 percent marginal tax rates _ its tax system
is among the most progressive in the world _ and Japanese companies
suppress income differentials by paying employees according to
seniority rather than merit. These tax rates and corporate
practices reflect a psychology of egalitarianism, many say, that
has tended to suppress entrepreneurship and hold back the most
talented sector of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was here in high school, there were four classes of
about 50 kids each in my 11th-grade class,'' said Robert Alan
Feldman, who first came to Japan as an exchange student and is now
chief economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo. ``And as I looked
around, it struck me that there were a couple of really bright kids
in each class, and a bunch of medium kids and a bunch of dumb kids.
And I asked the teacher, `Well, why don't you track the kids in
some way, like have a bright class?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``And he gave me an answer I'll never forget. He said: `It
wouldn't be democratic.' And I thought, gee, these people define
democracy very differently.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Japan seems troubled by economic changes that are
beneficial overall but that make losers out of some people.
Creating losers would upset the society's ``wa,'' or harmony, a
value that has been central to Japanese society at least since
Prince Shotoku in 604 proclaimed a constitution decreeing ``Wa must
be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on wa often impresses visitors, but it also
results in paralysis. Japan has difficulty carrying out changes
that benefit the majority but that are vigorously opposed by a
small group of prospective losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is a society of consensus, and as long as 30 percent of
the population holds out against a decision, the government will
not act,'' said Yoshio Hatano, a former ambassador to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions between the United States and Japan thus seem to
arise from not just Tokyo's political paralysis but more
fundamentally from a set of enormously different attitudes and
values, not just about economics but about life itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at two ends of the spectrum, the U.S. and Japan,'' said
Masaru Yoshitomi, one of Japan's leading economists.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshitomi noted that Japan's egalitarianism runs so deep that
when schoolchildren take part in Sports Day activities, the prizes
often go not just to the winners of the races but to absolutely
every child who takes part. He suggested that this takes equality
too far, breeding cohesion but suppressing the excellence that
drives a modern economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no outstanding people in Japan,'' Yoshitomi said,
only partly joking, ``and that has to change.''

FAT ZAPPING IS A DREAM COME TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My wife Alice swears that all of her nocturnal dreams are
projected in technicolor. Mine are black and white.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable. Alice is an ``eyes'' person. My specialty
is noses. Even in my dreams, I can sniff out something good to eat.
</P>
<P>
   I now learn I have a soul mate. Betty Ann Richmond confesses
that she has dreamed of lamb shanks.
</P>
<P>
   I have dreamed of lamb shanks, too. But mine was more of a
nightmare, because I wasn't allowed to eat the lamb shanks in my
dream.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time now, Bo Peep's sheep have occupied a prominent
place on the American Medical Association hit list. That concerned
Richmond for professional reasons. She is a psychotherapist,
specializing in eating disorders. As a part of her mission, she
hopes to teach patients (and friends) how to cook and enjoy
healthful meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe I actually had a dream about lamb shanks!?''
she wrote in a recent letter. ``They are tasty, moderately priced
but are extremely fatty. My dream had to do with cooking the lamb
shanks in the microwave to drain some of the fat content. Voila,
next day I tried it, and it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond now suspects the microwave could solve a lot of cooking
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have been reluctant to barbecue meat because of
carcinogens, the microwave is the answer,'' she suggests.
``Reducing the fat before grilling eliminates the carcinogen
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Tell me the truth. Can't
you actually smell these lamb shanks?
</P>
<P>
   Nocturnal Lamb Shanks
</P>
<P>
   8 meaty lamb shanks
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   5 teaspoons chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 medium carrots, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   3 stalks celery, diced
</P>
<P>
   1 28-ounce can chopped tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried white beans
</P>
<P>
   10 cups turkey (or chicken) broth
</P>
<P>
   Lots of fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   Freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   A day ahead, soak the dried beans in water to cover. Obviously,
this is going to be a long dream.
</P>
<P>
   The shanks should weigh about a pound apiece. Place them in the
microwave in batches and cook long enough to drain the fat. Dry
each shank with paper towels, then sear the lamb in a large, iron
kettle. Brown each shank quickly over high heat. Add a bit of broth
if needed to reduce smoking.
</P>
<P>
   When shanks are browned, remove and deglaze the pot with a bit
more turkey broth. Add the onion and garlic and saute in the broth,
covered, for about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove lid, add the carrots, celery, tomatoes and drained beans.
Pour in enough broth to cover the beans. Cook on a slow simmer for
about 2 hours, adding broth as needed to keep beans covered. When
the lamb and beans are tender, you could refrigerate the pot so
that you can skim off more fat. But Richmond says there won't be
much to skim.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you dish up the lamb feast immediately or reheat it
tomorrow, place a lamb shank on each plate and surround with beans
and vegetables. Spoon liquid over and around shanks and top with
rosemary and Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a microwave oven, go over to Richmond's house
and use hers, if her husband, Louis, will let you in. Otherwise you
may have to serve another low-fat meal, like this one:
</P>
<P>
   Baked Chicken
</P>
<P>
   8 chicken thighs, boned and skinned
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup dry bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon dried rosemary
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon onion powder
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   One-eights teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Combine all the dry ingredients in a pie plate.
</P>
<P>
   Dip each thigh into buttermilk, then roll in the crumb mixture.
I don't mean that you, personally, should roll in the crumb
mixture. There wouldn't be enough to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Place the coated thighs on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Shove
into a preheated, 325-degree oven and bake until done, about 50
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have buttermilk, add a teaspoon of vinegar to whole
milk and let sit a couple of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This is supposed to serve four.
</P>
<P>
   In your dreams!

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART FORCED TO GIVEAWAY FOUR ART WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CAROL VOGEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As one of the founders of the Museum of Modern Art,
Abby Aldrich Rockefeller was steadfast in her conviction that the
institution be devoted only to new art.
</P>
<P>
   When she wrote her will a year before her death in 1948, she
remained true to her vision. Mrs. Rockefeller left the Modern four
important drawings, two by van Gogh and two by Seurat, that have
become among the most prized works in its collection, but the
bequest was subject to a curious stipulation.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 years, when in Mrs. Rockefeller's estimation the
drawings would no longer be considered new, the will specified that
the Modern had to give the works to specific rival institutions
that did not have the same exclusive commitment to art of the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The dreaded day arrived earlier this month, and the Modern was
forced to send the van Goghs, which together are valued at more
than $40 million, 30 blocks north to the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. The Seurats, together worth about $1.5 million, were shipped
to the Art Institute of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're irreplaceable,'' said Glenn Lowry, director of the
Museum of Modern Art, who described the loss of the drawings as
``painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan, refrained
from crowing. ``The important thing is that they're staying in New
York and joining the largest group of van Goghs on this
hemisphere,'' he said. The Met's collection now includes 18
paintings and six drawings by van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   That Mrs. Rockefeller's wishes are unusual is an understatement.
Few museum bequests come with such specific strings attached.
Museum officials said she made no other bequests with such
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rockefeller was the wife of financier John D. Rockefeller
Jr., a major benefactor of the Metropolitan. She founded the Modern
with Mary Quinn Sullivan and Lillie P. Bliss in 1929. They hired
Alfred H. Barr Jr. and his structuring helped define the mission of
the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rockefeller's will addressed just that. In her eyes,
anything that was not new or of the moment did not belong in an
institution that called itself modern; such works would be better
suited for a museum like the Met, with its encyclopedic collection
of world art.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the Met is the new owner of a haunting scene of the
``Hospital Corridor at St.-Remy,'' an 1889 gouache in rich tones of
ochre depicting the hospital's bleak, deserted hallways that van
Gogh made for his brother, Theo, while the artist was a patient
there. The other drawing, ``Street at Stes.-Maries,'' which van
Gogh made a year earlier, shows a row of cottages along a narrow
street leading to the Mediterranean, with a sailboat drawn only as
a distant speck. The drawing, with its signature swirls and
hatchings, is considered by experts to be a first-rate example of
the artist's masterly use of pen and ink.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to send the Seurats to the Art Institute of Chicago
was understandable. The drawings are studies for Seurat's
masterpiece ``Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte''
(1884-1886), which was among several important paintings given to
the Art Institute by Frederick Clay Bartlett, a Chicago collector,
in 1926. The painting has become an iconic image for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already own two large crayon drawings of trees that were
studies for the painting, as well as an oil sketch that was an
early idea for the painting,'' said Teri Edelstein, deputy director
of the Art Institute. ``But until now we didn't have any figures,
so this is particularly exciting for us. The Museum of Modern Art
was obviously Mrs. Rockefeller's passion, and she wanted audiences
there to enjoy these drawings, but ultimately she realized they
belonged with the painting.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, officials at the Met and the Art Institute
sent the Modern friendly notes reminding the museum that the clock
was ticking. ``It was all very collegial,'' said Colta Ives, a
curator in the drawings and prints department at the Met. ``Many of
us feel we're working in tandem with a sister institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Collegial, perhaps, but through the years, all the institutions
involved have broadened the time span of their collections and
become more competitive in courting important collectors for gifts
and bequests.
</P>
<P>
   So parting with prized drawings hurt the Modern. ``Why doesn't
the Met give us the drawings on permanent loan?'' Lowry asked when
told that the Met sympathized with its loss. Officials at the Met
responded that the Modern was welcome to borrow the works at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lowry added that ``had Abby Aldrich Rockefeller been alive
today, it would have been unlikely she would have given them to the
Met'' because the roles of the Met and the Modern have changed
dramatically since her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, in those days the Modern was supposed to stay
modern,'' said William S. Lieberman, chairman of the Metropolitan's
20th-century art department. At least that was what Lieberman and
his colleagues strove for when he was hired by Mrs. Rockefeller as
a young curator at the Modern in the early 1940s. ``The Modern has
become a historic museum, which was not its original mission,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But 1947, the year Mrs. Rockefeller wrote her will, was a
soul-searching period for three New York museums: the Metropolitan,
the Modern and the Whitney Museum of American Art. And had things
gone as planned, their fates would have been inextricably linked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for a brief moment that year the institutions formally
agreed that the Whitney would merge with the Metropolitan, its
collection joining an expanded American wing at the Met. Meanwhile,
the Met and the Modern would each play a distinct role.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both museums were then eager to pool their
collections, the Met being devoted primarily to the ``visual arts
of the past,'' as the agreement read, and the Modern to the
``encouragement and study of the visual arts of the present and
recent past.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinking was that the healthiest way for the Modern to stay
modern would be to routinely sell older works that could be
considered classics in order to raise money to acquire new works.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement made definite distinctions between modern and
classic art. Modern art was ``any painting, drawing, print or
sculpture by a living artist and any such work of art by a deceased
artist which is still significant in the contemporary movement in
art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Classic art,'' as the agreement called it, included ``all
other paintings, drawings, prints or sculpture which have become
part of the cultural history of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the Met lent the Modern a Maillol
sculpture, ``Chained Action,'' and a Picasso portrait of Gertrude
Stein, works considered too avant-garde for the Met. (The works
ultimately went back to the Met.) A long list of paintings that
included some of the Modern's prized Cezannes, Matisses, Picassos
and Seurats were to be sold to the Met.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early 1950s, the agreement unraveled. Although the
Met acquired about a dozen works, including two Picassos, ``Woman
in White'' and ``La Coiffure,'' the identities of the two
institutions had already begun to change. At the same time,
pragmatic considerations had come to the fore, like the market
value of the art, which had escalated since the agreement was made.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefellers were one of this country's greatest
philanthropic couples and their gifts were often defined by their
art collections. The Modern was her passion, the Met was his. He
gave the museum numerous works of Chinese and ancient Near Eastern
art, and his most prominent gift was the Cloisters, the museum of
medieval art in Fort Tryon Park in upper Manhattan. The gift
included medieval art (the unicorn tapestries, for example), land
on which to build and the remnants of chapels, cathedrals and
monasteries from Europe that were combined to become the Cloisters.
Rockefeller even bought a large stretch of the Palisades on the
west side of the Hudson River to preserve the museum's view.
</P>
<P>
   Given this strong link to the Met and following the spirit of
the agreement, it is understandable that Mrs. Rockefeller decided
that the Met should have the van Goghs.
</P>
<P>
   The Met and the Art Institute of Chicago are planning
exhibitions that include their new treasures. Though the Art
Institute has not set a date, the Met plans to show five of its van
Gogh drawings in the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Gallery for Prints and
Drawings from Dec. 1 to Feb. 7. Also on view at the same time, in
the nearby 19th-century European paintings and sculpture galleries,
will be 12 of the museum's van Gogh's paintings.

EUROPEAN LAW AIMS TO PROTECT PRIVACY OF PERSONAL DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The European Union put into effect a law
Sunday prohibiting U.S.-style buying and selling of personal data,
a move that could interrupt electronic commerce with the United
States if the two sides fail to resolve deep philosophical and
legal differences over protecting privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the European law is to prohibit companies from using
information about their customers in ways the customers never
intended _ for example, selling it to other companies for use as a
marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   The new law affects an enormous range of information that
companies collect about people in the course of daily business,
from credit-card transactions to magazine subscriptions to
telephone records, as well as the electronic footprints that people
leave when they visit sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The law was adopted three years ago by the European Union after
a majority of its 15 member nations agreed to issue what is known
as a directive. Under European law, each member nation is required
to implement the directive by enacting its own law. Six nations
have drafted or passed such laws so far.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its impact on Europe, the directive has the potential to
disrupt electronic commerce with the United States. A key provision
of the new measure would prohibit any company doing business in the
European Union from transmitting personal data to any country that
does not guarantee comparable privacy protection _ foremost among
them, at this point, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American direct-marketing companies, which make money buying,
selling and developing business strategies based on huge data banks
of personal information about consumers, have lobbied hard against
government regulation of their industry. As a result, the Clinton
administration has adopted a more laissez-faire approach under
which data industries would be allowed to police themselves through
self-regulatory organizations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they agree with Europe on the basic principle
that privacy should be protected but they have big differences
about the best way to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have privacy czars and bureaucracies, and that kind of
top-down approach would probably be regarded as a violation of
privacy rights by many people in the U.S.,'' David Aaron,
undersecretary of commerce, said of European nations.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, who held talks on the issue with European officials in
Brussels, Belgium, earlier this month, added, ``We say, `Let's
create a situation where, if companies agree to follow certain data
practices, they can be held harmless under the new directive.'''
</P>
<P>
   If the issue, which neither side paid much attention to until a
few months ago, is not resolved, European officials could
theoretically soon begin to block trans-Atlantic data transfers by
multinational corporations and the growing number of Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   European officials say they have no plans for any blockades
soon, and are hopeful about reaching a peaceful resolution.
Officials from the United States and Europe say they held
constructive positive discussions earlier this month. The European
Commission has scheduled a meeting on the issue for Monday, and it
is expected to seek some kind of temporary solution while the two
sides negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the debate is a deeper political issue that is
fraught with cultural baggage. For years, European nations have
been far tougher than the United States about protecting privacy.
Many countries essentially ban telephone marketing to people's
homes, and that prohibition is now being applied to unsolicited
sales approaches by fax and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Several nations, including Germany and the Netherlands, have
government agencies devoted exclusively to protecting personal
data.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as ombudsmen, these agencies investigate complaints from
individuals who believe that companies have mishandled information
about them. Companies that are accused of violating privacy laws
can be prosecuted under criminal laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great difference in attitudes about privacy
protection between Europe and the United States,'' said Ulrich
Sieber, a law professor at the University of Wuertzburg in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. privacy laws are far more lax and consist of a hodgepodge
of statutes and regulations enforced by various state and federal
agencies charged with oversight of other industries, like, for
instance, those that regulate banks.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast with Europe, an entire industry has arisen in
the United States that specializes in trolling public and private
sources for vast quantities of personal information, like birth
records, drivers' license numbers and torrents of data accumulated
by retailers about customers' individual purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The new European directive embraces several basic principles
that national governments must now translate into their own laws.
It requires that companies tell people when they collect
information about them and disclose how that information will be
used. In addition, customers must provide informed consent before
any company can legally use that data.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires companies to give people access to
information about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they agree with those requirements in
principle, but disagree with giving people unconditional access to
information about themselves, saying access should be allowed only
if it is reasonable or practical to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The more difficult issues are enforcement and policing. Aaron
says the United States wants to give companies a variety of ``safe
harbors'' to satisfy privacy protection. One idea is to create
independent self-regulatory organizations that would monitor a
company's data practices and would give well-behaved companies what
amounts to a stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Another option, they say, should be for companies to deal
directly with European officials and demonstrate that their systems
and practices are appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say the new law could easily take on a life of
its own, because it gives individuals and private organizations the
right to sue companies that they say fail to provide adequate
privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and government officials worry that independent privacy
advocates in Europe will simply invoke the letter of the law and
begin taking U.S. companies to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the idea of creating safe harbors will be
practical, because people can still go ahead and sue a company
regardless of whether the governments reach an agreement among
themselves,'' said Christopher Kuner, a lawyer in Frankfurt who
specializes in European information law.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, government and industry officials predict
that nothing much will happen. Most countries have yet to implement
their own laws to carry out the directive. And several countries,
including Germany, have had tough laws in place for years, and
companies have found ways to deal with the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pioneering cases in Germany involved Citibank, which
ran afoul of German data-protection authorities in 1995. But since
Citibank, which has a major business presence in Germany,
demonstrated to government officials there how its system protected
data in the United States, it has operated without conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of American Express Co. said they had reached similar
agreements in many countries and that they believed they could live
with the new directive. ``It is a crucial issue for us, but it has
not been a burden so far,'' said James Tobin, an American Express
spokesman in London.
</P>
<P>
   John Borking, vice president of the Data Protection Authority of
the Netherlands, said, ``We are not information police, and I
expect that in the whole of Europe nothing will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But, added Borking, European governments will always take
privacy protection seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the beginning of a new information society, and no
one really knows the outcome,'' he said. ``But privacy and trust
are important parts of this society.''

QUESTIONS ARISE OVER CIA'S ROLE IN MIDEAST PEACE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring that he is troubled by the CIA's role in
a new Middle East peace accord, Sen. Richard Shelby, the chairman
of the Select Committee on Intelligence, said Sunday that he would
hold hearings to investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby, R-Ala., said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that he did not
think he could stop the agency from taking on its new role
mediating between Israel and the Palestinians. But he said that he
wanted to find out a great deal more about it from the director of
central intelligence, George Tenet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is troubling, troubling to me, troubling to a lot
of people that have overseen and worked with the CIA and its
mission over the years,'' Shelby said. In the new accord, the
traditional role of the CIA is being expanded ``out into the
open,'' he said. ``The CIA would be the implementer of policy here,
which is a big departure, and I think it's something we have to
look into.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no difficulty with the CIA working quietly, ``in
the background,'' to insure that the Israelis and Palestinians
share information.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace deal worked out on Friday morning after 18
months of drafting and nine days of negotiation, the CIA station
chief in Israel will sit on a committee with the Israeli and
Palestinian security directors. He is to promote Israeli and
Palestinian security cooperation and handle complaints from both
sides. But the agency is also supposed to be a sort of
``validator'' of Palestinian efforts to fight terrorism, both on
its own and with the Israelis. Many of those efforts are laid out
in the agreement, with timetables.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the CIA will validate whether the Palestinian
Authority is working hard to confiscate illegal weapons and is
reducing the size of its police force from more than 40,000 to the
30,000 called for in earlier accords. In addition, the CIA will
insure that at least 30 Palestinians wanted by the Israelis for
terrorism will be incarcerated by the Palestinian Authority and are
not simply arrested and let go again, in what the Israelis call ``a
revolving door.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA is already assisting Israel with sophisticated
border-control devices, with more to come, to allow Palestinians
and their goods to travel in and out of Israel with fewer security
delays for inspections, usually in an effort to find explosives or
weapons. And it is also helping to train the Palestinian security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The new role ``will put people in danger,'' Shelby said. ``This
is a real departure of the traditional role of the CIA,'' which is
to gather intelligence, he continued, ``and I would hope that they
stay within their role, and they would not be something _ border
guards, arbitrators, enforcers of a policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the CIA was already
engaged in similar work, especially in the Middle East. ``The CIA
has played roles previously in terms of monitoring and verifying
other agreements previously in the region,'' Ms. Albright said on
the CBS news program ``Face the Nation.'' She added that the
agency's new role began with an anti-terrorism summit meeting at
Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, in 1996, just before Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was elected.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agency would work in a ``role which assists, to try to deal
with these issues without being personally involved,'' Ms. Albright
said. ``We're there, as we are in the peace talks, always as the
honest broker as assisting in this.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Tenet intended to explain the issues to Congress in any
event, and other officials noted that the agency maintains offices
in the West Bank cities of Hebron, Ramallah and Nablus as well as
one in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   But other senior U.S. and Israeli officials said the CIA role
could also be controversial for different reasons. The agreement
for Israel to hand over another 13 percent of the West Bank in
return for Palestinian steps on security is carried out in three
stages over three months. Israel would have the right to suspend
the agreement _ and the transfer of large amounts of land to the
Palestinians _ if it is judged that the Palestinians are not living
up to their specific security commitments.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be the CIA that will arbitrate that judgment, which
would have major political and security ramifications throughout
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, emphasized that the
agency ``is not enforcing the provisions'' of the accord. ``The CIA
will help to facilitate cooperation,'' he said on the ABC news
program ``This Week.'' ``They'll play an observer role to determine
whether the overall agreement security provisions are being
implemented. That gives both sides a greater degree of
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergeralso said the CIA role was not that new, and that the
agency also played ``a verifying and mediating role'' in the 1973
Sinai disengagement agreement, and continues to do so there and on
the Golan Heights between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, speaking on CNN, said the idea of the CIA playing
this role was an American one, which he accepted. He said that
Israel had a sufficient intelligence capacity, so needed the CIA's
information less than it did the CIA's honesty in judging
Palestinian efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we have to do is to be honest about things, and
to monitor things as they are, if there are violations, to confront
them, not to look aside, because lives are at stake,'' he said.
``The security of Israel is at stake.''

<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ It was all white men on the Supreme Court who
handed down the milestone rulings that helped decide the fate of
American Indians more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here at the University of Kansas School of Law, Indian
lawyers are acting out a legal ``what if'' experiment: What if
Indians had been on the Supreme Court of the 1800s?
</P>
<P>
   Eight American Indian lawyers gathered here on Oct. 10 and
played the roles of justices in an elaborate moot court. The panel
heard a full ``reargument'' of one of the most important of the
early Supreme Court cases, Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia. In the 1831
decision, Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that tribes were not
foreign nations entitled to be dealt with equally but mere
``domestic dependent nations.'' The ruling in Georgia's favor laid
the legal foundation for much that was to come in America's
relations with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The reconsideration of the case is not a carefree task. Years
ago in law school at the University of Wisconsin, said Laura Soap,
one of the moot court justices, she felt no emotion as she studied
the famous Supreme Court rulings dealing with Indians. But as the
arguments have been replayed in the moot court, she said, ``I find
myself getting a little angry, the more I think about it. I find
myself thinking: How am I going to explain this to my kids?'' Ms.
Soap is a Kickapoo Indian; her husband is a Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   The moot court judges surprised no one by announcing after the
arguments that, this time, the Cherokee Nation had won. But, just
like real justices, the eight Indian lawyers are deliberating over
a written opinion to justify their decision. It is to be published
in a law review.
</P>
<P>
   At the invitation of a reporter, Ms. Soap and another of the
justices, Russell Brien, a member of the Iowa tribe, met at the law
school to hash out their views in the drafting of an opinion the
way real judges might. On a bright Kansas afternoon, they struggled
with the history of the legal system's treatment of their people.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall concluded 167 years ago that, no matter how real their
grievances might be, tribes could not appeal to the Supreme Court.
The ruling left the tribes with no redress for acts like the
breaking of treaties and the forced removal of native people from
their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Soap, 38, is an associate justice of the real Supreme Court
of the Sac and Fox Nation of Kansas and Missouri. If she had the
chance to hear the Cherokee case, she said, she would try to be
practical in contending with Marshall's view that the Supreme Court
lacked jurisdiction to hear the Cherokees' case.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she could concede, she said, that the Indians could not
enforce their treaties. But closing the door of the country's
highest court to Indians, she said, diminished the ideals of
America. ``I would talk to Marshall,'' she said, ``and I would say:
`Maybe the treaties are no good. But we need to do it the way the
Americans do it: We need to have the issues heard in court.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Brien, 32, is a lawyer in a Kansas City firm who
works on repackaging mortgage loans as securities. He tried a
legalistic approach to the Cherokees' case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the Indians were here first,'' Brien said. ``The
Indians' title to the land has not been extinguished.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that one way to deal with Marshall's view was to
convince him that if the court did not treat the Indians' claims as
legitimate in 1831, the Indians' anger could fester for a long
time. ``You might as well address it now, rather than wait till
later,'' Brien said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the meeting of the two justices, the professor who
convened the moot court, Robert Porter, had explained the goal of
the exercise. Porter, a Harvard-educated lawyer and a member of the
Seneca Nation, is the director of the Tribal Law and Government
Center at the law school here.
</P>
<P>
   As Indian nations across the country struggle to reassert their
sovereign powers over their own people, he said, Indian lawyers
must study the way America used the law to establish what he called
colonial domination. The moot court and similar exercises, he said,
are intended ``to lay the intellectual foundation for our
decolonization.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy task. Brien and Ms. Soap said that as lawyers
trained in the American system, it was nearly impossible for them
to view the Cherokees' case of 1831 with anything like the eyes of
their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Brien said that his family left the reservation years ago and he
had only become involved in tribal matters in recent years. As he
learned his tribe's modern legal system, he said, he discovered
that over the generations it had come to mirror the American
system. Older ways, he said, had been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have my tribe's dispute resolution system. That's lost
to me,'' he said. ``And I am still in the process of trying to
learn my tribe's traditions.''

MIDEAST ACCORD ELICITS SHRUGS IN ARAB WORLD
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ After the hoopla in the United States, a guarded
shrug from much of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in this region is so elusive _ or so perilous _ as
peace. And that perhaps explains why the Wye Plantation agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians has evoked such resounding
reticence among Arab leaders _ who played an umpire's role at most
or were left on distant sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Running through the Arab response _ whether among the Islamic
radicals who burned Israeli flags in Gaza or among less vocal and
more moderate figures backing Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader
_ was a common stream of mistrust in the intentions of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and doubt about American
motives.
</P>
<P>
   Only King Hussein of Jordan, summoned from cancer treatment to
the negotiations in Maryland, and visibly sapped by chemotherapy,
attached his personal prestige to the interim accord that emerged
from nine tortuous days of negotiations. His eyes, some Arab
commentators said, were as much on history's judgment of his role
as a peacemaker as on anything else.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the leader of the
Arab world's most populous state, struck a far more cautious note.
``Let us wait and see,'' he said. ``There have been so many
agreements that were never enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People and officials cannot help being cautious,'' said
Mohammed al-Sayed Said, a senior researcher at Cairo's Al Ahram
Center for Political and Strategic Studies. ``There is long history
and heritage of Israeli manipulation and nonimplementation of any
of the previous agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder who trusts Netanyahu in the Arab world. How many
agreements were signed by him while he evaded implementation? So
why not this one also?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Mohammed Sid Ahmed, a respected commentator here,
President Clinton ``is the main winner in this agreement'' as he
struggles for domestic political advantage in advance of next
month's elections in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the Arab world at large and the
Palestinians has always been a complex one, riven by the competing
ambitions of Arab leaders to pursue divergent goals through
Palestinian surrogates. Even recently, Syrian-backed Palestinian
movements bitterly criticized Arafat's peace maneuvers, reflecting
President Hafez Assad's own fruitless quest for the return of the
Golan Heights from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, though, since the political cartography of the Arab
world was redrawn by Iraq's defeat in the Persian Gulf war and the
subsequent, American-led drive for a broader peace, the ability of
the Arab states to mold the direct relationship between Israelis
and Palestinians has been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, has reduced Arafat's ability to seek a regional
consensus. While Egypt and Jordan may, for differing reasons, help
promote his cause, other Arab states pursue other agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to give support to Arafat?'' said Dr. Said of the
Al Ahram center. ``Syria, with its known principle of pursuing
unilateral actions, or Iraq or Sudan or Algeria or Libya _ who want
to shoot Arafat in the head?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, to guard his back, Arafat embarked Sunday on a Middle
East tour that evoked memories of his earlier Lear-Jet diplomacy,
as an insurgent leader, through Arab capitals _ traveling from
Egypt to Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye accord, offering the Palestinians more land in return
for greater guarantees of security for Israel, have played into the
instinctive caution of a region where peace with Israel has brought
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's peace with Israel remains frigid. King Hussein has paid
for Jordan's peace with Israel in the coinage of domestic
discontent among a population that is predominantly Palestinian. In
the annals of Middle Eastern peace diplomacy, two statesmen _
Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Yitzhak Rabin _ have paid for
peace with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, no one gets too hopeful here _ especially not about
interim deals that not only do not settle Palestinian-Israeli
disputes but also do not address Israel's other unfinished business
with its neighbors Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road is still long for for a comprehensive peace,'' said
Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister. ``This necessarily
requires an Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights and
from southern Lebanon as well as declaring a Palestinian state and
achieving security for all parties.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Egypt itself, driven by a desire for prestige as the Arab
world's heavyweight and with the American aid dollars to support
it, has displayed the same ambivalence as other countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The government-owned Al Ahram newspaper, thus, reported at
length on President Mubarak's telephone conversations with both
Arafat and Clinton as the Wye agreement was being finalized. But,
said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, it did
not seek a high-profile role because it did not want to be too
closely associated with an agreement that might yet unravel.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the agreement has introduced one novel element
into the public visage of Middle Eastern diplomacy _ the Central
Intelligence Agency. The agency is to referee the security
relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, ensuring that the
Palestinians live up to commitments to stamp out terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, the CIA was widely depicted by Palestinians as
a sinister player in an American-backed Zionist conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   With the new security deal, said Walid Kazziha , a professor of
political science at the American University of Cairo, Arafat has
``shouldered a great responsibility as Israel's policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Dr. Said, the CIA's involvement might now work in the
Palestinians' favor, ``putting an end to Israel's demands on
security.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   From broom closet to book jacket comes an evolving literary
definition of the thoroughly mainstream witch: a teen-age girl
casting economy spells on crabby teachers, or a sleek Wiccan high
priestess with a coven, a law degree and three press agents to
promote the resulting spiritual memoir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I writing this book?'' said Phyllis Curott, 44, a New
York lawyer with her own practice and a Circle of Ara coven, whose
``Book of Shadows'' shares with readers her religious enlightenment
as well as mugwort potions for psychic dreams. ``You don't want to
get hate mail, but you make choices. And I feel that we're at a
critical moment in our history, and I really deeply believe that
people may change their attitudes by reading about an educated
professional who is a witch.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this goal, she has carefully cultivated an image as a
hip, upwardly mobile witch, wearing a strappy brown Morgan leFay
dress and wispy blond hair for her dust jacket, Donna Karan for the
publicity photos. She hired one independent public relations agency
to promote her book among readers of New Age spiritual books,
another to work with the mainstream audience. A media coach
provided her with tips on demeanor and earthly sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to shine the light of truth on
this and dispose the negative stereotypes of the green-faced
hideous hag,'' she said. ``What I'm hoping to reveal is that behind
the mask of an evil witch is the ancient and very beautiful face of
the goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   And so are an assortment of other young and middle-aged witches
whose rising literary output of self-help titles and memoirs is
propelled, in part, by a yearning for social acceptance and a
growing demand for information about the highly individual,
nature-based folk religion of Wicca, which worships ancient deities
and, as one author put it, has suffered from ``centuries of bad
press.''
</P>
<P>
   The wide assortment of books has reaped some authors six-figure
advances and contracts with large publishing houses. Other writers
complain that literary openness has cost them friends and, in some
cases, day jobs that augmented meager royalty checks.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing demand has also inspired some smaller publishers to
stack their lists with witchcraft titles and to haunt New Age trade
shows and witch camps and retreats in search of new talent and
themes that are reaching _ and in some cases targeting _ an
audience of teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   No title has actually soared on a broomstick to the top of a
best-seller list, but publishers large and small have found that
many of the books are steady perennial sellers. Over the last two
decades, the literature has evolved from academic and scholarly
books to more practical titles that young women and housewives are
willing to buy, said Karen Bouris, director of marketing for Harper
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, sales of Wicca titles averaged about 3,000 to
4,000 copies a year at Carol Publishing Group, but in the last two
years sales have increased, with some of the popular titles selling
up to 40,000, said Steven Schragis, the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning I put a spell on Random House and Simon &AMP;
Schuster, using nothing you can't buy in a regular grocery store _
Velveeta, paprika and Orange Crush,'' joked Schragis, who has
expanded the company's list of Wiccan titles from 2 to 29,
including guides for men, young witches and gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   But no spell could stop the large publishing houses, which are
also pursuing literary witches. In November, Bantam Books is
preparing to publish ``Circle Round,'' Starhawk's how-to book on
raising a second generation of witches, while Harper San Francisco
is promoting its ``fun and empowering'' guide, ``Be a Goddess!''
</P>
<P>
   For $9.99, St. Martin's Press is offering ``The Supermarket
Sorceress' Enchanted Evenings,'' by Lexa Rosean, who manages
Enchantment, a white-magic shop in Manhattan. The paperback
provides easy-mix recipes for spells concocted from widely
available ingredients. (Apartment-hunting spell: tinfoil, cinnamon,
salt, sugar, bread, pennies.)
</P>
<P>
   With its lack of a central hierarchy and rigid rules, the
earth-based religion of Wicca draws members from a mix of
movements: feminists, environmentalists and New Age seekers who
worship the gods and goddesses of nature by casting sacred circles
and celebrating the changing seasons. This leaves wide room for
interpretation of rituals, some dating back to pre-Christian
religions, others rising from merely mundane modern issues like
dealing with a balky computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rituals today come from a variety of places,'' said Helen
Berger, an associate professor of sociology at West Chester
University in Pennsylvania, who has written a book about modern
witchcraft. ``These are very avid readers who have recreated older
practices throughout the world and usually mixed them with modern
issues and concerns about gender equity. Some of the rituals come
from people's re-creations or from movies and novels and poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Wicca members tend to be white, college-educated, middle-class
women, many of whom have families, said Ms. Berger, who said the
religion was becoming more institutionalized as the members aged.
``It was fun to be an outsider and a witch in their 20s,'' she
said, ``and now they are in their 40s and they want acceptance for
their children.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fear of a backlash has never disappeared, said Ms. Berger,
who added that the false stereotype that witches worship Satan
endures. She cited several examples of women whose religious views
raised anxiety in Texas and Tennessee, where she said a mother
joined a Christian church to avoid losing her children in a custody
case that uncovered her interest in Wiccan themes and books.
</P>
<P>
   Silver RavenWolf, formerly Jeanine Trayer, is a 32-year-old
onetime Baptist and mother of four from the Harrisburg, Pa., area
who has just published a guide called ``Teen Witch,'' intended
precisely for a new generation of witches.
</P>
<P>
   Her own children have been initiated into the religion, but she
said they have faced taunts from their peers for their beliefs. She
said her sons had been teased and her daughter's school locker had
been painted with derogatory slogans. Her daughters actually
advised her, she said, in writing her book, which offers 30 spells
made with low-cost and accessible ingredients. Still, she
discourages young would-be witches from starting their own covens
until they are adults who can train with older witches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have letters from kids saying their parents have burned
their books and destroyed their altars,'' the author said.
``Basically, it's because of a misconception, and what they fear
isn't true. Hollywood movies and bad publicity have made witches
look evil and that they hurt people and they really don't. I'm just
as worried about my own kids out there in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, other publishers express wariness about publishing a
book that is so clearly intended for the teen-age market. ``We
talked about, and we didn't do it,'' said Schragis, of Carol
Publishing. ``We have stayed away from publishing a book that
specifically uses the word teen or teen-ager'' in the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen Witch'' is published by Llewellyn International, a
company based in St. Paul with a long history of publishing
astrology books and annual revenues of $17 million. Two years ago,
the company's executives noticed a surge in sales with the
popularity of ``The Craft,'' a B-movie about a small coven of good,
bad and moderately well-behaved teen-age witches dressed in
knee-highs and school uniforms by day, hip clothes by night.
</P>
<P>
   Llewellyn responded by publishing a variety of books on
witchcraft for beginners, including ``Teen Witch,'' with a cover of
bemused 15-year-old girls in jeans and short skirts posed like a
movie poster for ``The Craft.'' Today, more than half of the 100
titles that Llewellyn publishes annually revolve around Wiccan
themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our typical reader had been a boomer who grew up in the '60s
who had been looking for a more appealing explanation of
spirituality,'' said Von Braschler, Llewellyn's director of trade
sales. ``Now our typical reader is becoming a very young woman in
her teens. We're basing this on the letters we get for the
authors.''
</P>
<P>
   Llewellyn's authors typically receive no advances and hold other
jobs to supplement their royalties. Their experiences are far less
glamorous than those of authors like Ms. Curott, who was able to
sell her memoir on the strength of her background to a large
publisher after a competitive auction with five bidding companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me tremendous credibility,'' Ms. Curott said of her
education at Brown University and her law degree from New York
University. ``When people think of Wicca, they think of either
Satanism or silly mumbo jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Morrison, 43, a Llewellyn author of ``Everyday Magic''
and ``Everyday Needlework,'' said she learned this lesson the hard
way in the Missouri town where she lives and has tried to promote
her work as a budding author of witchcraft titles. She suspects
that she was dismissed in June from her job at an animal shelter
near Jackson, Mo., after a bookstore clerk recognized her name and
picture on one of the books that described her as a Wiccan high
priestess.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid of what they don't understand,'' said Ms.
Morrison, 43, a former Roman Catholic whose books offer spells for
coping with computer crashes or speeding up modems.
``Unfortunately, it does no good to educate people in this area
because they don't want to be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New Age authors really don't make a lot of money,'' she added.
``I'm fortunate my husband makes good money, and yes, I'm missing
my salary from the animal shelter. I read cards when I go to book
signings. I'm allowed to do workshops, and _ goddess willing _ I'll
be able to find a job to work full time.''

APARTMENT RENTAL RATES UP, VACANCIES DOWN IN SUBURBAN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mal Fienberg's For Rent signs are gathering dust
these days.
</P>
<P>
   He owns 12 apartment buildings with, collectively, about 600
units in the suburban Los Angeles communities of Encino, Van Nuys
and Sherman Oaks with nary a vacancy in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market today is very good,'' Fienberg said in a bit of an
understatement. ``Right now my vacancy rate is basically zero.
We've had people calling for apartments, and we don't have any to
rent them.''
</P>
<P>
   With California's improved economy, it's become a landlord's
market for apartments in the San Fernando Valley, a sprawling
community northwest of the downtown Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   Demand is up, the vacancy rate is down and rents are rising on
the region's 200,000 apartment units. In some cases, like the
recently refurbished Premier complex in Sherman Oaks, rents for a
two-bedroom unit can top out at $2,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some buildings even have waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   Fienberg and other apartment owners and managers say this fall's
market is quite a change, because rents have either stayed the same
or fallen between 1987 and last year.
</P>
<P>
   While demand is high, rents are not equally skyrocketing thanks
to a 1979 rent control ordinance that covers a large percentage of
the valley's apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Most apartments built before 1978 can only raise their rents to
match increases in the cost of living. Right now the increase is
about 3 percent, but it has been as high as 7 percent in the recent
past.
</P>
<P>
   Once a tenant moves out, rents can be raised to whatever the
market will bear. Generally, that means about 5 percent more than
the previous tenant was paying, a number of apartment owners and
managers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the apartments are pretty close to market value to
begin with,'' Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Not according to Marie Abounayan, whose search for a new
apartment is giving her a case of sticker shock and lowering her
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the allure of California's re-energized economy,
Abounayan, her husband and their three young children recently
moved back to the San Fernando Valley from Michigan and took up
temporary quarters in a Sherman Oaks home.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six weeks, using the Los Angeles/San Fernando
Valley Apartment Guide as her compass, Abounayan has been trying to
find a three-bedroom apartment in Encino, Tarzana or Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a frustrating experience, she said after checking out
a unit at Warner Center Apartments, a sprawling complex in the San
Fernando Valley's Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apartments are too small. The prices are outrageous,''
Abounayan said after looking at a 1,000-square-foot apartment that
rented for $1,400 a month. ``I can't find anything that I want.''
</P>
<P>
   During the year's second quarter, the most recent period for
which statistics are available, the vacancy rate for buildings with
100 or more units was 4.6 percent, according to Marcus &AMP; Millichap,
a Palo Alto, Calif.-based real estate investment brokerage company.
It was 6.8 percent in the like period for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the average rent has increased to $890 from $854
during that time. And inducements like one month's free rent or
move-in allowances have just about disappeared from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (landlord) concessions are all but gone,'' said Brad
Palfrey, executive vice president of PCS Property Management, which
manages the tony Premier, where the features include a sand
volleyball court, tennis courts and movie viewing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is better, there are more jobs, and there are more
people who have moved back into the Southern California area. There
are more people going after a limited supply,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Campbell, a broker at Marcus &AMP; Millichap's Encino office,
concurs that the tight market is a result of the region's improving
economy. He predicted the area's apartment market will continue to
be tight, with gradually increasing prices for the foreseeable
future unless there is a big jolt from the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vacancies will continue to go down, and the (apartment) values
will continue to increase, but that's without a worldwide recession
thrown into the mix,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   He does not think rents have regained historical highs, but they
are gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of people maybe have gotten back to where
they were 10 years ago, but nobody I know is well above that,'' he
said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ State Rep. David Phelps, who is running for
Congress in southern Illinois, was not surprised when television
stations began broadcasting an advertisement criticizing his record
earlier this month. A Democrat, Phelps was prepared for things to
get nasty in his race against Brent Winters, his Republican
opponent, for an open seat in the 19th Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not Winters who sponsored the attack advertisement,
which pictures Phelps and criticizes his votes on property and
income taxes in the Legislature. It was the Republican National
Committee, which has taken advantage of election rules that allow
the national parties to spend unrestricted funds on advertisements
about issues, as long as the advertisements don't urge the election
or defeat of specific candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats used the tactic effectively in the 1996
presidential campaign, and some prominent Republicans have urged
the Justice Department to seek an independent counsel investigation
of whether President Clinton scripted the plan to evade spending
limits on his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time the Republicans, flush with the so-called
soft money that can be used on issue advertisements, are expanding
the practice, and spending far more than their opponents.
Republican House leaders, in fact, have designed the most ambitious
party advertising plan in any non-presidential election year. The
plan, ``Operation Breakout,'' calls for spending $20 million by
Election Day, with $7 million already spent in 60 congressional
districts in 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   To subsidize their advertising campaign, Republican House
leaders have resorted to pressure tactics, assigning incumbents
fund-raising quotas and using House leaders to lean on their
colleagues for contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps, one of the targets of the Republicans, questioned how an
advertisement targeting his record in the state Legislature
qualifies as a national Republican issue advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see what this has to do with the national Republican
Party,'' Phelps said in an interview. ``When they use the
candidate's name and talk about my record as a state
representative, that has nothing to do with the issues I'll be
voting on in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
Rep. John Linder, said issue advertising is necessary and legal,
especially in light of millions spent by the AFL-CIO on
advertisements attacking Republican House candidates two years ago.
``We watched the unions and the Sierra Club spend millions on issue
ads,'' Linder, a Republican from Georgia, said in an interview.
``We have every right as a political party to tell America what we
believe. And that has been affirmed by the Supreme Court five
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder also said that part of getting the party's message out is
providing information about the records of Democratic opponents
like Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $20 million to be spent on House candidates,
the National Republican Senatorial Committee is spending at least
$6 million on issue advertisements in states with closely contested
Senate races, including North Carolina, South Carolina, Nevada,
Kentucky and Wisconsin. To maximize the use of soft money _ the
unrestricted donations raised by political parties from
corporations, individuals and interest groups _ Republican Party
committees in Washington have transferred millions of dollars to
state party organizations to pay for issue advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have their own campaign. The Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee plan to spend at least $6 million each on issue
advertisements and have also transferred millions in soft money to
state Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
   Linder is following the lead of the Democratic Party's 1996
presidential playbook, when Clinton and the Democratic National
Committee pushed issue advertising to the limit. Unable to afford
the multimillion-dollar advertising program proposed by Dick
Morris, a consultant to Clinton, leaders of the re-election
campaign approved instead a plan in which issue advertisements were
paid for by the national committee with a heavy portion of soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   That plan took advantage of a 1995 advisory opinion from the
Federal Election Commission that said political parties could
sponsor the same kind of issue advertisements that ideological
interest groups had been running. The commission also said that the
parties could use unrestricted donations from individuals,
corporations and labor unions to pay for the advertisements with a
blend of the restricted funds, known as hard money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself helped script the Democratic Party's $44 million
blitz of issue advertisements, which featured him prominently.
Lawyers for the Clinton-Gore campaign and the Democratic National
Committee said the advertisements were legal and that they did not
explicitly seek votes for the Clinton-Gore ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1996 Democratic ad plan has attracted renewed scrutiny.
Attorney General Janet Reno has ordered a 90-day preliminary
investigation into whether Clinton orchestrated the plan to avoid
the spending limits on his 1996 campaign, a charge that lawyers for
the president and the Democratic National Committee have denied.
</P>
<P>
   Reno could recommend the appointment of an independent counsel
to investigate the advertisements, something she has been pressed
to do by both the director of the FBI and the former head of the
Justice Department's Campaign Finance Task Force. She must decide
by early December.
</P>
<P>
   And the Federal Election Commission is considering whether to
adopt a preliminary report by agency auditors that concluded that
both Clinton and the Republican presidential nominee, Bob Dole,
violated their campaign spending limits with party-purchased issue
advertisements and should each repay $13.4 million in federal
matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has discouraged the Republicans from spending
record amounts on Operation Breakout. Party issue advertisements
are supposed to convey a broad party-building message and cannot
urge voters to vote for or against a specific candidate, although
they can feature candidates. The Operation Breakout spots work
around the ban on candidate advocacy by urging viewers to call
candidates, rather than vote for them. In the advertisement
attacking Phelps, for example, viewers are urged to call him to
protest his positions on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In some districts, the advertisements are generic, positive
party messages extolling the accomplishments of the Republican
Congress, including a $500-per-child tax credit. In at least nine
races, the advertisements are negative, customized messages against
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enormous campaign finance abuses of the 1996 presidential
elections are now exploding into 1998 congressional races all over
the country,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
nonprofit group that advocates overhaul of the nation's campaign
finance laws. ``And this, in turn, is setting the stage, absent
reform, for the 2,000 national elections being run on an
overwhelmingly corrupted campaign finance system.''

</P>
<P>
   Both parties are expanding their use of issue advertisements to
make use of their soft money. Republican Party committees have
taken in $100.2 million in soft money this election cycle, compared
with $35 million in the 1994 cycle, while Democrats have received
$75.6 million, up from about $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Breakout's fund-raising goals have strained the
Republicans. An initial $5 million was supplied by the Republican
National Committee, but funding from House Republicans was slow to
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich and Linder have pressed their Republican
colleagues in the House to contribute to Operation Breakout from
their own re-election coffers or to raise contributions from
wealthy constituents. Committee chairmen were told that they were
expected to bring in a minimum of $100,000, and safe incumbents
were assigned a target of $50,000, according to two Republicans
involved in discussions about the advertising program.
</P>
<P>
   At a leadership meeting after Labor Day, according to a report
in Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Capitol Hill, Gingrich and
other House leaders scolded their colleagues for the sluggish pace
of contributions _ the budget goal was initially $37 million. They
warned that members who did not contribute might be punished in
future committee assignments, or even denied committee
chairmanships.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans who were angered by the push was Rep.
Philip Crane, who hopes to succeed Rep. Bill Archer as chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee when Archer retires in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Crane sent a $25,000 check to Linder earlier this
month, he also wrote a letter complaining about the heavy-handed
fund-raising. ``To say Phil Crane is not a team player for the
party is ridiculous,'' said the Illinois congressman's
administrative assistant, Kirt Johnson. Johnson said that Crane did
not have a lot of money to spare after facing an opponent in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Republican issue advertisements in Senate races have been a
source of controversy, too. In Wisconsin, Democratic Sen. Russell
Feingold, who championed campaign finance legislation that would
have outlawed soft money, has complained about the $1 million spent
by the National Republican Senatorial Committee on advertisements
attacking his record on a variety of issues, including Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is in a competitive race against Republican Rep.
Mark Neumann, Feingold has told the Democratic Party not to use
party soft money on issue advertisements in Wisconsin. Neumann said
his opponent still benefits from advertisements by labor and
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Feingold said he would rather lose his seat
than win re-election with party advertisements funded by soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that this is a huge risk,'' Feingold said. ``But I
took it with open eyes. I wanted this election to be a referendum
on the need to get big money out of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee does not want
to risk losing Feingold's seat and bought television advertising in
Wisconsin on Friday. Feingold has demanded that the committee pull
the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have transferred millions of dollars to local party
committees to pay for their television blitz. In 1996, Democrats
funneled more than $32 million through the state parties to pay for
issue ads. In both instances, the national political parties were
taking advantage of state-level formulas that permit more soft
money to pay for issue advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Election Commission records show that in Wisconsin, for
example, on Sept. 24, the National Republican Senatorial Committee
transferred $233,585 in soft money and $78,000 in restricted funds
to the Wisconsin Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, the state party paid $233,688 in soft money and
$77,896 in restricted funds to the media firm of Stevens Reed Curio
for ``media buy for issue advocacy.'' Records show three similar
transfers in August and September, with identical payments to the
Stevens firm, the consultants who designed the committee's national
issue advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern has been repeated in other states, according to an
analysis of the records for The New York Times by the Campaign
Study Group, a private research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee has sent $740,000
in five transfers to the Kentucky Republican Party, with the
Stevens firm receiving nearly identical amounts from the state
party for television advertisements supporting Senate nominee Jim
Bunning. The senatorial committee has pumped more than $1 million
into Nevada, in six transfers, where the Republicans hope to defeat
Democratic Sen. Harry Reid.
</P>
<P>
   A seasoned team of Republican consultants handpicked by party
strategists in Washington has designed the Republican issue
advertisements. Although Greg Stevens designed the Senate ads, the
creative team for Operation Breakout includes four well-known GOP
Republican political firms, including one headed by Mike Murphy,
who was a media consultant in 1996 to the Republican presidential
candidates Lamar Alexander and Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   In some districts, the Republican issue advertisements have more
than doubled the amount of television advertising on behalf of
Republican candidates. And in districts where the National
Republican Senatorial Committee has given the legal limit in direct
contributions to a candidate, the issue advertisements represent an
additional, significant form of aid.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ State Rep. David Phelps, who is running for
Congress in southern Illinois, was not surprised when television
stations began broadcasting an advertisement criticizing his record
earlier this month. A Democrat, Phelps was prepared for things to
get nasty in his race against Brent Winters, his Republican
opponent, for an open seat in the 19th Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not Winters who sponsored the attack advertisement,
which pictures Phelps and criticizes his votes on property and
income taxes in the Legislature. It was the Republican National

TEXAS: RACE FOR NO. 2 CAPTIVATES STATE  
 MARYLAND: COURTING BLACKS IN CONTEST FOR GOVERNOR  
 MICHIGAN: CHALLENGER PLAYS THE MOM CARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moved in ``a'' category.)

 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big political question of the moment in Texas is not whether
Gov. George W. Bush will win re-election, given that he leads his
Democratic challenger, Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, better than 3
to 1. Nor is it whether Bush might go on to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   No, the political question of the moment is who will win the
contest for lieutenant governor _ the Republican, Agriculture
Commissioner Rick Perry, or the Democrat, Comptroller John Sharp?
</P>
<P>
   It makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   And they're running neck-and-neck.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of those states in which the lieutenant governor
and the governor do not have to come from the same party. So if the
governor dies or becomes incapacitated _ or gets elected president
_ the chief executive officer of the state can suddenly end up
being someone from the other party.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important and politically portentous, Texas is one of
those states in which the lieutenant governor is not just an
understudy waiting in the wings but instead has real political
clout, with power to set the agenda of the state Senate, appoint
some of its committees and control the flow of its bills.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Bush has to give all this some serious thought as he
looks to the future. Obviously, too, how well his Republican
colleague, Perry, does on Election Day will depend to a degree on
how long Bush's political coattails are.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people who don't live in Texas will have their
measuring tapes out for that. What will they conclude if Bush wins
big but Perry loses, which current polls indicate could happen?
</P>
<P>
   Enter another George Bush, the former president and father of
the governor. He is all over Texas television these final days of
the campaign in an advertisement in which he offers Perry a ride on
whatever coattails he has left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an opportunity here to elect a man to perhaps the
most powerful position in the state of Texas,'' he says. ``Everyone
in our family strongly supports him. You have a good man. My heart
is where Barbara's is, where George's is, in the Perry corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Courting Blacks in Maryland Contest
</P>
<P>
   If Gov. Parris Glendening of Maryland, a Democrat, is to win
re-election this year, he needs a big turnout by black voters, the
fastest-growing political force in the state. But getting that
turnout won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, the state's two most powerful black
leaders, Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore and Wayne Curry, the chief
executive of Prince George's County, outside Washington, endorsed
the governor _ but very late in the game and without a lot of
enthusiasm, having accused him earlier of ignoring the needs of the
city and county, both of which have large black populations.
</P>
<P>
   In their endorsement speeches, the mayor and Curry said they
would work their constituencies hard for the governor. But since
then they have not been seen out and about all that much. And the
latest polls show the governor still locked in a dead heat with his
Republican challenger, Ellen Sauerbrey.
</P>
<P>
   So now Glendening, a liberal Democrat, is hammering Ms.
Sauerbrey, a conservative, for votes she cast on civil rights
measures when she was a state legislator. In a new round of
television ads, he criticizes her for opposing an
anti-discrimination bill in 1992 and for voting against a 1990 bill
that would have guaranteed minority contractors a share of state
projects. He also charges that she has a history of opposing fair
housing laws and hate-crime measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``A civil rights record to be ashamed of,'' one of the ads
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sauerbrey, who in speeches to black audiences pointedly
promises that as governor she would have an administration
attentive to the needs of all peoples and interests, countercharges
that Glendening is distorting her record and stooping to
race-baiting and fear tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad that a governor who ought to be bringing people
together is playing the race card,'' she said last week while
addressing a predominately black group of Prince George's voters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sauerbrey seems to be working Baltimore and Prince George's
almost as hard as Glendening, remembering well that in the 1994
governor's race, when she also was his opponent, he won by the
slimmest of margins _ 5,993 votes. Much of that margin, voting
analysts said later, was built up in Baltimore and Prince George's.

   Michigan Challenger Plays the Mom Card
</P>
<P>
   What do you do in politics when your opponent is beating you 2
to 1 in the polls and 65 percent of all voters say they have an
``unfavorable'' view of you _ the election equivalent of being
``hated,'' as one pollster put it?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Geoffrey Fieger, you play the mom card.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger is the bombast-and-bile, high-decibel lawyer who
represents Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the advocate of assisted suicide,
and who once had high hopes that he could unseat Michigan's popular
Republican governor, John Engler.
</P>
<P>
   But those hopes are pretty low now. It turns out that a lot of
voters think Fieger, a Democrat, should have kept his mouth shut,
shouldn't have called Engler a ``moron,'' shouldn't have said his
own party was full of ``wimps and oatmeal,'' shouldn't have
speculated that people living during the time of Jesus might have
considered him a ``goofball'' rather than the Savior.
</P>
<P>
   So, like a lot of sons who get into trouble, Fieger has turned
to his mother. And, of course, mom _ June Fieger, 74 _ is there for
him, trying to make the hurt go away.
</P>
<P>
   In television ads now showing across the state, she determinedly
works to soften her boy's image, saying he is, well, a good boy and
she is ``furious'' that those Republicans are calling him a
``religious bigot'' and who knows what else.
</P>
<P>
   One spot has her promising voters that her son will make
education a main priority and use the state's lucrative lottery to
pay for improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right, Geoff?'' she says in closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right, Mom,'' replies Geoff, who is standing next to a
chalkboard on which is written, ``I will be a good governor.''
</P>
<P>
   In another ad, Mrs. Fieger leans toward the camera, glares, and
wagging a finger says: ``As for you John Engler, you should be
ashamed. I know your mother raised you better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   What Engler knows is that moms make good campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when Engler first ran for governor, he persuaded his
mother, Agnes, to appear in an ad intended to deflect negative
advertising that had been aimed at him. And he went on to win, in
an upset.

TEXAS: RACE FOR NO. 2 CAPTIVATES STATE  
 MARYLAND: COURTING BLACKS IN CONTEST FOR GOVERNOR  
 MICHIGAN: CHALLENGER PLAYS THE MOM CARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moved in ``p'' category.) 
(lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big political question of the moment in Texas is not whether
Gov. George W. Bush will win re-election, given that he leads his
Democratic challenger, Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, better than 3
to 1. Nor is it whether Bush might go on to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   No, the political question of the moment is who will win the
contest for lieutenant governor _ the Republican, Agriculture
Commissioner Rick Perry, or the Democrat, Comptroller John Sharp?
</P>
<P>
   It makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   And they're running neck-and-neck.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of those states in which the lieutenant governor
and the governor do not have to come from the same party. So if the
governor dies or becomes incapacitated _ or gets elected president
_ the chief executive officer of the state can suddenly end up
being someone from the other party.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important and politically portentous, Texas is one of
those states in which the lieutenant governor is not just an
understudy waiting in the wings but instead has real political
clout, with power to set the agenda of the state Senate, appoint
some of its committees and control the flow of its bills.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Bush has to give all this some serious thought as he
looks to the future. Obviously, too, how well his Republican
colleague, Perry, does on Election Day will depend to a degree on
how long Bush's political coattails are.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people who don't live in Texas will have their
measuring tapes out for that. What will they conclude if Bush wins
big but Perry loses, which current polls indicate could happen?
</P>
<P>
   Enter another George Bush, the former president and father of
the governor. He is all over Texas television these final days of
the campaign in an advertisement in which he offers Perry a ride on
whatever coattails he has left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an opportunity here to elect a man to perhaps the
most powerful position in the state of Texas,'' he says. ``Everyone
in our family strongly supports him. You have a good man. My heart
is where Barbara's is, where George's is, in the Perry corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Courting Blacks in Maryland Contest
</P>
<P>
   If Gov. Parris Glendening of Maryland, a Democrat, is to win
re-election this year, he needs a big turnout by black voters, the
fastest-growing political force in the state. But getting that
turnout won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, the state's two most powerful black
leaders, Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore and Wayne Curry, the chief
executive of Prince George's County, outside Washington, endorsed
the governor _ but very late in the game and without a lot of
enthusiasm, having accused him earlier of ignoring the needs of the
city and county, both of which have large black populations.
</P>
<P>
   In their endorsement speeches, the mayor and Curry said they
would work their constituencies hard for the governor. But since
then they have not been seen out and about all that much. And the
latest polls show the governor still locked in a dead heat with his
Republican challenger, Ellen Sauerbrey.
</P>
<P>
   So now Glendening, a liberal Democrat, is hammering Ms.
Sauerbrey, a conservative, for votes she cast on civil rights
measures when she was a state legislator. In a new round of
television ads, he criticizes her for opposing an
anti-discrimination bill in 1992 and for voting against a 1990 bill
that would have guaranteed minority contractors a share of state
projects. He also charges that she has a history of opposing fair
housing laws and hate-crime measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``A civil rights record to be ashamed of,'' one of the ads
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sauerbrey, who in speeches to black audiences pointedly
promises that as governor she would have an administration
attentive to the needs of all peoples and interests, countercharges
that Glendening is distorting her record and stooping to
race-baiting and fear tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad that a governor who ought to be bringing people
together is playing the race card,'' she said last week while
addressing a predominately black group of Prince George's voters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sauerbrey seems to be working Baltimore and Prince George's
almost as hard as Glendening, remembering well that in the 1994
governor's race, when she also was his opponent, he won by the
slimmest of margins _ 5,993 votes. Much of that margin, voting
analysts said later, was built up in Baltimore and Prince George's.

<P>
   After zipping through the Kinkos' express window to run off some
last-minute pie charts, Mikey Ovitz and Big Ed Roski will gather up
all the dioramas, soap carvings, bent pipe-cleaners and watercolor
paintings that look like something left behind by Red Skelton and
put them on display this week in Kansas City before NFL's Top
Secret Committee For Admitting New Cronies.
</P>
<P>
   But they've got to remember one thing:
</P>
<P>
   They're not representing the poor, deprived Los Angeles sports
fan. They're on their own. This is their chance to make a fast
buck, not enhance the cultural experience of a community that
soooooo wants to see professional football return.
</P>
<P>
   Let other city councilmen waste their time duking it out over
taxpayer-funded stadiums and attached entertainment centers. We've
got important things to do on our quiet Sunday afternoons, chugging
down our Jamba Juice and thankful we can go to the mall without
worrying about a traffic jam right about 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL wants a team in this TV market badly enough, it will
give us one without us putting on a dog-and-phony show.
</P>
<P>
   So don't ruin our Pleasantville.
</P>
<P>
   __The only Carson we need developed for the NFL is the USC
freshman. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ John Elway thought it was important enough to cough up
$10,000 of his own cash to support Denver's Citizens For A New
Stadium organization's campaign for a football palace, which is on
the November ballot. Broncos owner Pat Bowlen has thrown in about
$650,000 of the more than $2 million raised by the group. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __Prop See-You-Later. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __We've got it from reliable sources that the Clippers have made
a head-coach offer to Jim Brewer for _ get this _ one year at
$200,000. Not only a slap at a guy who's been an assistant the last
four years, but it's prorated depending on how long the lockout
goes. Cheap? Boston's Rick Pitino
</P>
<P>
   pulls in about $85,000 !ital!a game . . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Charles Barkley had some free time to make it over to the
L.A. Boxing Club downtown Friday to shoot a scene with Pamela
Anderson Lee for her show, ``V.I.P.'' The storyline: Barkley,
playing himself, seeks protection from Ms. Barbed Wire because he
wouldn't throw a game in the championship finals and a bunch of
gangsters want revenge. Pam and Charlie will be shooting the
underground-video version next week at Lake Mead. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __When Michael Jordan slipped out of the players meeting last
week at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, all the TV cameramen waiting
outside flipped on the strobe lights and the reporters with the
microphones leaned forward. Then MJ spoke: ``Hey, I'm just going to
use the restroom.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   __Sports talk goes another notch below hokey self-promotion when
AM-1150 parades Karl Malone out today as its new lockout-stir-crazy
host. It wouldn't make sense even if 1150 was a jazz station. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __During his World Series writing assignment for USA Today,
village idiot Davey Johnson defended all the idiotic moves made by
San Diego skipper Bruce Bochy . Which makes perfect sense. Why
would the pending Dodgers skipper want to see the stooge get canned
and then have the NL West rivals fill his spot with someone
!ital!smarter before next season? . . .
</P>
<P>
   __Kansas City Chiefs defensive end Leslie O'Neal was ordered to
pay $50 for sexual battery against a topless dancer named Christy
Palomino Barsoom . . . .
</P>
<P>
   __Dominique? Dominique? Domineeeeeeeeeeeeee que! C'mon out and
tumble for us. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __Those ESPN ``SportsCenter'' commercials with Evander Holyfield
reading books to preschoolers all makes sense now. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __The college football postseason picture is supposed to be
clearer after the first Bowl Championship Series ranking come out
today. The only thing that doesn't make any sense is why UCLA and
Ohio State won't just play a title game at the Rose Bowl, where
they belong in the first place. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __Most interesting scenario: In its last two games, USC beats
UCLA to knock the Bruins out of the Fiesta Bowl, then beats Notre
Dame to end any talk of the Irish coming to the Rose Bowl. Then the
Trojans go to Hawaii. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __Those well-conditioned Trojans at least aren't breathing hard
during the fourth quarter of their losses. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __Don't tell me who won Sunday's MLS Cup. No, I didn't tape it
to watch later. I just don't want to know.

IN WASHINGTON STATE, NEXT SENATOR IS SURE TO BE A WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Cal., Ill. Ky.)  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in ``a'' category) 
(mk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ Patty Murray swept into the U.S. Senate in
1992's ``Year of the Woman'' in the wake of national outrage over
the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee's handling of sexual
harassment accusations against a Supreme Court nominee. Six years
later, in her re-election campaign, a woman is once again standing
up for feminist values on the campaign trail _ ``fighting against
lechers in the work place who hit on young women,'' as she puts it.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidate saying these things is not Ms. Murray, a
Democrat, who says she must remain an ``impartial juror'' in case
President Clinton is impeached. Instead, it is her conservative
Republican opponent, Rep. Linda Smith, whose ire is on high alert.
``The feminist movement,'' Ms. Smith says, ``needs to stand up
against any man who would use women like pieces of meat like our
president has.''
</P>
<P>
   For just the third time in the nation's history, two women are
running against each other for the Senate. In California and
Illinois, other women elected to the Senate with Ms. Murray are in
serious danger of losing to men this year. But Washington state,
which boasts the highest percentage of women in the state
Legislature of any state, is certain to send a woman back to the
Senate. It is just that voters here are facing a choice between two
very different women.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the race between Ms. Murray and Ms. Smith, both
48, is a vivid illustration of the increasing political prominence
of women, whose numbers are at an all-time high in both the U.S.
House (54) and Senate (nine). But even as both candidates cite
their experience as working mothers and talk eloquently about the
importance of having a woman's perspective in the Senate, it is
clear that they have wide differences over just what it means to
have that perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith's challenge reflects the fact that even as Democratic
women who hold office or are candidates still outnumber their
Republican counterparts, the gap has been closing in recent years,
according to statistics compiled by the Center for the American
Woman and Politics at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute. (In
House and Senate elections on Nov. 3, 82 Democrats and 49
Republicans on the ballot are women, an overall number that ties a
record set in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   In short, the politics of women circa 1998 looks much more
complicated and ideologically diverse than it did six years ago.
Just having more women elected to office does not necessarily
guarantee that any particular policies will be favored in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murray, for instance, is one of the most reliable
abortion-rights supporters in the Senate, while Smith is staunchly
anti-abortion, and they have clashed strongly over the issue during
this campaign, especially on whether to outlaw the procedure that
its critics call partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent debate in Seattle, Ms. Murray said that no woman
wants to find out late in her pregnancy that continuing it could
threaten her life or health, and she said that criminalizing a
decision for abortion at that point would be totally unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the Congress, shouldn't be the ones telling her she should
go to jail,'' Ms. Murray said. ``That decision should be made
between her, her doctor and her faith.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Smith castigated Ms. Murray as one of the ``radical
senators'' who favored the ``barbaric practice'' of late-term
abortion. And she has consistently expressed her own opposition to
all abortions, including cases of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of Clinton's relationship with a White
House intern, one that Ms. Smith, who is from the Vancouver area in
southwest Washington, has sought to cast as an albatross around Ms.
Murray's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said of Clarence Thomas stronger things, that he should
not serve, and she said of Packwood very strong things, that he
should step down,'' Ms. Smith said in an interview of Ms. Murray's
reactions to earlier cases involving a Supreme Court nominee and a
U.S. senator facing accusations of harassing behavior toward women.
``You treat this issue equally, and if you've got a man abusing the
power, taking advantage of younger women who are subordinates, then
you speak out consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is not much evidence here that Ms. Murray has been
seriously damaged by Ms. Smith's attacks on the issue. Ms. Murray
has said several times that she is ``disappointed'' in the
president's behavior but, unlike Ms. Smith, who has both suggested
that the president resign and supported his impeachment, Ms. Murray
argues that it is inappropriate for someone who may cast a Senate
vote in an impeachment trial to be so adamant on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   And so far in this race, most analysts continue to see much
evidence that Ms. Murray has the upper hand. The most recent
statewide poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research
Inc., shows Ms. Murray leading Ms. Smith by 51 percent to 38
percent. Ms. Smith, who has never lost an election and has made
something of a career for herself of toppling seemingly entrenched
Democratic opponents, says she is undaunted by the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murray has more money, for several reasons, at least one of
which reflects just how much partisan stereotypes have been turned
topsy-turvy in this race.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans are often seen as the favored candidates of
corporate interests, the reverse is true here, in no small part
because Ms. Smith remains a bitter foe of some of the biggest
free-trade pacts negotiated by Congress in recent years, a position
that riles many business leaders here in one of the nation's most
trade-dependent states.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith is a caustic critic of China, which she accuses of
flooding the American market with ``slave-labor camp goods,'' and
she is the only member of the state's congressional delegation to
vote against continuing normal trade status for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That is a position that her supporters cast as one of tremendous
courage, and for which some human-rights groups have praised her,
but it is also one that Ms. Murray describes as both naive and
harmful to the state's economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to have our wheat or apples in China if we
stop trading with them, as Linda has voted to do,'' Ms. Murray said
in the Seattle debate. And speaking before a group of approving
Rotarians here in this Seattle suburb the other day, Ms. Murray
repeated her frequent contention that the best way to affect human
rights in China is to continue trade and dialogue with Chinese
leaders, not to close the door to a relationship with them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith's ability to generate campaign money is also severely
hampered by another stand she says she has taken on principle. She
is a strong proponent of overhauling campaign-finance laws, and her
sharp criticism of Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is a chief
opponent of such legislation, has hurt her in the campaign
pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, who heads the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, could give as much as $540,000 to Ms. Smith's campaign,
which is well behind Ms. Murray's in terms of campaign commercials
running on state airwaves. But even as it has poured more than $1
million into California state Treasurer Matt Fong's bid to unseat
Sen. Barbara Boxer, the Democratic incumbent, the national
Republicans have given only a little more than $100,000 to Ms.
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   For all their ideological differences, Ms. Murray and Ms. Smith,
who served together in the Washington state Senate, share many
intriguing similarities in their careers. Both come from
working-class backgrounds and took an interest in a local issue _
schools, in Ms. Murray's case, and high taxes, in Ms. Smith's _ and
turned it into a signature cause that helped propel them into
office. And both have stunned seemingly entrenched incumbents in
making it there.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a grandmother of six whose husband, Vern, is a locomotive

an extensive, intensely dedicated cadre of volunteers, which she
calls ``Linda's army,'' and whose members tend to share her
conservative, Christian beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murray, on the other hand, rode her experience as a
school-board member in suburban Seattle to the state Legislature,
and, virtually unknown in most of the state, she cruised to a
remarkable victory in the 1992 Senate race after the incumbent
Democrat stumbled over sexual-harassment accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In that campaign, Ms. Murray recalled that she had once been
dismissed by a male politician as ``just a mom in tennis shoes''
who couldn't get anything major accomplished, and she turned that
tag line on its head, embracing the shoes and turning them into
perhaps the most memorable political image of the ``Year of the
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoes are still a powerful symbol, and when she traveled to
Emily Dickinson Elementary School in Redmond, Wash., the other day,
the parent-teacher committee presented her with a pair of tennis
shoes to sign for their school auction.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Murray is known for her low-key style, Ms. Smith is a
far more bombastic speaker and she revels in her maverick image:
One of a handful of Republicans who voted against Newt Gingrich's
re-election as House speaker, she once likened the speaker to a fat
child who gobbles up everybody else's food (she later apologized).
</P>
<P>
   As the challenger, Ms. Smith has almost surely been hurt by the
amount of time she has had to spend back in Washington, D.C., this
fall as Congress labored to come up with a budget. It is time she
could have used to campaign more and, just as critically, raise
funds to get her ads on the air, but she said that she has no
regrets about missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to keep priorities right,'' she said in an
interview. ``And my job is to try to keep track of what was going
on back there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't come home and do that,'' she added. ``So I decided
that I would make that choice. It would be a sacrifice but I would
rather lose than not do what I am supposed to be doing.''

IN WASHINGTON STATE, NEXT SENATOR IS SURE TO BE A WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Cal., Ill. Ky.)  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in ``p'' category) 
(mk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ Patty Murray swept into the U.S. Senate in
1992's ``Year of the Woman'' in the wake of national outrage over
the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee's handling of sexual
harassment accusations against a Supreme Court nominee. Six years
later, in her re-election campaign, a woman is once again standing
up for feminist values on the campaign trail _ ``fighting against
lechers in the work place who hit on young women,'' as she puts it.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidate saying these things is not Ms. Murray, a
Democrat, who says she must remain an ``impartial juror'' in case
President Clinton is impeached. Instead, it is her conservative
Republican opponent, Rep. Linda Smith, whose ire is on high alert.
``The feminist movement,'' Ms. Smith says, ``needs to stand up
against any man who would use women like pieces of meat like our
president has.''
</P>
<P>
   For just the third time in the nation's history, two women are
running against each other for the Senate. In California and
Illinois, other women elected to the Senate with Ms. Murray are in
serious danger of losing to men this year. But Washington state,
which boasts the highest percentage of women in the state
Legislature of any state, is certain to send a woman back to the
Senate. It is just that voters here are facing a choice between two
very different women.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the race between Ms. Murray and Ms. Smith, both
48, is a vivid illustration of the increasing political prominence
of women, whose numbers are at an all-time high in both the U.S.
House (54) and Senate (nine). But even as both candidates cite
their experience as working mothers and talk eloquently about the
importance of having a woman's perspective in the Senate, it is
clear that they have wide differences over just what it means to
have that perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith's challenge reflects the fact that even as Democratic
women who hold office or are candidates still outnumber their
Republican counterparts, the gap has been closing in recent years,
according to statistics compiled by the Center for the American
Woman and Politics at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute. (In
House and Senate elections on Nov. 3, 82 Democrats and 49
Republicans on the ballot are women, an overall number that ties a
record set in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   In short, the politics of women circa 1998 looks much more
complicated and ideologically diverse than it did six years ago.
Just having more women elected to office does not necessarily
guarantee that any particular policies will be favored in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murray, for instance, is one of the most reliable
abortion-rights supporters in the Senate, while Smith is staunchly
anti-abortion, and they have clashed strongly over the issue during
this campaign, especially on whether to outlaw the procedure that
its critics call partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent debate in Seattle, Ms. Murray said that no woman
wants to find out late in her pregnancy that continuing it could
threaten her life or health, and she said that criminalizing a
decision for abortion at that point would be totally unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the Congress, shouldn't be the ones telling her she should
go to jail,'' Ms. Murray said. ``That decision should be made
between her, her doctor and her faith.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Smith castigated Ms. Murray as one of the ``radical
senators'' who favored the ``barbaric practice'' of late-term
abortion. And she has consistently expressed her own opposition to
all abortions, including cases of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of Clinton's relationship with a White
House intern, one that Ms. Smith, who is from the Vancouver area in
southwest Washington, has sought to cast as an albatross around Ms.
Murray's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said of Clarence Thomas stronger things, that he should
not serve, and she said of Packwood very strong things, that he
should step down,'' Ms. Smith said in an interview of Ms. Murray's
reactions to earlier cases involving a Supreme Court nominee and a
U.S. senator facing accusations of harassing behavior toward women.
``You treat this issue equally, and if you've got a man abusing the
power, taking advantage of younger women who are subordinates, then
you speak out consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is not much evidence here that Ms. Murray has been
seriously damaged by Ms. Smith's attacks on the issue. Ms. Murray
has said several times that she is ``disappointed'' in the
president's behavior but, unlike Ms. Smith, who has both suggested
that the president resign and supported his impeachment, Ms. Murray
argues that it is inappropriate for someone who may cast a Senate
vote in an impeachment trial to be so adamant on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   And so far in this race, most analysts continue to see much
evidence that Ms. Murray has the upper hand. The most recent
statewide poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research
Inc., shows Ms. Murray leading Ms. Smith by 51 percent to 38
percent. Ms. Smith, who has never lost an election and has made
something of a career for herself of toppling seemingly entrenched
Democratic opponents, says she is undaunted by the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murray has more money, for several reasons, at least one of
which reflects just how much partisan stereotypes have been turned
topsy-turvy in this race.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans are often seen as the favored candidates of
corporate interests, the reverse is true here, in no small part
because Ms. Smith remains a bitter foe of some of the biggest
free-trade pacts negotiated by Congress in recent years, a position
that riles many business leaders here in one of the nation's most
trade-dependent states.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith is a caustic critic of China, which she accuses of
flooding the American market with ``slave-labor camp goods,'' and
she is the only member of the state's congressional delegation to
vote against continuing normal trade status for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That is a position that her supporters cast as one of tremendous
courage, and for which some human-rights groups have praised her,
but it is also one that Ms. Murray describes as both naive and
harmful to the state's economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to have our wheat or apples in China if we
stop trading with them, as Linda has voted to do,'' Ms. Murray said
in the Seattle debate. And speaking before a group of approving
Rotarians here in this Seattle suburb the other day, Ms. Murray
repeated her frequent contention that the best way to affect human
rights in China is to continue trade and dialogue with Chinese
leaders, not to close the door to a relationship with them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith's ability to generate campaign money is also severely
hampered by another stand she says she has taken on principle. She
is a strong proponent of overhauling campaign-finance laws, and her
sharp criticism of Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is a chief
opponent of such legislation, has hurt her in the campaign
pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, who heads the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, could give as much as $540,000 to Ms. Smith's campaign,
which is well behind Ms. Murray's in terms of campaign commercials
running on state airwaves. But even as it has poured more than $1
million into California state Treasurer Matt Fong's bid to unseat
Sen. Barbara Boxer, the Democratic incumbent, the national
Republicans have given only a little more than $100,000 to Ms.
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   For all their ideological differences, Ms. Murray and Ms. Smith,
who served together in the Washington state Senate, share many
intriguing similarities in their careers. Both come from
working-class backgrounds and took an interest in a local issue _
schools, in Ms. Murray's case, and high taxes, in Ms. Smith's _ and
turned it into a signature cause that helped propel them into
office. And both have stunned seemingly entrenched incumbents in
making it there.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a grandmother of six whose husband, Vern, is a locomotive
engineer, waged a successful write-in campaign in 1994 to become
the Republican candidate in the 3rd Congressional District,
encompassing the southwestern part of the state. She has relied on
an extensive, intensely dedicated cadre of volunteers, which she
calls ``Linda's army,'' and whose members tend to share her
conservative, Christian beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murray, on the other hand, rode her experience as a
school-board member in suburban Seattle to the state Legislature,
and, virtually unknown in most of the state, she cruised to a
remarkable victory in the 1992 Senate race after the incumbent
Democrat stumbled over sexual-harassment accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In that campaign, Ms. Murray recalled that she had once been
dismissed by a male politician as ``just a mom in tennis shoes''
who couldn't get anything major accomplished, and she turned that
tag line on its head, embracing the shoes and turning them into
perhaps the most memorable political image of the ``Year of the
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoes are still a powerful symbol, and when she traveled to
Emily Dickinson Elementary School in Redmond, Wash., the other day,
the parent-teacher committee presented her with a pair of tennis
shoes to sign for their school auction.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Murray is known for her low-key style, Ms. Smith is a
far more bombastic speaker and she revels in her maverick image:
One of a handful of Republicans who voted against Newt Gingrich's
re-election as House speaker, she once likened the speaker to a fat
child who gobbles up everybody else's food (she later apologized).
</P>
<P>
   As the challenger, Ms. Smith has almost surely been hurt by the
amount of time she has had to spend back in Washington, D.C., this
fall as Congress labored to come up with a budget. It is time she
could have used to campaign more and, just as critically, raise
funds to get her ads on the air, but she said that she has no
regrets about missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to keep priorities right,'' she said in an
interview. ``And my job is to try to keep track of what was going
on back there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't come home and do that,'' she added. ``So I decided
that I would make that choice. It would be a sacrifice but I would
rather lose than not do what I am supposed to be doing.''

   BIG PINE KEY, Fla. _ It was not the 5 inches of gray muck that
covered their once-green lawn or even their water-sopped mobile
home _ its floors gone, its furniture ruined _ that disheartened
Bob Dagnall and Dawn Kawzinsky.
</P>
<P>
   One month after Hurricane Georges pushed 6 feet of water across
the sea-level Sands subdivision, leaving the couple an
uninhabitable shell with a $39,000 mortgage, they learned that
rebuilding here would require a special home on 12-foot pillars on
a downsized lot.
</P>
<P>
   The likely cost, under present codes, is $80,000. Their
insurance may pay only $12,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before the storm, we were legal,'' said Dagnall, a
mechanic. ``Today, it's a no-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For people in the Florida Keys, Georges revealed the fragility
of a 100-mile archipelago connected to the mainland by wires, a
pipe and a single highway. In scattered places on Big Pine Key, 30
miles from Key West, power is still out, water is unsafe to drink
and hundreds are homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But the hurricane also exposed here what Bob Herman, director of
growth management for Monroe County calls ``sins of yesterday'':
grandfathered or unenforced sanitation, and building and flood
regulations that, for years, allowed uncontrolled and unsafe
development.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said the storm damaged 150 to 200 mobile homes so badly
that they would require new building permits, kicking in federal
regulations for elevated foundations in flood zones and state
requirements to replace any illegal cesspools with $8,000 septic
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The storm also flooded scores of illegal ground-floor apartments
in raised houses. ``There may be 6,000 of these mother-in-law
rooms, many of them rented to people who work in the tourist
business,'' Herman said. After the storm, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency provided temporary housing for 1,600 people.
</P>
<P>
   To help homeowners recover, Monroe County is allowing them to
spend up to $2,500 for storm repairs without a permit. But there is
evidence that some residents are hurriedly patching up homes and
apartments to avoid the tougher regulations. There is also
political pressure to relax codes for people already hard-hit.
</P>
<P>
   In Key West, for example, a high-profile fight is under way to
preserve the 11 surviving floating homes on the quaint but
controversial Houseboat Row. Before the hurricane, its 26 units
dumped raw sewage into shallow water along a seawall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm is an opportunity for this community to make some
important decisions about their future, as we try to reconstruct
ourselves,'' said Jack Teague, the state Health Department's
environmental administrator in the Keys. ``The question will be
`Will we use it to improve ourselves or simply perpetuate the
problems that we've been facing before the storm?'''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups say the storm only made obvious their
long-standing argument that the Keys are overdeveloped. ``The fact
is, these waste water systems are leaching into canals and
near-shore waters every day,'' said David Holtz, the local
representative of the Center for Marine Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 4,000 illegal
cesspools remain in the Keys, but studies show that conventional
septic drain fields also leak into the sea within 12 to 24 hours
after a toilet is flushed. When they were built in the 1950s and
1960s, homeowners routinely knocked a hole in the bottom of septic
tanks to prevent the tanks from floating out of the ground during
storm surges, said Gene Shinn of the U.S. Geological Survey, who
grew up in the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Shinn told a federal task force led by Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt that the sewage is contributing to the
decline of the Keys coral reef, visited by 1.5 million tourists a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The waste issue has become more urgent after preliminary
findings by scientists working for the environmental agency that
virus pathogens from waste water exist in sea water near shore. Dr.
Joan Rose of the University of South Florida said levels are high
enough that residents who swim year-round in canals contaminated by
septic systems are likely to get sick.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of government agencies and environmental groups has
asked a reluctant Congress for $200 million to build central sewer
systems in the Keys. They argue that the law creating the Florida
Keys National Marine Sanctuary in 1990 demands federal protection
of its waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people have put in too many illegal fixtures, and
that has to be corrected. The party's over,'' said John Hankinson
Jr., the environmental agency's regional administrator who chairs
the group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If Congress declines, the coalition is suggesting a toll on U.S.
1, the highway built by the federal government to encourage
visitors after the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The road, paralleled by power lines and a water pipe from the
mainland, fueled growth in the 1960s. By 1976, whole islands had
been stripped of vegetation and hundreds of miles of canals had
been dug for developments. That year, the state took legal control
of Keys growth, although lawsuits delayed a growth management plan
until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the county's growth-management plan, 255 new homes can be
built a year outside Key West, provided each homeowner pays for the
removal of a cesspool somewhere in the county. All construction has
been halted on Big Pine Key. The plan also requires a study, now
being carried out by the Army Corps of Engineers, to determine the
Keys' carrying capacity, or the number of residents and tourists it
would take to irreversibly harm the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Georges caused widespread devastation, for some
residents its timing was impeccable. Donna Hastie, for one, is
looking forward to a new home to replace a trailer crushed by a
tree on a tiny lot in the Saddlebunch Keys. Ms. Hastie, who works
as a controller for a restaurant, had just received a notice to
replace her cesspool.
</P>
<P>
   She expects to get a federal low-interest loan that will cover
both the cost of a new home 8 feet off the ground and a new aerobic
waste-water system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a disaster can ever come at a good time,'' Ms. Hastie said,
``this was it.''

<P>
   A few months ago, PGA Tour players didn't have to think twice
about their vote in the race for the Player of the Year. It was no
race at all. It was a demolition.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Mark O'Meara might as well have been wearing
pinstripes. O'Meara and the Yankees, wiping out the competition.
Kicking tail, not even waiting around to take names. O'Meara was
revving his engine and lapping the field. He won two of the first
three major championships, the Masters and the British Open. Not
only was he leaving people in his dust, there was no sight of
anybody in the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   But a strange thing happened on the way to the blowout.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval showed up.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with only this week's season-ending Tour Championship
to go, the Player of the Year question is, indeed, a question. Even
O'Meara says so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, David's got a shot at it,'' O'Meara said. ``I
thought before he won at Kingsmill (two weeks ago) he had a pretty
good shot at it. He's won four tournaments, and he's a very fine
player. Of course, I'd love to win it. But if he goes on to win
another tournament, then I have to admit I'd probably vote for him
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour's Player of the Year is voted on by the touring
professionals. Many had conceded the honor to O'Meara after he won
the Masters and the British Open, becoming the first player to win
two majors in the same season since Nick Price in '94. Price was
voted Player of the Year that season.
</P>
<P>
   But while O'Meara sprinted to the big lead, Duval churned along
with the precision and determination of an accountant, which
figures considering the way he kept adding zeros to his bank
ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Duval won for the fourth time this season when he scored at the
Michelob Championship at Kingsmill this month. Nobody else, O'Meara
included, has won more than twice this year.
</P>
<P>
   The race is so close between the two that it is not overstating
the issue to say if one of them could contend or win in Atlanta at
the Tour Championship, which starts Thursday, he probably would
lock up the award.
</P>
<P>
   It has come down to this week. Win, and the tour's top honor for
consistency and performance over a full year will be bestowed on
O'Meara. Or Duval.
</P>
<P>
   And with only 30 competitors heading to East Lake Golf Club on
Thursday, winning _ or at least contending _ won't be as difficult
as it would be in a field of 144.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played well, but Mark has won two majors,'' Duval said.
``The year's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as close as either player comes to giving psychological
ammo to the other side. Hey, this is golf, remember?
</P>
<P>
   But the fact of the matter is the Player of the Year could be
determined this week in Atlanta. By all accounts, O'Meara and Duval
are too close to separate. The arguments for both players are
strong.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara won the Masters and British Open and was a strong
finisher at the PGA. He has six top-10 finishes in just 18 starts
and ranks sixth on the official money list. Though it doesn't
technically work for him in consideration for the Player of the
Year, he won the World Match Play Championship over Tiger Woods in
England this month. It doesn't hurt his rsum for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Duval has won seven times since the '97 Michelob. His four wins
this year have come at Tucson, the Shell Houston Open, the World
Series of Golf and Michelob. He has been in the top 10 in 10 of 22
starts. He is No. 1 on the money list with more than $2.4 million.
He will set a record for one-year earnings after this week,
regardless of where he finishes in the Tour Championship. He lost
the Masters by a stroke to O'Meara. Duval leads the tour in
scoring, total driving, birdies and putting.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who piled up seven second-place finishes
before he broke through and won. Now, he finds himself in position
to be the top player on the tour. It's a far cry from early in May,
when Duval _ like everybody else _ was playing catch-up against
O'Meara. At that time, he had just picked up his winner's check
from the Shell Houston Open. Though his two wins weren't as glitzy
as O'Meara's, Duval had shed his image as a bridesmaid.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, he was asked if he was the top player in the
world, to which he said: ``I don't think there's a fair way for me
to answer that question. To be fair, I don't think you can say
there is a best player week in and week out. The only fair way to
judge is to wait until the end of the season and then judge the
best player.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, that's what the PGA Tour membership will do. As for
competition against Duval and O'Meara, there is none. Vijay Singh,
Phil Mickelson, John Huston, Fred Couples and Billy Mayfair each
have won twice on the tour, but none of them has displayed the
consistency Duval has shown. And only Singh has won a major,
nudging O'Meara in the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's work early in the season was remarkable. But it was
inevitable he would tail off after the PGA. He played only one PGA
Tour event from mid-August until this past weekend at the Disney.
That was by design. He set his schedule for 1998 in '97 and didn't
deviate. He said it wasn't really tempting to alter his schedule
when it became obvious he and Duval were in a battle for supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably played fewer tournaments (in America) than ever
before,'' he said. ``Golf has become so global. For myself, I enjoy
playing internationally. If those opportunities come about, I enjoy
taking advantage of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Tour Championship is our season-ending event, and
there's a lot on the line. It would be very special to have a good
performance. It's always hard to pick and choose where you play
well. But I would hope to finish the year very strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   As would Duval, 27, who has reinvented himself as an elite
player after so many near misses in his first three seasons on the
tour. Duval believes he has a better outlook on his game than he
did during those early years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to have a knack for knocking myself back down to earth,
like I did missing the last two cuts before I headed to the World
Series (and won),'' he said. ``I think I stay pretty well-grounded
now, and it lends itself for me to play better golf. That's
probably helped me as much as anything lately because I don't think
about, `Well, I've won this and that lately.' I've won a lot. My
percentage of winning is high. That's not important. I just stay
very focused on the task at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the task is to do well this week in Atlanta, where Duval
attended Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win in Atlanta would be very special,'' he said. ``I'm
trying to think if I've won anything in Atlanta before. And I don't
think I have. I don't even think I've won a prize in a raffle or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory Sunday _ or even a strong showing _ would be more akin
to a winning lottery ticket than a raffle. The same goes for
O'Meara, 41, who is enjoying his best season on tour. He was Rookie
of the Year in 1981 and has 16 PGA Tour victories. But this week
could be the topper that defines his career. And he also realizes
that, unlike Duval, he might not have many more chances like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a dream year for me,'' he said. ``David is a very,
very talented player. He's finally proven that. He and Lee Westwood
have probably won more tournaments in the last year than anybody
else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the Player of the Year, our peers judge it. If I'm
lucky enough to get voted, I know David will have many other
chances to win it. I might not have any more chances.''

IN ISRAEL, NETANYAHU SEEKS SUPPORT FOR PEACE ACCORD AND HIS
GOVERNMENT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel,
stepping off a plane from Washington into a turbulent political
arena, plunged directly into an aggressive campaign on Sunday both
to stay in office and to secure support for the new peace accord
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Facing vituperative protests by Jewish settlers and the threat
of new elections, Netanyahu kicked off his campaign right at the
Ben Gurion Airport Sunday afternoon, mounting a charged defense of
what the right wing sees as a betrayal of all it stands for: the
turnover of more land to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast live on Israeli television, he portrayed
himself as a reluctant peacemaker and as a kind of warrior forced
to make stomach-turning strategic decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handing over even one centimeter or one grain of the soil of
the Land of Israel to the Palestinian Authority is difficult and
agonizing,'' Netanyahu said. ``We fought with all our might, we
fought like lions, to reduce as much as possible, within the
framework of Israel's commitments, the land that was handed over.''
</P>
<P>
   Appealing directly to his fiercest critics, the settlers in the
West Bank who have vowed to topple him, Netanyahu said, ``You are
us and we are you. We love you.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment fell on closed ears. The settlers formally broke
relations with Netanyahu on Sunday and announced they were seeking
a new candidate. Fanning out across roads in the West Bank, they
staged rambunctious protests, blocking about 30 junctions and
locking horns with the Israeli police even as they swayed in
prayer. Palestinian traffic was successfully halted for an hour; 20
settlers were arrested; and two police officers were lightly
injured.
</P>
<P>
   While Yasser Arafat briefed the Algerian president in Algiers on
the peace agreement Sunday, he faced troubles of his own at home,
where security officials are waging a crackdown on terrorism,
illegal weapons and dissent in the wake of the signing.
</P>
<P>
   During a violent show-down with the local chapter of Arafat's
Fatah movement in Ramallah, a military intelligence officer shot
and killed a 17-year-old boy, Wasim Tarifi, from a prominent local
family. Tires were burned, stone barricades were erected in the
heart of downtown, shops were shuttered and a general strike was
called for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst thing that could happen, an internal
confrontation and breakdown,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian
council member who witnessed the shoot-out from her home.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation was provoked when hundreds of Fatah youth
protested following a raid on the organization's local headquarters
by military intelligence officials, who seized weapons and arrested
five people.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of an upsurge of activity by security officials, who
have been cracking down on critics of the peace agreement, too. On
Friday, 11 journalists were detained for seeking an interview with
the Islamic fundamentalist spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
And Palestinian police on Sunday arrested a prominent Muslim
cleric, Sheik Hamed Bitawi, after he spoke out against the accord
on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis allow settlers to express their opposition,'' his
wife told Reuters. ``Why can't we?''
</P>
<P>
   At the airport in Tel Aviv, despite the settlers' chilly
reception, Netanyahu received not only a formal, brass-band welcome
but a genuinely enthusiastic one from cabinet ministers and from
the rank and file of his own Likud Party. This suggested that he
has successfully moved his political camp onto a new ideological
terrain where territorial compromise with the Palestinians, long
anathema, has been accepted as a pragmatic reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Likud party was founded to defend the notion of a
``greater land of Israel'' against the Labor Party's willingness to
concede territory, Labor leaders sounded disoriented Sunday, as if
they were trying to rejigger their role. In part, they gloated, and
in part, they tried hard to insist they were still opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Likud has given up the idea of the greater land of Israel,
and adopted the positions of the Labor Party,'' Ehud Barak, Labor's
leader, said. But he added: ``The state is mired in mud. It's time
to act toward early elections and establish a government that will
start pulling us out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the airport and in subsequent television interviews,
Netanyahu's rhetoric aimed squarely at that threat. While his term
is due to expire in 2000, he holds a razor-thin majority in the
Parliament, buoyed by a motley coalition of old Likud, new
immigrants and the religious right. But with this agreement, the
coalition, which arose in support of Netanyahu's anti-peace effort
stand, is fracturing.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party has promised to grant Netanyahu a two-week
``safety net,'' unwilling to topple a government on the issue of
peace. But after those two weeks are over, they are prepared to
enter a peculiar alliance with the right to bring down Netanyahu. A
bill calling for new elections could go to the Parliament as early
as this week.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In his statements Sunday, Netanyahu tried to hammer home the
idea that his right-wing critics have nowhere else to turn, because
Labor is the only other option, and wouldn't meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child knows that the Labor party would have already
given back most of the territory,'' he said. The Labor party cannot
be trusted, he said, to run the final status negotiations, which
will determine such thorny issues as borders, the return of
refugees and the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it runs the final status negotiations,'' Netanyahu said,
his voice rising, ``a Palestinian state will be established on all
the territory of the state of Israel, and the Jewish settlements
will actually be dried up and, in the end, uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will see to it that the border will not reach Tel Aviv,
here at this airport?'' he continued. ``Who will protect
Jerusalem?''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu ticked off what he described as Israel's gains from
Friday's agreement, known as ``The Wye Memorandum'' for the
conference center in Maryland where it was negotiated. He asserted
that it greatly improved on the Oslo interim peace agreement,
containing a timetable for concrete security measures by the
Palestinian Authority that must be met before Israeli withdrawals
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plugged many of the holes in the Swiss cheese of Oslo,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers did not buy it. As one group took to a bulldozer in
an unsuccessful effort to fence off a plot of land in an Arab
neighborhood in East Jerusalem, the leaders held an emergency
meeting to plan strategy against Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government is not our government,'' Rabbi Eliezer Waldman
said. ``We have been tricked. It appears that a new leadership is
needed in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlers seem to be politically isolated in their opposition
to the peace agreement. An opinion poll published Sunday by the
newspaper Yedioth Aharonot showed that 74 percent of Israelis
support the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greater Israel was buried in this agreement, and the formula
of land for peace has been accepted by all,'' said Leah Rabin,
widow of Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister who was assassinated in
1995, two years after signing the Oslo interim peace agreement.
``This is a full recognition of Yitzhak's path.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Army radio reported Sunday that the Shin Bet security
services had recommended tightening security around Netanyahu and
the ministers who accompanied him to Washington, following threats
from extremist elements on the Israeli right.

 &HT;    CARTER RECALLS HISTORIC CAMP DAVID AGREEMENT ON ITS 20th
ANNIVERSARY
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (i)
International categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. Former President Jimmy Carter said Sunday he
was ''cautiously optimistic'' that the Israeli-Palestinian
agreement reached last week on Maryland's Eastern Shore had
''basically put back on track'' Mideast peace efforts the Georgian
worked hard at two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carter warned, however, that the key to maintaining the momentum
would be the actions taken by politicians on all sides of the
accord in the weeks and months ahead, as Israelis and Palestinians
struggle to implement the U.S.-brokered deal and to negotiate the
far more difficult disputes still standing in the way of a
comprehensive and lasting Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm inclined to be cautiously optimistic,'' said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that the Israeli mothers want peace and the Palestinian
mothers want peace and the Lebanese and the Syrian and the
Jordanian mothers want peace,'' Carter said in remarks delivered at
the University of Maryland. ''The obstacles are politicians who
don't have the courage to honor the demands and prayers of the
mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter also said that eventually the question of a Palestinian
state _ Carter called for a Palestinian homeland in a 1977 speech _
would have to be taken up by Israelis and Palestinians. However, he
would not speculate on the timing or other specifics of how the
contentious matter might be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will obviously be a feature that will finally have to be
decided,'' he said in response to a question on the future of
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who served as president from 1977 until 1981, made the
remarks before some 700 students, faculty members and diplomats
from nearby Washington. The university invited Carter to deliver
the second annual Anwar Sadat Lecture for Peace, named for the
former Egyptian president, whom Carter called ''the greatest leader
I ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he sent a congratulatory letter on Friday to
President Clinton, who spent 82 hours over nine days of difficult
negotiations to help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reach agreement on a
land-for-security deal intended to break a 19-month stalemate in
the long and anguished Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's efforts comprised the most intensive personal
commitment of a U.S. president to the Mideast peace process since
September, 1978, when Carter spent 13 days holed up with Sadat and
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at the presidential retreat
at Camp David, Md. That summit provided the breakthrough that led,
the following spring, to a peace accord ending three decades of
Israeli-Egyptian hostilities. It remains a landmark achievement in
the effort to end a half century of Israeli-Arab enmity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next spring it will be 20 years. Not a single person has been
killed (between Egyptian and Israeli militaries) and not a single
word of that peace treaty has been violated,'' Carter said. ''It
has been a testament that it's possible (that) Arabs and Israelis,
who have despised each other, who have killed each other, who have
been at war with each other, can indeed find peace, so that it is
permanently beneficial to both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement between Netanyahu and Arafat calls for
negotiations to begin early in November on the so-called final
status issues of territory, water, security and other matters that
would form the framework for a permanent peace accord between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks are expected to include the volatile issues of the
status of Jerusalem _ both sides claim it as their own _ and the
question of a formal Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what's going to happen in the future,'' said
Carter. But, he said, Friday's agreement has ''basically put back
on track the peace process...there's hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the Camp David summit, Carter said it was concern
for future generations that ultimately saved what was, overall, 13
days in which Sadat and Begin spent mostly not talking to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   On the 11th day, Carter recalled, there was a point at which the
talks were on the verge of collapse and all three leaders were
packing their bags to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Begin, though, had asked Carter to sign a photograph of the men
together, as a souvenir for his grandchildren back in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   An aide brought Carter eight photographs. ''Instead of just
signing Jimmy Carter,'' he recalled, ``I put, 'With love,' to every
one of his grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Begin was ''hardly speaking to me,'' Carter recalled, when he
dropped by the Israeli leaders' Camp David quarters to deliver the
souvenir photos.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said 'Thank you, Mr. President,' and turned around,
dismissing me, in effect. And then he looked down and he read the
first photograph, and he called out the name of his granddaughter.
And then one by one he read out the names of his grandchildren. And
tears ran down his cheeks. And, when I saw them, I also cried. And
he said, 'Why don't we try one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Carter, ''To make a long story short, we concluded the
agreement.''

   LOS ANGELES: last of her cantaloupe chunks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat, Louise,'' Shah prodded her friend. ``I'm almost done, so
I can help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time, there is no other time,'' Shah murmured, as she stuffed
her empty Tupperware into her lunch box and then reached across the
desk and wrested away the dues notices from a protesting Dilger.
</P>
<P>
   When her last class ended at 2:40 p.m., she briskly gathered up
work sheets from the desks. Her last task -- putting chairs on the
desks -- really is not her job, but she said, ``The custodians,
they do so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, her school day was not over yet -- not nearly. First
she had to pick up jars of amoebas and parameciums for her
students' experiments.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekends, Shah might head to Costco and pack her blue
Plymouth Voyager with tubs of peanuts and M&AMP;Ms so she can teach
students about mixtures. And she may swing by garage sales in
search of bargains for her classroom, like the aquarium she lugged
to school so her students could observe fish.
</P>
<P>
   Shah was born and raised in Baroda, India, to a family with
strong ties to education -- her mother was a teacher and her father
was a principal.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a middle school student, she recalls she had a knack for
teaching science. When her eighth-grade science teacher would leave
the lesson plan behind, Shah would teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could control the class -- even the boys,'' Shah said.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to earn her bachelor's and master's degrees in
biology before she married. When she married Bharat Shah, 51, she
intended to be a wife and mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he said, maybe you will get bored -- how about teaching?''
Shah said. So Shah went back to earn her bachelor's degree in
education at Maharaja Sayajirao University, in Baroda, where she
had earned her previous degrees.
</P>
<P>
   She began teaching at a private school in Baroda and had a
daughter, Dipa, now a 20-year-old student at UCLA. Shah's other
daughter, Anuja, is 16.
</P>
<P>
   The family emigrated to the United States in the late 1970s,
living off the salary of Shah's husband, a metallurgist, and moved
to California's San Fernando Valley in early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the valley that Shah decided to start teaching again.
But she had doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never been in an American class. I had struggled with
English as a child. It was overwhelming to me to be a mother, to
run a household, cook and watch over my daughters,'' Shah said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Shah juggles work and family like she runs her classroom
-- with efficiency. She creates traditional Indian dinners almost
every night and even manages to squeeze in hourlong walks with her
husband after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just takes practice and attitude,'' Shah said. ``A
lot of it is attitude -- that you (ITAL ON)can(ITAL OFF) do it.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In the predawn hours one recent morning, Darshana
Shah padded into her kitchen and flipped on the light, a lone
beacon in her slumbering neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   There, clad in pajamas at her kitchen table, the 46-year-old
teacher combed through the newspaper looking for science and health
stories to clip out for her sixth- and seventh-grade students at
Portola Middle School in Tarzana, a suburban community
appoximately 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. It was
5:30 a.m. -- the start of a typical workday for Shah that would
stretch 17 hours.
</P>
<P>
   For Shah, teaching extends well beyond the walls of her
classroom and begins well before the school bell rings. It is her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to be a teacher,'' said Shah, who knew since middle
school that she would follow her mother and father into education.
``I feel like I'm learning a lot from the students. They're
excited, I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Such dedication has not gone unrewarded: Shah has been selected
as one of 11 state finalists for the Presidential Awards for
Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching. She will find out
in January if she is one of the two winners for California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids appreciate how motivated and excited she is about
science, and it's infectious,'' said Kriste Mencher, Portola's
magnet coordinator. ``And she is so willing to put in the extra
time, whatever it is that is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Shah's extra effort and recognition, she gets the same
salary as her colleagues who have the same level of education and
experience. The average salary for a Los Angeles Unified School
District teacher is about $45,900, for 50 hours a week, according
to the district and teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers do not receive merit pay because the union believes
gauging exactly who deserved it would be difficult if not
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be able to say teachers would be paid overtime for
all the things they do on their own time. What is merit? Is merit
putting in long, extra hours? Many teachers do that,'' said Day
Higuchi, president of United Teachers Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If teachers are well supported and given the resources, they
motivate themselves to put in all kinds of time,'' he said. ``By
and large, teachers don't need an external incentive to work as
hard as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All they ask,'' he added, ``is that they get paid enough to
hold their heads up in polite company.''
</P>
<P>
   Shah said she is satisfied with her salary of about $50,000 and
would rather spend her energy teaching than pushing the union to
negotiate for merit raises as talks resume this week with the
school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have complaints,'' Shah said. ``Whatever I want I
think I can have because I tailor my needs to my income.''
</P>
<P>
   As on most days, Shah left her home around 7 a.m. to give
herself time to drop off her 16-year-old daughter at her high
school.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived at Portola Middle School by 7:30 a.m. -- enough time
to take her shopping bags full of science supplies to class before
homeroom period. The school reimburses her for extra supplies, but
sometimes she ends up spending her own money.
</P>
<P>
   Always trying to make each student feel special, Shah decided
this year to celebrate the birthdays of her 20 homeroom pupils.
It's a small gesture, she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help me so much. When I have back-to-school night they
help me set up, every morning if I need some help with setting up a
lab, they help,'' Shah said. ``I wanted to do something for them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a magnet schoolteacher, Shah works with the LAUSD's
brightest, most challenging students. The program serves 245
students who are taught an advanced curriculum tailored to a
specialty, like science.
</P>
<P>
   Shah teaches five science classes, four for highly gifted magnet
students who must have an IQ of 145 or higher to qualify. Frog
dissections are simply not enough to satisfy the intellectual
cravings of Shah's students.
</P>
<P>
   So she brings in fetal pigs, starfish and squid for dissections.
Shah's students don't just draw DNA strands, they string together
beads to create DNA molecule jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   She allows her students to write science poetry instead of
essays. They can create computer-generated science models or make
life-size models. Instead of taking tests, Shah's students can
create puppet shows, newscasts or science ``Jeopardy'' games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever way they learn that's fine,'' Shah said. ``Some like
paper and pencil tests, and some like (puppet shows). As long as
they show me that they learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Shah also created a DNA genetics program with the Thousand Oaks,
Calif.-based biotech company Amgen Inc. that gives students
hands-on experience with genetic materials.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching is like lighting candles, according to Shah.
</P>
<P>
   ``They learn on their own,'' Shah said. ``You just provide the
experience. And the more experiences they have the more they
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Cruz, one of Shah's sixth-graders, never liked science
when he was in elementary school. That has changed with Shah.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will go over it a lot of times until you get it,'' said
the 11-year-old. ``I came here not liking science. Now I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shah's clipped pace continued even during lunch. Among the
cabinets filled with specimens in glass jars and posters of animal
and plant cells, Shah and other teachers heated up their lunches
and sat at the students' desks to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Math teacher Louise Dilger, co-chairwoman of the faculty
association with Shah, began stapling dues notices in between
bites. The minute Shah noticed this, she gulped down the last of
her cantaloupe chunks.

BOTTOM LINE: RODMAN IN, SHAQ OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when the NBA came out with its feel-good 50th
Anniversary team, announced amidst huge fanfare at halftime of the
'96 All-Star game? And everyone honored _ except Shaquille O'Neal
and Jerry West _ thought enough to show up.
</P>
<P>
   The editors of Athlon Sports' pro basketball special collectors
edition ($4.99, on newsstands) goes a step better: It not only
picks the game's top 50 players of all time but ranks them.
</P>
<P>
   And there's only so much agreement on who should be among the
top 50, too.
</P>
<P>
   On Athlon's list, the top nine include five who spent a majority
of their glory days, if not all, with the Lakers. They shouldn't be
too tough to figure out _ they've all got numbers up on the wall at
the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10:
</P>
<P>
   1. Michael Jordan
</P>
<P>
   2. Bill Russell
</P>
<P>
   3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
</P>
<P>
   4. Oscar Robertson
</P>
<P>
   5. Magic Johnson
</P>
<P>
   6. Larry Bird
</P>
<P>
   7. Wilt Chamberlain
</P>
<P>
   8. Elgin Baylor
</P>
<P>
   9. Jerry West
</P>
<P>
   10. Bob Pettit
</P>
<P>
   Because Athlon weighed championship rings more heavily into the
equation than personal statistics, Russell's choice at No. 2 over
Abdul-Jabbar and Chamberlain makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   The others on Athlon's list who spent time with the Lakers are
George Mikan (No. 15), Bob McAdoo (No. 33), Connie Hawkins (No. 38)
and, albeit briefly and dangerously, Spencer Haywood (No. 41).
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're doing your homework, this means not only O'Neal
but also James Worthy missed the cut. Both were selections on the
NBA's 50th Anniversary team.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, nine players on the NBA's team weren't worthy
of Athlon's roster. In addition to O'Neal and Worthy, gone are Bill
Walton, Robert Parish, Lenny Wilkens, Sam Jones, Wes Unseld, Dave
DeBusschere and Earl Monroe. They've been replaced by McAdoo,
Hawkins, Haywood, Dennis Rodman, Walt Bellamy, Artis Gilmore, Mel
Daniels, George McGinnis and Dan Issel.
</P>
<P>
   One reason might be that Athlon's list doesn't discriminate
against those who spent a majority of their careers in the ABA,
which seven of those nine did. And it doesn't carry any grudges
against Rodman, who could be the game's most prolific rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   __ Postscript: Rodman said it on the ``Tonight Show'' with Jay
Leno last week, talking about the NBA lockout:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of messed up that a lot of guys in the NBA
do not deserve the money. You have guys (making) $150 million and
they don't do a damn thing. That's kind of screwed up, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have a guy here in L.A. like that. Don't get me
wrong, I like Shaq as a competitor, but as far as his
determination, it's kind of . . . I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   We hear ya.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the last eight years, Georgia has boomed, and it
has done so under Democratic rule. The state has created jobs
faster than any state east of the Mississippi. Its population has
exploded by 16 percent, the highest growth in the South. It has
eliminated the state tax on groceries. Its 5-year-old lottery has
provided college scholarships for 319,000 college students and
prekindergarten classes for 246,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   But deep problems have gone unaddressed under Democratic rule as
well. The state's educational system remains troubled, with Georgia
students ranking 49th this year on the SATs. Atlanta, the city that
has driven the state's economic growth, has become clogged with
traffic and soiled by dirty air and water.
</P>
<P>
   And so this year's race for governor, in a state that seems to
grow more Republican by the day, has centered on whether Georgia's
glass is half full or half empty. Have the Democrats earned the
right to add to their 126 years of uninterrupted rule, or has this
state, like much of the South, become so Republican that party
labels will obscure considerations of governmental experience?
</P>
<P>
   The race between Roy Barnes, a longtime Democratic legislator,
and his Republican opponent, Guy Millner, an entrepreneur, has
taken on national significance because Georgia is the only state
that has not elected a Republican governor since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, 50, represents Cobb County, an Atlanta suburb that is
heavily Republican. He presents himself as a qualified steward of
the state's recent progress. Millner, 62, who lives in Atlanta's
toniest neighborhood, offers himself as an agent of change who will
protect the most successful Democratic programs while shaking up a
government that has rarely felt threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to take the beach,'' Millner said Sunday in a
debate that was televised by Atlanta's WSB. ``This is a campaign
going against a Democratic monopoly that's been in our state for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes counters that it is Democrats who have made Georgia the
magnet it is today. He has tethered himself tightly to Georgia's
immensely popular governor, Zell Miller, who is retiring after two
terms and who has endorsed Barnes in television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see all those negative things that Guy Millner sees
about Georgia,'' Barnes told Democrats at a fund-raising dinner in
Atlanta last week. ``I see a Georgia that prospers.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner, a founder and board member of Norell Corp., a
temporary-services firm, has narrowly lost runs for governor and
U.S. senator in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is a one-time loser, having lost to Miller in the 1990
gubernatorial primary. A lawyer and businessman, he has spent 22
years in the General Assembly, developing a record that is
considered conservative within his party. He voted against the
establishment of a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, a vote he says
he regrets. He also initially opposed the state lottery, though he
has become an enthusiastic supporter of its educational benefits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The race has been expensive and hard fought, with accusations of
racism and lying and a barrage of negative advertisements produced
by both sides. Both campaigns expect to spend close to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, whose wealth was estimated at $167 million this summer,
is likely to provide at least half of his campaign's funding, while
Barnes has contributed about $850,000 of his own money. The most
recent independent polling gave Millner a lead of 45 percent to 42
percent, a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists on both sides report that the numbers have gone
essentially unchanged for weeks, with party loyalists already
committed and few issues seeming to move undecided voters. ``You
can drop an atom bomb and nothing happens,'' said Raymond Strother,
Barnes' media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Millner began running television advertisements
accusing Barnes of supporting racial quotas. Barnes responded that
he has always opposed quotas, though he voted against a bill this
year that would have ended affirmative action in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The new advertisement, and Millner's constant criticism of the
city of Atlanta, which has a black mayor, have prompted Barnes to
accuse his opponent of ``playing the race card'' in a state that
has prospered largely because it has avoided divisive racial
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   On the issues, Millner has proposed eliminating Georgia's tax on
automobile tags. He also says he wants to reduce class sizes in
Georgia schools by hiring 7,500 new teachers. To pay for those
expensive proposals, Millner maintains that he can use a
businessman's approach to cut 7 percent from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Barnes' campaign have been his proposals to
lower residential property taxes and to give managed-care consumers
a greater choice of doctors. He scoffs at Millner's contention that
he can find enough waste in the state budget to pay for his
proposals, saying it demonstrates his lack of experience in state
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't understand that these things actually cost money,''
Barnes said in Sunday's debate. Noting that Georgia's most recent
governors have come from the General Assembly, he added, ``It's
experience in running the state that makes us prosperous.''
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce that point, Barnes asked Millner on Sunday to
explain how the state's revenue estimates were determined, a
question that gave Millner some trouble. In other recent forums,
Millner has fumbled when asked to explain important bills and to
state how many legislators Georgia has.
</P>
<P>
   Millner acknowledged Sunday that Barnes ``can tell you every
bill number line by line, and I applaud that.'' But, he added, ``Is
that what is needed?''
</P>
<P>
   And he said that after more than a century of one-party rule,
Georgia needs a leader who will ask why new things cannot be tried.
``Yes, I'm Pollyanna,'' he said. ``I'm not willing to say we can't
do it.''

conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   On the issues, Millner has proposed eliminating Georgia's tax on
automobile tags. He also says he wants to reduce class sizes in
Georgia schools by hiring 7,500 new teachers. To pay for those
expensive proposals, Millner maintains that he can use a
businessman's approach to cut 7 percent from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Barnes' campaign have been his proposals to
lower residential property taxes and to give managed-care consumers
a greater choice of doctors. He scoffs at Millner's contention that
he can find enough waste in the state budget to pay for his
proposals, saying it demonstrates his lack of experience in state
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't understand that these things actually cost money,''
Barnes said in Sunday's debate. Noting that Georgia's most recent
governors have come from the General Assembly, he added, ``It's
experience in running the state that makes us prosperous.''
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce that point, Barnes asked Millner on Sunday to
explain how the state's revenue estimates were determined, a
question that gave Millner some trouble. In other recent forums,
Millner has fumbled when asked to explain important bills and to
state how many legislators Georgia has.
</P>
<P>
   Millner acknowledged Sunday that Barnes ``can tell you every
bill number line by line, and I applaud that.'' But, he added, ``Is
that what is needed?''
</P>
<P>
   And he said that after more than a century of one-party rule,
Georgia needs a leader who will ask why new things cannot be tried.
``Yes, I'm Pollyanna,'' he said. ``I'm not willing to say we can't
do it.''

IN A COMEBACK YEAR, HUSTON COMES BACK FOR VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Sunday's victory by John Huston was
done in comeback fashion, befitting his comeback season.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Huston was frustrated and disappointed, suffering
through his worst season on the PGA Tour. He fell out of the top
125 on the money list for the first time since turning
professional.
</P>
<P>
   To keep his tour card, Huston was forced to use a one-time
exemption he had earned as one of the top 50 players in career
earnings, and he entered this season needing to prove that he could
still win at golf's highest level.
</P>
<P>
   Huston has more than provided that proof. Sunday at the National
Car Rental Golf Classic, he added to his most satisfying season
with one of his most impressive victories. Starting the day five
strokes off the lead, Huston shot a six-under par 66, overtaking an
impressive group of contenders to defeat Davis Love III by one
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Huston took the lead for good on the 15th hole and finished at
16 under par for the tournament (272). Love shot a 71 and
squandered a 3-stroke lead that he had held entering the final
round. Brent Geiberger, who shot Sunday's best round, 65, at Walt
Disney World's Magnolia Course, finished third at 13 under par.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, the fifth of his career, earned Huston $360,000 and
even more respect among his peers. It was his second victory of the
year, his first coming at the United Airlines Hawaiian Open, when
he shot 28 under par to set a 72-hole tour record for most strokes
under par.
</P>
<P>
   And with Sunday's victory, Huston moved to No. 9 on this year's
money list ($1,438,910), almost doubling his previous best year of
1994, when he earned just over $731,000.
</P>
<P>
   This year, at age 37, the real John Huston returned. And the
adversity he overcame has made him even more appreciative of
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of last year, I was totally frustrated,'' said
Huston, who was bothered in 1997 by a shoulder injury. ``I didn't
feel good physically. Mentally I was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to be sitting in this position at the end of this
year. I've played consistent all the time, and I have not had any
times when I was really struggling. It has definitely been my best
year.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the last full-field event of the tour year before this
week's Tour Championship in Atlanta, which is reserved for the
year's top 30 money winners.
</P>
<P>
   Several issues were settled Sunday, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _ The top 125 money winners were decided. Those players earned
automatic playing privileges for next year and avoided next month's
qualifying school. Blaine McCallister had a terrificround to
secure his tour card for next year, shooting a 66 to capture the
125th spot on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Tolles also secured his card, shooting a 71 to tie for
15th place and move to 115th on the list. Dave Stockton Jr., who
started the week at No. 125, missed the cut and fell to 132nd
place. And it was also a heartbreaking day for P.H. Horgan III, who
shot a 69 but finished 126th on the money list, a little more than
$4,000 behind McCallister.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stewart Cink failed in his bid to make the top 30 on the money
list after Sunday's four-over-par 76. Cink needed to finish tied
for eighth or better to pass Andrew Magee on the list. But Cink
finished tied for 51st in the tournament, and he will stay home
this week while Magee goes to the Tour Championship as No. 30 on
the list.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Duval virtually clinched the 1998 money title, despite
finishing tied for 43rd Sunday. With just over $2.47 million won
this year, Duval is more than $650,000 ahead of Jim Furyk, who is
second on the list. For Furyk to win the money title, he would have
to win the Tour Championship and Duval would have to finish last.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's spotlight belonged to Huston, who also won at
Disney in 1992. Huston used an accurate tee-to-green game and
steady putting to keep the pressure on Love, who hit too many
erratic approach shots.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Playing in the next-to-last threesome with Tiger Woods and Fred
Funk, who finished tied for seventh place at 7 under par, Huston
birdied Nos. 4, 5 and 8 to pull into a first-place tie with Love
and Doug Martin at 13 under par.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who also finished tied for seventh, dropped off the pace
when Huston and Love both birdied Nos. 10 and 11. Huston made a
40-foot putt at No. 11, and when Martin bogeyed No. 14 to fall two
strokes behind, it became a two-man race between Huston and Love,
who were still tied at 15 under par.
</P>
<P>
   Then Love made a costly bogey at No. 15, a par 3, when he hit
his tee shot into the rough, chipped to 10 feet, then missed the
putt. That allowed Huston to open a 2-stroke lead with a birdie at
No. 16, a par 4, when he hit a beautiful 7-iron approach shot to
three feet, then made the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Love scrambled back, making a 15-footer for birdie at No. 16 to
pull within 1 stroke again. But he could not birdie either of the
last two holes to force a playoff. Love hit a great drive at No.
18, but his 9-iron approach shot drifted into the left fringe,
about 25 feet from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   With Huston already in the clubhouse at 16 under par, Love
needed to make his next shot to force sudden death. But his birdie
attempt from the fringe stopped about a foot short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inexcusable, really, to have an 8-iron and a 9-iron into
the last two holes, and not get either close to the hole,'' Love
said. ``If I can drive it that straight, I ought to be able to hit
a 9-iron to within 10 feet. I just didn't give myself makeable
putts. That was the difference. But John played well, and I'm happy
for him. To do what he did this year is quite an accomplishment.'' &QL;

STUDENT JAILED AFTER INSTRUCTOR IS THREATENED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A University of Maryland senior remained in a
county jail Sunday after the campus police said he threatened a
teaching assistant in an attempt to receive an A on a test he had
not taken.
</P>
<P>
   University of Maryland police officers arrested Stephen Clancy
Hill, a 22-year-old economics major, near his home in Riverdale,
Md., on Oct. 14. He was charged with first-degree assault, use of a
handgun in the commission of a felony, carrying a concealed deadly
weapon and possessing a deadly weapon on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had requested a private meeting in the mathematics building
with a teaching assistant, Alvaro Alvarez-Parrilla, on Oct. 9, two
days after missing the test, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, they said, Hill met with Alvarez-Parrilla in his
office, where he lifted his jacket to reveal a handgun he carried
in a shoulder holster and threatened to ``make him disappear'' if
he did not give Hill an A on the test.
</P>
<P>
   When Alvarez-Parrilla said he would not comply, Hill left the
office without hurting him, police said. The teaching assistant
reported the incident to the police that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real threat that we had to investigate,'' said Capt.
Mary Brock of the University of Maryland police.
</P>
<P>
   The police obtained a search warrant for Hill's home and car,
and officers arrested Hill in his car at a traffic intersection. A
loaded 9-mm semiautomatic handgun and three other loaded magazines
were found in Hill's car and a shoulder holster was recovered at
his home, the officers said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is being held on $15,000 bond at Prince George's County
Detention Center. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The incident caused concern on the campus in College Park, Md.
But James Bentley, a sophomore, said he was not surprised by the
arrest. ``I had seen him carrying around the weapon with bullets in
his pocket,'' Bentley said of Hill. ``When I asked him why he
carried the gun, he said it was for people who get on his bad
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's lawyer, Rosalyn Pugh, said: ``When the facts are out, I'm
sure Hill will be vindicated. There's more to this story than meets
the eye.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chuck Schumer had just graduated from Harvard Law School,
earning a passport to the kind of wealth and freedom from worry
that his parents could only imagine, when he broke the news to them
that he had hatched a different plan.
</P>
<P>
   As the family drove from the courtyards of Cambridge, Mass.,
back to their narrow three-bedroom house in the Flatbush section of
Brooklyn, Abe and Selma Schumer's oldest son announced that he
would not hunker down to study for the bar exam. Instead, he would
wake before dawn to stand outside subway stations. He would stay
out past dusk to ring doorbells.
</P>
<P>
   There was an open seat representing his area of Brooklyn in the
New York state Assembly, and Schumer intended to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Only partly in jest, Selma Schumer urged her friends not to vote
for him. ``We thought he was crazy,'' she said, speaking for both
herself and her husband, who worked as an exterminator. ``He had
wonderful job offers. With good money! We were impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   But her son was intent, instinctively sensing what he really
wanted and knowing that he could get it. He was just 23 years old,
and he never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer won that election, and every one after it. He left the
state Assembly to enter Congress when he was only 30. Now 47, he is
waging the most critical campaign of his career, trying to do what
several other Democrats before him failed to: unseat Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, the Republican who has represented New York in the U.S.
Senate for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   And he is bringing to that quest the same confidence, sense of
purpose and knack for political positioning that he carried with
him on that ride back from Cambridge in the summer of 1974. He is
also bringing a set of sharp political tools that he has honed ever
since. One is the ability to master complex issues and make them
understandable to average voters, as he demonstrated in the
televised debates with D'Amato this last weekend. Another is an
eagerness to take credit for successful initiatives, even those for
which he is not entirely responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has never been ambivalent about his goals and, like his
rival, he has never been less than cunning in attaining them. His
political ascent has been steady and methodical; his political
evolution has been just as canny.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the Assembly as a something of a reformer, a youthful
antidote to the corruption epitomized by the gathering storm clouds
of Watergate. A proud bearer of liberal Democratic standards in the
late 1970s and 1980s, he emphasized more moderate positions in the
1990s, as liberalism fell out of vogue and he contemplated a run
for governor or senator. Either race would require the favor of a
statewide electorate more conservative than the constituents in his
congressional district in New York City, and Schumer's recent
record suggests that he appreciated that.
</P>
<P>
   He became an ardent crime fighter, a zealous consumer advocate
and a stubborn enemy of fraud and waste in the food stamps program,
seizing issues that appealed to a broad range of voters across the
political divide.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said any change in his political persona was a response
to the needs and concerns of the people in Brooklyn and Queens whom
he represented and the result of growing older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I more conservative than I was 20 years ago?'' he wondered
aloud one recent morning as he ate a bowl of oatmeal in the dining
room inside the U.S. Capitol. ``Sure. But it's been a gradual
process.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that few people remained utterly fixed in their
opinions through time, and portrayed his flexibility as something
preferable to the intellectual rigidity of some politicians. ``I
don't like people who think they got the message from on high,'' he
said. ``I don't like ideologues from the left or the right.''
</P>
<P>
   But many colleagues and political analysts said there has been
obvious calculation in the arc of Schumer's career, a painstaking
preparation for this moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's cherry-picked some issues very, very carefully to
prevent himself from being pigeonholed as a stereotypical
liberal,'' said Charles Cook Jr., editor of The Cook Political
Report, a nonpartisan journal.
</P>
<P>
   Cook pointed to Schumer's support for the death penalty, which
he opposed earlier in his career. ``This is something that would be
absolutely unacceptable for any good liberal,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The unquestioned constants through Schumer's career have been
his formidable intelligence and, perhaps even more so, his
determination to prevail. That extraordinary drive has not always
won him the affection of colleagues, some of whom dislike Schumer
for what they and their staff members describe as an egomania and
crass self-promotion that stand out even on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is far from the most popular legislator there. But even
those peers who find his intensity off-putting respect what he has
accomplished and agree that it has been pivotal in his success as a
legislator and politician.
</P>
<P>
   He may not have followed the precise course his parents hoped
for, but he stayed true to the size of their ambitions for him.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1986 book, his sister, Fran Schumer, a journalist, wrote:
``Ever since he was 8, my older brother has wanted to recreate in
the world his position in our family _ president of the Schumers,
favorite son of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His first bid for higher office, to be president of our junior
high school, failed,'' she continued. ``But he beefed up his act so
it would never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   When a young Schumer discussed his decision to run for elective
office, he characterized politics less as a calling than as a
career choice, a profession that he felt would suit his
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Finding such a fit was vitally important to him, because he and
his siblings had watched their father, the owner of a small
exterminating company, toil six days a week at a job that gave him
security but no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the tragedies that other people had in their
lives, it was nothing,'' Schumer acknowledged. ``But it had a real
impact on me. My father was such a decent man and he had this huge
albatross around his neck, which was the business. ''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer family, Jewish and solidly middle class, lived on a
street where all of the houses looked pretty much alike. Charles
Ellis Schumer, born on Nov. 23, 1950, was the oldest of three
children, followed by Fran and then a younger brother, Robert.
Selma Schumer stayed home to raise the children and went to work as
a teacher only after they grew older.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer excelled from the start. He reliably aced tests,
graduated first in his class at James Madison High School and won
admission to Harvard, which he began in the fall of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time of heated political activity, the apogee of
protests over the Vietnam War and racial discrimination, and
Schumer was quickly swept up in that heady moment. He joined the
Young Democrats Club, rising to its presidency in his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   Several classmates recalled that it was trendier to belong to
the Students for a Democratic Society, a radical group. But they
said Schumer was never one to storm barricades or occupy buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, they said, he was suspicious of such righteousness,
pragmatic and committed to working within the system, not trying to
overthrow it. He was also a bit of a square, rooted firmly in
Flatbush and holding tightly and proudly to its accent and a frumpy
manner that sometimes drew ribbing from peers.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Kellermann, who met him at Harvard, worked in his
Congressional office and remains one of his closest friends, said
she could not remember him even wearing jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he did not smoke marijuana either. ``It was
illegal,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   As his fascination with politics grew, he chose social studies
as a major, wrote his senior thesis on ways that Congress could
function more efficiently and sought internships with legislators
and political groups. He was falling into a career without fully
realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   He said politics promised to indulge his interest in solving
problems and helping people, his affinity for debate and his desire
to educate. Friends said it promised to indulge something else as
well: Schumer's yen for attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He very much thrives on approval from the outside world,'' Ms.
Kellermann said. ``He likes being noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   In both his bid to enter the Assembly and the niche he carved
for himself there, Schumer cast himself as a reform Democrat, eager
to restore integrity to government and make it more responsive to
people's needs.
</P>
<P>
   He also displayed the signature traits that colleagues attribute
to him to this day: a conspicuous assertiveness, an obvious
conviction in his own abilities and a skill for seizing issues in a
manner that got his name in the newspapers and face on television.
</P>
<P>
   Older Assemblymen like Mel Miller and Stanley Fink, who each
subsequently served as Assembly speakers, did not know quite what
to make of him. ``He was a snot-nose,'' Miller remembered.
``Stanley said to me, `We got to get rid of this snotty kid.'''
</P>
<P>
   But gradually, they revised that opinion of Schumer. ``When you
got past the somewhat pushiness and the somewhat arrogance,''
Miller said, ``there was talent there and a willingness to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly office was a veritable mill of exhaustively researched
reports on subjects ranging from the slow response time of
ambulances in New York City to the high prices that asphalt
contractors charged the city. Simultaneously, he forged an identity
as an ardent defender of civil liberties and ally of tenants
bucking what they saw as the tyranny of landlords.
</P>
<P>
   While Schumer's energy usually served his purposes, it at times
threatened to undermine them. After his election to the U.S. House
of Representatives in 1980, he became the target of federal and
local investigations into accusations that he had improperly used
his Assembly staff to work on his congressional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some former congressional staff members said the investigations,
which were ultimately dropped, were fueled in part by the
resentments of exhausted employees whom Schumer had pushed to the
brink. They described Schumer as a sometimes overbearing boss with
an untempered desire to get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer acknowledged that he was eager to make his mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress was a revelation to me,'' he said. ``Huge areas of
endeavor had no experts. I said, `I'm going to become the expert in
housing, in banking.' And there were no real experts in Congress.''
In a subsequent interview, Schumer recalled his thrill at becoming
``the expert, in the whole United States Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And knowledge,'' he said, ``was power.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer had run for Congress in part on a pledge to bring more
federal dollars back home, and as a young congressman, he was often
a champion of better programs and more consideration for poor and
middle-class people in his district.
</P>
<P>
   Among his earliest accomplishments was helping to fight off a
Senate attempt to cut housing subsidies to cities with rent control
and helping to write a housing rehabilitation bill that promoted
home ownership in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But colleagues said that in Congress, as in college, Schumer
never truly embraced the left. And there were striking examples of
moderation in his record from the 1980s, like his key support for a
bill that toughened restrictions against illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the 1990s, however, as the Republican revolution
brewed, President Clinton emerged as a new-style Democrat, and
Schumer eyed statewide office, that his more moderate streak truly
came to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the alteration of Schumer's persona was a
function of emphasis as much as philosophical conversion. Across a
wide spectrum of issues, he was still among the House's more
liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   He consistently drew the same high ratings that he had in the
1980s from such liberal advocacy groups as the Americans for
Democratic Action, and he consistently drew the same low ratings
from conservative groups that promoted tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   He voted against both the balanced-budget amendment and the 1996
bill that restricted welfare benefits. His record on women's rights
and abortion rights, which had always been strong, remained so.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But there were certain crusades _ most notably, crime prevention
_ that placed him closer to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's growing attention to crime was logical, given his
assignment from 1991 to 1995 as the chairman of the House's crime
subcommittee. But he used that position to adopt a number of
tough-on-crime stances not typically associated with liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he was heeding the frustrations of voters in his
district. ``I felt the anger and the anguish of my constituents _
beautiful, hard-working people,'' he said. ``Their car would be
stolen, their home would be burglarized, someone would be mugged. I
said, `Let's try to stop the crime problem.' It was one of my goals
from the day I got to Congress, but I didn't have enough seniority
until I became head of the crime committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping 1994 crime bill that Schumer helped write expanded
the applicability of the death penalty to scores of federal crimes,
provided billions of dollars for new prison construction and put
tens of thousands of additional police officers on the nation's
streets. But it also stressed prevention, funneling money to
programs like drug counseling for inmates.
</P>
<P>
   He fought for the inclusion of a ban on the sale of assault
weapons in the crime bill and also spearheaded passage of the Brady
Bill, which required a waiting period for the purchase of a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   There were additional positions that cast Schumer in a moderate
light. He supported the line-item veto and voted in favor of a bill
to ban the recognition of marriages between homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in interviews, he took to berating the Democratic
Party for losing touch with ordinary Americans and to describing
himself as an ``angry centrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts said he was restyling himself for
purely political purposes, a charge fueled by his demonstrated
fondness for self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues and their staff members even coined a phrase for
what they said was Schumer's habit of trumping or pre-empting
colleagues' efforts: to Schume.
</P>
<P>
   But many of them declined to discuss their true feelings about
Schumer for attribution, noting that he could soon be in a position
to make them regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Other colleagues countered that Schumer was the object of envy,
an assessment with which he seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of my little plights in life,'' he said. ``People
have always been, you know, jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may not be that simple.
</P>
<P>
   For a while in 1995, he and former Representative Susan
Molinari, a Republican from Staten Island, shared a recurring spot
on a New York City newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Molinari recalled that during one program, when she was
about to tell viewers that she was expecting a baby, Schumer
interrupted, handing her a baby gift and congratulating her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was announcing being pregnant,'' Ms. Molinari said, ``and
Chuck stole the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Schumer's profile has grown dramatically over the last
two decades, his demeanor has changed little. He still carries
Flatbush in his voice and his parents' unpretentious, thrifty ways
in his life style.
</P>
<P>
   He presents a fascinating dichotomy, at once striving to move
beyond his origins and staying comfortably tethered to them.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, when he was younger, Schumer flirted with glamour,
going out with women who were richer and blonder than the ones with
whom he had grown up. In the late 1970s, he briefly dated the
gossip reporter Claudia Cohen, who had a widely publicized romance
with D'Amato just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer settled down in 1980 with Iris Weinshall, a
cabdriver's daughter who was also raised in Brooklyn. She works as
a deputy commissioner in the New York City Department of Citywide
Administrative Services, and the couple live with their two
daughters, Alison, 9, and Jessica, 14, in a 10th-floor,
three-bedroom apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that they bought
in 1983 for just $157,000.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is content to slurp down a bowl of cold cereal for
dinner and has been known to wear the same suit day after day. Mrs.
Schumer said he constantly forgets to make appointments to get his
hair cut.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, before she intervened, he would sometimes
grab a pair of ordinary scissors and trim the misbehaving tufts
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, I see him looking in the mirror and bemoaning not
being able to get a haircut,'' Mrs. Schumer said. ``And I say,
`Don't even think about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer admitted that it was somewhat out of character when
several years ago he got a modest hair transplant to fill denuded
patches toward the front of his scalp.
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on abhorring ostentation, and his living
arrangement in Washington, a city he deliberately flees every
weekend to rejoin his family, reflects that.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress is in session, he shares a small town house on
Capitol Hill with three other lawmakers, with his rent of $500 a
month buying him a fraternity-style atmosphere and no privacy at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Miller, D-Cal., and Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.,
each sleep in one of the two upstairs bedrooms; Schumer shares the
downstairs living room with Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's roommates say he is almost always the last one to
leave his office and return to the town house at night; he is
sometimes the first one up in the morning as well. There are always
new tasks to tackle, new missions to launch, and Schumer never does
anything halfway.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Weiner, a New York City councilman who once worked on
Schumer's congressional staff, remembered how the softball games
between ``Schumer's Boomers'' and the staffs of other members of
Congress would grind to a temporary halt whenever Schumer dropped
by.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd always have to suspend the game,'' Weiner said, ``because
he would want to bat over and over again until he got a great
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Grounding out was patently unacceptable. Sometimes even a single
would not suffice. Schumer would remain standing over home plate,
swinging and swinging for something big.

MURDERED DOCTOR REMEMBERED AS CONSCIENTIOUS AND COURAGEOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ABORT-DOC-REACT, ABORT-DOC-SHOOTING) 
(js) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, N.Y. _ Some of those whom knew him said Dr. Barnett
Slepian continued to perform abortions in the face of death threats
because he had what one friend called ``a stubborn kind of
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said he persisted because he was simply a conscientious
doctor and made his decisions not on ideological grounds but
because he wanted to practice the full range of gynecological
medicine just as he had been trained to do, even if that included
the procedures that many in the aggressive anti-abortion movement
in western New York equated with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having babies come into the world was his life,'' said Ellen
Fink, a longtime friend. ``But he performed abortions because he
believed it was a women's legal right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, a 52-year-old gynecologist and obstetrician who lived
in this suburb of Buffalo, was shot fatally in the back Friday
night as he stood in the kitchen of his home chatting with his
wife, Lynne, and his 15-year-old son, Andrew. He had just returned
from synagogue where he had gone to mark the yahrzeit _ or
anniversary _ of his father's death with the Jewish prayer, the
kaddish.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, his friends, patients and relatives were heartsick at
his murder, but also fearful of what they could say because the
sniper who lay in wait in the woods behind Slepian's house and shot
him with a high-powered rifle through an undraped window is at
large. Still, a few took time to talk to reporters because, they
said, they wanted to make sure the man they knew was portrayed not
as a narrow pro-abortion zealot but as a well-rounded doctor,
father and husband.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, who as a young man was so determined to become a doctor
that he studied medicine in Spanish in Guadalajara, Mexico, when
U.S. schools would not accept him, was a person who prized his time
with his four sons, Andrew, 15, Brian 13, Michael, 10 and Philip,
7. He capered with them in their backyard swimming pool or taught
them the value of work and money by having them mow the lawn in
summer and shovel the driveway in winter. He was a devoted jogger,
having run a marathon, and was what one friend said was ``a health
nut'' who was meticulous about his family's health and carefully
watched such demons as cholesterol and salt. He belonged to a
Reform synagogue, Temple Beth Am.
</P>
<P>
   He was painfully aware that he and his family could be the
target of a fierce opponent of abortions and took precautions.
There had been four attacks against doctors on both side of the
U.S.-Canadian border. As recently as Friday morning, Slepian
received a two-page warning from the downtown Buffalo clinic where
he worked urging him to beware of sniper attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not assume that you are safe once you are at home,'' the
warning said. ``Close the drapes in your house so you are not
visible from outside.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Slepian often kept the blinds drawn at home and he
called the police whenever he received a death threat. Neighbors
said there were a number of periods when an Amherst patrol car was
stationed outside Slepian's two-story brick colonial in a
well-to-do enclave here.
</P>
<P>
   But he refused to change his approach to medicine, even when his
friends warned him some anti-abortion protesters would view his
death as a ``coup'' that virtually eliminated access to abortion in
the Buffalo area.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew the risks well,'' said Glenn Edward Murray, who was
Slepian's lawyer and longtime friend. ``We had discussed the fatal
dangers he placed himself in by continuing to perform abortions. We
discussed security measures. He was dedicated to providing women
with safe and legal abortions and was unwilling to abandon his
clients because of threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who talked in carefully measured tones but still found
himself choked with emotion, said Slepian had as a young intern and
resident in the Buffalo area been taught by mentors how dangerous
and sometimes fatal ``back alley'' abortions performed by bad
practitioners or by the women themselves could be. Even as he had
four children of his own, he was determined that he would perform
abortions for women who needed them, no matter how poor they were.
</P>
<P>
   So in addition to a private practice he had in this leafy
suburban town in the prairie-flat countryside east of Buffalo,
Slepian chose to work regularly at a clinic in downtown Buffalo
that had been singled out by protesters and was the last of its
kind in Buffalo: Buffalo GYN Women's Services. Now, that clinic has
been left without a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a stubborn kind of courage,'' Murray said. ``He was
resolved not to let the threat eliminate the legal and medical
options for patients.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His wife, Lynne, a trained nurse who stayed home in recent years
to raise their sons, was as resolute as he was in not letting the
protesters stop her husband from practicing medicine as he saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, a slender, wiry man with the bearded face of a scholar,
was born in Cambridge, Mass., into a lower-middle class family of
four children, each of whom went on to considerable accomplishment
as an adult. One of his two brothers, Jacob, is also a doctor,
specializing in ear, nose and throat medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, whom friends called Bart, was raised in Rochester,
attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado and
received his medical degree from the Autonomous University of
Guadalajara. A residency at the State University of Buffalo brought
him to this area 20 years ago, and he stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Although gynecologists will quietly perform abortions for their
longtime paying patients, Slepian became one of only a handful of
doctors in western New York who were willing to perform abortions
at public clinics and not hide the fact that they did. Nonetheless,
his friends said, he counseled women seeking abortion to consider
alternatives like adoption. In 1988, protesters taunted him outside
his home on Hanukkah. When he emerged carrying a baseball bat, a
clash ensued and Slepian was eventually charged with a misdemeanor
for damaging a protester's vehicle. In 1992 he again became a
target in a coordinated protest by 200 picketers from the
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue that was known as ``Spring of
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, patients who visited him at the downtown clinic
or his private office in Amherst periodically endured shouts from
picketers of ``You're murdering your babies.'' A longtime patient
who asked that she be identified only as Karen said that Slepian
frequently apologized for the disruptions the protesters were
causing. Still, Karen said she knew him mainly as a devoted
gynecologist who saw her through infertility treatments and
delivered her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't supposed to be there for the delivery but he came
anyway and when I asked him, `What are you doing here,' he said:
``I wouldn't miss it for the world.'' Similarly, she said, he went
out of his way to visit another patient when she was in the
hospital for a non-gynecological ailment. ``I thought I'd come over
to have donuts and coffee with you when I heard you were in the
hospital,'' Karen heard that he told the friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the type of man,'' Karen said, ``that I would put my
life in his hands and not question what he had to say. And I can't
say that about all doctors.''

COMMENTARY: NOW THE HARD PART 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Years ago, the joke was told of the Jewish
matchmaker who had the idea of matching up poor Sammy _ a nebbish
and a schlumpeh _ with Princess Margaret, then the world's most
eligible woman.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy's mother would not hear of it. The princess could not cook
and was not Jewish. After weeks of persuasion, with the matchmaker
showing how the alliance with British royalty would help Israel,
the mother gave her grudging approval. The matchmaker heaved a sigh
of relief and said: ``Now for the hard part.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Aspen Institute's Wye Conference Center last week,
matchmaker Bill Clinton helped Palestinians and Israelis move to
the final stage of their negotiations. Now comes borders,
statehood, security, water, capital city _ the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   Who gained what at Wye?
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis came away with enforcement of reciprocity. Because
trust does not exist, CIA monitors will adjudge Chairman Arafat's
treatment of terror. If the revolving door on jails does not stop
spinning, Palestinians will rightly be blamed for the resulting
freeze of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant, the salami-slice turnover of land is
virtually ended. That means a substantial chunk of the West Bank
remains as an incentive to Palestinians to reach final settlement.
Without that deal-closer of more territory, the argument would be
solely over dividing Jerusalem, on which peace hopes would founder.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Netanyahu, perhaps with Foreign Minister Sharon's
knuckle in his back, blundered by introducing Jonathan Pollard, an
American who spied on America for Israel 13 years ago, into the
bilateral negotiations. Now they are trilateral; Clinton has been
handed a card to play.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard betrayed his country at the behest of foolhardy spooks
in Israel who were unconcerned about poisoning Israeli-American
relations and besmirching all Jewish Americans with charges of
``dual loyalty.'' The reckless Israelis ignoring that risk were
more culpable than the traitor in Washington, but were never
properly punished by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard has a claim of injustice. He bargained a confession of
guilt for a prosecutor's assurance of no life sentence, thereby
saving the United States from ``graymail'' at trial. Then an
infuriated Caspar Weinberger prevailed on the sentencing judge to
double-cross the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu has transformed the prisoner into a bargaining
chip. At a coming crucial moment, Clinton will push that chip
forward, and Sharon may have to buy Pollard's freedom by uprooting
a couple of West Bank settlements.
</P>
<P>
   How did Arafat fare at Wye? He got his 13 percent slice and his
security control of a previous slice, concessions both tangible and
substantial. He gets several hundred prisoners returned from
Israeli jails; at the same time, he resisted sending 30 terrorists
to Israel for trial by promising to try them himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to sell yet again a vow to change the Palestinian
charter's vows to destroy Israel, and to inveigle the U.S.
president into a statehood-advancing visit in December to bear
witness to the doing of what Arafat long insisted was already done.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat did not get off the hook on fighting terror. If he
flinches from his duty under this agreement, the CIA is supposed to
blow the whistle and stop the process cold. That discipline will be
annoying to Arafat; we'll soon see how effective the new American
Foreign Legion can be.
</P>
<P>
   How did Bill Clinton fare? Nobody can doubt that this meeting
was delayed to give him a pre-Election Day boost, but an October
surprise has long been a presidential perk.
</P>
<P>
   Credit him for working hard, long and forcefully to achieve a
modest but difficult transition. As John Harris reported in The
Washington Post, Clinton's proven talent for rhetorical ambiguity
and slippery tenses came in handy in diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   I was about to give Clinton a medium salute, but then he had to
preach to black ministers that the negotiation had been part of
``my personal journey of atonement.'' This one was for Monica? That
self-absorbed confusion of his need for political forgiveness with
the nation's need for an effective chief executive was smarmy and
solipsistic. As JFK would say, ``no class.''
</P>
<P>
   We are into the final stage, as Netanyahu urged. Now comes the
hard part: If they run a municipal corridor to Ramallah, and call
it North Jerusalem ....
</P>

ELECTION OF RIVALS IN BRAZIL HURTS CARDOSO REFORM PLANS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Rivals of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso won important victories in gubernatorial races Sunday,
handing the recently re-elected president a complex landscape for
pushing through long-delayed government and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In Sao Paulo, however, Brazil's most populous and wealthiest
state, Mario Covas appeared likely to win re-election as governor,
defeating former Sao Paulo mayor Paulo Maluf.
</P>
<P>
   Although Maluf's party forms part of the president's governing
coalition, Cardoso had endorsed Covas. Maluf is known as a big
spender with presidential ambitions of his own. His victory could
have complicated Cardoso's efforts to control state spending and
win congressional approval for reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite considerable foreign pressure on Brazil to demonstrate
how it will restructure government to reduce deficits, Cardoso has
put off publicly announcing his plans, fearing they could damage
the chances of his allies in the elections. The delay costs Brazil
heavily; each day, the country loses hundreds of billions of
dollars in foreign reserves, and the longer the country maintains
interest rates over 40 percent, the deeper its recession and debt.
</P>
<P>
   With Brazil's solvency seen as crucial to maintaining economic
stability of Latin America and protecting the United States from
recession, the United States and the International Monetary Fund
are preparing to chip in toward an aid package of at least $30
billion to shore up Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso won re-election on the first round of national voting
earlier this month, but partial results showed left-of-center
candidates leading in some of the most developed states of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pedro Piva, of the president's Brazilian Social Democracy
Party, called Sunday's elections ``a warning sign for the
government,'' adding, ``I think we're going to have difficulties
ahead to approve this package.''
</P>
<P>
   The governors are important both because they control a
considerable share of the national budget and act as natural
leaders of their parties in Congress. States will be called upon to
cut their budgets by as much as 20 to 30 percent, which will mean
laying off civil servants. Current laws allow the states to fire
workers if the payroll exceeds 60 percent of the state budget;
under a new law the administration is proposing, layoffs would
become mandatory once that ceiling was reached.
</P>
<P>
   In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, a former mayor of the city
of Campos who belongs to the leftist Democratic Workers Party, was
leading over Cesar Maia, a former Rio mayor belonging to a
conservative grouping.
</P>
<P>
   In Rio Grande do Sul in the south, Olivio Dutra of the Workers'
Party was also leading over the incumbent, Antonio Britto, a
Cardoso ally.
</P>
<P>
   In Minas Gerais, former President Itamar Franco was leading by a
wide margin over the incumbent Eduardo Azeredo, also of Cardoso's
centrist Brazilian Social Democracy Party. Franco's party belongs
to the governing coalition, but Franco has been critical of
Cardoso's economic policies and personally stung by the president's
re-election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1993, during Franco's presidency, he named Cardoso finance
minister and launched the economic plan that would make Cardoso a
national hero to a people weary of hyperinflation. But Franco was
deeply humiliated at his party's convention earlier this year, when
he sought to run for president against Cardoso. He was not only
turned down, but laughed at.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Sen. Maguito Vilela, of Franco's Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party, said backing for Cardoso's reforms would
not be automatic. The party would not support tax increases, he
said, noting that one tax slated for increase, on financial
transfers, was initially approved as a temporary measure to finance
hospitals, but ended up going to offset the deficit. ``It just
burdened people and didn't do anything to improve health care,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Brazilian television precisely which measures his party
would endorse, Vilela said, ``If it means more sacrifice for the
people,'' his party ``will not support it.''

VOTE IN SPAIN'S SEPARATIST BASQUE REGION UNLIKELY TO JEOPARDIZE
CEASE-FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By AL GOODMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILBAO, Spain _ Moderates came out ahead of separatists Sunday
in regional elections in the northern Basque region that were
closely watched for their impact on peace prospects after the
Basque guerrilla group ETA began a cease-fire last month.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right Basque Nationalist Party, which has led the
regional Parliament for 18 years, won 28 percent of the vote total
and 21 seats out of 75, but fell short of a majority, as it has in
the past. It is likely to make a governing pact with a Madrid-based
national party that wants to keep the prosperous northern Basque
region firmly within Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The Basque Parliament remained fragmented among seven parties.
But the leftist independence coalition Euskal Heritarrok, or Basque
Citizens, considered to be the political wing of ETA, capitalized
on the cease-fire and won 18 percent, the third-largest total.
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid, the governing conservatives and the opposition
Socialists sought to pose the campaign as a choice between risky
Basque self-determination and the secure path of Spain's 1978
Constitution, which has permitted home rule. The Basque region has
had its own Parliament since 1980, and also has taxing power and a
6,000-member regional police force
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Diez, a Socialist leader, said election results showed the
Basques ``don't want adventures but a stable framework.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the competing parties tried to present itself as the
best guarantor of a permanent peace in the three-province Basque
region. The opening of the acclaimed Bilbao Guggenheim Museum there
last year has become a symbol of the region's economic and cultural
resurgence that might be cemented with a permanent end to
separatist violence.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, whose initials in the Basque language stand for Basque
Homeland and Liberty, announced its first ``indefinite'' cease-fire
in a September 16 communique. It cited ``unique opportunities'' for
peace after 30 years of guerrilla attacks that have been blamed for
800 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders in Madrid say the rebels were pressured by
arrests of their commandos and by street demonstrations demanding
peace, while they also drew inspiration from the recent peace
accord in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the results of the Basque vote were not likely to
jeopardize the fledgling peace initiative, a masked man identified
as an ETA spokesman said, in a British Broadcasting Corporation
television interview on Saturday that the unilateral cease-fire was
``firm and serious.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the conservative prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, has vowed
not to negotiate with ETA until it permanently renounces violence
and lays downs its arms _ steps the rebels have not taken.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar's Popular Party was the other big winner in the Basque
elections, with the second-highest number of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Euskal Heritarrok, which has not formally condemned ETA's
violence, was widely considered an unlikely partner in the new
Basque government despite its third-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   The group is the successor to Herri Batasuna, or Popular Unity,
which changed its name before the campaign, apparently fearing it
might be declared illegal. Last December, the Supreme Court
sentenced the entire 23-member leadership of Herri Batasuna to
seven years in jail for collaborating with the ETA.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Aznar blasted a statement by the ETA spokesman in
the BBC broadcast that the rebels would not apologize for the
separatist violence, calling it an ``insult to the memory of the
victims of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The masked spokesman had said that, ``It is the Spanish state
which should be asking for forgiveness, for denying our people
self-expression and the right to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-week campaign in the Basque region, home to 2.1 million
people who comprise just 5 percent of Spain's population, ended on
a harsh note with the Basque Nationalist Party's president
contending that the two big Madrid-based parties had tried to
strike fear in the voters in its campaigning.

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ After the hoopla in the United States, a guarded
shrug from much of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in this region is so elusive _ or so perilous _ as
peace. And that perhaps explains why the Wye Plantation agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians has evoked such resounding
reticence among Arab leaders _ who played an umpire's role at most
or were left on distant sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Running through the Arab response _ whether among the Islamic
radicals who burned Israeli flags in Gaza or among less vocal and
more moderate figures backing Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader
_ was a common stream of mistrust in the intentions of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and doubt about American
motives.
</P>
<P>
   Only King Hussein of Jordan, summoned from cancer treatment to
the negotiations in Maryland, and visibly sapped by chemotherapy,
attached his personal prestige to the interim accord that emerged
from nine tortuous days of negotiations. His eyes, some Arab
commentators said, were as much on history's judgment of his role
as a peacemaker as on anything else.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the leader of the
Arab world's most populous state, struck a far more cautious note.
``Let us wait and see,'' he said. ``There have been so many
agreements that were never enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People and officials cannot help being cautious,'' said
Mohammed al-Sayed Said, a senior researcher at Cairo's Al Ahram
Center for Political and Strategic Studies. ``There is long history
and heritage of Israeli manipulation and nonimplementation of any
of the previous agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder who trusts Netanyahu in the Arab world. How many
agreements were signed by him while he evaded implementation? So
why not this one also?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Mohammed Sid Ahmed, a respected commentator here,
President Clinton ``is the main winner in this agreement'' as he
struggles for domestic political advantage in advance of next
month's elections in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the Arab world at large and the
Palestinians has always been a complex one, riven by the competing
ambitions of Arab leaders to pursue divergent goals through
Palestinian surrogates. Even recently, Syrian-backed Palestinian
movements bitterly criticized Arafat's peace maneuvers, reflecting
President Hafez Assad's own fruitless quest for the return of the
Golan Heights from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, though, since the political cartography of the Arab
world was redrawn by Iraq's defeat in the Persian Gulf war and the
subsequent, American-led drive for a broader peace, the ability of
the Arab states to mold the direct relationship between Israelis
and Palestinians has been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, has reduced Arafat's ability to seek a regional
consensus. While Egypt and Jordan may, for differing reasons, help
promote his cause, other Arab states pursue other agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to give support to Arafat?'' said Dr. Said of the
Al Ahram center. ``Syria, with its known principle of pursuing
unilateral actions, or Iraq or Sudan or Algeria or Libya _ who want
to shoot Arafat in the head?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, to guard his back, Arafat embarked Sunday on a Middle
East tour that evoked memories of his earlier Lear-Jet diplomacy,
as an insurgent leader, through Arab capitals _ traveling from
Egypt to Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye accord, offering the Palestinians more land in return
for greater guarantees of security for Israel, has played into the
instinctive caution of a region where peace with Israel has brought
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's peace with Israel remains frigid. King Hussein has paid
for Jordan's peace with Israel in the coinage of domestic
discontent among a population that is predominantly Palestinian. In
the annals of Middle Eastern peace diplomacy, two statesmen _
Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Yitzhak Rabin _ have paid for
peace with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, no one gets too hopeful here _ especially not about
interim deals that not only do not settle Palestinian-Israeli
disputes but also do not address Israel's other unfinished business
with its neighbors Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road is still long for for a comprehensive peace,'' said
Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister. ``This necessarily
requires an Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights and
from southern Lebanon as well as declaring a Palestinian state and
achieving security for all parties.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Egypt itself, driven by a desire for prestige as the Arab
world's heavyweight and with the American aid dollars to support
it, has displayed the same ambivalence as other countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The government-owned Al Ahram newspaper, thus, reported at
length on President Mubarak's telephone conversations with both
Arafat and Clinton as the Wye agreement was being finalized. But,
said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, it did
not seek a high-profile role because it did not want to be too
closely associated with an agreement that might yet unravel.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the agreement has introduced one novel element
into the public visage of Middle Eastern diplomacy _ the Central
Intelligence Agency. The agency is to referee the security
relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, ensuring that the
Palestinians live up to commitments to stamp out terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, the CIA was widely depicted by Palestinians as
a sinister player in an American-backed Zionist conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   With the new security deal, said Walid Kazziha , a professor of
political science at the American University of Cairo, Arafat has
``shouldered a great responsibility as Israel's policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Dr. Said, the CIA's involvement might now work in the
Palestinians' favor, ``putting an end to Israel's demands on
security.''

NBC TO NAME NEW PRESIDENT FOR ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ NBC plans to name a new president for its
entertainment division Monday, setting up a transition that will
eventually put all the network's entertainment operations under the
executive, Scott Sassa, senior NBC officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Sassa will replace Warren Littlefield, who, with
20 years at NBC, is one of the longest-serving program executives
in the history of television, despite being only 46 years old.
Littlefield has been a central figure in developing and scheduling
some of the most popular TV shows of the past decade, including
``Seinfeld,'' ``Cheers'' and ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior NBC executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the network had decided to move Sassa, who is 39 years old,
from his current job as president of NBC's station division, to set
up a transition period during which Sassa could work under NBC's
top entertainment executive, Don Ohlmeyer, before taking over for
Ohlmeyer when he decides to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer's contract expires at the end of 2000 and he has told
friends he is likely to leave his present job at that time to go
back to producing shows. One senior NBC executive said Sunday that
Littlefield had not been seen as a suitable successor to Ohlmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., concluded a deal with
Littlefield Sunday to create a joint-venture production company
that he will head. Littlefield's contract as president of
entertainment had extended through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Sunday, Littlefield called the
arrangement with NBC for a production company ``a gold-standard
deal,'' adding, ``I feel really sensational about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield said he had begun to think about leaving his
position last Christmas when Jerry Seinfeld told him he would be
quitting his show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when Jerry said he realized it was time to move on to
the next phase of his life, I started to think seriously about my
own choice,'' Littlefield said. ``When it became clear that Don was
not going to go beyond his contract, and as it became clear that
Scott would be a player for the network, I also got very
comfortable with the idea that it's time for me to move on to
chapter two of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   No other executive affected by the decision responded to
requests for comment Sunday. But one senior executive said
Ohlmeyer, who had been an Emmy-Award winning producer of sports and
entertainment shows before joining NBC, ``wants to get back to
making shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior NBC executive, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said, ``This is about getting an orderly transition in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive noted that Sassa had been brought to NBC last year
after running the entire entertainment operation for Turner
Broadcasting. He said that, in essence, Sassa had been temporarily
parked in his job overseeing NBC's stations to await an opening in
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   With NBC's top management concluding that Littlefield would not
succeed Ohlmeyer, the executive added, ``it was logical to turn to
Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa will assume Littlefield's post Monday, the senior
executives said. Littlefield said he would help with the transition
any way he could, but emphasized that he was eager to begin work on
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield leaves with a legacy as a main architect of NBC's
thick catalog of programming hits in the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s he was the chief program executive under Brandon
Tartikoff, who then led NBC's entertainment division. During that
time, Littlefield helped develop many of the network's biggest
hits, including ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Hill Street Blues,''
``Cheers,'' ``The Golden Girls'' and ``St. Elsewhere.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After Tartikoff left NBC in 1991, Littlefield was named
president of entertainment and ran the division. But NBC's hit
shows were aging, and the network entered a period of steep
decline. During that time NBC did add hits like ``Seinfeld'' and
``Mad About You,'' though both took years to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   NBC realigned the management of its entertainment division in
February 1993, bringing in Ohlmeyer to supervise all entertainment
operations as president of NBC West Coast. Littlefield retained his
title of president, but reported to Ohlmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Ohlmeyer-Littlefield team, NBC soon reasserted total
control of prime time, beating its rival networks by record
margins. Within two years, NBC added a group of hits _ ``Frasier,''
``Friends'' and ``E.R.'' _ that helped push NBC to record profits
exceeding $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield was also involved in another pivotal decision for
NBC. At the end of Johnny Carson's 30-year reign as host of the
``Tonight'' show, NBC was torn between two successors, Jay Leno and
David Letterman. Littlefield pushed hard for Leno and he got the
job. Letterman left for CBS where his new show initially topped
Leno's. But after two years, NBC's prime-time comeback was matched
by Leno's ascendancy to late-night leadership; his show is now the
network's most profitable entertainment program.

TAKING HIS OWN PATH TO RANKS OF MARATHON'S ELITE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.Y., Minn., Colo., Fla., Pa., N.C.)   (jw) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The morning of the 1997 New York City Marathon, Jerod Neas
jumped in a car with his parents in Princeton, N.J., drove to
Staten Island and hopped out at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge for a
26.2-mile commute through the city's five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 9 inches and 130 pounds, Neas could not muscle his way
up toward the elite runners on the bridge. It seemed as if he were
fighting to get on a crowded subway train. So he started 15 or 20
rows back and found himself sprinting to cover the first mile in 5
minutes 40 seconds. After two miles, he was already fading into the
rearview mirror of the lead pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running as fast as I could,'' the 27-year-old Neas
recalled. ``It's a tough thing to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   The best he could hope for was to find someone else running the
same pace and willing to work together. Neas kept at it, and
between Miles 23 and 24, when the race entered the hills of Central
Park, he passed the favored American, Mark Coogan, who had been an
Olympian a year earlier in Atlanta but was now drained and fading.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the finish line in 2 hours 19 minutes 7 seconds, Neas
finished 15th over all and first among the Americans. But there are
few things as obscure as being first among the Americans in an
international marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Neas finished nearly 11 minutes behind the winner, John Kagwe of
Kenya. He was so little known that there was even confusion about
his nationality. Was he American or French? By the time reporters
caught up to him, Neas had already returned home to Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field wasn't packed with Americans,'' Neas said. ``I was
more pleased with where I finished than being the first American.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he will return for a fourth shot at New York, hoping
to lower his time and raise his place in the standing. Neas knows
he cannot win, but he hopes that incremental improvement now might
lead to a breakthrough later. He is following a solitary,
unorthodox plan toward making the United States team for the 2000
Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Even among American runners, Neas remains in the shadows, a
virtual unknown. He ranks in the second half of the second tier of
American marathoners, with a personal best of 2:16:20. That is 10
minutes off the world record of 2:06:05 held by Ronaldo da Costa of
Brazil and nearly eight minutes short of the American record of
2:08:47 set by Bob Kempainen.
</P>
<P>
   Neas largely avoids the road-racing circuit, has no coach and
does no track work. He is committed to marathons, six or seven a
year, when most elite runners compete in only two. In 1996, Neas
ran nine marathons because he needed the prize money to make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 4, he ran the Twin Cities Marathon in Minneapolis (he
finished sixth). New York will follow four weeks later. If he is
going to put in all this mileage, about 120 miles a week, if he is
going to run this hard and this fast, he figures it might as well
be in a race.
</P>
<P>
   But this kind of racing regimen is likely to leave him watching
the Olympics on television instead of in person. So Neas plans to
reduce his races next year as he aims toward the Olympic trials in
2000. Eight months ago, a vitamin company began endorsing him,
picking up his expenses. And for a year now, he has lived in the
Denver suburbs, training in the mile-high altitude, hoping to
increase his oxygen-carrying capacity. His wife, Julie, a
controller for a building company, has moved to the Rockies with
him, willing to make adjustments in her career for his.
</P>
<P>
   His Olympic chances are remote but not impossible. American
marathoning is in a deep funk. Kempainen has retired to become a
doctor, and his successors, Coogan, Keith Brantly and Jerry Lawson,
have not converted potential into achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 10 guys have a legitimate shot if they can bring down
their times and run more consistently,'' Neas said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Neas will receive no special treatment, except a
chance to start nearer the front and a shot to win $5,000 as the
first local runner. The race offers $100,000 to an American winner,
double the prize money, but officials are reluctant to pay
appearance fees for what has become repeated failure. An American
man has not won in New York since Alberto Salazar in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome Americans, but we're not going to pay someone
$10,000 in appearance money to run 2:20,'' said Allan Steinfeld,
the race director.
</P>
<P>
   Neas said he understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've earned very much respect,'' Neas said.
``It's got to be earned.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He began running as a high school junior, when his family moved
to Princeton from Clearwater, Fla. He ran in college at Penn and
then at North Carolina, where Neas received a degree in 1994. After
school, he bunked at home, lived race to race, getting by on meager
prize money and determined to live the lonely life of the
long-distance runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love getting out in nature and running,'' Neas said.
``If you don't do well, you don't have anyone to blame but
yourself. It has nothing to do with luck. Usually, the best runner
wins. What makes it great is that it's so difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he ran his first marathon, in Atlantic City. He had
planned to run a half-marathon, but prize money was offered only
for first place, and Kagwe was entered in the shorter race, so Neas
decided he had better run a full marathon. He did, and won in 2:19.
Four weeks later, he entered New York, emboldened with victory, but
he hit the wall at Mile 15 and struggled home in 2:27.
</P>
<P>
   ``That taught me never to be cocky going into a marathon,'' Neas
said.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Kiele, an investment banker, and his father, Harold,
a certified public accountant, have run marathons, inspired by his
own running. But his mother, Donna, said she thought the idea was
crazy and feared that her son would ``fall into a shamble of
bones'' by the age of 32.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he runs, chasing an Olympic dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is an opportunity to run with the best in the world,
to compare where you really are,'' Neas said. ``It's like an
Olympic race. Everyone who is anyone runs New York eventually. It
brings me back to reality, keeps me honest.'' &QL;

OUTDOORS: ONCE AGAIN TO COLE POND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Mass., Vt.)  (mk) 
 By NELSON BRYANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENFIELD, N.H. _ Rarely, over a period of more than 40 years,
have I enjoyed brilliant success when fishing for Cole Pond's brook
trout, but I keep trying.
</P>
<P>
   Each fall, the tug of Cole Pond becomes almost irresistible.
Atop a forested hill at an elevation of 1,376 feet, this 17-acre
body of water, more than 50 feet deep in the middle, is surrounded
by the reds and yellows of maples, birch and beech in October, and
often during the hike up to it, one hears the throbbing wings of
departing ruffed grouse. The only man-made structure on the pond
shore is the fireplace of a cabin that burned down decades ago. A
now-deceased friend of mine, Vic Pomiecko of Claremont, N.H., and I
occasionally waited out storms in that cabin, and for many seasons
we stashed a raft _ made of nylon cord and saplings _ in the woods
on the east side of the pond, lashing inner tubes beneath it for
flotation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Cole Pond's shoreline does not permit fly-fishing, there
being no room for a back cast. It does, however, offer a few
locations for the land-based fly rod devotee, and if one is willing
to pack waders there is a cove with a hard, sandy bottom just east
of where the trail reaches the pond. From the mouth of that cove, a
wading angler can cover a 30-yard stretch with a long line.
Nonetheless, those truly serious about catching trout would do well
to bring an inflatable raft or a float tube.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many anglers, I favor waters I know and quarry I
encountered in my New England boyhood. New England has been my home
for more than seven decades. I revel in the familiar and at the
same time am bedeviled by it. On the island of Martha's Vineyard,
where I have spent most of my life, the lanes and roads, beaches,
salt ponds and marshes are redolent with memories, some pleasant,
some searing. And so it is with the hills, streams, ponds and lakes
of New Hampshire where for nearly 20 years I sought economic
sustenance as a journalist and fled to the woods for spiritual
nourishment, renewing acquaintances with mountainside homesteads
abandoned a century before, stone walls wandering through the
woods, once-prized apple trees thrusting up through stands of
encroaching conifers or a never-failing spring emerging from the
base of a granite ledge.
</P>
<P>
   When my companion Ruth Kirchmeier and I visited Cole Pond early
this October, I observed that the moderately stiff mile-long uphill
hike had taken 45 minutes, 15 minutes more than it did 40 years ago
when I was a lad of 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fret, you made it yet another time,'' she replied, and
set forth for a walk about the pond to see if the high-bush
blueberries she had found up there at the same time last year were
available. They were not. There would be no Cole Pond blueberry pie
when we got home.
</P>
<P>
   Three other fishermen, all young, visited the pond in the two
days we were there. The first had no waders or boots. He stood on
the shore skillfully directing his back cast into a narrow opening
behind him and had taken one trout about a foot long before we
arrived. The second angler arrived with an inflated float tube
strapped to his pack, which contained a pair of waders. On the
second day, the third arrived, waders in his pack and a float tube
in a satchel, accompanied by a golden retriever. All three listened
politely to a gray-bearded old man puffing on a pipe intent on
telling what he had learned about a pond he had fished before they
were born.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Cole Pond was reclaimed; existing populations of
suckers, chain pickerel, sunfish and horned pout were removed and
brook trout were introduced. Since that time, it has been managed
for trout. Over the years it has yielded quite a few brook trout of
more than 2 pounds and at least one of about 5 pounds has been
taken from it. Only fly-fishing is allowed on Cole Pond. As of this
year, all trout between 12 and 16 inches had to be released and
only two fish could be kept daily, both less than 12 inches or one
less than 12 and one more than 16. The intent of this so-called
slot limit is to provide a quality fishery for large trout. The
fishing season on Cole Pond closed Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth filled her sketch pad and poked about the pond while I
fished, finding an otter slide, where the scat was laden with
indigestible bits of crayfish, a species stocked in the pond in
1954. Last year when Ruth and I were there, I had been startled by
three otters rising from the water less than 50 feet in front of
me.
</P>
<P>
   This year, I caught only one trout each day, both a little less
than a foot long, although once, late on the first day, a trout of
2 pounds or more made a pass at my Muddler Minnow as I was lifting
it from the water. A bit more action would have been pleasing, but
I was not dissatisfied, even though I consider myself reasonably
adept at the esoteric art of still-water fly-fishing for trout.
</P>
<P>
   We had, after all, begun our fall sojourn at the century-old
Meccawe Trout Club in Reading, Vt., as guests of John Houlihan, a
Claremont, N.H., dentist. There, using advice given to me by the
club's caretaker, John Paiva, I had caught 11 brook trout in one
day on the club's 10-acre man-made pond, keeping four that Ruth and
I savored while seated before the blazing fireplace in the
cavernous lodge where the interior adornments include a tattered
fishing hat worn by President Calvin Coolidge, who was, I was told,
a frequent club guest. The mainstay of another evening meal was
four woodcock given to us by Houlihan, who had gone bird hunting
that morning.
</P>
<P>
   We took the brace of Cole Pond trout back to the Vineyard, drank
a toast to the pond and to my departed buddy Vic, then enjoyed the
fish with an almond-butter sauce, brown rice, a salad made from our
cold frame lettuce and a pie made with apples plucked from an
abandoned homestead tree.

   AMHERST, N.Y. _ With no arrests reported in Friday night's
slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, the three doctors who publicly
acknowledge performing abortions in the Buffalo area remained in
seclusion Sunday as residents of this quiet Buffalo suburb reeled
from the news that a sniper could still be in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials from federal, state and local agencies
who met with Canadian investigators here Sunday would not comment
on their inquiry into the death of Slepian, the gynecologist and
obstetrician who was killed by a sniper as he sat in his kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights advocates said clinics in the area that perform
abortions had been promised stepped-up security by law enforcement
officials and would operate normally this week.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a spokeswoman for the FBI or federal and local police
officials would specify the security measures that would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Finnelly, the lawyer representing Buffalo GYN
Womenservices, an abortion clinic where Slepian frequently worked,
said that another physician who wished to remain anonymous had
treated patients who had been scheduled to see Slepian on Saturday.
Other abortion advocates said that since the slaying local
physicians had expressed their willingness to carry out abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Womenservices is determined to keep this going,'' Ms. Finnelly
said. ``That's what Bart would have wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents here who denounced the shooting refused to give
their names out of fear that Slepian's killer could strike again.
There was an obvious sense of concern over the sniper attack in
this picturesque suburb of 150,000, which was declared the
statistically safest city in America in a 1997 survey by Money
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that someone could come in and do something like this
is shocking,'' said Nick DiPirro, a retired high school
administrator. ``Things like this don't happen here.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Since the deadly bombing of two American embassies in Africa in
August, there has been a troubling accumulation of evidence that
the State Department inexplicably ignored warnings of possible
terrorist attacks against the installations.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and most disturbing account suggests that nine months
before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department received a
detailed description of the planned attack but did little to
strengthen security at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of negligence demands examination by the Clinton
administration and Congress. Shortly after the bombing, the
department acknowledged that the American ambassador in Kenya,
Prudence Bushnell, had earlier recommended that the embassy be
moved to a safer location. Her advice was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Raymond Bonner and James Risen of The New York Times
reported that an Egyptian now believed to have been directly
involved in the bombings outlined the Kenya plot to American
intelligence officials last November.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account was so specific _ he said
terrorists were planning to detonate a truck bomb in the embassy's
underground garage _ that it called for more than a temporary
increase in security. Unhappily, it was discounted, even thought to
be a ruse to lure the embassy into new security measures that
terrorists could monitor and defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of this is hard to fathom, and harder still to explain
to relatives of the Americans and Kenyans killed in an attack
nearly identical to the plan Ahmed described.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombings, the department has been quick to close
embassies temporarily if attacks seem imminent. It would be
interesting to know if the intelligence behind those decisions was
any more credible than Ahmed's warning.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the State Department is happy with the department's
handling of security matters, but the tendency to blame limited
funding and bureaucratic inertia is disheartening. Of course,
additional money would have made it possible to harden defenses at
more embassies, and Congress has now added to the security budget.
But more decisive leadership in the department could have assured
preventive steps were taken in East Africa.

</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26:
</P>
<P>
   The murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian is the latest depraved assault
on the small number of courageous physicians who still risk their
safety to perform legal abortions in this country. Slepian was one
of only three doctors who performed abortions in the Buffalo, N.Y.,
area, and harassment and threats against him by anti-abortion
groups had become routine over the past decade. He persevered
through courage and a belief in the right of his patients to choose
whether to bear a child.
</P>
<P>
   But a principled commitment to provide a constitutionally
protected service could not stop the assassin's bullet that tore
through his kitchen window and into his back Friday night. His
death shows again how tentative the right to abortion has become in
the face of terrorism by anti-choice fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   Their repeated acts of terrorism must be met with the severest
possible crackdown by law-enforcement authorities. If an armed
police officer has to be stationed outside every abortion
provider's home and office, 24 hours a day, let it be done. This is
an assault not only on individual doctors but on the rights and
liberties of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the FBI joined Canadian authorities to investigate a
series of unsolved sniper shootings of doctors in Canada and
western New York dating to 1994. In January, a week after the 25th
anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision, a clinic
bombing in Birmingham, Ala., killed a security guard and severely
wounded a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, three doctors, including Slepian, three clinic
employees and a clinic escort have been murdered. There have been
more than a dozen attempted murders of abortion providers in the
last five years. Arson and bombings at clinics have become so
common that many no longer make the national news.
</P>
<P>
   It is bad enough that conservatives in Congress and in state
legislatures are working to dismantle reproductive rights by
banning certain procedures, such as so-called partial birth
abortion, and by requiring waiting periods and parental consent
before an abortion can be obtained. But those restrictions are at
least imposed by the normal give and take of political and judicial
struggle in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   What is outrageous is the attempt to shut down abortions by
illegal means _ by shooting the doctors or bombing the clinics or
harassing the women seeking to exercise their constitutional right.
Some anti-abortion groups, to their credit, have denounced the
bombings and shootings, but others seem reluctant to issue the
strong condemnations that are warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one particularly virulent anti-abortion Web site lists
the names of doctors it says perform abortions, or ``crimes against
humanity,'' with a code indicating whether they are ``working,''
``wounded'' or a ``fatality.'' Such incendiary rhetoric, and
frequent accusations by some anti-abortionists that abortion
providers are committing murder, can only fuel more terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The increase of anti-choice laws and ongoing campaigns of
harassment by protest groups, even short of murder, have worked to
make abortions harder to obtain. More than 80 percent of counties
in this country have no abortion provider. In 45 states, the number
of doctors who performed abortions declined between 1982 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian was among those who took a stand against restricting
reproductive freedom and paid with his life. Unless these brave
doctors are better protected, fewer doctors in the next generation
will be willing to place themselves and their families in such
danger. That is what the terrorists want. They must not be allowed
to succeed.

HOW TO FILE A LAWSUIT FOR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:  I have some friends who have been employed as assembly workers
for an electronics company for the past five years. The owner
recently hired a department manager who happens to be Chinese.
Since then, this manager has hired only Chinese workers and has
placed help-wanted ads only in Chinese-language newspapers. Asked
why he does this, he answered that he ``likes the Chinese newspaper
better.'' What can my friends do about this obvious discrimination?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Employers are allowed to hire people from a single racial
or national group if there's a good business reason for it _ for
instance, hiring French waiters for a French restaurant. But this
sounds like a pretty clear violation of state and federal civil
rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Your friends should warn the company owner that the firm is
facing a serious legal and financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   If it lost a discrimination lawsuit, the firm could end up
paying for back wages, emotional distress and punitive damages _
along with a hefty legal bill for defending itself in court.
</P>
<P>
   Such complaints usually are filed by someone who directly has
been injured by discrimination _ someone who has been unfairly
denied a job or promotion. But if the bias is blatant enough, your
friends also might be able to file a complaint even before they've
suffered a personal injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, someone has to have been denied an opportunity,''
said Brad Seligman, a civil rights lawyer who teaches at Hastings
School of Law. ``But there are also federal cases that say people
are entitled to a workplace that is free of discrimination, so they
might file a complaint over that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of defending against one of these cases can be quite
substantial,'' Seligman said. ``The owner may not be aware of the
legal risk.''
</P>
<P>
   If the owner won't listen, your friends could file a
discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission at (800) 669-4000 or the California
Department of Fair Employment and Housing at (800) 884-1684.
</P>
<P>
   Some other options? If your friends want to keep a low profile,
they could ask an outside organization like a union or community
group to file a discrimination complaint. Employees or outsiders
also could file an unfair-business-practice suit under Section
17200 of the California Business &AMP; Professions Code. Or they could
file a complaint with the local human rights commission, if your
city government has one.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the options with an experienced civil rights lawyer:
You can get a referral from the National Employment Lawyers
Association at (415) 227-4655.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; My company is looking for a new chief financial officer,
but we don't want to use a headhunter. Where can we find suitable
candidates? We're an $8 million consulting firm with 50 employees
that helps companies predict future trends and do strategic
planning.
</P>
<P>
   A: Do-it-yourself may be fine when it comes to building a deck
on your house or refinishing your floors. But when trying to fill a
high-level job like CFO, you'll probably do a lot better by working
with a good headhunter or placement agency.
</P>
<P>
   Finding and hiring a top executive takes both time and skill.
Does someone on your staff have the savvy to see where applicants
are puffing up their resumes? Or to assess whether someone with
experience as a controller could make the transition to being your
CFO? Does someone have the time to weed through hundreds of
resumes? Or to spend hours tracking down candidates who may not be
actively looking for work right now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most small companies don't really know how to hire a CFO,''
said Dan Maisler, president of a San Francisco placement firm
called Accountants 4 Contract. ``By trying not to use a placement
firm, they may end up hiring a pig in a poke.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you're set on the do-it-yourself approach, here are
some ideas that go beyond help-wanted ads:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask your firm's accountants, insurance brokers and attorneys
for names of possible CFOs. Also, call up CFOs at other companies:
They may not want to change jobs but may know people who do. ``The
more people you get the word out to, the better,'' advised Marcelle
Bolding, an Oakland human resources consultant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Circulate your job listing with professional associations such
as the Financial Executives Institute, the Institute of Management
Accountants, or the California Society of CPAs.
</P>
<P>
   _ For a fee, you can post your opening on finance-oriented Web
sites such as the Financial Job Network at www.fjn.com or CFO
Magazine at www.cfonet.com. You could also try general career sites
such as MonsterBoard at www.monster.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider hiring a temporary CFO while you conduct your search.
An interim CFO could help you define exactly what you want from a
candidate _ and might work out well enough to stay on permanently.
Some Bay Area firms that specialize in providing temporary finance
executives are Accountants 4 Contract, CFOs 2 Go and Robert Half
International.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I recently quit a job working for a consulting firm. I
asked them for a release letter stating my period of employment,
but they are not responding to the request. Are they required to
provide such a letter to me? If not, what can I do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Most companies have no legal obligation to provide
references about former employees. And nowadays many employers have
stopped giving out meaningful information about workers'
performance, out of fear of libel lawsuits if they say anything
negative.
</P>
<P>
   However, most companies still DO provide basic information such
as job title and dates of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Put your request for a confirmation-of-employment letter in
writing. Include a stamped, self-addressed envelope. If your former
manager won't respond, try the human resources department.
</P>
<P>
   Also check whether the firm is willing to respond to queries
from prospective employers. If so, you probably don't even need a
release letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not want to give this information directly to the
employee, but they might give it to a prospective employer who
called them for a reference,'' said Sheila Weisblatt, a career
counselor with Momentum Career Consulting in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   What if the company really won't confirm that you worked there?
</P>
<P>
   Line up some other references who know your work _ colleagues,
clients or previous bosses. And if a prospective employer needs
written confirmation that you held this job, you can always turn in
a photocopy of your W-2 tax form or a paycheck stub.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: There is one small group of California employers who DO
have a legal obligation to provide at least some reference
information, according to Roseville attorney David Hurd, author of
``The California Employee Survival Handbook.'' Section 1055 of the
state labor code says public utilities such as electric companies
must provide a letter with dates of employment and a job
description for former employees.
</P>
<P>
   Send your work and career questions to Ilana DeBare, Workways,
San Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco 94103. Or
send e-mail to workways &LR; sfgate.com. Or call (415) 764-2815. We
can't respond to each query, but we will answer as many in print as
we can.

</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Here are our endorsements for some of the more competitive races
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7th District &LR;  (parts of Union, Somerset, Middlesex and Essex
counties): Choosing between Rep. Bob Franks and his Democratic
challenger, Maryanne Connelly, is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, a three-term Republican, is generally regarded as a
moderate in a party caucus that is woefully short of moderation. As
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Railroads, he is in a key
position for the mass-transit-dependent metropolitan area. But Ms.
Connelly, the mayor of Fanwood and a retired AT&AMP;T executive, is
firmer in her support for civil liberties and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Franks is the better choice. He is among the
relatively small group of moderate Republicans who have come
together at key moments to restrain the House leadership's worst
instincts and make progress toward campaign-finance reform. Franks,
after a shaky start, was a sturdy supporter of the Shays-Meehan
campaign-finance reform bill.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a strong voice for the region's troubled port and
aggressive in defending the older industrial areas of the Midwest
and Northeast against the growing influence of the South and West.
Despite our differences with Franks, he gets our endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8th District &LR;  (Passaic and Essex counties): Rep. Bill Pascrell
Jr., a Democrat, and Matt Kirnan, the young Republican lawyer
challenging him, are surprisingly close on the issues, and
unpredictable in their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Kirnan says he would have voted for the stronger Democratic
version of the patients' rights bill. Pascrell joined Republicans
to approve a ban on needle exchanges to combat AIDS in Washington.
Both men say they are generally pro-choice but support a ban on
so-called partial birth abortion. Both express particular concern
for the troubled cities in their district.
</P>
<P>
   Pascrell has the glad-handing demeanor of a veteran politician
and Kirnan, who is mayor of Verona, nevertheless has the wide-eyed
openness of a newcomer. Both are appealing candidates, but by a
narrow margin our endorsement goes to Pascrell due to his superior
experience and our concern about Kirnan's constitutionally dubious
support for vouchers for parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9th District &LR;  (parts of Bergen and Hudson counties): Rep.
Steven Rothman, a Democrat, describes this race as a fight between
``a moderate fiscal conservative and an ultra-right, extreme
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothman, who sometimes seems to weigh the political advantages
of his words too carefully, may be a bit more liberal than his
description suggests. But he is not far from the mark about his
opponent, Steve Lonegan.
</P>
<P>
   Lonegan, the mayor of Bogota, has a compelling personal story.
Legally blind due to a degenerative eye disease, he struggled to
get an education and find a job. He not only prospered as a
salesman, but was able to develop his own thriving business.
Unfortunately, Lonegan's success in overcoming his handicap on his
own seems to have turned him against government programs. We admire
Lonegan's success story, but we endorse Rothman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 12th District &LR;  (Hunterdon County and parts of Mercer,
Middlesex, Somerset and Monmouth counties): The Democratic
challenger, Rush Holt, is perhaps most famous for his radio ads,
which feature a recording of the incumbent, Michael Pappas, singing
a tribute to Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But Holt deserves support for more than his skill at
attention-grabbing advertising. The son of a U.S. senator, he made
his own career as a scientist. He has worked on nuclear weapons
proliferation for the State Department, on environmental protection
in New York City and most recently as assistant director of the
Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Although he has never held
public office, Holt has had an extensive career in community
service, particularly in the areas of environment and education.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas, a freshman Republican, has a record that is far more
conservative than the district he represents. He was one of only
two New Jersey representatives to vote against the bipartisan
Shays-Meehan campaign-finance reform bill. Holt gets our
endorsement.

COMMENTARY: MARTIN'S RUNNING MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR THE JETS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ More than anyone else, Vinny Testaverde
has an up-close-and-personal appreciation of Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could sit back where I am and watch him cut and see the
hole,'' the Jets' quarterback was saying with a smile. ``I've never
seen a back like him.''
</P>
<P>
   In their history, the Jets have had only two running backs like
him, Freeman McNeil and Emerson Boozer.
</P>
<P>
   And as good as McNeil and Boozer were, Martin will have a chance
in Kansas City next Sunday to do something neither ever did _ rush
for 100 yards in five consecutive games. After rambling for 144
against Indianapolis, 108 against Miami and 107 against New
England, he had 101 in Sunday's 28-3 thumping of the Atlanta
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 101, his teammates and 71,573 spectators at Giants
Stadium will remember 8 particular yards.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jets pinned at their own 6-yard line late in the second
quarter, Martin took a pitch from Testaverde and moved to his
right. When no hole opened, he tap-danced to his left, sidestepped
Falcon tacklers and slithered to the 15-yard line. Barry Sanders
couldn't have done it any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed my block, so my guy had Curtis dead to rights,''
center Kevin Mawae said later, ``but he made 8 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   For the season, Martin has now rushed for 576 yards in his six
games, a 96-yard per game average. He has also caught 20 passes for
192 yards, including 3 for 35 yards Sunday. That adds up to an
average of 128 yards of total offense over his six games.
</P>
<P>
   In the only game he missed, with a damaged thigh, the Jets were
awful in a 30-10 loss in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers attest to why Coach Bill Parcells was willing to
surrender first-round and third-round draft choices to the Patriots
to sign the 25-year-old Martin to a potential six-year, $36-million
contract as a restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' Parcells has often said, ``Curtis
is my first-round draft choice this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots took two running backs with those choices, Robert
Edwards and Tony Carter, but the Jets possess a premier running
back who had already rushed for 3,799 yards in three seasons, two
of them when Parcells was the Patriots' coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtis has great vision, toughness, speed when he has to have
it, he can catch the ball out of the backfield,'' said Keith Byars,
the Jets fullback who was Martin's teammate in New England. ``He
can do anything you ask him to.''
</P>
<P>
   And do it with energy and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtis wants to please, he cares about what I think and what
Mo Carthon thinks,'' Parcells said, referring to the Jets' running
backs coach. ``He's got a big heart, he responds to competition.
He'll die on the sword for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Martin arrived, Parcells has rated the importance of
100-yard rushing games to winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a back rush for 100 yards,'' the coach has said,
``you're going to win 70 percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's ratio has been 100 percent _ his four 100-yard games
have translated to four Jets victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to become a little family now,'' Martin said,
alluding to the offensive linemen who create the holes he scoots
through. ``Just because the play's going to the right, you can
never let your man go because I might be coming back that way.''
</P>
<P>
   His offensive linemen, however, are usually too busy blocking to
see Martin's runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I look forward to seeing the films on Monday,''
guard Todd Burger said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the Jets are 4-3, and they were fortunate to play the
Falcons, now 5-2, when 44-year-old Steve DeBerg was Atlanta's
quarterback. They blitzed DeBerg dizzy. It wouldn't have been that
easy if Chris Chandler had been playing.
</P>
<P>
   But that's life in the National Football League. Take advantage
of a break when you get one.
</P>
<P>
   With three straight victories at Giants Stadium after a loss to
Baltimore in the home opener, nobody is moaning about how the Jets,
who train on Long Island, must play in another state in a stadium
named for another team.
</P>
<P>
   In learning they can win in Giants Stadium, the Jets should be
able to throw that crutch away.
</P>

Monday night's game with the Steelers, are one of the American

INVESTORS RESURRECTING BIOTIME, THE FREDDY KRUEGER OF STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
BioTime is the Freddy Krueger of scary stocks. It keeps coming
back.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again, shares of the Berkeley biotechnology concern have
risen from near-death despite a lack of solid fundamentals
supporting their rebound. This time, investors may be buying
BioTime because they believe that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration is going to approve its flagship product, Hextend,
earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if that were true _ and bears on the stock contend
that it's implausible _ BioTime's Hextend has rather bleak
prospects if and when it finally comes to market.
</P>
<P>
   Hextend is a blood-volume expander, a water-and-starch solution
that is designed to keep a patient's blood pressure at adequate
levels during surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, despite management claims to the contrary, Hextend
isn't likely to be much different than similar products already on
the market, says Manuel Asensio, president of Asensio &AMP; Co., a New
York securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   So what you have is a nominal pharmaceutical product with little
particular advantage over existing offerings in a minuscule $30
million market that happens to be shrinking, Asensio says.
</P>
<P>
   Bark. Bark. BioTime is Fido incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   But for some silly reason, individual investors (no
institutional fund worth its salt would get near this puppy) have
bid up BioTime shares to $10.63, from a 52-week low of $5.50 on
July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Asensio speculates that most of the bulls are individual
investors who are getting poor advice from questionable advisers
and brokers. Of course, Asensio is an unabashed short-seller,
meaning that he borrows stock on the bet that shares will fall.
Then, he buys the shares back at a lower price, pocketing the
difference. He currently has a strong sell recommendation on
BioTime.
</P>
<P>
   Asensio is what some folks call a ``fundamental short.'' He
doesn't pick on solid companies that fall on hard times. Instead,
he focuses on companies where the fundamentals simply don't add up
to the stock price or market projections.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, unlike many short-sellers or hedge fund managers
with short positions, Asensio doesn't request anonymity from the
press and relies on extensive independent research. He's not flying
below the radar, and he has been bearish on BioTime for quite some
time.
</P>
<P>
   But now he's concerned that investors are being falsely led by
the company to think that Hextend will receive a ``priority
review'' from the FDA within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for management to state that it believes
(Hextend) is receiving a priority review,'' Asensio says.
</P>
<P>
   A priority review is the most expeditious form of product
approval by the FDA, which usually is granted only to the most
critically important new drugs. (Remember, Hextend is not some
anti-cancer wonder drug. It's starch water.)
</P>
<P>
   However, such a review would allow BioTime to bring its products
to market sooner; therefore, it theoretically would have a shot at
earning profits in the near future. In general, biotech stocks rise
when their products get approved by the FDA, and few observers
doubt that Hextend will fail to pass muster with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Asensio argues that the company is deliberately using the
promise of a priority review to spur buying in the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no factual basis for (their) claim. If Hextend had
qualified for a priority review, BioTime would already undoubtedly
know,'' Asensio says.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the logic: BioTime says it submitted its new-drug
application for Hextend on March 31. Under FDA guidelines, the
agency would have had to notify BioTime of a preliminary review
within six months of the filing, Asensio says.
</P>
<P>
   That means BioTime management would have been told by September
30. If management has been notified and has failed to announce such
a favorable ruling by the FDA, it would be withholding material
information, he adds. Besides, why would management keep such
positive news a secret? BioTime officials were unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In short (pun intended), Asensio contends that Hextend isn't on
any kind of fast track for approval. Typically, without
preliminary-review status, it takes the FDA about 12 to 18 months
to review new-drug applications. That means BioTime shouldn't
expect a decision from the FDA before this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprising to me that they could bring this stock back,''
Asensio says.
</P>
<P>

FUND MANAGERS' TACTIC ANGERING SOME SHAREHOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Most investors get into aggressive growth funds because they're
looking for big long-term returns from the stock market _ and
they're willing to take the risk.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But what happens when the fund managers get cold feet?
</P>
<P>
   This debate took on a new urgency during the stock market's 19
percent plunge this summer. A lot of these market wizards panicked
and moved big chunks of assets out of stocks and into cash.
</P>
<P>
   That left investors who thought they'd bought a Ferrari tooling
along in a Model-T Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Whether fund managers or investors themselves should make
market-timing decisions is an age-old question.
</P>
<P>
   Certain funds _ known as balanced funds or asset-allocation
funds _ use bonds and cash to dampen volatility as part of their
standard strategy.
</P>
<P>
   With aggressive-growth funds, however, the strategy typically is
to remain fully invested in fast-moving stocks. They usually hold
just 2 or 3 percent of their assets in cash, and that's only to
meet shareholder redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But a significant minority of fund managers fancy themselves
market timers _ switching between stocks, bonds and cash when the
mood strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar, the Chicago fund-tracking service, found that 30
aggressive-growth funds _ out of a universe of 149 _ held at least
10 percent of their assets in cash at the end of their latest
reporting periods.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most shocking example, the manager of the
Brandywine fund, a high-flying aggressive-growth fund, sold the
bulk of his stocks in December _ missing out on a big market rally.
He didn't get fully reinvested until May _ just in time for the
market's summer swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Most financial experts agree that managers of aggressive-growth
funds shouldn't try to time the market. For one thing, they say,
nobody can do it with consistent success.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investors buy shares in these funds because they
want to profit from the stock market's tendency to shoot up over
the long term.
</P>
<P>
   If the shareholders decide that they want part of their stock
assets switched to cash or bonds, so the argument goes, they can do
it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue is that the individual investor is the person in
the best position to determine what kind of risk they want to
take,'' says Jeff Molitor, director of portfolio review with the
Vanguard mutual-fund group.
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``If a fund describes itself as taking on a certain
type of character and risk, it is the obligation of the fund
company to deliver that character and risk, not change it.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what a fund says in its marketing materials, though,
none of them lock themselves into an inflexible investment
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The only way a shareholder can find out what the fund actually
owns is to wait for the semiannual reports, which disclose
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders are happy to let their fund managers make
market-timing decisions and even expect them to.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who invest in mutual funds are saying, in
effect, `I want to delegate all the decisions to a professional. I
am not really in a very good position to make these decisions
myself.' '' said Steve Lipper, senior vice president of Lipper
Analytical Services, the New York fund-tracking service.
</P>
<P>
   One investor who feels that way is Phil Taylor of San Carlos,
who owns shares in several Fidelity funds. He says he asked his
broker _ also Fidelity _ whether the fund managers took any
``defensive actions'' when the market was tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was disappointed to learn that his Fidelity funds hadn't
gone defensive. They had remained fully invested in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not try to time the market,'' Fidelity spokeswoman
Jessica Johnson said. ``One of our fundamental principles is that
taking a long-term view is much more effective. We simply
concentrate on the stocks with the best fundamental prospects for
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why some managers might be tempted to time the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Any fund manager who had converted stocks to cash at the peak in
mid-July, then bought stocks again after the Dow Jones industrial
average bottomed out 19 percent lower at the end of August, would
have been hailed as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, money managers seldom _ if ever _ time the market
that precisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illusory. You just can't time the market,'' says Russ
Kinnel, an equity fund analyst with Morningstar Inc. ``If you try,
you risk missing out on big market rallies.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandywine manager Foster Friess learned that the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   He was hit with a double whammy _ selling near a market bottom
and getting back in near a peak.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Brandywine Fund and the Brandywine Blue Chip
Fund each has lost about 18 percent of its value since the end of
December, compared with a gain of more than 11 percent in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   Friess, who responded via e-mail, didn't seem particularly fazed
by the episode. ``We feel it is important to stay fully invested
except for those special times when strict adherence to our
disciplines, which have been time-tested for over 30 years, dictate
we allow cash levels to rise rather than stretch our criteria to
buy stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Friess also is one of six managers of the $385 million Masters
Fund sponsored by the Litman/Gregory money-management firm in
Larkspur. Friess wanted to liquidate the bulk of his portion of
that portfolio in December, but that didn't sit well with partners
Craig Litman and Ken Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him our preference was to have the fund fully
invested, but we wanted him to have flexibility,'' Litman says.
When Friess persisted, Litman/Gregory compromised and gave him
permission to convert up to 40 percent of the assets he managed for
the Masters fund into cash.
</P>
<P>
   Litman wouldn't say what impact Friess' maneuvers had on the
performance of the Masters Fund, which is down 0.9 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Brouwer, of the Brouwer &AMP; Janachowski money-management firm
in Tiburon, says that until this year, he bought shares in the
Brandywine funds for his clients _ but no longer. ``When they went
to cash, we sold. We weren't happy with that move.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's Strong Discovery Fund had better luck with
market-timing this year, says co-manager Chip Paquelet.
</P>
<P>
   It converted nearly 30 percent of its assets to cash during the
horrendous market drop during August _ ``to get out of the way of
the freight train.'' But it started reinvesting early this month
and now has about 10 percent of its assets in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were underexposed to stocks in August, which was a very big
down month,'' he says. ``We remained underexposed in September,
which was a slightly up month. On balance, being in cash helped
us.''

JOHN G. GUDE, 96, AGENT FOR JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John G. Gude, an agent who represented many prominent figures in
broadcasting and publishing, died on Oct. 11 at Martha's Vineyard
Hospital in Massachusetts after a fall at Long Hill Nursing Home in
Edgartown, Mass. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Gude's clients included Edward R. Murrow, Walter
Cronkite, William Shirer, Andy Rooney, Fred Friendly, Elmer Davis
and James Thurber.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Montclair, N.J., Gude was a graduate of Brown
University. He joined the CBS News department in the 1930s, writing
publicity releases and editing news broadcasts. Shortly thereafter,
with Thomas Stix, he formed the Stix &AMP; Gude agency, which
represented radio news personalities, including Murrow, during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Gude brought Murrow and Friendly together for the
production of ``I Can Hear It Now,'' a recording of historic events
conceived by Friendly and narrated by Murrow. The success of the
recording led to a radio series and then to the ``See It Now''
television program, which ran on CBS from 1952 to 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Gude's wife, Helen, died in September at 94. He is survived by
two sons, Jonathan and David; a daughter, Elizabeth, of Chilmark,
Mass.; and three grandchildren.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To mix and match 20th-century ballet classics with
newer works is always a risk, but the San Francisco Ballet met the
challenge at the start of the weekend. The contemporary
choreography included a gem, while the company's touchstone
neo-classicism was displayed in two masterpieces: ``Agon'' (1957)
by George Balanchine and ``The Cage'' (1951) by Jerome Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   Both works confirmed that the company has a new star in Lucia
Lacarra, a 22-year-old dancer from Spain whose impeccable classical
schooling does not detract from her dramatic intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbins and Balanchine ballets were strikingly danced at
City Center, but so were the season's first performances of
``Valses Poeticos,'' a jewel of a romantic duet by Helgi Tomasson,
the San Francisco Ballet's artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Joanna Berman, a homegrown product of the
company, demonstrated easily that her early potential has been
fulfilled. A brilliant classical stylist, she brought her vitality
and precision to the choreography's expressive shapes. Her cavalier
was Cyril Pierre, a new French recruit whose masculine presence and
excellent partnering also set off a beautiful performance by Sabina
Allemann, who brought an ecstatic, mature tone to the woman's role
on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the epitome of the Balanchine-Stravinsky ``leotard'' ballets,
``Agon'' is an outright experiment in density of movement and
complex structure. The four men who open and close the work
occasionally stretch into arabesque on their heels in a canon that
parallels that of the music. But they are required to end the piece
after the final beat, not on it.
</P>
<P>
   The work's pas de deux is formal, a startling exercise in
convoluted partnering. But it can also become a close-up of
male-female relationships. On Friday, Muriel Maffre and Benjamin
Pierce were more compelling than at Tuesday's gala, where they
performed the duet as an excerpt. The mechanics of the choreography
were less evident, replaced by Miss Maffre's cool serenity and the
naturalness with which she used her high leg extensions to describe
Balanchine's flattened and angular shapes. Pierce admirably
negotiated the tricky partnering with the same sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maffre exudes a statuesque glamour in the role, and she and
Pierce excitingly carved their way through space. Ms. Lacarra and
Stephen Legate were sharper on Saturday. Their dancing was smaller
in scale but Legate has an imposing intensity, and Ms. Lacarra is
like a string that ties and unties itself into the loops of
Balanchine's choreography, so flexible are her own high leg
extensions and the flow of her sensuous style.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the colloquial accents of the man's solo in the first
trio were captured by Christopher Stowell; and on Saturday,
Guennadi Nedviguine needed only to look less stern. Katita Waldo
had class in the castanet solo. Parrish Maynard (who has been
outstanding all season) and Damian Smith made evident the
epigrammatic wit of the male duet on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On the same program, Ms. Lacarra repeated her wiry and
electrifying portrayal as the man-eating Novice in the insect world
of ``The Cage.'' Small and highly supple, she adds a new resiliency
to the choreography; Sara Sessions was the new and aptly aggressive
Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Like Robbins, Tomasson extends the art of partnering in ``Valses
Poeticos,'' set to several piano waltzes by Granados, played
beautifully onstage by Michael McGraw. Ms. Berman, sharp and
articulate, can surprise with the suddenness of a swoon, leg
extended, in her partner's embrace. Ms. Allemann will give you the
more soulful version. There is not a wrong note in Tomasson's
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Ivonice Satie's ``Shogun'' still looks like a sketch but it was
more interesting than before. David Palmer and Stowell, in a cast
change, gave the competing samurai onstage extra power and speed on
Saturday. Tomasson's new ``Criss-Cross'' on Friday had Ms. Waldo,
in a local debut, and Maynard leading the shimmering first section;
Yuan Yuan Tan and Vadim Solomakha smoothly led the less striking
second half.

FAN HAS BEEN A FIXTURE AT YALE BOWL FOR 84 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Princeton's Palmer Stadium is gone, having been replaced by a
new jewel. The Yale Bowl, which along with Palmer Stadium opened in
1914, still stands in New Haven, Conn. In its press box on Saturday
sat Al Ostermann, who was overseeing the operation of the
electronic scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping score, Ostermann has seen every Yale game
there except one.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned that Palmer Stadium had worn out, Ostermann said
he mused to himself, ``Gee, I must be getting old.'' He turned 92
last Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Ostermann lives in nearby Woodbridge, Conn., with his wife of 60
years, Eleanor. Neither boasts about his attendance record, which
totals 522 games after Yale's 37-14 victory over Columbia on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   What about the one game he missed? ``Yale was playing what they
called a breather in those days, an easy opponent,'' he said of the
game in 1930. ``It was Alfred. There was a big game scheduled to be
played in New York at Yankee Stadium between Army and Illinois. So
I went there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostermann has no regrets. Yale won, 66-0, and the Cadets nipped
the Illini, 13-0.
</P>
<P>
   For the first game in the bowl, against Harvard on Nov. 21,
1914, Ostermann sneaked into the stadium early and hid under a
bench until the kickoff. ``I was frozen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His friend and contemporary at Hillhouse High School was Albie
Booth, who became a spectacular running back and kicker for Yale
from 1929 to 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Booth was 5 feet 6 and 140 pounds, as was Ostermann. ``I wasn't
much of an athlete. I wanted to go to Yale too, but I didn't have
the Latin and the Greek, which you had to have back then to get
in,'' Ostermann said. ``Albie went to Milford Prep for a year and
then he got in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostermann went to Florida to seek his fortune but soon returned
and eventually spent 36 years working for the telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the late 1920s, Ostermann became a fixture around
the football program, performing small duties such as helping to
operate the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Ostermann says he has always been a football junkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger it was nothing for me to go to three to
four games a weekend,'' he said. ``High school on Friday, or maybe
Saturday night, Yale on Saturday, the Giants in New York on
Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   Yale football has changed a great deal since the days of Albie
Booth. On Saturday, Ostermann looked out upon rows and rows of
empty benches. The Yale Bowl's capacity is 64,269, down from 70,500
four years ago. The stadium was last filled in 1981 for the Harvard
game. Saturday's attendance was 14,537.
</P>
<P>
   Ostermann blames television. ``I could have watched a dozen
games between noon and midnight today, if I'd stayed home,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stayed home? Perish the thought.

Q&AMP;A WITH CREATOR OF `EQ' 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Daniel Goleman is the author of the best-selling book ``Emotional
Intelligence,'' which popularized the idea that emotional skills
are as important to people's success in life as their IQ. Goleman
now has written a new book, ``Working with Emotional
Intelligence,'' that claims American companies are wasting $10
billion a year on poorly designed training programs because they
don't understand the way emotional intelligence really works. A
former science reporter with a doctorate in psychology from
Harvard, Goleman recently spoke with The Chronicle.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; When some people hear the phrase ``emotional
intelligence,'' they may assume you're talking about employees
being nice to each other all the time or acting ``touchy-feely.''
Is that what you mean?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Emotional intelligence doesn't just mean being nice. It
might mean being brutally frank with someone when they need to face
the truth, particularly if you're giving performance feedback. It
means being intelligent about emotions _ a different way of being
smart. Basically, emotional intelligence refers to how well we
manage ourselves and our relationships.
</P>
<P>
   There are five parts to that. One is knowing what you're
feeling. The second is managing your feelings, especially
distressing feelings. The third is motivation, the fourth is
empathy and the fifth is social skills.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is: It's all learnable. Unlike IQ, which is
constant through life, emotional intelligence tends to rise through
every decade of life. We used to call it maturity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Is emotional intelligence the same as what used to be
called ``soft skills''?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Yes. But we now have a hard definition of soft skills. For
instance, the concept of emotional intelligence is based on brain
research. Research shows that these skills are different from
technical and purely cognitive abilities because they involve a
different part of the brain _ the emotional center rather than the
neocortex. That makes them very different in terms of what it takes
to learn them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the traditional training programs in soft skills are
very misguided. They use the wrong model of learning, which doesn't
take into account the difference in how the emotional brain works.
The emotional brain needs a lot of practice. It's very primitive.
It's not going to really ``get it'' from a single session or from
reading something. It's not going to ``get it'' from a self-help
book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; As long as there have been organizations, people have
needed social skills. But have the particular skills needed for
success at work changed over time? Does a successful manager in
1998 use the same skills that his or her father used in 1958?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; The core of my new book is analysis of proprietary studies
from 121 companies, in which they looked at what sets a superior
leader apart from average. Compare them to similar lists 20 years
ago, and several competencies emerge as more important _ adapting
to change, teamwork, and leveraging diversity, which means being
able to work in a superior way with people different from yourself.
</P>
<P>
   These studies also show that emotional-intelligence-based skills
are twice as important as IQ and technical skills combined, when
you analyze the ingredients in superior performance. The higher you
go in an organization, the more significant they become. For top
management, emotional intelligence is about 85 to 90 percent of
what sets superior leaders apart from average.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Are there any skills found in top performers 20 years ago
that aren't so necessary today?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Things like being extremely efficient and orderly and doing
everything by the book. Kind of a clean-desk mentality. That
doesn't matter so much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Is emotional intelligence necessary in technical jobs?
There's the stereotype of the engineer who has no social skills but
is a technical whiz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Paradoxically, emotional intelligence is extraordinarily
important for success in technical fields. One of the crises in
technical companies is a crisis of leadership _ finding people who
can lead the team.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm starting a research consortium of technology
companies that is doing research on emotional intelligence skills
in their organizations for precisely this reason. They want to know
how to spot it and nurture it.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost a dirty little secret in the technology sector that
it's not a big IQ that will make you a superior manager. You have
to have a technical IQ high enough to have mastered the technical
skills of the people you're going to lead. But it's your social
skills that will make you able to inspire, motivate and direct
them. Engineering schools pay no attention to that. You can get
your bachelor's or master's in engineering and be a complete idiot
socially.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; What about women and men? Do women have more innate
emotional intelligence than men do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; The answer is yes and no. On average, women are better than
men at empathy and social skills. But on average, men are better
than women at things like self-confidence and how well they manage
stress. So I think it averages out.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; How have your ideas been received in the business world?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; I was amazed when ``Emotional Intelligence'' came out. That
book was mostly about children and education. But most of my
inquiries came from businesses that wanted me to come and consult
or talk, because they immediately saw the applicability. There's
huge receptivity in the workplace because everyone knows: Hey, if
there were an emotionally intelligent organization, that's the
place you'd want to work.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; In your book, you said four out of five companies now try
to do some kind of training in emotional intelligence, although
they may not call it by that particular name. But you also say that
most of it _ $10 billion worth of training _ is worthless.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; I was very surprised to see that hard-nosed businesspeople
could be very soft-minded when it came to evaluating training in
this area. They're naively frittering money away on programs that
look glitzy or sound good but have never demonstrated any real
effect _ and in fact, aren't even asked to demonstrate that they
work before they're bought.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest mistakes? Companies blithely send everyone
in a department off to a training session, whether they want it or
not. Some people need it; others don't. But everyone gets sent
regardless. It's called ``spray and pray.'' You spray it on them
and pray something will stick.
</P>
<P>
   Common mistake No. 2 is that people are given the same program
for change regardless of their needs, circumstances or interests.
That just doesn't work. You really need to tailor a learning plan
to individuals for optimal results.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there's no support back on the job for what companies are
trying to teach people. Your boss doesn't really care, and nobody
is following up. You went to a seminar, maybe you had a good time,
you have a little buzz from it, and it evaporates. People need to
know that the change they're trying to make _ whether it's being a
better listener, or taking more initiative _ matters on the job to
the people who are evaluating them.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest mistake is that people are not given
guidance in practicing the new skill on the job where it matters.
The real test of mastery of learning of this kind is whether you
can use it at the moment it matters the most, and whether you do it
automatically. That means you actually learned it.
</P>
<P>
   The final mistake made by companies is they don't evaluate the
outcome of training. The most common way for companies to evaluate
training programs is asking people afterwards if they liked it. But
that has no relation to whether they learned anything that will
make a difference for their job performance or their career.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Suppose you want to train some employees in emotional
intelligence. You'd also like to train them to use Microsoft Word.
Should you teach both those things the same way?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; No. Microsoft Word can be learned on a computer or in a
tutorial, maybe even in a single session with a good teacher. Once
you explain it to people, they've got Word. But once you explain
emotional intelligence to people, they've only gotten WHY they need
to practice it. Then they need months of practice in the situation
where it matters. This kind of learning is learned best if people
have extended support in practice _ not just rehearsal for doing it
on the job, but actually DOING it on the job.

DELL HOT ON HEELS OF COMPAQ FOR TOP U.S. PC-  MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID EINSTEIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
High-flying Dell continued to put pressure on top-ranked Compaq in
the third quarter, two reports on the U.S. personal computer market
showed today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both International Data Corp. and Dataquest also said the
overall PC industry grew at a healthy pace as strength in the
United States and Europe offset continued weakness in Asia. IDC
reported a 15 percent increase in worldwide shipments for the
quarter compared with the previous year, while Dataquest pegged the
figure at 13.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which sells directly over the telephone and the Internet,
saw U.S. shipments rise by more than 50 percent for the
12th-straight quarter. The latest surge helped the Round Rock,
Texas, company increase its market share to 14.1 percent, according
to IDC.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, meanwhile, suffered an 8 percent drop in U.S. shipments
compared with the same quarter a year ago, when it was beginning to
drive up inventories of its products in distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's market share, which IDC pegged at 19.6 percent last
year, has fallen to 15.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Gateway all increased their market
shares while snaring the third, fourth and fifth spots,
respectively, in the quarterly rankings.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was particularly impressive, jumping back into the top five
after missing the list last quarter. ``They've finally gotten it
together in the low-priced market,'' said Christine Arrington of
IDC. ``They've also been able to reorganize and create a lot of
efficiencies in their PC business that have allowed them to regain
market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Gateway's 44 percent growth during the quarter testified to the
strength of the direct-sales model that it shares with Dell.
Gateway also benefited from the success of its YourWare program,
which lets consumers finance PCs and trade older models in for new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that Gateway's focus on the U.S. home market and
IBM's return to the U.S. retail segment has produced excellent
results,'' said Bill Schaub of Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell, the beleaguered consumer PC company in Sacramento,
continued to slip, suffering a 5 percent drop in shipments. It was
sixth on IDC's list, with a market share of 6.8 percent, down from
8.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, Compaq grew 9.7 percent, according to Dataquest. Its
market share dipped from 14.2 percent to 13.7 percent, but that
still was well above second-place IBM, which increased its share
from 7.9 percent to 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dell placed third in worldwide shipments, followed by HP and
Gateway.

UNMASKING SECRET DELIGHT: TO BE A FRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - My only regret is that I didn't get to chase anybody
with a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Or an ax, even.
</P>
<P>
   But I was a rookie, so I satisfied myself with lurking behind
exotic fake plants, waiting for just the right second and _
HARGGHH! _ screaming at the poor wretches just when they least
expected it.
</P>
<P>
   The shock and terror on their faces put me in the best mood you
can imagine. If only I'd made a small child cry . . . but that's
just being greedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds brutal, I know. But that's life working in a haunted
house. I donned a bizarre jungle-tribesman-type mask and a black
robe for an hour or so last week at Scream Theatre, in Manistee
Town Center, doing my best to scare the life out of anyone who had
paid for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there was more to this than just springing and
screaming. Well, not in my case. But most of the folks there put a
lot of thought and effort into their ghoulish work.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Harris, for instance, said he not only keeps his body still
but his eyes locked in place so that no one will suspect he's real
before he pounces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stand still and then jump out and scare the (expletive)
out of them,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Psycho killer
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris gave me a tour of the house before it opened, pointing
out the grisly gore in all its glory. A friendly sort, he had a
tendency to start sentences with such phrases as, ``There was one
night when I was a psychotic killer,'' or, ``Last night, I was a
demented Little Bo Peep, and . . . '' Normally, he is a ghostly
ballroom dancer, but this particular night, he was ``bondage man,
manning the front door.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah. That explains the black leather, the chains. The whip.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Raczkowski offered more tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't like to be followed,'' she said. ``So
following can be very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Raczkowski, an insurance underwriter when she's not inducing
screams and chest pains, looked perfectly normal, other than the
inch-deep gash running from her forehead to her collarbone. Most
effective. She elicits screams 90 percent of the time, she said _
and loves it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommend it to anyone,'' she said. ``Feeling stressed?
Scare someone! It's great. It's a rush. It's like jumping off a
cliff.'' (She said that last like it was a good thing.)
</P>
<P>
   Taking their advice, I nestled among the plants and waited,
standing as still as possible (maybe too still _ one kid, wondering
whether I was real, poked me in the eye to find out). And when they
started to pass by, as I said before . . . HARGGHH!
</P>
<P>
   Christine was right. The fun. The (begin ital) power. (end ital)
This was fantastic!
</P>
<P>
   ``Go straight at 'em,'' Chris Goben advised during a slow
stretch. ``Find a weak spot in the crowd and just work on that weak
spot till it's got 'em all scared.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wolfman and Bolton
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goben, who has worked in haunted houses for six years, was
dressed like a wolfman, which made our conversation a little
surreal. (Sometimes he's also the Beast, a creature he described as
being like the wolfman, only ``he antagonizes the souls of
mortals.'' Oh, I get it _ like Michael Bolton.)
</P>
<P>
   Goben was describing the thrill of scaring people as a ``pure
adrenaline rush'' when we heard a commotion and he suddenly took
off toward his post. More people coming?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever they say, `Fresh meat!' or `Victim!' you've got
someone in the house,'' he said over a furry shoulder. Good to
know.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, I didn't scare everyone. Wearing white sneakers probably
wasn't the brightest move _ it tended to tip people off. And, of
course, the occasional macho guy had to prove how tough he was by
joking around about how scared he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the chain saw would have come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a chain saw, you don't have to do too much to
scare the crap out of somebody,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   I checked out the chain-saw guy later. I'm happy to say that,
from the look on the victims' faces, Harris was right. &QL;

MEET THE NEW JETS, NOT THE SAME AS THE OLD JETS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In the Jets' new era, as they continue
to escape from their twilight zone, they take advantage of the
breaks instead of being victimized by them.
</P>
<P>
   Their 28-3 victory over the Falcons on Sunday was a major step
forward for this franchise, a second-straight triumph over a pretty
good team, and the fourth victory in the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' record is now 4-3, putting them in a tie with New
England for second place in the American Football Conference East,
one game behind the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Luck? Perhaps there was some for the Jets, who faced and
battered the oldest quarterback ever to start a National Football
League game, 44-year-old Steve DeBerg. He was starting for the
first time in five years because Chris Chandler has a sore left
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   And dumb luck, too? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells, angry at the rookie free safety Kevin
Williams for being late to a meeting on Saturday night, banished
him to the bench. So Jerome Henderson, who hadn't started since
last year, discovered on Sunday morning at the Meadowlands that he
was going to be the free safety. He pounced on a DeBerg fumble in
the second quarter, returned it for a touchdown that put the Jets
ahead by 14-0 and forced the Falcons into an uncomfortable game
plan _ employing DeBerg to try to get them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the kind of bounce you dream about,'' said Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   There was a dream-like quality about the game for most of the
crowd of more than 70,000 fans and several Jet players. Vinny
Testaverde continued his Hollywood-like comeback by tossing a pair
of touchdowns, Curtis Martin continued his 100-yard rushing
production, Mo Lewis played linebacker like an all pro and the
defense held the previously dangerous Jamal Anderson to only 46
yards on 19 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Decent teams are supposed to take advantage of other teams'
problems, and the Jets showed the willing, but overmatched DeBerg
nothing but animosity. They blitzed him from the opening series,
they wound up sacking him three times in three quarters, they
intercepted him once and forced him to fumble once, leading to the
pivotal touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Testaverde understood exactly how important this day
was. For the first time in 10 years, his career
touchdowns-to-interception differential is now in positive
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm plus-2,'' he said with a smile when asked about that
record. The 34-year-old admitted that he had been hounded by his
history of having more interceptions than touchdowns. This season,
though, he has tossed 11 touchdowns to one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, having Martin produce a fourth straight game of 100
rushing yards _ something no Jet runner had done in 13 years _
meant that Testaverde was not confined to flinging the football
downfield.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is now 4-0 as the Jets' starter _ no other
quarterback in team history can make that statement _ and in each
start, Martin amassed more than 100 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Even Parcells was, well, if not pleased, at least upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy we won,'' he said, ``I guess you can't tell
that.''
</P>
<P>
   His Jets reached what he had set out as a goal two games ago _
capturing five games of a six-game stretch. Last Monday night, the
Jets toppled a fine Patriots team and on Sunday they defeated a
Falcons club that was 5-1 coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Next Sunday the Jets play the Chiefs in Kansas City, a place
that often overwhelms visitors.
</P>
<P>
   So Parcells wasn't completely a sweetheart with his club after
Sunday's thrashing. ``I told guys we still got players who need the
whip and I don't have the energy to whip them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said Sunday that Williams ``was late last night for the
meeting. That's fine. But I'm not going to have any rookies late
for the meeting. So he can just sit on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also pre-game exhortations by the veteran running
back/tight end Keith Byars and linebacker Bryan Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the defense had to make points,'' said Cox. ``We
hadn't done it all year.'' Cox started for James Farrior, who had
not practiced well enough for Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   First, the defense stuffed Anderson, who was held to no gain in
a two-carry stretch on the opening drive. When the Jets got the
ball for their second series, they embarked on an 86-yard march
that culminated with a 2-yard scoring run by Martin.
</P>
<P>
   And then, on the opening drive of the second quarter, DeBerg
found himself sandwiched between defensive backs _ Victor Green
blitzing from one side, Henderson coming from the other. Green
sacked him, DeBerg fumbled and there was Henderson plucking the
ball off the ground in stride and dashing 53 yards for the score.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked for the Falcons. Anderson had only 25 yards by
halftime, averaging a mere 2.3 yards a carry. DeBerg got little
yardage on his completions. All the Falcons got out of the half _
and the game, it turned out _ was a field goal from the
second-oldest player on the team, 38-year-old Morten Andersen, on
the last play of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But that was quickly negated after halftime on a big play by
Keyshawn Johnson, who had dropped two passes earlier. Johnson used
his 6-foot-3-inch height to reach a toss from Testaverde over
cornerback Ray Buchanan, who is 6 inches shorter. It was a 12-yard
score that put the Jets ahead by 21-3. DeBerg was forced to pass,
and on the next series a deflection was picked off by Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   That positioned a Testaverde-to-Byars 22-yard scoring pass that
was so easy that Byars strolled into the end zone the final 6
yards.
</P>
<P>
   It prompted a standing ovation, a roar from the crowd of ``Jets,
Jets, Jets, Jets.'' But it wasn't a plea for something to happen,
as the chant has been so often over the years. Instead, it was an
anthem from fans who usually had been too nervous to think of
better days.
</P>
<P>
   That crushing score also marked the end of DeBerg's day. He was
replaced by a second-year man, Tony Graziani, who is 20 years
younger.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Glenn Foley, the player replaced by Testaverde two
games ago, came in during the final two minutes and kneeled down as
the Jets ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   On the sideline, Williams, who got in for a few plays, watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning,'' said the chastised rookie later, ``always makes
everything easier.'' &QL;

WALTER KENDRICK, SCHOLAR OF LITERATURE, DIES
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ Walter Kendrick, a professor of English at Fordham
University who was an authority on Victorian literature, an author
and a literary critic, died Monday in Beth Israel Hospice in
Manhattan. He was 51 and lived in Manhattan's West Village.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his companion, Daniel
Applebaum.
</P>
<P>
   Kendrick taught until early in this fall semester at Fordham,
whose faculty he had joined as an assistant professor in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times book critic Michiko Kakutani wrote in a
review of Kendrick's book ``The Thrill of Fear: 250 Years of Scary
Entertainment'' (1991, Grove): ``In this lively new study of scary
entertainment, the scholar Walter Kendrick _ the author of a
diverting study of pornography called `The Secret Museum' _ takes
issue with `those who bemoan the graphic bloodletting of
late-century horror films, who see it as a symptom of terminal
degeneracy in Western culture.' There is nothing particularly new
about today's horror films, he writes, except innovations made
possible by special-effects technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kakutani called ``The Thrill of Fear'' ``informative and
consistently entertaining,'' and critic John Gross wrote, also in a
review in The Times, that ``The Secret Museum: Pornography in
Modern Culture'' (1987, California) had ``a great deal to recommend
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendrick's other writings included ``The Novel-Machine: The
Theory and Fiction of Anthony Trollope'' (1980, Books on Demand).
He contributed essays and reviews about literature and art to The
Village Voice, The Oxford Review, Salmagundi and The Boston Globe.
He also wrote book reviews for The Times and almost 100 articles in
various journals.
</P>
<P>
   At his death he was working on a book-length chronicle of two
old Rhode Island families, the Kendricks and the Mayforths (his
mother was a Mayforth).
</P>
<P>
   He was chairman of the literary criticism section of the
Northeast Modern Language Association in 1981 and a fellow of the
National Endowment for the Humanities in 1980 and 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Kendrick was born in Providence, R.I., and received a
bachelor's degree in 1968 from Wesleyan University and a doctorate
in 1975 from Yale University. He was in the Army, stationed mainly
in Germany, from 1968 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Applebaum.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James V. Hallisey, a lawyer specializing in health
care and Surrogate's Court matters, died on Oct. 16 at his home in
Manhattan. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Tamara
Hallisey-Hatfield.
</P>
<P>
   Hallisey, a Manhattan lawyer for the last 32 years, was a legal
consultant to the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York
and was on the boards of the Catholic Youth Organization, the
Catholic Health Care Network and Our Lady of Mercy Health Care
System, which includes nursing homes in New York City. He was also
chairman of Rosalie Hall, a home for unwed mothers in the Bronx,
and he was active in the affairs of Carmel Richmond Nursing Home on
Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Hallisey was born and raised in Hell's Kitchen. He served in the
Marines during the Korean War and graduated in 1954 from Iona
College and in 1957 from the Fordham University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, he married Nancy Spafford, who died in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter, of Manhattan, he is survived by a son,
James Hallisey Jr. of Manhattan; two grandchildren; a brother; and
two sisters.

NO DEVELOPMENTS REPORTED IN SLAYING OF ABORTION DOCTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, N.Y. _ The nightmare unfolded just off a road called
Paradise in a haven that prides itself as ``the safest town in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   But even here, in this leafy Buffalo suburb of swimming pools
and country-club comfort, friends and neighbors said Sunday they
sensed danger lurking in Dr. Barnett Slepian's presence.
</P>
<P>
   Before Slepian apparently became the latest victim in the
long-roiling conflict over abortion rights _ fatally wounded by a
sniper Friday night as he sat in his kitchen near his wife and four
sons _ he fought back as few abortion providers have against
protesters who taunted him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Often with words, and once with a baseball bat, Slepian, 52,
attacked the activists who converged on his home and office,
calling him ``killer'' and warning his sons, ages 7 to 15, not to
become ``murderers like your father.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid a rash of abortion-related shootings and bombings in recent
years from Birmingham, Ala., to the Boston area, several of
Slepian's friends and neighbors said they had long wondered if the
next stranger arriving from Paradise Road would have murdering
Slepian on his mind. Neighbors said they often called police to
report suspicious passersby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always worried something would happen because he
believed so deeply in his ideals and made so many enemies because
of it,'' said Dr. Djavad Arani, a cardiologist who lives across the
street from the Slepians, as he walked with his wife, Gisela.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian also sensed the possibility of an early and violent
death. Decrying protesters who strung up a six-foot-tall banner in
his neighborhood that said ``Slepian Kills Children'' and picketed
his house wearing buttons bearing the same slogan, Slepian wrote in
a letter to the editor of the Buffalo News in 1994: ``Please don't
feign surprise, dismay and certainly not innocence when a more
volatile and less restrained member of the group decides to react
... by shooting an abortion provider.''
</P>
<P>
   A task force of local, state and federal agents from the United
States and Canada reported no developments Sunday in a massive
search for clues to Slepian's killer. Authorities believe the
slaying may be linked to four previous shootings of abortion
providers at this time of year in northern New York and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   All the shootings have occurred near Veterans Day, which in
Canada is called ``Remembrance Day,'' and embraced by some
antiabortion activists as ``Remember the Unborn Child Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, who had just returned home with his wife from services
at his synagogue in memory of his late father, was the first person
killed in the series of shootings. He also was the first to die in
an abortion-related shooting since John C. Salvi III murdered two
receptionists _ Lee Ann Nichols and Shannon Lowney _ at women's
health clinics in Brookline in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.2l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Police said Slepian's killer lay in wait in a wooded area off
Cricket Lane, just beyond a swimming pool and fence behind
Slepian's two-story, Tudor-style brick house. As Slepian began to
rise from his kitchen chair, the sniper fired a single round of
high-powered ammunition that struck Slepian in the back and burst
through his body, killing him in his family's presence.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   Although the vast majority of antiabortion activists condemned
the slaying, the Rev. Donald Spitz, director of Pro-Life Virginia,
said Slepian ``reaped what he sowed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The shooter is a hero,'' Spitz said in a statement. ``Whatever
action is justified to save the life of a born baby is justified to
save the life of an unborn baby. ... Someone else who loved the
babies that he planned on killing stopped the serial murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Slepian had been marked for death on an Internet page created by
militant foes of abortion rights. Sunday, his name, with a line
drawn through it, appeared on the page beneath a depiction of
dripping blood. The line through Slepian's name, according to the
web page, indicated he was a ``fatality.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Slepian's neighbors remained uneasy Sunday as yellow
tape ringed nearly a dozen homes around the crime site and officers
stood sentry, blocking every approach to Slepian's house.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian's wife, Lynn, a former nurse, and their sons remained
behind closed doors, preparing for his funeral today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even those of us who don't believe in abortion are very upset
about what happened to this poor man,'' said Joan Witnauer, a
neighbor who works with her husband, a building contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of Slepian's neighbors said they opposed abortion
rights. But they described Slepian as a loving, dedicated father
and considerate neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, in addition to performing abortions, delivered
thousands of babies. ``He did a lot of good in his life's work,''
Witnauer said.
</P>
<P>
   But he endured much wrath, in part because he dared to stand up
to his detractors, several friends said. In his lone act of
violence, Slepian struck a demonstrator and battered a van in 1988
when protesters stood outside his home and reportedly chanted
``murderer'' as his family celebrated Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and paid a $400 fine.
But he continued to play a high-profile role in the abortion
debate, unlike many other providers who have shied from the public
arena for safety's sake.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 interview with a Buffalo television station, for
example, Slepian accused antiabortion activists of inciting
violence. ``Maybe they are not going to perform it,'' he said,
``but they're setting up their soldiers to perform the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors who witnessed the demonstrations outside
his home and office expressed sorrow at the abuse they said
Slepian's family endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they all were harassed,'' said Pat Goldwater, a
friend and former neighbor who described herself as a manager in
the insurance industry. ``But what his wife and children went
through was really cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Goldwater praised Slepian for staying in the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my eyes, he's a hero,'' she said. ``He had convictions, and
he stood up for what he believed in, which not many people are
willing to do these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Slepian feared the consequences of his death. Referring
to his wife and children, he said in the Buffalo television
interview, ``I think, if I wasn't around, what they would go
through.''

FOOTBALL COLUMN: FOR DEBERG, ONE BATTLE THAT HE LOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Steve DeBerg is 44 and trying to play in
a sport where old guys are swallowed up like raw meat in a zoo.
That creaking noise you heard Sunday was DeBerg's knees when he
walked onto the field as the starting quarterback for the Atlanta
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get too caught up in the comeback story of DeBerg, who
replaced the injured Chris Chandler. It turned out to be an ugly
fable as DeBerg was overmatched in the New York Jets' 28-3 victory
over the Falcons. He became the oldest starting quarterback in the
National Football League, and looked every day of it.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive part of DeBerg's story is not the fact that
he is playing, but the journey he took to get to this point.
</P>
<P>
   Though DeBerg has been in football since the 1970s, his rebirth
really began in 1996, when Falcons coach Dan Reeves and his
assistants, including DeBerg, were fired by the New York Giants.
Every one of those coaches got other jobs _ except DeBerg. No team
wanted him, so in a span of only a few years DeBerg went from
unemployed to Falcons quarterbacks coach to the old man in the sea
of bodies. It has been both a glorious and a painful trip.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves hired DeBerg as the Giants' quarterbacks coach in 1995, a
move that shocked many. DeBerg had wanted to get into coaching for
several years, but the worst-kept secret in the league was that no
team would hire him, because of a belief that he had a drinking
problem. In fact, when the Giants hired him, several executives
from other teams called to warn the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, DeBerg was able to keep the fight with his
personal demons from spilling into the public eye. At least until
an embarrassing episode in January 1996, when he was stopped by the
police while driving in New York at 1:50 a.m., traveling eastbound
on a westbound street, according to a police report.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg, who told the police he had had five beers that night,
was charged with driving while intoxicated, driving while impaired
and driving the wrong way on a one-way street. His license was
automatically revoked because he refused a Breathalyzer test, the
report said. The charges were later dropped, and DeBerg received
alcohol counseling as a result of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Giants organization, from players and assistant
coaches to front-office executives, weren't surprised by the
arrest. They knew about DeBerg's drinking problem, and were well
aware of other instances of alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   With DeBerg also showing up late and missing staff meetings,
Reeves eventually tired of the incidents and gave him a stern
warning to straighten up or face being fired. DeBerg apologized to
the staff.
</P>
<P>
   That was almost two years ago. This past off season, after being
out of football for more than a year, DeBerg reunited with Reeves
as the Falcons' quarterbacks coach. DeBerg said in interviews this
summer that he now drinks only in moderation.
</P>
<P>
   There are athletes who fall into the pit and never crawl out.
DeBerg apparently has made his way out. Now comes another tough
battle: playing in an NFL that is so fast and brutal that no one
DeBerg's age has any chance of excelling.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg's mobility is terrible, and since the Jets know his arm
strength is weak, they blitzed him relentlessly. In just under
three quarters, he was 9 for 17 for 117 yards with an interception.
Often, because of the continual pressure, DeBerg lobbed the ball
harmlessly in the air.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg was sacked three times, and his fumble in the second
quarter was returned for a touchdown. And what may not endear
DeBerg to teammates is that after the game, he seemed to blame
everyone but himself for what turned out to be a miserable day for
the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``From top to bottom it seemed we were outperformed, from the
playing side of it to the coaching side of it, pretty much the
whole deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg has what he wants _ another chance to play in the NFL.
But that died on the field Sunday. He was so bad that he will not
start another game unless all the quarterbacks on the Falcons'
roster come down with the bubonic plague. Where DeBerg's success
has come is off the field.
</P>
<P>
   If it is true he has controlled his drinking, that is something
more impressive than anything he has ever done on the field, or
will ever do.

GLENN WILLIAM POORMAN, STANDARD OIL EXECUTIVE, DIES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Glenn William Poorman, the president of Esso International from
1966 until he retired in 1970, died Wednesday at his home in
Crowley, La. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Poorman, who was born in Palmyra, Pa., fell ill at age 12 with
scarlet fever, which affected his eyesight and forced him to drop
out of school.
</P>
<P>
   He recovered his health and attended Dartmouth College, where he
majored in chemistry and graduated cum laude in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Finding it hard to get a job in the Depression, he continued his
studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he got
a master's degree in chemical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He got a job in 1932 with the Standard Oil Co. at its huge
refinery in Baton Rouge. Not having the money for a train ticket,
he caught a ride on an oil tanker to the refinery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934 he married Louise Gueno from Crowley, who was attending
Louisiana State University.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of working at the refinery he was transferred to
the company's headquarters in New York where he helped to plan the
transition from war to peacetime when demand for gasoline and other
products began to surge.
</P>
<P>
   He helped to set up the first system to measure management
performance at the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he was named the vice-president of Esso Export, a
Standard Oil affiliate, and in 1966 was named the president of Esso
International, the worldwide marketing and transportation
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Oil is now known as the Exxon Corp.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Louise; two daughters, Louise
Baenninger of Mandeville, La., and Sanna Randolph Thomas of Mill
Valley, Calif., and three grandchildren.  &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Randolph Carter, an author who wrote several plays
produced on Broadway, died on Oct. 12 at St. Albans Naval Hospital
in Queens. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's first Broadway production was ``Arms of Venus'' (1937),
based on Petronius' ``Satyricon.'' Variety called it ``a tempest in
a Roman tomb'' and ``an orgy of laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was associated with J.J. Shubert for 10 years, serving as
a play doctor and providing dialogue for musicals and operettas
including ``The Student Prince,'' ``Countess Maritza,'' ``The Land
of Smiles'' and ``The Merry Widow.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Broadway productions included a dramatization of
``Wuthering Heights'' in 1940 and ``Eugenia,'' starring Tallulah
Bankhead, in 1957. His ``Florence Nightingale,'' starring Katharine
Cornell, was presented on radio in 1951 by the Theater Guild on the
Air.
</P>
<P>
   He also adapted ``Wuthering Heights'' for a television
production that starred Richard Burton and Claire Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 his adaptation of James Farrell's ``Death of Nora Ryan''
was presented off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 to 1969 Carter was the drama critic on the John
Wingate news program on WOR-TV.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of ``The World of Flo Ziegfeld'' (1974) and a
monograph, ``Joseph Urban'' (1992).

DEFINING ISSUES EMERGE IN DEBATE BY SCRAPPY SENATE HOPEFULS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen &UR; . &LR;  Alfonse D'Amato and Rep &UR; . &LR;  Charles Schumer
laid out sharply different views on tax cuts, gun control and
abortion rights Sunday during a free-flowing, if clamorous, debate
in which each Senate candidate struggled to set the agenda for the
final week of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate marked by sarcastic retorts and repeated instances
in which each man tried to talk over the other _ ``Gentlemen,
gentlemen, this is getting out of hand!'' the moderator, Gabe
Pressman, implored at one point in an effort to restore order _
Schumer and D'Amato spent much of their time trying to discredit
each other's credentials. D'Amato once again asserted that Schumer
had neglected his duties in Washington this year in order to
campaign, while Schumer described D'Amato as untrustworthy and
extreme.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the first debate, which took place 17 hours earlier
in Schenectady, this one showed the two candidates, nudged by the
moderator, in an exchange of views on issues that has largely been
absent through much of this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer assailed D'Amato for repeatedly voting against abortion
rights and gun control and for supporting much of House Speaker
Newt Gingrich's Contract With America. D'Amato assailed Schumer for
supporting a series of tax increases in Congress, opposing the 1996
welfare bill and voting against authorizing President George Bush
to use force against Saddam Hussein in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   These exchanges of views were made, though, in anything but an
orderly manner. Pressman is known for staging debates without
rules, and both D'Amato and Schumer, two of the more combative
politicians that New York has produced in the last 10 years, sought
to make the most of that televised opportunity. They almost
stumbled over each other grabbing for the questions, cutting each
other off and talking over each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please let me finish, sir,'' Schumer said, as D'Amato
challenged his assertions about his support for tax cuts. ``I
didn't interrupt you. So don't interrupt me.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, D'Amato said, ``You're being rude,'' and
glared at Schumer as the congressman badgered the senator to
account for his votes against abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, D'Amato wrinkled his face in exasperation as
Schumer assailed his credibility. ``Oh my God,'' he muttered, with
a loud sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I finish?'' Schumer asked Pressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you never finish,'' D'Amato responded.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, meeting in the second of the only two debates
D'Amato would agree to, sat in gray armchairs at WNBC studios at
Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. D'Amato was stern and mostly
unsmiling, pointing his fingers and extending his arms to make his
point. Schumer was more relaxed, staring straight into the camera
as he spoke, slipping on a pair of black-rimmed reading glasses as
he read portions of an editorial endorsing him in Newsday, as he
tried to rebut D'Amato's criticism about his attendance record.
</P>
<P>
   On crime, both men invoked different bills on which they
differed in order to put themselves in the strongest light. D'Amato
pointed to legislation that would, among other things, provide for
extra penalties for crimes that were committed with a gun, and a
bill that would require mandatory sentences for repeat felons.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer heralded his crime bill, which included money for local
police officers, a broadening of the federal death penalty and
tougher penalties for multiple offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The two men demonstrated one clear difference on fighting crime:
gun control. Schumer challenged D'Amato for opposing his bills to
restrict the number of assault weapons and to license some
handguns, setting off a tangled exchange between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator, why are you opposed to them when so many New Yorkers
want them?'' Schumer asked, referring to the bills. ``Can you
answer the question?''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato responded by noting his efforts to pass legislation
increasing penalties for crimes committed with guns. ``Congressman,
the difference in our approach is _ ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to answer the question?'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato continued, ``I'm for going after the criminal, as
opposed to attempting to pass more laws.''
</P>
<P>
   On taxes, D'Amato repeatedly assailed Schumer for consistently
voting in favor of Democratic tax bills over the years. D'Amato
said that by his count, they added up to $1 trillion, ``so when we
call you a tax-and-spend liberal, it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted against raising those taxes on middle-class families,
on farmers,'' D'Amato said. ``The congressman voted to tax
everything that's alive, and even people who have died.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to 1993 legislation pushed by Democrats to balance the
budget _ with a combination of spending cuts and tax increases _
D'Amato added, ``Yours was the deciding vote to have the greatest
tax increase in the history of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer seized on D'Amato's opening to align himself with
President Clinton, who remains extremely popular in New York.
Clinton has argued that that bill laid the groundwork for the
nation's current economic prosperity, including the elimination of
the federal deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1993 vote that President Clinton put together is a vote
that turned America around,'' Schumer said. ``It helped account for
our present prosperity. It helped create hundreds of thousands of
jobs. It helped do all kinds of things that the Republican Party
had been unable to do and help balance the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The two clashed as well on abortion rights. D'Amato, without
ever noting outright that he opposes abortion rights, argued that
there should be tolerance of different views on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of conscience,'' said D'Amato, who is running
with the support of the Right to Life Party.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``And it's a contentious issue,'' he said. ``And I can't change
on it. And people know where I stand. But I have voted for these
exceptions 18 times. And here's the record. And the congressman
would try to becloud that.''

   D'Amato was referring to legislation that allowed for abortion
in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life was in danger.
But Schumer noted that D'Amato had voted just as often for bills
that included no such exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can New Yorkers trust a man like Al D'Amato on this
issue?'' Schumer said. ``You know, I do respect your view, senator.
And there is tolerance. I have lots of friends who have the same
view as you. But have the decency, the honor and the courage to
come clean and say that you are strongly pro-life and you believe
in it. And I will say I'm pro-choice and I believe in it. And we'll
let the chips fall where they may.''

A FEW QUIRKS EXPOSED IN MICROSOFT TRIAL  
 MAKER OF MUSIC PLAYER AWAITS JUDGE'S DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.)  
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Microsoft's view, the government's antitrust suit represents
``a return of the Luddites,'' the English workers who first tried
to stop the advance of industrialization in 1811 by smashing new
machines that were being used to manufacture socks.
</P>
<P>
   But in court last week, it was Microsoft's lawyer who seemed to
be a follower of the movement's mythical leader, King Ludd.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial opened last week, the Justice Department _ not
known to be the foremost votary of advanced technology _ put on a
high-technology light show to display the memorandums and e-mail
messages the government had gathered from Microsoft's files.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing a long memo that was displayed on a giant video
screen, the government's lead lawyer, David Boise, was able to
point to a quotation as his assistant immediately highlighted the
section in blown-up form.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the turn of Microsoft _ a company that sees itself as
the world's vanguard of high technology, and which sells
Powerpoint, the software for presentations of this sort that is the
industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Microsoft's lead lawyer, John Warden, put a key memo up
for display, the first thing the judge and courtroom saw was his
hand sliding a sheet of paper onto an overhead projector. The
relevant passage had been colored with a highlighter pen.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Microsoft decided that a Luddite presentation was
politically useful. Or perhaps Warden simply felt more comfortable
with this approach. After describing the advance of computer
technology in the last few decades, he concluded by telling the
judge, ``There are a few of us, including me, who still use a
fountain pen and a legal pad.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge on the case, Thomas Penfield Jackson, is clearly no
technophile, either. Though most evidence being introduced is
e-mail messages, Jackson seemed wholly unfamiliar last week with
even the basic conventions of the medium. When one e-mail note was
being introduced, for example, he asked Warden, ``How do we know
this is from Microsoft?''
</P>
<P>
   Warden explained: ``Where it says `From: Microsoft.com.' That's
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' the judge responded, nodding.
</P>
<P>
   But then not even last week's key witness professed much
technical expertise. As James Barksdale, the head of Netscape
Communications Corp., sat on the witness stand for three days, he
responded to several questions by protesting that he was not a
technologist.
</P>
<P>
   During a closed conference with the judge and the other lawyers
late last week, Warden said of Barksdale, ``Sometimes he doesn't
seem to understand'' the questions, ``but that's in good faith,''
according to a transcript made public.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said, ``Sometimes I don't understand them either.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Warden responded: ``Sometimes I may not understand them
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials declined to confirm it, but word is that in
the summer months leading up to the trial, the company leaders
decided to ban a word: ``browser.'' Certainly the defense team
labored to avoid using the term in court last week.
</P>
<P>
   As a key part of its defense, the company is trying to argue
that Internet Explorer, the browsing software used to explore the
World Wide Web, is an integral part of the Windows operating
system. To concede otherwise might reinforce the government's
accusation that Microsoft rolled Internet Explorer into Windows
mainly to undermine the market for Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   So the software formerly known as a browser is now referred to
by Microsoft as ``Internet Explorer technologies'' or ``browser
functionality.''
</P>
<P>
   In court on Thursday, for example, Warden asked Barksdale a
question about ``Internet Explorer technologies,'' to which
Barksdale shot back:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you mean the browser?''
</P>
<P>
   No, Warden answered, he meant ``Internet Explorer code, Internet
Explorer technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a browser,'' Barksdale retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Warden refused to take the bait. Through another five minutes of
questioning, he resorted to one circumlocution after another to
avoid using the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible to separate what you call Internet Explorer
from Windows 98?'' he asked at one point. And later, Warden asked
about the ``functionality in Windows that you call the browser.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale did not back down either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The browser itself is not a part of Windows,'' he insisted.
``But it is called into play by Windows when browser functions are
needed.''

<P>
   Maker of Music Player Awaits Judge's Decision
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Multimedia Systems is waiting on a judge's decision,
expected Monday, to learn whether it can take its latest invention
to market in time for holiday shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   That invention, called the Rio, is a portable gadget smaller
than a Sony Walkman and weighing only a few ounces that can store
music in digital form and play it back through headphones. The
company had hoped to start selling the device in early November for
about $200.
</P>
<P>
   But on Oct. 16, U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins in Los
Angeles issued a 10-day restraining order, prohibiting the company
from producing the Rio. Diamond officials are to be back in court
Monday to hear whether Judge Collins has decided to make the
injunction permanent or lift it.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, the powerful
trade group, filed a complaint against Diamond on Oct. 9,
contending that the Rio would encourage people to download pirated
music stored on the Internet, instead of buying compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   Users of Rio first download songs from any music Web site and
store them on their hard drives. They then attach the Rio to their
computers using a cable, allowing them to transfer as much as an
hour's worth of music to the device. The music is stored in the MP3
programming format, providing near-CD quality sound.
</P>
<P>
   The case may rest on Judge Collins' interpretation of the 1992
Audio Home Recording Act, which is intended to protect musicians
and music companies from piracy and copyright violation involving
digital home audio equipment. The association says that the Rio is
in clear violation; Diamond contends that the device is not covered
by the act because it specifically exempts computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The association wants Diamond Multimedia to incorporate security
technology into the Rio that would prevent users from storing
illegal copies of music, but Diamond executives argue that the
company is not legally required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piracy is a bad thing and needs to be controlled, but you
don't control it through the device,'' said Ken Wirt, vice
president of corporate marketing at Diamond, which is based in San
Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome may come down to whether Judge Collins finds that
the Rio is a computer device. If she does, she may remove the
injunction, perhaps setting a court date for sometime in 1999.

<P>
   Additional details of the slaying emerged on Sunday. Slepian's
lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray, said the sniper's bullet entered
through a partially draped kitchen window, hit Slepian in the back
and exited through his chest. The doctor's wife and one of his sons
were in the kitchen when the shooting occurred, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet bounced off a cabinet and ricocheted into the living
room, where the doctor's three other children were watching
television, Murray said. Slepian's wife and one son tried to revive
him. Just over an hour later, he was declared dead at nearby
Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, people on both sides of the abortion issue
expressed outrage at the shooting. But one abortion opponent, the
Rev. Donald Spitz, the founder of Pro-Life Virginia, described
Slepian's killer as a ``hero'' for ending the physician's
``bloodthirsty practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We as Christians have a responsibility to protect the innocent
from being murdered,'' Spitz said in a statement released to The
Associated Press, ``the same way we would want someone to protect
us. Whoever shot the shot protected the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Most other opponents of abortion, however, condemned the
shooting and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In his Sunday Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York,
Cardinal John O'Connor called the murder wrong but he urged those
angered by the slaying to be equally angered by abortions. ``He
called on many of the same people to express outrage at partial
birth abortion, which he called the equivalent of infanticide,''
Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, said
of the cardinal's sermon.
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders in Buffalo also condemned the shooting. Bishop
Henry Mansell of the Archdiocese of Buffalo said it was ``an act of
madness,'' but he went on to defend the Church's opposition to
abortion as ``respecting of human life in all its forms, especially
the most vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Dudley, deputy director of the National Abortion
Federation, assailed the remarks and called on anti-abortion groups
to shift their tactics. She said the rhetoric of the anti-abortion
movement has helped lead to violent attacks against abortion
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that when pro-life organizations try to distinguish
between themselves and these incidents they are at best being
disingenuous,'' she said. ``They are the ones who call these
doctors murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amherst, residents who said they opposed abortion decried the
attack and said they hoped the perpetrator was caught.
</P>
<P>
   Men smoking cigars and drinking beer with friends after shooting
skeet at the Buffalo Shooting Club in Amherst said their feelings
about abortion were mixed, but they uniformly denounced the killing
of Slepian.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents said abortion had gradually dwindled as a local
issue since Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, started a
series of largely unsuccessful ``Spring of Life'' demonstrations in
1992 intended to shut down abortion clinics and harass local
doctors, including Slepian.
</P>
<P>
   Little of the vitriol that the issue aroused in the late 1980s
and early 1990s remains, residents said, and many of the local
religious leaders who led the 1992 protests have moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people that are left are the hard-core, fanatical
people,'' said Larry Finkelstien, a high school teacher who works
as an escort at abortion clinics. ``Everyone else has gone away.''

NOEL CARROLL, 56, STAR RUNNER AND FITNESS DEVOTEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Noel Carroll, a hulking half-miler who set Irish, European and
world records and helped establish Villanova as a showcase for a
generation of Irish track stars, died in Dublin, Ireland, on Friday
as he had so conspicuously lived _ on his feet, apparently after
suffering a heart attack during his regular noontime run.
</P>
<P>
   He was 56 and was one of Ireland's leading exponents of clean
living and physical fitness.
</P>
<P>
   If his death inevitably recalls that of Jim Fixx, the American
running guru who was 52 when he suffered a fatal heart attack while
running in 1984, Carroll was known in Ireland as more than a
celebrated athlete who neither smoked nor drank and who preached
the joys and benefits of running.
</P>
<P>
   Since his competitive career ended in the 1970s, he had spent 24
high-profile years in a continuing public dialogue with aggrieved
citizens and municipal critics as the official spokesman of the
so-called Dublin Corp., the city's chief operating authority. Since
1996 he had held the equally high-profile position of chief
executive of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, sports fans in the United States can be forgiven
if they recall Carroll chiefly as the oversized Irish speedster who
caught the eye of Villanova's legendary track coach, James Elliott,
at the 1962 Millrose Games in New York and went on to turn an Irish
trickle started by Ron Delaney into a tide as a pioneer of the
famous Irish-Villanova pipeline, which drew a torrent of star Irish
runners like Eamonn Coghlan and Marcus O'Sullivan to suburban
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   As a 20-year-old half-miler, Carroll, a member of the Irish
two-mile relay team, wasn't much to look at, or was rather too
much. At 6 foot 3 inches and 196 pounds, he was built more like a
tight end, or maybe two half-milers, than a middle-distance runner,
but Elliott, a former quarter-miler, wasn't called Jumbo for
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, at 18 and 19, Carroll had set world age-group records
in the 880-yard run, and when the coach saw how well he moved his
bulk around the banked Madison Square Garden track, he offered him
a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   For Carroll, who had dropped out of school at 13 and held a
series of jobs before beginning his running career in the army,
where he was converted from cross-country to the 880 and 440, the
chance to get a college education without having gone to high
school was too good an opportunity to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   At Villanova he did not disappoint, maintaining reasonable
grades while leading the Wildcats to a series of track
championships and helping to set a world record along the way, in
1964, as the anchor of the 4-by-880 relay team.
</P>
<P>
   Although he turned in disappointing performances and failed to
win a medal in two Olympic Games, 1964 and 1968, Carroll was a
dominant runner of his time. He set an indoor European record in
the 880 in 1964, won three consecutive European and British titles
in the event, won a total of 14 Irish championships and set a
progression of national records in the 880 and the 440.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, he maintained such a sense of humor about his
career that he once dismissed athletics as ``a way of proving
you're better than someone else at something that's of no use to
anybody.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was a sense of humor that came in handy during his later
career as designated apologist for Dublin's municipal government.
As Dublin Corp.'s first official spokesman, Carroll relished his
role of defending government decisions that inevitably stepped on
someone's toes.
</P>
<P>
   If it was sometimes a thankless task, Carroll maintained his
credibility in part by bluntly speaking his mind, sometimes to the
point of insensitivity. When a 1986 hurricane, for example, flooded
some low-lying homes, Carroll, feeling that the wails of the
afflicted had risen above the water line, was not as sympathetic as
he could have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who live by the river,'' he said, ``should expect to
get their feet wet now and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his public career, Carroll maintained his athletic
visibility by writing extensively about running and physical
fitness, and by serving as mentor and even coach to young runners.
</P>
<P>
   In time he grew a bit sheepish about his role in steering native
talent out of the country, and for the last several years he had
sought to stem the flow by coaching the track team at University
College in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, who is survived by his wife, Deirdre O'Callaghan, a
singer and harpist, and by four children and five grandchildren,
maintained his high spirits to the end.
</P>
<P>
   The night before his death he was in his element, mingling with
1,000 guests at the Chamber of Commerce's annual dinner.

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   During a recent visit to our daughter and her family, my husband
and I were in charge of our three grandchildren for a day. At the
supper table that evening, the children decided to talk about what
they had done during the day. Twelve-year-old Samantha said that in
school they had discussed the possibility of the president's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's impeachment?'' asked 7-year-old Jake.
</P>
<P>
   Couching my reply in terms I thought he would understand, I
answered that when the president does something wrong, he is told
that he cannot be president any more.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice filled with disbelief, Jake exclaimed: ``You mean he
smoked?''

   Getting out late from my facial treatment, I hurried to hail a
taxi and planned to apply my makeup en route. When I realized that
I had forgotten to bring along a mirror, I asked the driver if he
had one. He said he didn't but that I could come up front and use
the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   When I hesitated, he offered to turn the rearview mirror so that
I could use it when he stopped for red lights. We agreed, and at
the next light he stopped and turned the mirror for me to use. I
leaned forward and applied my makeup.
</P>
<P>
   When the light turned green, he readjusted the mirror and so we
continued the process until we arrived at my destination. I thanked
him, and when he looked at me to collect the fare, he said, ``It
did make a difference!''

   Participants: A homeless man and a homeless woman, both familiar
to riders of the train.

   Observer: David M. Richman.

   Action: The homeless man is ready to tell his story of personal
woe. As he is about to begin, the homeless woman steps into the
car. They both stop, aware of each other's presence.

   ``That's OK,'' the homeless man says. ``The car is yours.''

   Beware of opera buffs offering directions. Walking on Broadway
at 68th Street, Carl Bowman overheard a young man asking a woman
for the location of Latraviata, a pizzeria where he was apparently
scheduled to meet someone. In true New York fashion, Bowman stood
by, ready to offer a second opinion, and when the woman said she
didn't know the location, Bowman spoke up _ Columbus Avenue, just
above 69th Street, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The young man took off at high speed. Bowman then realized that
Latraviata was just down the block. He had directed the man to the
Rigoletto pizzeria.

   I recently rushed down to the token booth at the Lexington
Avenue side of Grand Central Terminal, handed the clerk a $20 bill
and asked her to add $15 to my Metrocard. Then I raced through the
turnstile to catch the downtown train.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway to 14th Street, I realized I hadn't received the $5
change. What to do? Forget about it? Possibly, but why, I asked
myself. Go back later in the day? Right. Who would remember a
transaction of that morning?
</P>
<P>
   I decided to give customer service a shot. Turns out it was a
nice experience. The MTA was really going to try and get my money
back. But that is not the story.
</P>
<P>
   When I passed the token booth the next morning, I noticed the
same clerk on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' I said, wondering what my inquiry would evoke. ``You may
recall I forgot to take my $5 in change yesterday morning.'' I
never got a chance to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I tried to call you, but you were already through the
turnstile and down the stairs,'' she said. She pushed a $5 bill
through the slot. ``Have a nice day,'' she said. I did.

   Adele S. Greene was browsing through Crate &AMP; Barrel with a

Grandma,'' the voice said, ``it's always nice to talk to you.''
Curious, she turned around to see the enthusiastic youngster. What

   Karen DeCrow flew to Chicago earlier this month for the Art

She was standing in front of the colorful painting ``Portrait of a

both modern and prosperous. One said to the other, ``If she were
reading The Wall Street Journal, she wouldn't look so happy.''

   Leo Ladman's mother, in her late 80s, was fearful of crossing

spotted a penny, then another, then a dime and finally a nickel. A
good Samaritan saw her picking up the coins and pressed three crisp
dollar bills into her hand, insisting, despite her demurral, that
she take the money. Her son wonders if she could be on to
something.

NOSTALGIA FOR A PALACE OF DEPRESSION JUNK
</HEADLINE>

   VINELAND, N.J. _ Picture, if indeed you can, the kind of castle
Dr. Seuss might have built had he moonlighted on a Chevrolet
assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoonish spires of hand-packed muck rise ludicrously over prim
New England gables while iron bedsteads stand as gates in front of
auto-fender archways. Doors are made from baby cribs, walls from
bricks and bottle caps. In every corner, the scraps of industry are
pressed into the service of its maker's dream.
</P>
<P>
   The dreamer was George Daynor, a former gold prospector from the
Klondike, and his unusual vision was a mansion of junk called the
Palace of Depression. With just $4 in his pocket, Daynor left
Alaska in 1929, hitchhiked to Vineland and bought an auto dump.
From the scrap parts, he built a home of struts and rubber bumpers
and named it after the economic calamity that beset the nation.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 people visited Daynor's temple of trash before
the city razed it after his death in 1964. But if the axle bits and
lug nuts that made up the place have long since disappeared, the
plucky spirit that it represents remains. And now, in a starry-eyed
but serious effort to put this sprawling farm community on the
tourist map again, city officials here have begun a plan to rebuild
the Palace of Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all that remains of the once proud monument of junk is a
crumbling exterior wall and a lonely gazebo of stone and mud that
served for years as a ticket booth. But at its height, the Palace's
fame was so widespread that Universal Pictures made a short film
about it, ``The Fantastic Castle,'' and the Standard Oil Co. of New
Jersey included it on its Esso continental road maps.
</P>
<P>
   From New York City to southern Pennsylvania, headlines blared.
``Builds Palace Out of Old Junk'' and ``Transforms Swamp Tract Into
Paradise,'' they read.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its heyday, it was a huge tourist attraction, nationally
known,'' said Kevin Kirchner, Vineland's director of licenses and
inspections, who has undertaken the restoration effort. ``I'm
hoping that once we rebuild the place, it'll actually bring more
people into town.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Kirchner has set in motion a plan to build a
detailed replica of the original, reconstructing each and every
goofy ornament, from the chimney made of mud flaps to the
wagon-axle hearth. He plans to bring back Daynor's Knockout Room,
where its builder jokingly offered to help those still suffering
from their own depressions by dropping a 10-pound weight on their
heads to batter them back to their senses.
</P>
<P>
   Since this summer, Kirchner has hired an architect, an engineer
and several archeologists to help plan for the restoration. Now he
is trying to raise the $400,000 he estimates it will cost to bring
the Palace back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Besides money, however, the biggest obstacle is where to find
the perfect junk. But like Daynor himself, Kirchner plans to use
whatever materials are at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have body and fender guys standing by,'' he said. ``And I
have welders, too, if we can't find the stuff in a junkyard and
have to make it ourselves. I figure the Cub Scouts can go out
searching for tortoise shells and seashells.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the cornfields and tomato patches about 30 miles south of
Philadelphia, Vineland is the sort of close-knit city where parking
regulations are routinely ignored and everyone knows your name.
With such small-town sociability, the Palace of Depression
maintains an almost mythic grip on the minds of local residents,
many of whom recall touring it as children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about 5 years old when my parents first took me through
it,'' Kirchner said. ``I had nightmares for weeks. But later, as a
building inspector, I was always curious how the man managed to
build that thing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In ``The Fantastic Castle,'' Daynor comes across as a gnomish
man, bearded and burly, who is more than pleased to lead visitors
through his prized possession. He is eccentric, voluble and
charming, and obviously loves to lecture to the movie cameras.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Daynor was a notorious publicity hound, several
residents who knew him said, the sort of man who mailed greeting
cards to scores of newspaper reporters every Christmas with a
picture of the Palace and its builder.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his stranger public moments, in 1952, he accused two
agents of the Cuban government of ambushing him in a taxi outside
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and stealing back a suitcase filled with
the one million Cuban pesos he said he had just won in the Cuban
National Lottery. New York City detectives later said they had no
record of his presence in the city on the night he claimed the
theft occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, he was convicted of obstruction of justice and
jailed for a year for lying to federal agents investigating the
abduction of a 4-month-old Long Island boy, Peter Weinberger. In a
brazen publicity stunt, Daynor had told the agents that the
kidnappers had been to the Palace of Depression four days after the
baby disappeared, an utter lie. He had simply been following the
case in the newspaper and wanted to generate headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Like the original builder, Kirchner said he initially suffered
the ridicule of city officials. But in a recent interview, Mayor
Anthony Campanella said he was thrilled that the Palace of
Depression might come back to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're largely a farming community down here with a fairly
thriving glass industry,'' the mayor said, ``but outside that
there's really nothing for the tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Other small towns have managed to ignite their tourist
industries with off-kilter attractions. Vineland is hoping that the
Palace of Depression can attain the same sort of wacky acclaim
achieved by Cadillac Ranch, a half-dozen or so rusting Cadillacs
plunged hood-deep in the scrub grass off Interstate 40 in Amarillo,
Texas, or Carhenge, a life-sized replica of Stonehenge made from
junkers, which lies in a field off Federal Highway 385 two miles
north of Alliance, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of other people here share Kirchner's confidence that
the plan will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll rejuvenate our city and put us back on the map
internationally,'' said Cumberland County Sheriff James Forcinito,
who was born and raised in Vineland.

BOUNCING BACK KEY FOR BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first time, it was noteworthy. The second
time, a trend. Three times? Must be part of their personality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important ingredients to UCLA's 16-game winning
streak and No. 2 ranking is its resiliency _ its responses to
adverse playing conditions, to injuries and to momentum swings.
</P>
<P>
   The latter was critical to recent victories over Arizona, Oregon
and Cal. In each, UCLA (6-0, 4-0) responded to a second-half
touchdown by its opponent with a touchdown of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good a counterpunching offense as I've been
around,'' Bruins offensive coordinator Al Borges said. ``We've
reached a point where we don't expect to lose, and that's where you
want to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, our team has a lot of ebb and flow. We start the game
with two or three touchdowns, and all of a sudden we go on
autopilot for a while. Then we get kicked in the rear end and that
sets the machine in motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ``kicks'' often give UCLA's opponent the lead, always the
momentum. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   __ With six minutes left in the third quarter, Arizona took a
28-24 lead on Jeremy McDaniel's spectacular touchdown catch, a
full-extension dive that energized a sellout crowd (58,000) in
Arizona Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's response: DeShaun Foster returned the ensuing kickoff 45
yards, then Cade McNown directed a six-minute, 13-play touchdown
drive to give UCLA a 31-28 lead it never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   __ With 12 minutes remaining in the game, Oregon grabbed a 31-24
lead on Akili Smith's touchdown pass to Tony Hartley. The play
capped a 24-point Oregon rally and silenced 75,000 in the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's response: Keith Brown charged for 20 yards, McNown found
Brian Poli-Dixon on a 43-yard crossing pattern and Jermaine Lewis
scored from two yards. The 73-yard touchdown drive took all of two
minutes and it tied the game 31-31.
</P>
<P>
   __ With 36 seconds left in the third quarter, Cal quarterback
Justin Vedder hit Joel Young for a short touchdown pass that
trimmed UCLA's comfortable lead to a tenuous 21-16 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's response: Lewis returned the kickoff 32 yards, then two
minutes later threw a tailback option to freshman Jon Dubravac. The
30-yard touchdown pass extended UCLA's lead to 28-16, the final
score.
</P>
<P>
   Three games, three touchdowns, three victories. Average time of
scoring drive: 3:13.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a strong belief that it's going to win every
game, and that shows,'' offensive tackle Kris Farris said. ``Even
if we run a (tailback) option to a freshman wide receiver, we know
things will go in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins credit the 1996 USC game, in which they rallied from
a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit to win in double overtime, as the
birth of their resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   This season, they've responded at home and on the road, against
a high-powered offense (Oregon) and a punishing defense (Cal).
</P>
<P>
   They've responded with kickoff returns, long passes, running
plays and trick plays.
</P>
<P>
   They've responded with improvisation and with designed plays.
Lewis' pass to Dubravac was disguised a sweep to the right, which
UCLA had run three times earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set up, set up and then hit them,'' assistant coach Gary
Bernardi said. ``It's part philosophy and it's part the kids
responding. They respond very well to getting hit in the mouth.
They don't get complacent. They're confident and aggressive and
they keep enduring.''

great on the goal line. White and Ryan Nece combined for 19 tackles
_ not bad for second-year guys. Grade: A-

   __ Defensive backs: Cal's Dameane Douglas had 10 catches, but
the longest was meager 12 yards. Bruins might have found their
strong safety: redshirt freshman Jason Stephens. Grade: B+

Jermaine Lewis fumble: bad. Extra-point penalties: bad. Extra-point
kick from 45 yards: good. Grade: B-

<P>
   __ Coaching: With their playmakers hurting, Bruins distributed
the ball to supporting cast. Great call on trick play. Defensive
design (prohibit big plays) made Cal take tiny steps. Grade: A-

WITH PIAZZA IN THE FOLD, HUNDLEY PACKS UP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza is set to sign the most lucrative
contract in baseball history Monday afternoon. Left-hander Al
Leiter has apparently agreed to all but the fine print of a
four-year, $32 million deal that will probably be announced early
this week, according to one person familiar with the negotiations.
Now the question is, what becomes of Todd Hundley, the Mets' other
All-Star catcher?
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Mets General Manager Steve Phillips was still not
acknowledging that the Mets and Piazza had agreed to a seven-year
deal worth $91 million. But with Piazza and his representatives
apparently on their way to New York from Southern California, and
with those close to Piazza saying the deal was done, it has become
a foregone conclusion that Hundley will be playing elsewhere next
season.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Phillips acknowledged that a lineup with both
Piazza and Hundley would not be feasible next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a catcher, I'm not a left fielder,'' Hundley said late
Saturday night, alluding to his 34-game outfield stint this summer
that was an attempt to work both him and Piazza into the lineup.
``I'm not marketing myself as a left fielder. And there are teams
that need catching, obviously _ teams that I would love to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 teams Hundley will not be going to, thanks to a
limited trade clause he and the Mets agreed to after the Mets
obtained Piazza from the Marlins on May 22 while Hundley was still
recuperating from off-season elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, a friend said Monday, would like to go to a contending
team, would like to stay in the National League and would prefer to
stay on or near the East Coast. The teams his agreement prohibits
him from being traded to in the NL are the Expos, Marlins, Pirates
and Brewers. The teams he would allow a trade to in the American
League are the Yankees, Red Sox, Indians, Orioles, Rangers and
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   During the World Series, a number of teams asked Phillips about
the availability of Hundley, who hit a 41 homers, a major league
record for catchers, in 1996. The Cubs, Diamondbacks and Reds
appear to be the most interested.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the situation, Hundley does not appear angry with the
Mets, an organization he has been a part of since they picked him
in the second round of the 1987 free agent draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up in this organization,'' Hundley said, ``and Fred
Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday have taken care of myself and my family
financially for life. I have nothing but good things to say about
those people. They stuck with me through all those years. And I
realize this is a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley said he first realized his days with the Mets were
numbered on Memorial Day weekend, when he was having a meeting with
Wilpon at the co-owner's house. Wilpon admitted that he could not
bring a player like Piazza into a market like New York and not make
an effort to re-sign him. Wilpon, who has a close relationship with
Hundley, said at the time that even if it took $100 million to sign
Piazza, he would do it.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who is guaranteed $11.7 million the next two seasons,
said he then saw the writing on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Levinson, Hundley's agent, said: ``I absolutely believe
that Fred Wilpon and Steve Phillips have great respect and care
deeply for Todd Hundley. And over the course of the 1998 season,
Todd came to realize and accept that he is in a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley now hopes that the Mets respect him enough to trade him
to a contending team.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is little doubt the Mets would like to trade Hundley
before spring training begins. A deal could be made sometime
between the general managers' annual meetings next month and the
owners' meetings in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Mets may have made a deal to re-obtain Bobby
Bonilla from the Los Angeles Dodgers for reliever Mel Rojas. Even
though Bonilla left the Mets on less than favorable terms during
the 1995 season, Doubleday said he would have no problem with
Bonilla coming back. And one Mets executive said he felt Bonilla's
problems in New York had more to do with his relationship with the
news media than with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Mets do re-obtain Bonilla, however, seems to have
more to do with the Dodgers' apparent interest in San Diego
left-hander Randy Myers (who would render a trade for Rojas
superfluous) than with the Mets' reported insistence on including
second baseman Eric Young in the deal. One member of the Mets'
front office said this weekend that while the Mets had inquired
about Young's availability, it was not a prerequisite to a Bonilla
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, by signing Piazza, the Mets have demonstrated their
willingness to pay a large amount of money for the marquee player
they did not have at the beginning of last season. By doing so,
however, the Mets may have been bidding only against themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One baseball official said Sunday that the Mets may have outbid
other teams by as much as $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies were apparently prepared to offer the All-Star
catcher $60 million over four years. That is a reason Piazza's
representatives may have jumped at the Mets' seven-year offer after
less than a week of negotiations.

COMMENTARY: BIG CITY TRUE HEROISM IS SAYING NO TO UPSTATERS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you were writing an updated version of ``Profiles
in Courage,'' you would probably not plan especially long chapters
on either Sen. Alfonse D'Amato or Rep. Charles Schumer. But during
their race for the Senate, besides calling each other names, they
have presented New Yorkers with one shining moment of heroism.
</P>
<P>
   It appears in one of D'Amato's many television commercials
excoriating Schumer. The ad is titled ``Voted Against the Ice
Storm,'' which can be confusing at first because it sounds as if
Congress has taken to voting on the weather. You start wondering if
these votes are taken retrospectively (``Senate Censures Last
Week's Heat Wave'') or represent a new form of proactive government
(``In Compromise, House Votes for Partly Cloudy Skies Tomorrow'').
</P>
<P>
   But the fight, as usual, turns out to be about money: a bill
passed in Congress giving more than $25 million to upstate New York
farms and businesses that were hurt by an ice storm in January.
While D'Amato voted in favor of the aid, the commercial explains,
Schumer voted against it. ``Chuck Schumer votes for foreign aid for
countries like Mongolia,'' the outraged announcer declares over an
image of camels crossing a frozen tundra, ``but votes against
upstate New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has tried to excuse his action. He told reporters that
he voted against the bill only because it also cut money for
housing programs, and over the weekend his campaign broadcast ads
declaring his support for upstate disaster relief. But there's no
need for him to make excuses.
</P>
<P>
   He should be proud of his heroism. His vote gives hope to
taxpayers everywhere, especially those living in downstate New
York. It raises the first interesting question of the campaign: Why
do those upstate dairy farmers deserve our money any more than
Mongolian nomads do?
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible reason is that we have an obligation to fellow
citizens rendered helpless by a natural disaster beyond their
control. But why were these upstaters so unprepared for an ice
storm? The North Country's hardy souls are said to be guided by
traditional virtues and the timeless rhythms of nature. At some
point in their lives they must have noticed that, come January in
the Adirondacks, water has a tendency to freeze.
</P>
<P>
   True, January's storm was exceptionally severe, and the victims
obviously deserve sympathy for their losses. But severe storms were
a known risk of doing business in the Snow Belt, just as market
turbulence was a known risk for the brokers and secretaries on Wall
Street who have recently lost their jobs _ and aren't getting any
federal aid. As business risks go, bad weather is relatively simple
to prepare for with insurance and other precautions.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, though, Americans are no longer expected to
prepare for acts of nature. Why should New York's dairy farmers
plan for storms when most Californians refuse to buy earthquake
insurance, Midwesterners continue building businesses in flood
plains, and Floridians erect expensive homes on shores that are
regularly battered by hurricanes? They have all learned that if
anything goes wrong, politicians will race to the scene with
promises of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disaster aid has become one of the great tools for buying
votes and photo opportunities,'' said James Bovard, an adjunct
analyst with the Competitive Enterprise Institute who has tracked a
sharp increase in spending over the past decade. ``Since he took
office, President Clinton has set records by declaring disasters at
the rate of nearly one per week. The federal government has wasted
billions of dollars infantilizing Americans and given them all the
wrong incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades Americans have regarded New York City residents as
deadbeats _ a bunch of improvident grasshoppers begging for help
from the heartland's conscientious ants. Americans delighted
turning us down in our hour of need two decades ago, when The Daily
News ran its famous headline ``FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD.''
</P>
<P>
   But we're the ones with the foresight to live by one of the
world's most sheltered harbors, high above the waterline. Our
houses are not regularly endangered by mudslides, brush fires, or
tornadoes; our high-rises are anchored in bedrock that doesn't
routinely quake. Congested urban living poses its own risks _
fires, ruptured water mains, collapsing buildings, burglaries _ but
we buy insurance or absorb the losses ourselves. So when those
improvident upstaters come begging, we have the right to politely
demur:

   College football will officially embrace the computer age when
the Bowl Championship Series ranking is released for the first time
Monday and another prefix is added to the alphabet soup of polls
and calculations already in place to determine the best team in the
land.
</P>
<P>
   There is The Associated Press Poll representing the news media
vote; the ESPN/USA Today poll, which tallies the coaches' votes;
and, of course, there is The New York Times computer ranking, which
often seems to represent unfashionable thinking. This week, the
Times' ranking puts Texas at No. 18 _ defying both the news media
types and field generals who have left them out of their Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the BCS ranking. It's mission is simple: to insure
that the No. 1 team faces the No. 2 team in a national title game,
this year at the Fiesta Bowl. Its methodology, though, is anything
but simple. The BCS ranking will be compiled by averaging the three
aforementioned rankings with two other computer rankings, putting a
numerical value on strength of schedule and factoring in a team's
number of losses.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the whole formula rattles the human hardware.
But strip away the high-tech vernacular and what is left is an
argument that has been raging on barstools since the days of
leather helmets. Who is No. 1? Who have they played? Who is second
best?
</P>
<P>
   Now, how to determine that?
</P>
<P>
   The BCS ranking has decided on decimal points and data. The
better way is to analyze defenses and game dates. Last year, the
co-national champions, Michigan and Nebraska, had the first- and
fifth-best defenses in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, each of the five remaining contenders for the
national title won. Ohio State (7-0) beat Northwestern, 36-10, and
U.C.L.A. (6-0) bested California, 28-16, to remain No. 1 and No. 2
in the news media and coaches polls.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be surprised when Monday's BCS ranking moves the
Bruins ahead of the Buckeyes, as the Times computer did this
weekend. UCLA opponents are a combined 27-10. Ohio State's are
27-15 as a result of a down year in the Big Ten and Saturday's
losses by West Virginia and Missouri _ both early-season victims of
the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State has held its last four opponents to 80 yards rushing
or less, has the nation's No. 2-ranked defense (giving up 229.1
yards a game) and has only one true test left _ Michigan on Nov.
21.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA finishes the year with Washington, crosstown rival Southern
Cal and then Miami on Dec. 5 in a game that was postponed because
of Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like a gunslinger,'' UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said.
``Everybody is out to get us. We have to be ready. There's
pressure, but I'd rather have that than the alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that he would like to have a defense better than the
one ranked 91st in the nation and yielding a whopping 408 yards a
game. Twice, the Bears moved inside the UCLA 2-yard line, but the
Bruins managed to force a turnover and make a goal-line stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense rose to the occasion,'' said Toledo, who has
privately challenged his players to quit testing the fates _
especially after a 41-38 overtime victory last week against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The two other highly rated unbeaten teams continued their
winning ways: Tennessee (6-0) beat Alabama, 35-18, and Kansas State
(7-0) beat Iowa State, 52-7. The Vols remain No. 3 in the news
media poll and are ranked No. 4 by the coaches; the Wildcats are
No. 4 with the writers and broadcasters and No. 3 with the coaches.
The Times ranking, again a precursor to the BCS, moved Tennessee
ahead of Kansas State on strength of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kansas State appears to be the stronger of the two. The
Wildcats lead the nation in scoring defense, averaging 8.1 points a
game, and are fourth in total defense. However, Kansas State has to
do what it hasn't been able to for 29 years: beat Nebraska on Nov.
14. If that happens, the Wildcats have to beat Texas A&AMP;M (No. 7 in
the Times ranking) in the Big 12 championship game. That didn't
look as if it would be difficult while the Aggies were losing their
opener to Florida State. But they have since won seven straight,
including a decisive thumping of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   What can you say about the Vols? They have beaten good teams in
Syracuse, Georgia and Florida _ though it took overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to fight for every win, four of the five at least,''
Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer said. ``We have to continue to do
that, continue to fly around, make plays and tackle well.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's only remaining ranked opponent is unbeaten Arkansas
(10th in the Times ranking). The Volunteers may have to beat the
Razorbacks twice _ on Nov. 14 and perhaps again in the Southeastern
Conference championship game. A bigger hump, however, may be Tim
Couch and Kentucky. The Vols, who play Kentucky on Nov. 21, are
60th in the nation in pass defense and have given up 119 points in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is once-beaten Florida State, which is poised to
pick up the pieces when any, or all, of the four higher-ranked
teams lose. By whipping Georgia Tech, 34-7, the Seminoles moved up
to No. 5 in the AP poll. They boast a stronger opponents' record _
32-19 _ than those ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles have games left against Florida and Virginia _
both in all polls' top 15. But more important, they have the best
defense in the country, giving up just 212.3 yards a game. After
giving up an 18-play, 80-yard touchdown drive to the Yellow Jackets
in the first quarter, they held a team that averages more than 40
points a game to just 67 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Seminoles lost early in the year to Notre Dame
before running the table and winning the national championship. In
the beginning of the year, Coach Bobby Bowden insisted one loss
wouldn't eliminate a team from the title game. He's betting a
top-ranked defense can overcome more than decimal points and data.
``You're playing now for No. 2,'' he said of the BCS ranking. ``You
just got to get to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if he does.

FIRE ENDS DC UNITED'S TWO-YEAR REIGN IN MLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Talk of a major-league soccer dynasty died
Sunday afternoon when the expansion Chicago Fire ended DC United's
two-year reign with a 2-0 victory in the MLS Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which had lost its games against United this season by
3-1 and 4-1, became the first expansion team in a major sport in
modern history to capture a championship in its first year. And it
sent United coach Bruce Arena off to his new job as coach of the
American national team on a sour note. Arena's new post will be
officially announced on Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt from the beginning that we had a unique team, and I
started to feel that we'd compete for the championship,'' said Fire
coach Bob Bradley, who was Arena's top assistant when United
captured the first two MLS championships. ``For me to play against
DC United in the final meant a great deal, because United set the
standards in the league the first three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena said: ``Chicago played well and deserve to be champions. I
don't want to sound like sour grapes about the officiating, but
we're disappointed at the controversial calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena and others from DC United claimed that Chicago's goals
were from offside positions, and they complained that the referee,
Kevin Terry, should have called a penalty kick against Chicago on a
play involving United's Marco Etcheverry before the game was 5
minutes old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breaks went our way today,'' Bradley said, ``but I thought
we played well for a championship game. Some of our players had an
excellent game, from our goalkeeper to defense to midfield to
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's team came up with the kind of performance that wins
championship games. Chicago was very well organized on defense, got
brilliant goalkeeping from Zach Thornton and counterattacked
effectively. And Chris Armas did a marvelous job of neutralizing
Etcheverry, the league's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nowak assisted on both goals, by Jerzy Podbrozny in the
29th minute and Diego Gutierrez at the stroke of halftime, and was
named the game's most valuable player. On both goals Chicago
players appeared to be offside, especially Ante Razov on the second
goal, but Terry and his two assistants did not make a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the opinion of the referee,'' Terry said in a statement,
``Razov, while in an offside position, did not interfere with the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowak was a threat every time Chicago gained possession around
midfield. He avoided the shadowing of Richie Williams by roaming
various parts of the field, especially up and down the left flank.
He often cut into the middle when necessary, and he forced United's
defenders to move out of their positions, thus opening space for
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Armas, another of Chicago's indefatigable midfielders, said that
the 34-year-old Nowak's work rate ``is unbelievable for his age,''
adding, ``He surprises us all the time with his energy and his
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowak created the first goal with a patented run down the left
flank, on a play that started with Gutierrez passing to Lubos
Kubik, the lanky sweeper from the Czech Republic. The ball went
from Kubik to Razov to Nowak, for a low pass across the 6-yard line
to Podbrozny for the finish.
</P>
<P>
   The second goal was all Nowak's work. Getting the ball down the
left flank, he cut into the middle, avoided two defenders and took
a shot. Razov was clearly in an offside position when Nowak's shot
was deflected into the goal by Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very special day for me because I never won a
championship,'' said Nowak, who is from Poland and who played in
the German league before going to Chicago. ``We did some good
things at 1860 Munich, but we never won it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago focused on defense for most of the second half, allowing
United to control play. The Fire was solid near its penalty area,
and Thornton was in complete command.
</P>
<P>
   When Thornton parried Roy Lassiter's header with 15 minutes
left, United's players grabbed their heads, knowing, perhaps, that
Chicago's goal was impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pushed,'' said John Harkes, one of the few United players
who performed effectively, ``but Chicago handled our pressure
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said: ``The soccer community will react in a great way
to this championship. People like to cheer for new teams.''

TROJANS ARE CONSERVATIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moments after USC's narrow loss to Oregon, a
school official lamented how close the Trojans are to being 7-1
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're two field goals and a safety away,'' he said, referring
to the two short, missed field goals in the first quarter of
Saturday's 17-13 loss to Oregon, and the safety allowed in the
32-31 loss to California.
</P>
<P>
   USC (5-3, 3-2) would probably be ranked in the top 10 today and
talking about its Rose Bowl chances if it had won those two games.
But even with those on-field miscues, USC might be 7-1 if a couple
of different decisions had been made from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   One could only imagine the sighs of relief breathed by Oregon's
coaches when USC decided to kick a field goal from the 8-yard line
with 4:18 left in the game and the Trojans trailing 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   It was another conservative decision that ended up haunting the
Trojans. The first was when USC elected to kick a field goal at the
end of the first half against Cal with the ball on the 1-yard line.
By playing it safe, the Trojans have been left to wonder ``What
if...'' following both losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``At five minutes (to play), you can go either way,'' USC coach
Paul Hackett said about the decision to kick the field goal. ``If
it had been under five yards, we'd have gone after it.... Maybe
next time I'd do it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's been a disappointing aspect to the Cal and Oregon
losses, it's that the Trojans don't seem to have a go-for-broke
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hackett has acknowledged the talent level is not what
he had hoped, USC seems to play the percentages in tight games as
though the opponents were Ohio State or Florida State. With an
offense that is still anemic eight games into the season, there's
little reason to settle for field goals when you need touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Another lingering problem is the length of time it takes to get
offensive plays into the huddle. USC lost a game-tying touchdown
against Oregon because of a delay-of-game penalty. Quarterback
Carson Palmer should have seen the 25-second clock winding down,
but the freshman had been forced to sprint to the huddle because it
took so long for the play to be signaled in from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   These delays are baffling, because Hackett calls the plays. With
his reputation as an offensive coordinator, it would seem unlikely
there is uncertainty over any play.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is the muddled quarterback situation. Palmer's
continuing emergence is making it more difficult to justify simply
bringing him off the bench. He played more than starter Mike Van
Raaphorst against Oregon and appears comfortable running the team.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hackett has resisted making a change, using Palmer for
the majority of a game has ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst had completed five straight passes when he was
pulled against Oregon. He doesn't have the arm or elusiveness of
Palmer, so he'll never be the type of quarterback to provide a
spark off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   He either needs to start or stay on the sideline. If nothing
else, he's probably lost a fair amount of confidence from the quick
hooks he got against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   It might finally be time to stick with one quarterback, whoever
it is. Is anyone else wondering what happens next year when Jason
Thomas is healthy? Maybe the Trojans will try a three-quarterback
rotation. &QL;

`PLEASANTVILLE' AT HOME IN TOP SPOT FOR WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The nation's moviegoers journeyed to
``Pleasantville'' over the weekend as the fantasy-comedy edged
``Practical Magic'' for first place at the nation's box office with
an estimated $9 million at 1,652 theaters during Friday-Sunday,
studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The New Line release, with Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon
as '90s teens transported into the world of a '50s sitcom, opened
with generally positive reviews and a months-long marketing push
with hundreds of advance screenings to build prerelease buzz. New
Line marketing chief Mitch Goldman said ``Pleasantville'' carries
enough momentum to play well into holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this weekend won't go down in the record books,
this film is not a two- or three-weeker,'' Goldman said. ``Because
of the strong word-of-mouth, we expect `Pleasantville' to be around
for a long time and play into Academy Awards season.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said ``Pleasantville'' had performed up to
expectations, particularly since it was released during what is
usually a slow period for moviegoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of year when you see specialty films like
`Pleasantville' trying to cross over to the mainstream,'' said
Arthur Rockwell of Drake &AMP; Co. ``It's not just luck; there really
is a science to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, called the ``Pleasantville'' opening ``very solid'' and
said it could take in $55 million by the end of its run.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' second weekend of ``Practical Magic'' finished a
close second with $8.8 million at 2,652 theaters as the Sandra
Bullock comedy-romance continued its solid performance despite a
spate of negative reviews. ``This movie is drawing the date crowd,
which is not the type of viewer that listens much to critics,''
Bucksbaum noted.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell pointed out that ``Practical Magic,'' with nearly $26
million after 10 days, has been well-timed to coincide with the
Halloween season. ``Warner has to be happy with how well this has
performed since it was something of a risky project,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' marched onward, remaining in third with a still-strong
$8.2 million at 2,929 sites in its fourth weekend, dropping only 27
percent from its previous Friday-Sunday. The DreamWorks SKG release
has drawn $61.8 million in 24 days and will go past ``Beavis and
Butt-head Do America's'' $63.1 million record this week as the top
non-Disney animated film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's not too much else in theaters for families,
so `Antz' should keep doing well for a while,'' said studio
distribution chief James Tharp.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming challenges will come from Warner's re-release of ``The
Wizard of Oz'' on Nov. 6, Disney's ``I'll Be Home for Christmas''
on Nov. 13 and a pair opening on Nov. 20 -- Disney's ``A Bug's
Life'' and Paramount's ``Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal's second weekend of ``Bride of Chucky'' finished
fourth with $6.4 million at 2,445 theaters, edging Warner's
moderate opening of ``Soldier,'' starring Kurt Russell as a warrior
of the future, with $6.3 million at 2,507 sites.
</P>
<P>
   New Line's comedy hit ``Rush Hour'' continued to draw well in
sixth with $6 million at 2,602 theaters, giving it $117.5 million
after 38 days. It is now the 118th highest domestic grosser after
``Basic Instinct'' and should hit the $135 million mark by the end
of its run.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's second weekend of ``Beloved'' continued to perform
below expectations in seventh with $4.2 million at 1,507 theaters
as it lost nearly half its audience from the opening Friday-Sunday.
``It's a very noncommercial movie,'' said Rockwell of the drama,
starring Oprah Winfrey as a runaway slave.
</P>
<P>
   PolyGram's fourth weekend of ``What Dreams May Come'' finished
eighth with $4 million at 2,274 sites to beat Sony's disappointing
opening of ``Apt Pupil,'' starring Ian McKellan as a Nazi war
criminal pursued by a high school student, with $3.6 million at
1,448 theaters. Paramount's fourth weekend of ``A Night at the
Roxbury'' rounded out the top 10 with $2.4 million at 1,993
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Two art-house entries performed poorly. Miramax's widened
release of family drama ``The Mighty'' grossed a minuscule $700,000
at 518 theaters despite strong reviews and high recommendations
from moviegoers; October's ``Orgazmo,'' Trey Parker's comedy about
a preacher turned porno star, was nearly invisible with $218,000 at
100 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business continued to defy the season's traditional
slowdown in moviegoing with about $70 million, up 7 percent from
the same weekend last year. Year-to-date business is around $5.4
billion, 10 percent ahead of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Studios will keep issuing high-profile releases next weekend,
including New Line's romantic comedy ``Living Out Loud,'' with
Holly Hunter; Sony's ``John Carpenter's Vampires,'' with James
Woods; and New Line's ``American History X,'' in a drama about
bigotry that has been disavowed by director Tony Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   Final figures for this weekend will be released today.

FOR AN IDLE NBA PLAYER, THE BILLS OF THE GOOD LIFE PILE UP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two months after the National Basketball Association's lockout
came and his paycheck went, Kenny Anderson began contemplating the
unthinkable. It had nothing to do with asking his mother in Queens
for his old room back or taking a part-time security job; He
figured there are only so many indignities young millionaires
should have to face.
</P>
<P>
   But with his penchant for buying what he wanted and his
accountant having to borrow against his stocks to keep investing,
Anderson realized it may be time to do without. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about selling one of my cars,'' he said
recently, laughing. ``I don't need all of them. You know, just get
rid of the Mercedes.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he can always fall back on the Carrera Porsche, the
customized Range Rover or the Lexus sedan. When you have eight
vehicles registered in your name or your wife's, there are choices.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance alone on the cars and sport utility vehicles has been
costing Anderson about $75,000 a year. Throw in a mortgage in New
York, rent in Los Angeles, four daughters, one marketing company,
an agent's cut and endless legal fees, and a rough portfolio of the
veteran NBA player begins to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   He is often fabulously wealthy, but sometimes the opulent
lifestyle collides with a monstrous tax bracket. Tremendous
financial obligations mount quickly, which can sometimes lead to
economic insecurity for even some of the game's highest-paid
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people can't understand why the owners and players
are fighting over money and how it might hurt the season,'' said
Anderson, referring to the league's growing labor chasm. ``I'd be
upset too if I was a fan, paying our salaries. But it's like they
say: The more you make, the more you spend. And right now, without
my check, I have to start getting tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the 28-year-old point guard of the Boston Celtics, was
due his entire $5.8 million salary for the 1998-99 season on July 1
_ the day NBA owners declared a lockout after the collective
bargaining agreement expired.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of more than 20 players who were supposed to get paid
during the summer but did not, and one of 226 players with
guaranteed contracts who will not be paid for the first two weeks
of the season, which were canceled on Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   More cancellations may follow, and if more than 30 games are cut
from the 82-game schedule, the league will strongly consider not
playing the season. The NBA hopes that the financial pressure this
will place on the players will eventually divide them and prompt
the union to sign an agreement that slows the growth of salaries
and puts a ceiling on how much one player can earn.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of how severely the players' resolve will be
tested, Anderson is losing $76,000 a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to miss the season, not just for financial
reasons but losing a year of my playing career,'' said Anderson, a
seven-year veteran. ``But if I had to, I can. I've been without
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy I feel bad for is the one with the two- or three-year
deal and now their contract is up. In that case, I think people
will have their own agendas. It's going to be sticky. There might
be some guys branching off, saying, `I can't do this.' Not being in
their situation, I can't blame them. When that happens, everyone
will go, `Oh, he's selling out.' But, hey, you got to live.'' Scott
Bercu, Anderson's Manhattan-based accountant, said, ``These guys
have got to concede for a very simple reason: They're losing money
every time they don't play a game.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to players like Anderson who at least are under
contract even if they are not being paid, there are nearly 200
registered free agents who have some of the same bills that
Anderson has. Having signed a seven-year deal worth $49 million
with the Portland Trail Blazers two years ago, Anderson is in a
much better position than many of his peers. His contract average
of $7 million a year does not compare with Michael Jordan's $33
million deal, but his annual income dwarfs the league's average
salary of $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the cash-flow problem is the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to sell some mutual funds and borrow against stocks
to keep investing,'' Anderson said. ``I've got enough to hold me
over. And I definitely don't want anyone feeling sorry for me. I
mean, when you make money like we do, it's pretty hard to get
public sympathy. But it's all relative to your lifestyle and
obligations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his midtown Manhattan office, Bercu punches up Anderson's
finances on a computer screen. In a blink, you learn that playing
basketball for a living does not only guarantee you celebrity and
wealth; there are mounds of checks to sign, too.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, his wife, Tami Akbar, and their two daughters, Lyric,
4, and Kenni, 2, live in a five-bedroom home in Beverly Hills, not
far from Shaquille O'Neal's mansion. The peach pastel house has
large pillars, a four-car garage and a gazebo in the backyard. Two
stories below are a pool and tennis and basketball courts. The
monthly rent is $12,500.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson pays $7,200 in monthly child support for Danielle, 8,
and Kristinise, 5, who were born to different women. He has been
involved in each child's life as much as he can be during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can burn a hole in your pocket real quick,'' he said.
``I'm not saying it in a funny way, but you've got your schooling,
day care, nanny. It just goes on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also pays $3,000 a month on mortgage, property taxes
and maintenance for his mother's home on Long Island. Of the $5.8
million he is supposed to receive this year, the agent David Falk,
who negotiated the contract, is entitled to 4 percent _ $232,000.
Bercu said Anderson's legal and accounting fees run about $175,000
annually.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Kenny the Kid Enterprises, Anderson's
fledgling marketing company based in Century City, Calif., which at
this point does not bring in as much money as it shells out. Run by
his longtime friend Rodney Henry, the company exists essentially to
handle all of Anderson's day-to-day operations and appearances. A
clothing line is in its infant stages. The company also books
musical talent for outlets such as BET (Black Entertainment
Television) and helps further the acting career of Anderson's wife,
who has done commercials and was once a regular on MTV's ``Real
World.''
</P>
<P>
   With teams unable to provide daily public-relations assistance
to every player, and with agents like Falk too burdened with other
prominent clients to concentrate on promotion, many players are
hiring or developing their own marketing firms. The cost for five
employees, office space, supplies and telephone for Kenny the Kid
runs $250,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny doesn't live a life of Riley; he doesn't have unlimited
money,'' Bercu said. ``Without many shelters and at such a high tax
rate, he's literally a partner with the government. Of the $5.8
million, I'd say he probably sees about $3 million of that money.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he used to give family members and friends loans
of $3,000 to $5,000, but he has stopped doing that since the
lockout began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get tight,'' he said. ``I've cut back on certain
things I usually do. You got to watch your money when it comes to
family. I have to say no now even though I don't want to say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Bercu said: ``He calls them loans, but I call them gifts. He's
too generous and sweet sometimes for his own good. Especially when
it's family. But then, when you come from where he came from ...''
</P>
<P>
   A New York schoolboy legend at Archbishop Molloy High School in
Queens, Anderson has played for four teams the last three seasons.
Once regarded as an heir apparent to the NBA career assist leader
John Stockton, Anderson has weathered injury and expectation while
settling into a role of a solid playmaker the last several seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If his career lasts more than 10 years, he will be among the
league's fortunate players.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life is really a short-lived life from a financial point
of view,'' Bercu said. ``One of the things I do for Kenny is invest
for him, so I rely on money coming in to set aside long-term
savings. Before the lockout began, we started borrowing against his
stocks. We're talking a substantial loan. And then with the losses
in the market. You know they're going to rebound. Still, for a lot
of these guys without their salary checks, it's a bit of a
nightmare situation. If he doesn't get paid soon ...''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is not clipping coupons yet. A rough estimate of his
total financial obligations, not including personal expenses, runs
about $1 million annually, leaving him with $2 million in reserve.
Anderson is allotted $10,000 a month by Bercu, ``hanging-out
money,'' as he likes to call it. Tami gets $3,500 from a special
household account.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite car is his 1995 Mercedes SL 500 metallic red sedan
_ one of eight vehicles in a price range between $50,000 and
$120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those cars are extremely hard to insure,'' Bercu said.
``Because of a couple of speeding tickets, we've had lots of
difficulties. But what can you do? Ballplayers are into cars and
jewelry. It's what they like. You can't help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Extravagant and expensive tastes have been a hallmark of young
millionaire athletes. But without games and paychecks, NBA players
are about to learn the frugal side of living large. How long many
of them can cope without a biweekly salary may mean the difference
in their economic game of chicken with the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look at it as when this thing finally gets done, I get
my money,'' Anderson said.

IN GOVERNOR'S RACE, DEBATING ABOUT DEBATING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He has said repeatedly that he wants to debate, plans
to debate and hopes to debate. But just nine days before the
election, Gov. George Pataki has yet to actually commit to a debate
against his Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone. Pataki has said
only that their campaigns are working on the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The latest invitation to Pataki came Sunday, as Gabe Pressman of
WNBC-TV wrapped up the debate between Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep.
Charles Schumer. Pressman, the moderator, said that the station had
invited the governor and Vallone, the only statewide candidates who
have not debated yet, to do so next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that in the interests of the voters, both candidates
for governor will be here,'' Pressman said. ``That is, they'll show
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has said that he will, but it is far from certain what
Pataki will do.
</P>
<P>
   John Sparks, who handles WNBC-TV's political coverage, said that
Pataki's campaign manager, Zenia Mucha, told him Sunday that the
governor had another engagement the next Sunday. If Pataki did not
appear, Sparks said, Vallone would be given half an hour of
broadcasting time.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Mucha said Sunday that the campaign had not yet decided
about the debate. ``We haven't ruled anything in and we haven't
ruled anything out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she was waiting for, Ms. Mucha said: ``We've made it
perfectly clear that a debate should consist of a discussion of the
issues important to the state. Vallone has failed to demonstrate
that he has any knowledge of or interest in those issues.
Misrepresentations and personal attacks have been the mainstay of
his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha said that if Vallone ceased those attacks, debates
would be scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Vallone, did not respond to Ms.
Mucha's contention that Vallone had been on the attack. He made his
own attack: ``George Pataki has spent this entire campaign ducking
subpoenas, ducking debates, ducking reality and there's no end in
sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, speaker of the New York City Council, has said that he
will debate the governor at any time, in any place, in any format
amenable to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that we put a very gracious and
reasonable and responsible offer on the table and they have never
responded to it after the initial response, which was that they
would look at it,'' said Kevin McCabe, Vallone's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's campaign said that including the WNBC invitation,
Vallone had received 13 invitations to debate from television
stations and other organizations across the state. Those
invitations have gone to the governor as well. The Rev. Al Sharpton
also said Sunday that he would arrange an hourlong radio forum for
the candidates to debate issues affecting black New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate,
nor Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Liberal Party candidate, has
been invited to join most of the debates, including the one on
WNBC-TV.

BIG DECISION AWAITS BIG SKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most of the issues on the agenda are
administrative mumbo-jumbo, boring details. But there is one
intriguing thing the athletic directors will talk about next week
at the Big Sky Conference meetings in Ogden, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   It's what to do with the conference basketball tournaments that
are sandwiched between the regular season and the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at survey results that we have,'' Big Sky
commissioner Doug Fullerton said. ``It had to do with the format
and the winner (of the regular season) hosting.''Most coaches don't
like the regular-season league leader hosting the tournament,
because a site might not be determined until a week before the
tournament begins. That can kill attendance, as can a host team
being knocked out in the first or second rounds.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the schools aren't in favor of a predetermined
rotating site because it winds up costing the host too much.
Fullerton said only Weber State, Montana and Montana State have the
ability to turn a profit by hosting the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to create excitement for the tournament, but usually
the Big Sky only gets one team in the NCAA Tournament,'' Fullerton
said. ``The goal should be to protect your best team.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference could opt to hold the tournament at a neutral
site, and Cal State Northridge men's coach Bobby Braswell has a few
in mind: Sacramento, Salt Lake City, Phoenix or perhaps the new
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have the site ahead of time, people have a year's time
to start planning to buy tickets,'' Braswell said. ``I think if you
do it in the right place, you can (draw) people to it. It gives
people a chance to fly in and it will be a relatively inexpensive
plane flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really bother me, I would be really, really
concerned, if the league went in the way of deciding that two or
three schools could make money, so that would be where they had the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also being discussed on the women's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what's at stake, it makes sense to have it at a neutral
site,'' CSUN women's coach Michael Abraham said. ``It's not the
Pac-10, where five teams are going to go (to the NCAA Tournament).
If one team is going to go it should be at a neutral site.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Women's update: Despite having only four practices to build
on, the CSUN women's basketball team brought in some officials and
had a scrimmage Friday. And amidst the turnovers and sometimes
sloppy play, Abraham liked one thing he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of intensity was exceptionally high, which is
unusual,'' Abraham said. ``Because it's so competitive for spots
and playing time on our team, it was played at game-like intensity,
which made me happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we lacked (last year) was 40 minutes of
intensity. We played in spurts. One of the reasons I've gone to
longer practices is to force our team into the situation where they
have to deal with the fatigue so we don't have those lulls.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Big game approaching: The Matadors' women's soccer team will
play a huge game Friday at Northern Arizona. It will be the
regular-season finale, but it might not be the women's final game.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (6-12, 3-3 Big Sky) could sneak into the four-team Big Sky
tournament with a win, which could go a long way in determining
whether coach Brian Wiesner returns for a fifth season with the
Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN and Northern Arizona (7-9, 3-3) are tied for fourth place
in the league. Sacramento State, which was 7-7, 2-3 heading into
Sunday's game with Montana, is also in the picture for the fourth
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   __ Baseball commitment: CSUN baseball coach Mike Batesole said
he wanted to sign ``three to six'' players during the November
signing period, and he got his first oral committment.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed pitcher Bill Murphy of Arlington High in Riverside
told the CSUN coaching staff he would attend the school next year.
NCAA rules prohibit Batesole from talking about Murphy prior to
signing his national letter of intent.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: NOW THE UNCOOL ARE THE COOLEST OF ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nowadays, the eyewear of choice among really cool
people onstage is that favored not by European movie stars but by
accountants.
</P>
<P>
   The glasses made famous by the likes of Clark Kent and Woody
Allen are popping up regularly at New York's more outre theatrical
addresses. There they are, perched on the nose of David Latham, the
shorter of the duo of hipster comics known as Premium Bob, in the
team's new show, ``Dobie McDobie,'' at the Flea Theater in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Quinn Purcell, playing a lovelorn bombshell, dons the
fashionably unfashionable frames in ``Duet! A Romantic Fable,'' a
sendup of American courtship at the Actors' Playhouse in the West
Village. And isn't that a pair on one of those pointedly distracted
guys in ``Total Fictional Lie,'' the unslick performance piece at
Performance Space 122 in the East Village, by the slacker troupe
Elevator Repair Service?
</P>
<P>
   The eyewear of the brainy, the weakling, the social misfit
represents a kind of visual shorthand: It proclaims the wearer's
outsider status.
</P>
<P>
   Still, appearances can be deceiving. Mild-mannered Clark
actually has superpowers; the neurotic Woody of the movies is, of
all things, a romantic leading man. Similarly, the owlish players
in the aforementioned downtown shows are anything but squares.
Sporting the dorky spectacles are self-assured young entertainers
who only look like lifetime members of the National Honor Society.
</P>
<P>
   Who they aspire to be, in fact, are hip exemplars of an emerging
sensibility in performance art and comedy that anoints the outcast,
that celebrates the nerd. To be nerdy these days, it seems, is to
be cutting-edge.
</P>
<P>
   From Andy Dick, the irrepressibly geeky gofer on the sitcom
``News Radio'' to the performers on cable comedy shows like ``Viva
Variety'' and `` Show,'' to almost any character Jim Carrey elects
to play, nerdiness is a true comic virtue, a sure sign of
in-the-know sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   These clownish goof-offs are such self-conscious put-ons, so
redolent of show-biz savvy, that the audience is always aware that
the actor is ``on'' and not really playing a character. Their
performances, cynicism posing as innocence, are emblematic of a
seen-it-all, media-saturated age, a period in which nothing seems
spontaneous and everything in politics and culture is suspected of
being rigged, a time when the greatest humiliation of all is not to
be in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   A spate of new stage shows, occupying some of the smarter
downtown precincts, are the newest outlets of what might be called
nerd culture. Taking cues from such varied sources as Richard
Foreman, Andy Warhol and Andy Kaufman, these quirky productions
poke fun at the diversions of the egghead set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total Fictional Lie,'' for instance, is a deadpan lampoon of
the washed-out middle American characters who fascinate documentary
filmmakers. ``Dobie McDobie'' takes on, among other things, the
inflated myth-making properties of television news. And in ``Madame
Fury,'' at the Here Theater in SoHo, the comic actor Blair Fell and
his company, Aunt Bea's Dilemma, make an all-out assault on that
outpost of high culture, ballet.
</P>
<P>
   All three have some wildly amusing moments; in ``Madame Fury,''
Fell provides some choice lines to a tyrannical, weight-obsessed
ballet master based on George Balanchine, given to declarations
like ``What is a heart but an extra 5 pounds you should diet
away?''
</P>
<P>
   But at other times the cleverness of these productions seems a
bit twee, and even mechanical. The difficulty with this world-weary
brand of humor is similar to the problem encountered in standing at
a mirror and practicing a wink: The harder you work to induce the
reflex, the less successful it can become.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It's revealing that some of the best jokes are manifestations of
old-fashioned physical comedy, as when Latham's Premium Bob
partner, Paul Boocock, turns to the audience and flashes a
charlatan's million-dollar smile, or when the ballerinas of the
rival companies in ``Madame Fury'' do battle like tutu-clad ninjas,
arabesquing to the death.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is more than enough imagination and comic energy
exhibited in each of these shows to anticipate, and desire, even
bigger things from these companies. Elevator Repair Service
provides the weirdest immersion in nerd culture: ``Total Fictional
Lie'' is a kind of live-action version of the ``Real Audio''
cartoon segments created by Robert Smigel on ``Saturday Night
Live,'' interspersed with the company's jerky (and mesmerizing)
dance sequences, choreographed by Katherine Profeta.
</P>
<P>
   In the hourlong show, performed on P.S. 122's bare stage, random
scenes from actual documentaries _ including films about Paul Anka,
the serial killer Aileen Wuornos, and a door-to-door Bible salesman
_ are re-enacted by the seven-member cast.
</P>
<P>
   The funniest features Robert Cucuzza as the Bible hawker, trying
to close a deal with a nearly catatonic homemaker played by Leslie
Buxbaum; the banal scene repeats twice, with the actors delivering
hilarious approximations of the film subjects' accents. ``We take
oddahs,'' Cucuzza says again and again, and it's only after the
eighth or ninth repetition that his meaning (orders) becomes clear,
at least to us; Ms. Buxbaum remains blissfully oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   The gags here are a rarefied sort; they have to do with how at
odds the language and movement of the theater are with everyday
conversation and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of John Collins and Steve Bodow, ``Total
Fictional Lie'' affords a fresh and surprising, if more than a
little oblique, perspective. It's a perspective shared by ``Dobie
McDobie,'' with its cross-cutting style and pop-culture references
dished out to the audience at hyper-speed, and by ``Madame Fury,''
which expects audiences to be on their toe shoes, too.
</P>
<P>
   These shows are, in their way, advanced exams as much they are
entertainments, which only makes sense, since eggheads tend to do
well on their SATs.

SPORTS NO LONGER ON ROPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The resilience of boxing was never more evident than in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the sport slipped into a funk. Interesting
fights appeared to be a thing of the past, particularly disturbing
things were happening in the ring and no change seemed to be in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Those who make boxing their living lamented their misfortune _
but they knew it was temporary. It always is.
</P>
<P>
   A one-two-three combination seems to have given the sport the
boost it so badly needed.
</P>
<P>
   First, Oscar De La Hoya pounded Julio Cesar Chavez into
submission in a fight to set up a long-awaited title defense
against Ike Quartey on Nov. 21, one of the most compelling
lower-division matchups possible.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis appear to be zeroing
in on another long-awaited matchup, one that finally pits the best
two heavyweights against one another. The pay-per-view numbers will
be high.
</P>
<P>
   And third, Mike Tyson _ by far the sport's biggest draw _ was
given his license by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. That,
combined with Holyfield-Lewis, instantly injects glamour back into
boxing's glamour division.
</P>
<P>
   And what's on the horizon?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, De La Hoya vs. Felix Trinidad, !ital!the!off! most
anticipated lower-division matchup, and the winner of
Holyfield-Lewis vs. Tyson in what would certainly be the biggest
money-maker ever.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that how it should be all the time?
</P>
<P>
   Of course. Now it's up to those who rule the sport to maintain
the momentum. After all, it is they _ along with the Nevada
commission, in the Tyson case _ who created the current
environment.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya and his handlers finally agreed to take a risk, to
face a legitimate challenger, one who hasn't moved up in weight and
is in his prime, rather than another in a string of pushovers.
</P>
<P>
   This is why boxing fans are excited.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield finally decided to be consistent with statements that
his principal goal was the unification of the heavyweight titles.
He'll make plenty of dough ($20 million-plus), have a chance to
make more history and set himself up for a ridiculously lucrative
third bout with Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   This is why boxing fans are excited.
</P>
<P>
   Do you hear that, promoters? (And managers, trainers, fighters
and everyone else in the biz?) Boxing fans are excited. And it's
not that complicated: Make the best fights and everyone benefits.
</P>
<P>
   __ Uh-oh: Reports that a final agreement on the Holyfield-Lewis
fight are imminent are premature, even though both boxers have
agreed to fight, according to Dino Duva, head of Main Events.
</P>
<P>
   And he blamed promoter Don King, who has rights to Holyfield,
for the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are items in King's contract that are unacceptable, one
of which is a demand for futures on Lennox. In no uncertain terms
will we agree to futures on Lennox, and Don is aware of this. We
agreed verbally that futures are not an option. As long as Don
continues to play these games, the fight will not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is made, the fight could take place at Madison
Square Garden instead of Las Vegas, according to the British
domestic news agency Press Association, which cited no sources. The
fight could take place on March 13.
</P>
<P>
   BBC world service, also without citing a source, reported that
Madison Square Garden had bid $8.5 million to play host to the
bout.
</P>
<P>
   __ No Tyson fight?: Holyfield said that a third bout with Tyson
isn't in his immediate future unless the fans demand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already beat him twice. So it's not how bad I want to
beat him, but how bad the people want me to fight him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They'll want it bad, as the record-breaking pay-per-view orders
will eventually indicate.
</P>
<P>
   __ Wrong station: The Los Angeles station for which Steve Kim
hosted a boxing call-in talk show was KXTA (1150).
</P>
<P>
   It was incorrectly identified in last week's column. The show
was canceled, but Kim remains with the station.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: Fernando Vargas of Oxnard, who expects to
fight IBF junior middleweight champion Yory Boy Campas in December
or January, is talking tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Campas fight is going to be an easy one,'' he said. ``Yory
Boy is tired. He's been in too many wars. After a while, that takes
its toll on you. I'll beat him because I'm stronger, tougher and
more intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you really think, Fernando?...
</P>
<P>
   For those who missed the first Arturo Gatti-Ivan Robinson war,
Part II is set for Dec. 12 at a site to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Their first bout, in August, might have been the fight of the
year. Robinson won by decision....
</P>
<P>
   IBF strawweight champ Ricardo Lopez will have an opportunity to
prove the only blotch on his record was a fluke: He'll face WBA
titleholder Rosenda Alvarez on Nov. 13 in Las Vegas (televised on
Showtime).
</P>
<P>
   The two fought to a technical draw when referee Arthur Mercante
stopped the bout following an accidental head butt in the seventh
round....
</P>
<P>
   Former light heavyweight champ Virgil Hill is set to make his
cruiserweight debut against Jimmy Hayes on Nov. 7 in Hill's
hometown of Bismarck, N.D....
</P>
<P>
   Following David Tua's 90-second stoppage of Eric Curry last
month, Jackie Frazier, the daughter of Joe Frazier and a writer for
the Philadelphia Sunday Sun, had this to say: ``You have a better
left hook than my father.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is she disloyal, she also has no idea what she's
talking about....
</P>
<P>
   The handlers of talented young heavyweight Michael Grant are
trying to set up a bout with former contender Razor Ruddock for
January....
</P>
<P>
   Pernell Whitaker, trying to come back from substance-abuse
problems, is training in San Antonio with Tommy Brooks.

 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neal Horsley, a 54-year-old computer programmer in Carrollton,
Ga., does not understand what the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, he established a Web site called ``The
Nuremberg Files,'' a list attempting, in his words, ``to record the
name of every person working in the baby slaughter business across
the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Each name in the list is either in black type, meaning
``working''; in gray, meaning ``wounded;'' or has a line through
it, meaning ``fatality.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Horsley said that shortly after hearing
news reports Friday night that a doctor who performed abortions had
been shot and killed in his kitchen in a suburb of Buffalo, N.Y.,
he drew a line through the name of the doctor, Barnett Slepian, on
the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights organizations have denounced his action,
implying that Horsley may have crossed out Slepian's name before he
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly did not have advance information,'' Horsley said.
``I'm the only one who can change anything on the Web site. That's
tantamount to saying I knew of and advocated his death. What is
that? Libel or slander?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to define his role and that of his Web site, Horsley
replied: ``I'm a reporter. I am simply a journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials would not discuss the investigation of
the Slepian killing Sunday, but no one has suggested that the Web
site had any connection with the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley said the goal of the Web site was to gather information
about doctors who perform abortions so they could be arrested and
punished should abortion be made illegal once again. He said he did
not want abortion doctors to escape prosecution for lack of
evidence, as happened with some Nazi war criminals, and so he
called the site ``The Nuremberg Files: Visualize Abortionists on
Trial'' (http://www.christiangallery.com/atrocity/).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Visitors to the Web site are asked to provide a wide variety of
information about people who perform or aid in abortions. The
information includes photos or videotapes of the doctors, their
cars, houses, and friends; criminal records, including driving
record, mug shots, and fingerprint card; and civil suit records,
including ``informative depositions and divorce file (if any).''
</P>
<P>
   Horsley said he received his information through e-mail and
regular mail from anti-abortion activists and said he did not
regard the compiling of such information as an incitement to
violence. ``I have no power to stop them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about animation that depicts dripping blood under his
request for viewers to ``e-mail evidence or feedback,'' he replied:
``That is the blood of the unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Horsley said he first became aware of Slepian's death ``sometime
after sunup'' on Saturday morning through an E-mail or a report on
a computerized wire service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have a feeling of guilt when I saw it,'' he said.
``I did not have a feeling of sadness. We're involved in a war.
There are 4,000 babies a day being killed. To do this work, you
have to be like a policeman dealing with the reality of corpses.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not received communication from anyone taking
responsibility for Slepian's death or other attacks on people who
perform or aid in abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site has recorded 180,000 to 220,000 visits per month in
the last two years, Horsley said. On Friday, there were 7,886
visits and on Saturday, 18,295. Data for Sunday were not available
Sunday night.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Gilda and the Usual Suspects as Rounded Up by Verdi
</P>
<P>
   `Rigoletto'
</P>
<P>
   New York City Opera
</P>
<P>
   Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' returned to the New York City Opera on
Saturday afternoon. Carl Toms' 10-year-old production has been
rethought by John Conklin and given new direction by Christopher
Mattaliano. Neither man disturbs the traditional images of
``Rigoletto'' that rattle around in every operagoer's head. We are
given a reasonable representation, true to the period and speaking
the well-used vocabulary of operatic dramaturgy.
</P>
<P>
   The production looks good. Facades, staircases and doorways are
presented as fragments and set against a floor-to-ceiling
backlighted sky. The acting and the staging? Well, it's pretty much
what opera audiences have hardened themselves to. The cast does its
work. No part is sung with real distinction, but then none is
misrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   As the Duke of Mantua, Raul Hernandez keeps his fragile,
unfinished but not unpleasant tenor on track. Richard Zeller in the
title role makes nice sounds, but he is neither an elegant musician
nor a forceful presence.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Makarina as Gilda is musically organized in ways that
Zeller is not. Her soprano works best at its top and ``Caro nome''
was well served by it. If the voice is neither big nor lush, it is
careful and scrupulous in its phrasing. Blurs of pleasant sound do
not create a character, something that Stephen West, the
afternoon's Sparafucile, might think about along with Zeller.
</P>
<P>
   George Cordes (Monterone) and Angela Horn (Maddalena) had more
spirit, but it was the conductor, Marco Guidarini, who brought life
to Verdi. Both orchestra and chorus sounded uncommonly fine, and
everyone was engaged as far as his or her gifts allowed. Andrew
Richards, Leah Creek, William Ledbetter, James Bobick and Kate
Butler filled out the cast. The City Opera should get Guidarini
back.

   `Leaping Across Borders'

<P>
   Dancegoers fell in love with Finnish modern dance last year when
Jonathan Hollander and his Battery Dance Company introduced the
Finns to New York audiences. But ``Leaping Across Borders,''
presented by the company with the Consulate General of Finland on
Thursday night, was a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Tommi Kitti, this year's Finnish dance visitor, is a terrific
mover. In his knife-sharp, turn-on-a-dime dancing, his lean body
balanced firmly off-kilter in space, Kitti at first was
mesmerizing. His precision and sense of detail were impressive.
Dressed in black, he often resembled a wounded crow in cramped,
tense-bodied movement that seldom strayed very far.
</P>
<P>
   But he offered little more than those essential gifts in his
untitled improvisation, danced to music by Eero Hameenniemi that
was performed onstage by the Finnish jazz ensemble Nada. Kitti
could have been dancing for himself alone, given the resolute
introspection of the half-hour solo. Claustrophobically
self-referential and tediously repetitive, it was an unseemly
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The high point was the wild adventuring of Pentti Lahti on his
saxophone. The five musicians of Nada are expert, though their jazz
sounds at times like a compilation of familiar styles. That was
also a problem with ``4-Way Intersection,'' a new work by Hollander
to music by Hameenniemi.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography was as predictable as the story, the eventual
meeting of two wistful young women and two wistful young jocks in a
city park, though an abandoned cross-stage conga line made one wish
Hollander would let loose more often.
</P>
<P>
   The engaging dancers were Katherine McGowan, Adrianna Thompson,
Tadej Brdnik and Daniel Cardoso. The Nada quintet also included
Heikki Nikula, Hameenniemi, Sampo Lassila and Markus Ketola.

<P>
   The best came last in ``Coreografia,'' presented by the Robert
Wood Dance New York company on Saturday night. ``Reverence,'' which
closed the program, was a ceremony of slowly changing patterns
wound through by five women in dark-colored, simple, long dresses
that gave them the look of graceful columns.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Wood in 1996 and set to churchly music by Arvo Part,
``Reverence'' was a gradual journey toward exaltation, undertaken
by strong, mature performers who gave each move and gesture a quiet
glow. Those performers were June Balish, Naomi Goldberg, Heather
Gordon, Akiko Ko and Debra Noble.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of atmosphere and invention was missing in the rest
of the program. In ``Episode'' _ the opening dance _ choreography,
music, performances and underlying apparent themes looked like
ships passing in the night. Nothing connected until a solo danced
by a prowling, sensual Christopher Bonomo, who seized and held
one's attention like a cat capturing a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The other six cast members appeared to be less experienced as
performers. But Wood gave them very little to do in a piece that
seemed to have been inspired but not shaped by its score of short
pieces composed by Dhafer Youssef, Hakim Ludin and Carl Landa.
</P>
<P>
   The program also included ``Rakuen,'' a 1997 dance, set to music
by Brian Eno, David Bowie and Philip Glass, which honored the
pristine sweetness of its performers, 13 girls from the Children's
Dance Project of Canada.

   Women Who Know Pain and Find Solace Together

   Dance Theater Workshop
</P>
<P>
   Women became mourners and rejoicers, prophets of doom and agents
of healing in Ronald K. Brown's ``Incidents,'' the new work which
Ronald K. Brown/Evidence presented on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, lasting about an hour, got off to a striking start
with a solo for Angelica Patterson in which slow-motion sequences
occasionally quickened, only to slow again. The changes in tempo
symbolized states of uncertainty giving way to calm and hope.
Upstage, all this while, two women touched the back of a third as
if applying balm to a wound and the combination of their mimetic
gestures and Ms. Patterson's expressive dancing proved eloquent.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes that followed developed some of the emotional
implications of this incident. Ms. Patterson joined an female
ensemble that included Hope Boykin, a guest dancer from Philadanco,
a company from Philadelphia, and other members of Brown's troupe:
Dafinah Blacksher, Torya Beard, Diedre N. Dawkins, Celise L. Hicks
and Pofina Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Tense back bends and stamping feet suggested troubles and
determination. The women shook as they appeared to confront and
then transcend evil. They staggered as if weary and reached out
with religious aspiration. But they could also be comic, as when
their preenings satirized vanity.
</P>
<P>
   The taped accompaniment included a potpourri of sacred and
secular music arranged by a musical director known as MKL and
serious and frivolous recorded texts by Moms Mabley, Anna Russell
and Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The production ended with a communal celebration that was
heartening to behold. Yet ``Incidents'' might have been even more
poignant if, in addition to this merrymaking, Brown had included
movements recalling the opening scene's images of pain and healing
to serve as a reminder that troubles remain in this world and that
they can be faced with courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incidents'' is part of ``The Service,'' a series of programs
by Brown that continues through Nov. 8 at Dance Theater Workshop,
219 West 19th St., New York.

<P>
   Angelin Preljocaj's ``Romeo and Juliet'' retained its gloomy
power on Friday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music when Ballet
Preljocaj presented a new cast in the work's leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   Preljocaj has turned Shakespeare's Verona into a police state,
one in which even the oppressors are unhappy. Juliet may be a
member of the ruling class. But the way makeup made Claudia de Smet
look haggard and half-starved as the heroine suggested that no one
prospers in this Verona. By emphasizing the jerkiness of the
choreography, she revealed that she lived in a climate of fear.
</P>
<P>
   Then she met Romeo. As portrayed by Sylvain Groud, this was no
elegant youth, but a disheveled fellow who might not have had a
bath in days. Groud also made clear that Romeo was impetuous. Yet
at the start of the balcony scene, both lovers seemed wary, as if
each was unsure that the other could be trusted. Then, in this duet
and the ones that followed, they threw themselves at each other
with desperate passion.
</P>
<P>
   Verona's rival factions were led by Craig Dawson, as a thuggish
Tybalt, and Herve Chaussard, whose hot-blooded Mercutio might well
have been an insurrectionist.

ABORTION AND CAMPAIGN FUNDS DOMINATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the second and final debate in the race for state
attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic challenger, accused
Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco on Sunday of ignoring the threat
posed by radical anti-abortion advocates, thereby helping to ease
the way for this weekend's slaying of an obstetrician.
</P>
<P>
   The obstetrician, Dr. Barnett Slepian, was killed by a sniper on
Friday night at his home in a Buffalo suburb. Spitzer seized on the
shooting again and again during their half-hour debate, which was
broadcast live on WABC-TV in Manhattan and shown on other network
affiliates across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer cited a ruling in 1992 in which a federal judge rebuked
Vacco, who was then the U.S. attorney for western New York, for
failing to pursue contempt charges when protesters violated a court
order against blocking the entrance to a clinic where Slepian was
working. The judge, Richard Arcara of Buffalo, took the rare step
of removing Vacco from the case and replacing him with two special
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, speaking of his opponent, said, ``The horror that
occurred the other night should weigh heavily on his conscience.''
He also chided Vacco for getting rid of the Office of Reproductive
Rights when he became attorney general. ``Mr. Vacco disbanded the
very unit that was to protect this doctor,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco responded heatedly, assailing his opponent for exploiting
the slaying for political purposes. ``I think it borders on being
despicable that Mr. Spitzer would try to seek political advantage
at the expense of Dr. Slepian and Dr. Slepian's family,'' Vacco
said.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent, who is personally opposed to abortion, cited his
successful effort to win a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding a
ban on blocking abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, Kelli Conlin, executive director of the New
York chapter of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League, said that the case was started under Vacco's
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Sunday's debate was even nastier than the first
one, which was held in Woodbury, N.Y., on Friday. Vacco continued
hammering Spitzer for refusing to explain inconsistencies regarding
his campaign loans.
</P>
<P>
   Less than halfway through the debate, Vacco offered to yield the
rest of his time to Spitzer if he would reconcile his campaign
spending. At issue is Spitzer's claim that he had used eight
cooperative apartments he owns in Manhattan as collateral for
millions of dollars of campaign loans with a document submitted to
the state by his father, Bernard Spitzer. Before the cameras, Vacco
waved a document in which the father, a real estate developer, had
sworn that the apartments were not being used as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested Spitzer was being less than candid about the source
of his campaign financing. ``Show us the money,'' Vacco pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in the Friday debate, Spitzer provided only a
bare-bones response. ``The documents have been submitted,'' he
said. ``The response is very simple, Mr. Vacco: You're wrong on the
facts, you're wrong on the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters to say more on the issue after the debate,
Spitzer said he would ``answer the facts at the right time'' and
declined to elaborate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since those two issues occupied most of the half-hour allotted
to the debate, the candidates had little time to spell out their
ideological differences. Spitzer once again accused Vacco of
diminishing the stature of the attorney general's office, pointing
to reports that 80 percent of the people hired since Vacco took
over in 1994 had political connections. Vacco sought to deflect
that criticism by enumerating his accomplishments in fighting crime
and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, two political analysts _ one a Republican, the
other an independent _ said Spitzer's handling of the questions
about his finances had harmed his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's so easy to explain, why didn't he remove it from the
menu?'' said Jay Severin, the Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, an independent pollster in Utica, N.Y., said that if
Spitzer made a simple technical error, he has compounded it by his
reticence. ``That could be one of the things that causes Spitzer to
sputter,'' he said. ``I think he's handled it very badly.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Severin said, Spitzer did well by responding
so quickly to Slepian's slaying. ``It is evidence of some skill
politically that he was able to seize on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since polls indicate that two of three New York voters favor
abortion rights, Zogby said, it was a smart move for Spitzer to
home in on the shooting as a way to attract Democrats, moderate
Republicans and women to the polls.

 &HT;    Wallace wins; Cup chase near over
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Rusty Wallace broke a 59-race winless streak Sunday,
blowing away the Dura-Lube 500 field at Phoenix International
Raceway on the same day Jeff Gordon all but sewed up the Winston
Cup points championship.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, whose last victory came in March 1997 at Richmond, led
196 of the 257 laps before a rain storm swept across the mountains.
NASCAR officials called it quits after a 50-minute delay.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was in seventh place when the race was stopped and can
clinch his third Winston Cup championship by finishing 40th or
better Sunday at Rockingham, N.C., or just starting the final two
races.
</P>
<P>
   For Wallace, Sunday was all or nothing in breaking the streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept asking me if I was concerned about winning this
year, and I had to tell them I really was,'' Wallace said. ``When
we ended last year with 47 victories, my goal this year was to win
my 50th. (Sunday) was No. 48, and now I have a shot at it with
Rockingham and Atlanta coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace got off to a slow start here, chasing pole winner Ken
Schrader for the first 53 laps before taking the lead for all but
eight of the remaining laps. He beat Mark Martin out of the pits on
the final stop and was gone. Martin finished second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always want to be humble about that one,'' Wallace said,
when asked if he could have been caught had the race progressed.
``But I was so dominant. It's always easy to say, `Oh, he won
because of the rain,' and that's the part I hate. I did want to
restart because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin led one lap, Gordon none. This race was run up front, but
the attention was still focused on the two points leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what position you're racing for in the
points,'' said Martin, who picked up 29 points on Gordon. ``You
race every race to win, and that's what we did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon ran in the top 10 all day, but never really contended.
His string of 17 straight top-five finishes ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just having fun with that top-five streak,'' Gordon
said. ``It was really something. I think the thing that disappoints
us the most now is that we weren't able to keep it alive.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the championship, Gordon doesn't care where it ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as long as it happens,'' Gordon said. ``You can't really
expect to come in here and clinch it with two or three races left.
We're trying to get the best finishes we can right now. We're
really more focused on just running better.''

 &HT;    Still alive in ACC, Jackets regroup
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The cleanup began early Sunday morning around Georgia
Tech, where workers blew away all the remains of Florida State's
victory celebration from the streets around Bobby Dodd Stadium.
Upstairs from there in the Edge Center, a hoarse George O'Leary sat
in his office watching film and evaluating a performance that he
thought looked worse than it was.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-7 loss to sixth-ranked Florida State in all likelihood cost
Tech its first chance at the ACC title since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Florida State played its best game this season,''
O'Leary said. ``I'm disappointed in the loss, obviously, but we
have to grow from the loss, too.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest concern at the moment is the health of quarterback
Joe Hamilton and slot receiver/tailback Charlie Rogers. Hamilton,
who has a hip pointer, appears to be the less serious of the two,
while Rogers, who has a shoulder sprain and was much less mobile
after the game, gives O'Leary more cause for concern. O'Leary said
he will know more today about their availability for Saturday's
game at Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   For Tech (5-2, 4-1) to stay in a tie at the top of the ACC
standings with Florida State (7-1, 4-1) and Virginia (6-1, 4-1),
and keep its chances alive for a second-place bowl bid out of the
conference to the Gator Bowl, the Yellow Jackets have to beat
Maryland, win at Clemson on Nov. 12 and win at home on Nov. 21
against Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to regroup and see how we can do against
Maryland,'' O'Leary said. ``We've just got to realize and
understand we're still in the hunt now _ one loss in the ACC with
three ACC games left.''
</P>
<P>
   Having an off-week between the Maryland game and the Thursday
night game at Clemson would give Hamilton and Rogers time to heal,
as well as backup fullback and special teams player Curtis
Hollomon, who broke his thumb against the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   If Rogers is out this week, Tech will look to receiver Mike
Sheridan, who's been struggling to get back to form from a knee
sprain. He made a key third-down catch Saturday on the play where
Hamilton took himself out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to the point where he needs to be where he was
last year,'' O'Leary said. ``I hope (his knee) is getting
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Left guard Noah King, who got his first career start on Saturday
night over Jason Burks, may have solidified a spot there. O'Leary
said he was happy with the play off the bench of running back Joe
Burns, who led all Tech rushers with 43 yards, and linebacker Chris
Edwards.

 &HT;    Florida acknowledging vulnerability vs. Dogs
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Steve Spurrier spent the weekend at his vacation
home on the Florida coast, watching football and probably realizing
that the Gators' annual border war with Georgia isn't a day at the
beach anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 11 Bulldogs, who last week escaped Kentucky with a 28-26
victory when the Wildcats botched a field-goal attempt as time
expired, face the No. 5 Gators in Jacksonville on Saturday. Both
teams enter the game with 6-1 records and are tied for second in
the SEC East with 4-1 records in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia ended its seven-game losing streak to the Gators a year
ago with a stunning 37-17 upset in Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bulldog people are excited,'' Spurrier said. ``They won
last year and believe they can win this year. We got clobbered last
year, sort of like the old days. We've returned to knowing we can
be beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators got beat on Sept. 19, losing to Tennessee 20-17 in
overtime in Knoxville, but Florida has rallied to win four straight
games behind one of the nation's stingiest defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators also have overcome adversity. Part-time starting
quarterback Jesse Palmer broke his collarbone against LSU on Oct.
10, and was replaced by junior Doug Johnson. Johnson has thrown for
1,041 yards with eight touchdowns and three interceptions on
69-of-123 passing.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier said Sunday that junior Eugene McCaslin of Tampa would
start at tailback. McCaslin, a 6-foot-2, 219-pounder who would make
his first career start, has rushed for 70 yards on 23 carries.
Senior Terry Jackson, who leads the Gators with 577 rushing yards
and three scores, is doubtful with a sprained right ankle. The
Bulldogs also are searching for a running game. Georgia rushed for
185 yards on 37 attempts against Kentucky, but quarterback Quincy
Carter had 114 of those yards. Carter also threw for 147 yards and
two scores, accounting for all but 71 yards of the Dogs' total
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the difference for us on offense because we lost
about 90 percent of our firepower (from last season),'' Georgia
coach Jim Donnan said. ``He's kept us in the games with his plays.
We've struggled on offense with some injuries, but we've done
pretty well when we had our whole team in. We scored (against
Kentucky) on four straight possessions.''

 &HT;    Jets 28, Falcons 3
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ WHAT WENT WRONG
</P>
<P>
   What didn't? The Falcons had no pep in their step, falling
behind 14-3 when 44-year-old Steve DeBerg got sacked on an all-out
Jets blitz, and New York FS Jerome Henderson returned the fumble 53
yards for a TD on the first play of the second quarter. That was a
potential 10-point swing, as the Falcons had third-and-7 on the New
York 29-yard line. Atlanta never recovered. Coming into this game,
Atlanta was ranked No. 2 defensively against the run, the Jets No.
23. But the Jets rushed for 119 yards and the Falcons 55. Reason:
The Jets dominated the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball.
Atlanta came in tied for second in the NFL with a plus-eight
turnover ratio; the Jets were minus-three. Sunday, the Jets had a
plus-three advantage. DeBerg should have thrown the ball away on
the blitz that led to a fumble, and a subsequent interception
bounced off the back of an official into the hands of Jets LB and
Atlanta native Mo Lewis. Backup QB Tony Graziani also threw an
interception. Coach Dan Reeves seemed to question whether his
players were ready mentally, although he also admitted the game
plan didn't help DeBerg, either.
</P>
<P>
   _ WHAT WENT RIGHT

   This game was over in two hours and 50 minutes, the fastest
Falcons game this season.

   TE O.J. Santiago and WR Terance Mathis dropped what would have
been first-down passes on the Falcons' second possession. . . . The
offensive line struggled all day to give RB Jamal Anderson room. He
ended up with 46 yards on 19 carries (a 2.4-yard average). That
ended Anderson's streak of 100-yard games at four, tying the
franchise record. . . . Starting CB Ronnie Bradford and reserve CB
Michael Booker had fits with Jets WR Wayne Chrebet, who had four
catches for 54 yards. . . . WR Tony Martin, who began the game
leading the Falcons with 27 catches for 492 yards, had one catch
for 10 yards. . . . DeBerg was generally slow afoot, and should
have thrown a few balls away or to ``hot'' receivers to combat New
York blitzes. . . . CB Ray Buchanan shadowed Jets WR Keyshawn
Johnson most of the day and gave up just two catches, but one was a
12-yard TD pass in the third quarter on a fade route, with Johnson
using his 6-foot-3 height to advantage over Buchanan (5-9). . . .
On the 22-yard TD pass to Keith Byars in the third quarter, backup
LB Ben Talley fell down. He was supposed to cover Byars.
</P>
<P>
   _ FLYING HIGH
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons entered the game with just four receptions by wide
receivers other than starters Martin and Mathis _ two by Todd
Kinchen and two by Dwight. Kinchen, who dressed for just the second
time in five games, had three catches for 35 yards, and Dwight had
one for 20 yards before being injured early in the second half. . .
. WLB Cornelius Bennett had another fine game, with nine tackles
and one pass defensed, and ran down several plays on the far side.
. . . SLB Craig Sauer led the Falcons with 11 tackles, and added
one on special teams. . . . DE Lester Archambeau, who also played a
lot at DT because of injuries to starters Travis Hall and Shane
Dronett, had both Atlanta sacks.
</P>
<P>
   _ BEST HIT
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg completed the pass to Tim Dwight on a 20-yard crossing
pattern for a first down early in the second quarter, but DeBerg
paid for it. Having dropped back to throw from the Falcons' end
zone, on third-and-19 from the 11, he waited until the last
possible moment, and Jets LB Lewis smashed him chest-high, lifting
DeBerg up off his feet. He got up, though.
</P>
<P>
   _ BEST PLAY
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned pass from DeBerg to Dwight. It's really
something to see Dwight running full speed across the field, and
the rookie dived to get the final yard or so, barely getting the
first down.
</P>
<P>
   _ WORST PLAY
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the second quarter, the Jets sent eight men
on the pass rush, and DeBerg never had a chance. As he raised his
arm to throw, he was drilled by SS Victor Green, a native of
Americus, and lost the ball. FS Henderson picked it up and ran 53
yards for a TD, giving the Jets a 14-0 lead. Worse, C Robbie Tobeck
pushed Green in the back while everybody was giving chase, a
15-yard penalty assessed on the kickoff, which Dwight had to down
in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   _ GOOD CALL
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' decision to run the ``crack toss'' all day with RB
Curtis Martin worked well. The play, which is run out of a variety
of formations, calls for multiple crack-back blocks from outside
receivers, and was key to Martin's 101-yard day.
</P>
<P>
   _ BAD CALL
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg's failure to either throw the ball away or to a ``hot''
receiver on the play that he ended up fumbling _ and the Jets ended
up returning for a TD _ changed the nature of the game.
</P>
<P>
   _ SECOND GUESS
</P>
<P>
   Why leave Anderson in the game in the last five or six minutes?
He already has proven he's the only RB trusted in crunch time.
Translation: He's critical. So why risk injury to him rather than
run rookie Ken Oxendine in garbage time?
</P>
<P>
   _ OVERHEARD
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan (Reeves) has got a good team there. When you lose your
starting quarterback, it's difficult. I think they're going to be a
successful team this year if they can keep people healthy. One of
the keys today was stopping Jamal Anderson. That makes the
play-action less effective . . . so we get them in a lot of
long-yardage situations.'' _ Jets coach Bill Parcells. . . . ``We
smothered the line, and made sure he couldn't find any holes.'' _
Jets LB Mo Lewis, on slowing the Falcons' Anderson. . . . ``He just
makes our job a lot easier. We might miss a block or something, but
he's pretty elusive. He has the ability to make guys miss.'' _ Jets
C Kevin Mawae, on the joy of blocking for Martin.
</P>
<P>
   _ POSTGAME MOOD
</P>
<P>
   Bummed, and stunned. As Buchanan said: ``We're still a good
football team. I don't want to blame anything on our injuries, but
I think we would have matched up a whole lot better if we didn't
have the injuries. We're disappointed about this game . . . but
we're not disappointed that we're 5-2. . . . We've got to make sure
we don't lose too much sleep over this. We've got a division game
coming up (against the Rams).''
</P>
<P>
   _ ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Falcons de-activated starting left DT Hall,
WR Jammi German, and reserve CB Randy Fuller. Hall couldn't play
because of a bruised knee, and Fuller because of a strained
hamstring. Esera Tuaolo started for Hall, and first-year DT Shawn
Swayda got a few snaps. CB Booker replaced Fuller in the nickel
defense, and CB Darren Anderson replaced him in the dime defense. .
. . On punts, German was replaced as the outside right cover man by
Dwight. . . . K Morten Andersen's 53-yard field goal on the final
play of the first half was the 34th FG of 50 or more yards in his
career, increasing his NFL record. . . . Mathis moved into third
place in Falcons career rushing yards. He has 4,384, trailing
Alfred Jenkins (6,257), and Andre Rison (5,635).

 &HT;    Falcons flightless without Chandler
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Well, I'm just across the George
Washington Bridge from where the Yankee Clipper once roamed, but
forget Joe DiMaggio. Where have you gone Billy Kilmer, Earl
Morrall, Don Strock and those other dandy quarterbacks actually
born in the same century in which they were backups?
</P>
<P>
   They haven't come to Atlanta. For verification, there was Sunday
at Giants Stadium against the Jets, where the Falcons not only
proved again that they can't even think about escaping mediocrity
without Chris Chandler, but they added a exclamation point while
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   It's like this: Later this week, I'll turn an old man of 43, and
just the thought of playing more than a round of a golf on a given
day is suddenly terrifying to me. Anyway, the Falcons have this guy
who is older than I am, and his desperate bosses made him their
starter against the Jets when Chandler was sidelined with injury.
</P>
<P>
   The results were brutal. Then again, what can you expect from an
NFL fossil who spent four years away from something more rugged
than chipping and putting and should have spent a fifth? Instead,
Falcons grand poobah Dan Reeves hired the 44-year-old Steve DeBerg
before this season after Mark Rypien wasn't available, and a bad
situation became worse.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say the Falcons already had Tony Graziani on the
roster, and he isn't Kilmer, Morrall or Strock. As a result, the
DeBerg-Graziani combination was a mighty reason for the Falcons'
28-3 slaughter. So was the inability of the Falcons' offensive line
to keep the normally feeble pass rush of the Jets from nearly
placing DeBerg and Graziani in the same condition as Jimmy Hoffa,
supposedly buried in the stadium walls.
</P>
<P>
   The line's run-blocking wasn't much, either. And even the
Falcons' grand poobah admitted that he and his assistants didn't
have a Bill Walsh day in play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   There also was the inevitable creeping into the minds of your
average Falcon as soon as DeBerg was named the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were trying too hard to do their jobs,'' said Falcons
wide receiver Terance Mathis, joining his teammates in realizing
the Falcons are 11-4 during games in which Chandler starts and
finishes and 1-7 otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chris isn't in there, you're trying so hard to do the
right thing that it becomes counterproductive,'' Mathis said.
``We're 5-2, and at this point every game is big for us. If Chris
doesn't come back (in the near future) we still have to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Falcons do, but they'll choke with a steady diet of
DeBerg and Graziani. So the question for those who wish the
Falcons' renaissance to become more fact than fiction is simple:
When is Chandler coming back?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell until he starts practicing this week,'' Reeves
said. ``Right now, his left arm is almost attached to his side.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't good. In fact, as Chandler left the locker room, he
grimaced while showing me how difficult it was for him to take a
snap and hand the ball to his right.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing Chandler's teammates weren't watching. They'd have
grimaced, too, with thoughts of more DeBerg and Graziani.

 &HT;    Dura-Lube 400: Breaking down the race into 75-lap increments
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ The first 75
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Craven started for Ernie Irvan, who continues to recover
from injuries suffered at Talladega three races ago. ``Right now,
the car is better than I am,'' Irvan said. The action heated up
almost immediately when Jeremy Mayfield and David Green wrecked in
turn four, bringing out the first caution on lap 11. On the restart
at lap 16, Mark Martin passes Ward Burton for 10th, then Jeff
Gordon on the outside down the front stretch for ninth. Bill
Elliott, who started fourth, immediately applied pressure to Kenny
Wallace in third. The battle wore on until Elliott moved in front,
taking the inside groove on lap 31. Brett Bodine brought out the
second caution, spinning in turn one. The big move in the first 75
laps came from Dale Earnhardt, who charged from 39th to 13th,
passing Gordon down the backstretch on lap 75. Pole winner Kenny
Schrader led the first 53 laps, then Wallace took the bit on lap
54.
</P>
<P>
   LAP LEADERS: Kenny Schrader 53, Rusty Wallace 22. RETIRED: Brett
Bodine. UNDER CAUTION: 11 laps.
</P>
<P>
   _ The second 75
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Gordon may be the news, but Wallace continued to
check out on the field, leading by half a straightaway from
Schrader in second. Gordon couldn't make a move toward the front,
stalled in 13th place and in dire need of a caution for chassis
adjustment. Martin and Earnhardt continue their charges, Martin to
fourth, Earnhardt to 10th. Gordon is 13th. This 75 lap segment was
hardly action-filled, more round and round with little passing.
Jeff Burton continued a charge that took him from 38th to third and
Earnhardt crept to fourth. Dale Jarrett pitted on lap 127 for a
driver change, turning the car over to Michael Waltrip. Jeff Burton
passed Schrader for second as the second 75 laps closed.
</P>
<P>
   LAP LEADERS: Rusty Wallace 69, Mark Martin 1, Terry Labonte 2,
Jimmy Spencer 3. RETIRED: None. UNDER CAUTION: None.
</P>
<P>
   _ The third 75
</P>
<P>
   Wallace continued to dominate and Martin and Gordon continued
their duel. Gordon was eighth at the halfway point and Martin 11,
Gordon leading by a car length. They raced side-by-side from lap
166 to 172. It was short-lived, however, as Martin pulled away to a
three car length lead. Kenny Irwin slows on the backstretch and
coasts halfway through turns three and four, bringing out the day's
third caution. Gordon beats Martin out of the pits and moved up to
fifth while Martin falls to 10th. Gordon's lead was short-lived,
however. Martin passed Gordon on lap five and would hold it the
remainder of the race. On his charge at Martin, Wallace, meanwhile,
is cruising, pulling away to a six second lead on lap 217.
</P>
<P>
   LAP LEADERS: Rusty Wallace 75. RETIRED: Gary Bradberry
(overheating). UNDER CAUTION: 11 laps.
</P>
<P>
   _ The final 137
</P>
<P>
   Wallace continues to cruise to his first victory in the last 59
races. Martin maintains fifth place, at times leading Gordon by 10
car lengths. Wallace in no danger with half a straightaway lead
over Ted Musgrave, having his best run of the year. Jerry Nadeau
hits the wall in turn one, bringing out the fourth caution. It gave
the leaders an opportunity for one final pit stop. But on lap 257,
the rain comes. The race is red flagged and after 50 minutes, the
race is called 50 laps short.
</P>
<P>
   LAP LEADERS: Rusty Wallace, 73. RETIRED: Jerry Nadeau (wreck).
UNDER CAUTION: Nine laps.
</P>
<P>
   _ Today's impact
</P>
<P>
   With his seventh-place finish, Gordon put himself in position to
win the championship by merely starting the next two races, or
finishing 40th or better at Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who was hot
</P>
<P>
   Wallace breaks a 59-race non-winning streak with his victory
Sunday, leading 196 of the last 204 laps.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who was not
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield and Nadeau. Mayfield crashed on lap 11, and though he
returned to run 237 laps, finished 42nd of 43 starters. Nadeau was
running 32nd when he hit the wall on lap 248 and finished 39th.
</P>
<P>
   _ Next week's storyline
</P>
<P>
   It's Gordon again. He can clinch the Winston Cup championship by
merely starting the next two races, at Rockingham and Atlanta, or
finishing 40th or better at Rockingham.

CARDINAL COMMENDS CASTRO FOR HERNANDEZ REUNION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two days after a joyous reunion with family members
he had left behind in Cuba, Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez sat
with them in the front row at St. Patrick's Cathedral Sunday
listening as Cardinal John O'Connor praised Cuban President Fidel
Castro for making it all possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are grateful to President Castro,'' said O'Connor, who had
contacted Castro on Hernandez's behalf to ask him to grant the
family permission to visit. The cardinal went on to thank Attorney
General Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh and Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner for bringing the family together.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was reunited with his daughters, his mother, Maria
Julia Pedroso Cruz, and his former wife, Norma Alvira Manso, on
Friday after being separated from them since last December, when he
fled Cuba in a boat to pursue a professional baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up playing an integral role in the Yankees' winning the
World Series. O'Connor said that Sunday's Mass was not specifically
said in honor of Hernandez, who is known as El Duque. ``This Mass
is in honor of God,'' the cardinal said. ``Give thanks to him for
having El Duque and his family here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and his family members were greeted with applause when
they were introduced at the church, then they joined O'Connor for
brunch in his residence after the Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez did not make any public statements, but was expected
to ask the cardinal to baptize his daughters, Yahumara, 8, and
Steffi, 3.

   The display, ``Theodore Roosevelt: Icon of the American
Century,'' assembles more than 100 paintings, photographs,
political cartoons (like ``The Glad Hand'' by R.L. Bristol) and
memorabilia documenting the 26th president's pursuit of what he
called ``the strenuous life.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes a 1903 White House portrait by John
Singer Sargent and a 1905 bronze sculpture by Frederick MacMonnies

   Five sniper attacks against abortion doctors in Canada and the
United States have occurred in the last four years within a few
weeks of Nov. 11, or Veterans Day, a date observed as Remembrance
Day in Canada, but which some anti-abortion activists are said to
call ``Remember the Unborn Children Day.'' In each case, a sniper
fired a high-powered rifle from behind the doctor's home.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 8, 1994, Vancouver, B.C. _ Dr. Garson Romalis, 57, is
eating breakfast in his kitchen at 7:10 a.m. when two bullets crash
through a sliding glass patio door. One shatters his thigh bone and
severs his femoral artery. He nearly bleeds to death, but makes a
tourniquet from his bathrobe belt and calls for help. The shooter
had fired at least three times from a wooded ravine behind the
house. The doctor's wife and daughter also are at home but are
unharmed. Police recover two shell casings from high-powered rifle
bullets behind the house.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 10, 1995, Ancaster, Ont. _ Dr. Hugh Short, 62, is at home
watching television with his wife in a rear, second-floor den at
about 9:30 p.m. when a bullet comes through a window, shattering
his right elbow. A single shell casing is found in a wooded ravine
behind the home, in a suburb of Hamilton, Ont. After losing the use
of his hand, he stops practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 28, 1997, Perinton, N.Y. _ An unidentified doctor is
standing by an indoor pool in the rear of his house in a suburb of
Rochester, N.Y., between 7 and 8 p.m. when a bullet comes through a
sliding glass door. The doctor is not hit by the bullet but
sustains minor cuts from debris when the bullet strikes a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 11, 1997, Winnipeg, Manitoba _ Dr. Jack Fainman, 66, is hit
by a bullet fired through a back window of his home along the Red
River at about 9 p.m. The bullet hits him in the right shoulder a
few inches from his heart. Police dogs track footprints in fresh
snow behind his house to a park near the river nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 23, 1998, Amherst, N.Y. _ Dr. Barnett A. Slepian, 52, is
shot and killed when a bullet crashes through a kitchen window at
the back of his home, in a suburb of Buffalo, at about 10 p.m. He
had just returned home from synagogue with his wife and greeted his
four sons.

AWKWARD STEPS MOVE REID A STEP CLOSER TO WORLD TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Texas, N.J.)  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As David Reid and James ``Cowboy'' Coker waltzed into the wee
hours Sunday morning at Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, N.J.,
it looked as if both had two left feet. But that's what happens
when Fred Astaire goes toe to toe with Hopalong Cassidy. In the end
it was a very dissatisfying 12-round dance for both Reid, the slick
puncher from Philadelphia, and Coker, the cowpuncher from San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Coker's southpaw style proved so awkward that Reid was never
able to unleash his devastating right hand. And though Coker (20-1)
was credited with two knockdowns, the judges ignored them in the
scoring. Reid (11-0) looked bad, but he was never in serious
trouble, and he scored a 12-round unanimous decision and took away
Coker's World Boxing Council Continental Americas superwelterweight
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very awkward,'' Reid said. ``He leaned over to his left
so just in case I threw the right hand, he could slip it. He would
stay in a position to smother all my punches. I couldn't throw any
punches inside. I just had to throw from the outside so I could
score. I had to take what I could get.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges gave Reid almost every round: Paul Venti scored it
117-111, Ron Greenley scored it 118-110 and John Poturely scored it
119-111, all for Reid. Coker won the third round on all the score
cards. Poturely scored the 11th and 12th, when Coker put Reid on
the canvas in both rounds, even. Coker's left hand to Reid's temple
in the 12th round appeared to register a clear knockdown, but
Greenley scored the round for Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you have to do short of killing the guy,''
Coker said. ``I knew I would really have to beat him to win. How
can you score a fight like that when you have two or three
knockdowns?''
</P>
<P>
   Reid got two new experiences from this fight. He received his
first cut _ a nasty gash over his right eye in the third round that
required six stitches outside and four inside. And he was knocked
down twice.
</P>
<P>
   Coker, 32, heads back to San Antonio to regroup, while the
25-year-old Reid, the only American boxer to win a gold medal in
the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, continues his rise toward a
world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Although his performance wasn't very slick, by his own admission
and that of his trainer, Al Mitchell, Reid should be in line for a
title shot by next spring. Keith Mullings, the World Boxing Council
superwelterweight champion, was at ringside Saturday night. Reid,
who entered the bout against Coker ranked No. 3 in the WBC, has his
sights set on Mullings' title.
</P>
<P>
   In the only world championship bout on the card, Robert Garcia
(31-0) retained his International Boxing Federation junior
lightweight championship by stopping Ramon Ledon (12-1-1) at 1
minute 9 seconds of the eighth round. Garcia rallied after being
wobbled by Ledon in the second round, getting a severe cut over his
right eye and one in his scalp.
</P>
<P>
   In the fight preceding the main event, John Brown (19-5) stopped
Gabriel Ruelas (45-5) at 58 seconds of the fifth round. Ruelas, a
former world lightweight champion, looked lethargic and could not
mount any offense. He absorbed a great deal of punishment from
Brown. Dan Goosen, Ruelas' longtime promoter, said he would talk to
the 28-year-old Ruelas about retiring.

 &HT;    Georgia is not crawling with fat cats
 &HT;    (EDS: Embargoed until Monday, Oct. 26, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's fat cat political contributors are more like
skinny kitties.
</P>
<P>
   The state has only five individual contributors among the
largest 400 federal donors in the nation, and none of Georgia's
givers even cracks the top 245, according to a survey released
today by Mother Jones magazine. Georgia ranked 21st in total
individual contributions among the 39 states listed in the
magazine's third annual survey of contributions to federal
candidates, political parties and political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 403 donors gave nearly $36 million from Jan. 1, 1997
through June 30, 1998, Mother Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that there's a very small percentage of the
population who can afford to give like these people do,'' said
Jennifer Shecter of the non-partisan Center for Responsive
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot Chairman Bernard Marcus and his wife, Wilma, were the
top donors in Georgia, Mother Jones said. The Marcuses contributed
$52,500, mostly to Republicans. They ranked 249th among the top
400.
</P>
<P>
   Other top contributors in the state were Atlanta real estate
executive Julian LeCraw ($50,000), Warner Robins pathologist James
Q. Whitaker ($49,975), Stephen and Lucy Draper of the engineering
consulting firm Draper Group ($43,000) and apartment developer John
A. Williams ($39,050). LeCraw is ranked 263rd, Whitaker is No. 267,
the Drapers are 313th and Williams is listed 356th.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Drapers, who made all their donations to
Democrats, the rest of the Georgia donors favored Republican
candidates and causes.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's $234,525 in donations were a mere 0.65 percent of the
nationwide total.
</P>
<P>
   But although Georgia doesn't have many large individual donors,
the state contributes a significant amount of money to federal
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people find other ways to contribute,'' said Richard
Reynolds, a spokesman for Mother Jones. ``They do it through their
businesses, through PACs (political action committees).''
</P>
<P>
   The CRP's Shecter said: ``There's a difference between
individuals giving and industries giving. This shouldn't suggest to
you that the state of Georgia isn't responsive. Giving comes in
many forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-based PACs, for example, were the seventh-highest donors
nationwide and the state ranked 14th in contributions to political
parties from Jan. 1, 1997 through June 30, 1998, according to the
CRP. Not surprisingly, most of the donations came from the metro
Atlanta area and from Columbus, home to the AFLAC health insurance
company.
</P>
<P>
   AFLAC, with donations totaling $1.013 million, ranked second in
the state in federal contributions, the CRP said. Atlanta-based
United Parcel Service's $1.485 million in contributions led all
corporate donors statewide. Other top Georgia donors were BellSouth
Corp. ($839,595), NationsBank ($508,950), Southern Co. ($489,300)
and Coca-Cola Co. ($458,701).
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, UPS ranked 12th among corporate givers.
</P>
<P>
   Among individual contributors, New York ranked first in the
Mother Jones survey, with 66 donors who gave $6.32 million. That
was 17.6 percent of the total amount given nationwide. California
ranked second, with 65 donors and $5.25 million in contributions.
California accounted for 14.6 percent of all contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Other top-ranked states were: Texas (36 donors, $2.83 million,
7.9 percent), Massachusetts (26, $2.68 million, 7.5 percent) and
Florida (25, $2.28 million, 6.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In the South, Tennessee ranked 18th ($384,000), Arkansas was
20th ($290,900), North Carolina was 24th ($208,700), Louisiana was
28th ($163,100) and Alabama was 30th ($149,750), followed by
Mississippi ($117,250) and Oklahoma ($104,250).

OVITZ AND NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's show time!
</P>
<P>
   And who better to put on a show than Michael Ovitz?
</P>
<P>
   The man, after all, built the Creative Artists Agency (CAA) into
the biggest and most successful in Hollywood, and is the
controlling player in the only publicly traded theatre company.
</P>
<P>
   He helped launch the acting careers of Tom Cruise and Kevin
Costner, took David Letterman to CBS, and picked Disney's pocket
for a $128 million severance check.
</P>
<P>
   That alone should win him a few fans in America's most exclusive
fraternity, the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the league's owners will entertain presentations
from three groups actively seeking an expansion franchise, the
Ovitz/Carson project, the New Coliseum, and Houston. Each group
will get an hour to show its best open-field moves and answer a few
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz hour will include a model of The Hacienda that is so
big that it has to be taken apart to get on a freight elevator. It
will also include a film, because everyone likes sneak previews.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz aides describe the film as ``evocative.'' It will extol
the virtues of the global community that is Los Angeles. It will
link the NFL Experience with family values. And it will hammer home
that Los Angeles is the No. 2 market in America and has the world's
11th richest economy.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL will not make a decision on a 32nd team this week. But
Ovitz is clearly taking a killshot. He may not get a commitment
from the owners, but he could end the Coliseum's tortured campaign,
new or not, and leave Kansas City as the front runner.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the show is good enough remains to be seen. Kansas City
is not Cannes, and NFL owners, as fans here well know, are not a
sentimental bunch.
</P>
<P>
   The owners mostly want Ovitz to show them the money. Forgive the
film cliche, but that's what the league is all about.
</P>
<P>
   When Georgia Frontiere and John Shaw engineered the Rams' move
to St. Louis, the league stopped the vans momentarily until they
agreed to share the money.
</P>
<P>
   The league once gave lukewarm support to a proposed stadium near
Hollywood Park but bailed as soon as it realized R. D. Hubbard
didn't have the money to make it happen. It threw out author Tom
Clancy's bid to buy the Minnesota Vikings for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz group has had a stock answer for every question since
its campaign began: ``We have it covered.'' But come Tuesday, the
league will want facts and figures. Anyone caught tap dancing will
be escorted from the room.
</P>
<P>
   The owners will want to know exactly how much money Ovitz will
be putting into the project; a list of his fellow owners and their
finances; details on Herbert Glimcher's involvement in the deal
(the realtor holds the option to buy the land); information on
Carson's allegiance; and a timetable for construction.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the owners, will be more circumspect about Los
Angeles than any other prospective city. The Rams and Raiders left
behind a mess. ``If we return to Los Angeles, it's critical the
situation does not fail,'' said Roger Goodell, the NFL's
vice-president of development.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's biggest edge is the stadium. The league's number one
goal is to have every team in the league playing in a relatively
new stadium. Number two is the dreaded ``public participation'' in
its construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having four teams move is the most disturbing thing that's
happened since I've been here,'' said NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue last year.
</P>
<P>
   This is spin at its fastest velocity. All four teams that pulled
the plug the Rams, Raiders, Browns and Oilers jumped for new or
renovated stadiums and beaucoup up-front bucks. The only protection
any city has these days is its willingness to tithe to the NFL
trough.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Cleveland. One day it has the Browns and a fanatical
following. The next, it's team-less. A few years later, its new
owner has to pony up a $535 million expansion fee.
</P>
<P>
   If this isn't extortion, then I'm a Supreme Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz is willing to play the game, because he's used to it and
does it well. It's what Hollywood is all about image and
presentation, big-budget dynamics, understanding your audience and
charging $4.50 for a bucket of popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   The New Coliseum can't possibly compete with that, in part
because it's not new. Kingsowner Ed Roski could show the league a
zillion sketches of a renovated Coliseum. Owners still acquaint the
place with the departure of the Rams and Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   And when Roski takes the stage, he will do so without L.A. Mayor
Richard Riordan (he'll say hell of a videotape), without his hockey
partner, Philip Anschutz (who is too busy buying soccer teams), and
without Peter O'Malley (who the NFL once thought would be a swell
partner). The NFL is simply not going to give someone this
shorthanded the fate of the No. 2 market.
</P>
<P>
   An existing team is another matter altogether. Five teams want a
new stadium Denver, Chicago, Philadelphia, New England and Arizona
and the situations in San Francisco and Buffalo bear watching
because of hiccups in stadium plans. One might believethe Broncos,
Bears and 49ers are simply not going to move, but we all said that
about the Rams once upon a time.
</P>
<P>
   Do not be the least bit surprised if Bill Bidwill, the owner of
theCardinals, starts to cozy up to EdRoski and the New Coliseum
group, and the Coliseum reciprocates. The Cards rank last in
theleague in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   That might be the only way the Coliseum beats Ovitz to a NFL
team. The show starts Tuesday. We'll know by Wednesday if any ofthe
locals get two thumbs up.

GREAT TO HAVE BOWMAN BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTIANSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He may not be the most popular figure in the world of hockey --
especially among those who have played for him. And one could
hardly call him charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   But it was great to see Scotty Bowman behind the Detroit bench
on Friday night even if the Red Wings lost to Toronto. The NHL
needs every legend it has, even one who has used duck calls to
signal line changes.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no doubt that Bowman is a living legend. He's won
seven Stanley Cup titles, with three different teams, and is the
all-time leader in regular-season and playoff victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the king,'' said Mighty Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg, a
man hardly prone to exaggeration. ``It's great to see him back and
healthy. Hopefully he will coach as long as wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the way young players should look up to the veterans,
coaches should look up to Scotty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman has gone through a lot in the last two years -- his teams
have won back-to-back Cups, but he also seen the Red Wings suffer
through the tragic limo accident that left defenseman Vladimir
Konstantinov and the team masseuse paralyzed, the sudden death of
his brother, a knee replacement surgery and angioplasty procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But Ducks defenseman Jamie Pushor, a former Red Wing, said
Bowman had no choice if he was healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible for him not to comeback,'' Pushor explained.
``He lives and breaths hockey, I don't know what he'd do without
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to see him back and see him looking healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of healthy. Paul Kariya has wasted little proving he is
not about to shy away from physical confrontations after returning
from a concussion that ended his 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   He has been throwing his 5-foot-10, 180 pound frame around all
season, but his crunching hit on Boston's Ray Bourque last
Wednesday impressed his much bigger teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was throw the hardest checks out there,'' said Jim McKenzie
(6-4, 229). ``The only harder hit was Stu's (Grimson, who is 6-5,
239).''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, to nobody's surprise downplays his physical play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't feel like my game timing is too good,'' he
explained. ``So to give a good hit or get hit gets you to stop
thinking and start playing.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Kings pretty much avoided injury problems until
late in the season. This season the troubles started on the first
day of training camp when center Jozef Stumpel sprained his ankle
and didn't return until late in the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   The regular season has only seen things get worse. First, center
Ian Laperriere suffered a partially torn ACL in his left knee in
the second game of the season and his availability for the rest of
the season is very much in doubt. Laperriere, an emotional and
physical leader, will try rehab the knee without surgery, but if
that doesn't work he will undergo surgery and be lost for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Then in Game 4, Los Angeles lost goalies Stephane Fiset and
Jamie Storr to groin injuries in one period in a 5-5 tie versus
Colorado. Two games later, goalie Manny Legace, called up from Long
Beach, was bowled by Tampa Bay's Darcy Tucker and suffered a
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Before Legace was hurt Ducks GM Pierre Gauthier said teams need
at least three goalies to get through a season. The Kings, however,
might be the exception, they might need four or five.
</P>
<P>
   Where is Fredric Chabot when you need him?
</P>
<P>
   And while Los Angeles' goaltending situation was on life
support, it was learned that Stumpel, the team's leading scorer a
year ago who had been surprisingly ineffective in the first four
games of the year, was trying to play through a hip flexor injury.
He quickly was shutdown by coach Larry Robinson, who must try and
squeeze some goals out of his marginally talented offense during
the team's five-game East Coast swing.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever said it was going to easy Larry.
</P>
<P>
   THIS WEEK'S TOP 5: 1. Detroit (Bowman's return can't hurt), 2.
Dallas (Hull's mouth has yet to roar), 3. Philadelphia (Lindros,
LeClair on a mission), 4. Toronto (how long can it possibly last),
5. Vancouver (see Toronto).
</P>
<P>
   BOTTOM 5: 1. San Jose (late arriving holdouts equal no wins), 2.
Nashville (at least the Predators have an excuse), 3. Colorado
(Avalanche in danger of getting buried early), 4. Rangers (don't
let unbeaten streak fool you), 5. Tampa Bay (see Rangers).

GIRL WATCHES `NYPD BLUE,' GIVES POLICE PROOF OF SEX ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A 12-year-old girl who tried in vain to convince
someone her grandfather had been sexually abusing her for four
years collected her own evidence, gathering a semen sample in a
plastic cup, police say.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old grandfather was being held Sunday, accused of
five sex crimes against his granddaughter, all of which took place
last weekend, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' is withholding the grandfather's name
to conceal the identity of the granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The girl told police she collected the sample so DNA tests could
show it was her grandfather's. She learned the genetic test could
be done on semen by watching the television show ``NYPD Blue,''
police said.
</P>
<P>
   After she collected the sample, the girl took it to her mother,
who called police.
</P>
<P>
   The girl told police her grandfather started molesting her when
she was 8 years old. But no one, including her father, would
believe her, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police questioned the girl's 35-year-old father but did not
arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   The father lives with his parents at the home where the girl
told police she was abused.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the door at the west Phoenix home on Sunday.

   The girl was left alone with her grandfather on Friday night,
police said. That was when the latest molestation took place and
when the girl obtained the sample, they said.

<P>
   On Saturday, police arrested the grandfather on three counts of
sexual abuse and two counts of sexual conduct with a minor.

   Police said they have other evidence that could lead to more
counts, but they would not give details. &QL;

CSUN's Mel Miller in the first quarter
Saturday. !dtpost!!dlim!!head!Matadors' hopes dim!dlim! !by1! By

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; Montana State must travel to Eastern Washington and
Montana. Portland State has games with Cal State Northridge and
Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Weber State hosts CSUN next week and has Northern Arizona and
Eastern Washington ahead of that. And don't forget previously
written-off Montana, which is back in the hunt. The Grizzlies have
so-called cake walks against Idaho State and Sacramento State
before playing Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   Too many scenarios to discuss logically.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to CSUN, all those games are relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's still got a lot of games to play,'' CSUN strong
safety Vito Clemente said. ``Anybody can beat anybody in this
conference. Nobody's established themselves as a No. 1 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this pushes Montana State up a little bit and this
brings us down a little bit, but nobody's powerhousing in this
conference this year. Nobody's the powerhouse. Everyone's on a
level plane and it comes down to one or two plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have definitely changed for the Matadors (4-3, 3-2 Big
Sky). Coming off their second straight loss, a 36-26 baker's fest
(loads of turnovers) against Montana State, everything about the
Matadors' season has been altered.
</P>
<P>
   But the log jam near the top is keeping CSUN alive. Montana
State (5-2, 3-1) leads the way, but Portland State (4-3, 4-2),
Weber State (5-3, 3-2), Montana (5-3, 3-2) and CSUN all sit one
loss behind.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Matadors who have lost the most in the past two weeks.
Their ranking will be gone. Their aspirations of winning a
conference title has been supplanted by the most rudimentary hope
of surviving. The Big Sky title, long the goal, no longer looks
attainable to some players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a choice but to fight through adversity,'' CSUN
free safety Jeremy Golden said. ``What's on everyone's minds isn't
as much the Big Sky championship anymore. It's just playoffs. We
have to make the playoffs and a national title is what it's all
about, really. And there's still plenty of games left, like Vito
said.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what desperate teams do when their control is loosening.
They cling to the hope they believe is the most realistic.
</P>
<P>
   After losing to Sacramento State and Montana State in
back-to-back weeks, the thoughts are focused on the next four
games. And winning those games, so this season doesn't turn into a
grave disappointment. Four wins doesn't grant CSUN a Big Sky title,
but it should be enough to get the Matadors into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the conference championship is so important. It means
an automatic berth. A seven-win season is wonderful at this stage
of CSUN's development, but you don't become a player until you
reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is a young team, and this team is going to win a
whole bunch of football games,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said.
``And this team will win a Big Sky championship. Obviously, it's
tough this year. Our goal is to have two losses in this conference
and Montana State doesn't have an easy road ahead. They still have
to play Montana. THey've got to play Eastern Washington. They've
got to play Northern Arizona. At Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a tough road to hoe, too. So do we, but we're
capable of beating everybody on our schedule. Just like we're
capable of beating (Montana State).''
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how these things work. A few weeks back the only game
that mattered was the one CSUN played, and that's all any of the
Matadors knew. Now they can tell you what time kickoff is at a
number of sites for the next month. &QL; 
REPORT CARD
</P>
<P>
   Game: 7
</P>
<P>
   Result: Montana State 32, CSUN 26
</P>
<P>
   Record: 4-3, 3-2
</P>
<P>
   This week's GPA: 2.54
</P>
<P>
   Cumulative GPA: 2.65
</P>
<P>
   __ Quarterback: It's always hard to win when the quarterback
plays poorly, and that was the case against Montana State. Three
interceptions were deadly for Marcus Brady, who failed to throw a
touchdown for the first time this season. Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   __ Running backs: Jaumal Bradley did a nice job of running hard
in the second half and Melvin Blue had a productive first half
before fumbling. Twenty-five carries for 134 yards is as good as
it's been all season for the backs. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   __ Receivers:No one made the big play that was needed and the
group didn't get into the end zone. Anthony Ramos dropped a short
slant pass that could have kept a key drive alive in third quarter.
Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   __ Offensive line: Two sacks allowed for this unit is great.
Converted tight end Ryan Schatz played better than expected at left
tackle and the running game average 4.6 yards per carry. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   __ Defensive line: Pushed around again. Three sacks were due to
the secondary, and a lack of pressure allowed Chip Hobbs (eight
catches, 120 yards) to roam too much. It's a banged-up unit, but
it's also not producing. Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   __ Linebackers: Kenny Knoop and Brennen Swanson combined for 17
tackles and two sacks, but the group did nothing to distinguish
itself. Too many times the safeties are left to make the tackle to
prevent a big play. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   __ Defensive backs: No interceptions through nine quarters and
counting. Defensive holding and interference continue to plague
this group. Strong games for Vito Clemente and Jeremy Golden.
Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   __ Special teams: What else can they do? Two blocked punts and
four field goals gave CSUN a big enough edge to win the game, which
it didn't. Aaron Arnold also averaged 30 yards on three kick
returns. Grade: A+
</P>
<P>
   __ Coaching: The penalties were down, but the turnovers were
high for the second straight week. They say you can't coach
turnovers, but something's got to be figured out. Game plan was
solid. Grade: C

GORDON ON VERGE OF TITLE; WALLACE WINS RAIN-SHORTENED NASCAR RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Ariz. - Who'll stop the reign?
</P>
<P>
   Who will stop Jeff Gordon, stock-car racing's boy wonder, from
continuing his residence on the NASCAR Winston Cup throne?
</P>
<P>
   The throne appears to be Gordon's to keep for 1998, but the king
of the track on Sunday at Phoenix International Raceway was Rusty
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   About one hour after a driving rainstorm first began pelting
PIR, sending a record crowd of an estimated 109,000 scrambling for
cover and the exits, Wallace was declared the winner of the
rain-shortened Dura-Lube/Kmart 500.
</P>
<P>
   The end came after 257 laps of the scheduled 312-lap race, but
it could have lasted a thousand laps and it wouldn't have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was too strong, leading 196 laps.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, he was too hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace last savored victory nearly 18 months ago, dating back
59 races ago to March 2, 1997 at Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   It made him so hungry you could almost hear the rumblings in
Wallace's belly on pit road, chirping for one more sweet taste of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   It showed.
</P>
<P>
   Driving as if he wouldn't settle for another miserable trip back
to the garage with anything less than a a win, Wallace took control
on Lap 54 and led 196 of the final 204 laps in the Miller Lite Ford
Taurus, winning under a caution flag ahead of Mark Martin, Dale
Earnhardt, Jeff Burton and Ted Musgrave.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon finished seventh, behind John Andretti, and only needs to
finish 40th or better next week at Rockingham, N.C., to clinch his
third driving title in four years. Gordon also can clinch simply by
starting each of the circuit's final two races.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, go ahead and mail him the check.
</P>
<P>
   But not before handing Wallace a pay slip worth $78,005 for
winning at PIR, where it wasn't the first time he's been a one-man
show.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace entered the week having led seven of 10 previous PIR
races for 493 laps. He now has led a PIR-high 689 laps but shows
only one win.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. This one was oh-so-special.
</P>
<P>
   ``We targeted this race from the start,'' Wallace said. ``It was
a new car, new suspension, new motor, everything. The motor was
perfect and so was the chassis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We named it, `The Streaker,' to keep my winning streak
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory assured Wallace of at least one win in 13
consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, the 1989 Winston Cup driving champion, now has 48
career wins, moving him into a tie with Herb Thomas at No. 10 on
the alltime list.
</P>
<P>
   Few, however, were more memorable than No. 48.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever had a car that dominant that long,''
Wallace said. ``So I hope when I open the paper (today), I don't
read I won because of the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would really suck.''
</P>
<P>
   He needn't worry. It could have been a cloudless day and pushing
100 degrees, and Wallace still would have been difficult to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car just ate up all the problems (there were) and spit
them out the tailpipe,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   The race officially was declared finished at 3:35 p.m., 54
minutes, 30 seconds after drivers first were summoned to pit road
in an attempt to wait out the rain.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't stop, and two hours after the stoppage, it was
still coming down.
</P>
<P>
   The last race to get the early hook because of inclement weather
was the Coca Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Because of pit stops, there were seven different leaders. But
only pole-sitter Ken Schrader, who last won in 1991, came close to
matching Wallace. But it wasn't for long.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader led the first 53 laps but faded to 22nd, two laps
behind Wallace in an anti-climatic ending.
</P>
<P>
   Martin wasn't a contender for most of the race, but when rain
forced a caution flag on Lap 248, his crew delivered a lights-out
pit stop. Martin re-entered the racetrack in second, three higher
than when he went in.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the race never resumed under green flag conditions,
Martin wasn't terribly disappointed. He knew trying to chase down
Wallace was a little like trying to chase down a world-class
sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an awesome pit stop, and that gained us some spots
there,'' Martin said. ``We were gaining on the car, but we weren't
going to be a contender to win and probably couldn't expect to have
done better than second, so we'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   So will Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess four years ago at Pocono (Pa.) I won under a rain
delay, but I was leading the race at that point, too, with a
dominant car,'' Wallace said. ``It's always easy to say, `Oh, he
won because of the rain,' and that's the part I do hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did want to restart the race because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone. Even Gordon. &QL;

RACING'S TOP FAN: BIG GUY UPSTAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Ariz. - Outside the track's medical center, a gospel
quartet sang of love and salvation and eternal life above.
</P>
<P>
   But the small congregation at the Sunday morning service
couldn't hear the words. The heavenly voices were drowned out by a
hellish sound, the frightening shake-the-mustard-off-your-corn-dog
roar of a 358-cubic-inch V-8 engine, fully revved, flexing its
muscles in a garage stall only a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Car No. 35 was deliberately undermining the Lord's work _ that,
or Darrell Waltrip's red-and-green Tabasco Pontiac was protesting
the fact it had to start from the back row at the Dura-Lube/Kmart
500.
</P>
<P>
   Observing this conflict, a question came to mind. It's one
sportswriters and theologians have wrestled with since Richard
Petty was a child:
</P>
<P>
   Does God like stock-car racing?
</P>
<P>
   If so _ I don't mean to sound flip _ why does God let Jeff
Gordon win so much? What's he got against Brett Bodine? Was the
Almighty at least partly responsible for Rusty Wallace's victory in
a scheduled 312-mile race shortened by 55 laps by a desert
rainstorm?
</P>
<P>
   The view here is that God likes NASCAR racing because he made so
many fans. Six million Americans support the sport, and the numbers
continue to grow. About 110,000, including Miss Winston and Miss
Rodeo Arizona, attended the annual NASCAR Winston Cup event in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd, T-shirt messages ranged from instruction _ Drink
Til She's Cute _ to statements of product loyalty _ This Is Your
Brain (and beneath it is the Chevrolet logo); This Is Your Brain On
Drugs (Ford logo.)''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd dined on typical NASCAR fare: funnel cakes, barbecue,
pizza, turkey legs. I sampled a ``German Polish'' sausage. I have
to say, it was almost impossible to tell which part of the weenie
was which.
</P>
<P>
   From the grandstands to the hillside, fans at Phoenix
International Raceway bowed their heads for the pre-race
invocation. Ken Bowers' prayer was heard. No driver was seriously
injured. Dale Jarrett, the defending champion, went to the hospital
reportedly suffering from gall stones.
</P>
<P>
   The Book of Ecclesiastes says, ``The race is not to the swift,''
but that's how NASCAR events are decided. Wallace won his first
race of the season because his Miller Lite Ford with its brand-new
engine performed flawlessly, its wide wheels taking the turns of
the 1-mile oval faster than the other 42 cars.
</P>
<P>
   As Rusty put it, ``God, that thang flew!''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace led Mark Martin by almost 2{ seconds when the gray
clouds opened and the action was suspended. Gordon, who wins almost
everything (graffiti in one infield portable toilet read: ``All you
cry babys (sic) get over it. Gordon is the next Richard Petty''),
finished seventh. Gordon is so big that he has his own website. All
the Winston Cup points leader has to do is show up at the next two
races and smile to win his third driving title.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Brett Bodine found solace in another NASCAR scripture.
``He who is the least among you all will be great.'' Luke 9:48.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine won a Winston Cup race in 1990. It was his first victory,
and his last _ in 342 starts. A New Yorker, Bodine was sailing
along on the 46th lap Sunday when his car's left-rear tire blew.
Before he could slow down, he smacked the wall, inflicting the kind
of damage that an insurance claims adjuster looks at and shakes his
head and says, ``My, my, my.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the garage area, Bodine stared at the wreckage, hands on
hips, and sighed. Then his crew feverishly went to work on the
damaged car. It looked like a scene on ``ER.'' The hood gone,
mechanics peered at the engine. They began grabbing tools. Wrench.
Hammer. Drill. Electric saw. Surgeons tried to save the patient and
return it to working order in time to re-enter the race, but the
chassis was bent beyond repair. They lost the fight after an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That car,'' Bodine announced, ``will never run another race.''
</P>
<P>
   How then did he feel? He had lost again, finishing dead last,
211 laps back. Did he ever wonder if maybe his failings were beyond
his control? Does somebody upstairs did not like him?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. If he didn't like me, I might have gotten hurt,'' he
said, almost cheerfully. The only serious bruise was to his pride. &QL;

FIELD HOCKEY, ANYONE?

<P>
   PHOENIX - Are you ready for some field hockey?
</P>
<P>
   The National Hockey Festival could be heading our way as the
first fruits of the recent U.S. Olympic Congress, exposing Arizona
to an Olympic sport in which it has virtually no tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice part about it (the Congress) was being able to
physically show people our facilities,'' said  &UR; Mike Sculley,
executive director of the Maricopa County Sports Commission. That
includes WestWorld in Scottsdale, which Sculley rates as one of
Valley's most underused venues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Karen Collins, U.S. Field Hockey Association assistant
executive director of events, actually didn't get to WestWorld but
heard enough about it to leave an NHF bid request form with
Sculley. This year's 18th Festival will draw 3,000 players to the
West Palm Beach (Fla.) Polo Club over the Thanksgiving weekend to
decide championships in men's open, women's open, masters, mixed
and sectional divisions. &QL; 
Reese's pieces &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Changes could be coming in the date, venue and format of the
Reese's Gymnastics Cup, which was awarded to Phoenix in April.
</P>
<P>
   The two-person team competition was scheduled for Jan. 30 at
Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, but USA Gymnastics officials
are looking at other options. Like America West Arena, should the
NBA lockout continue or, more likely, Wells Fargo Arena at Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   A Jan. 17 matinee is being discussed for the made-for-TV event
that will be televised Feb. 20 on NBC. When the field is announced,
teams could consist of gymnasts with Olympic credentials paired
with up-and-comers vying for 2000 Olympic berths.
</P>
<P>
   Final decisions are to be made soon and tickets put on sale
before the end of the year. &QL;

<P>
   The path to the 1999 U.S. Figure Skating Championships begins
this week in Culver City, Calif., and Anchorage, Alaska, then winds

<P>
   The top four finishers in singles, pairs and dance from the
Southwest Pacific (Culver City), Northwest Pacific (Anchorage) and
Central Pacific (San Jose, Nov. 2-7) regionals advance to the
Pacific Coast sectional, Dec. 6-12 at the Cellular One Ice Den.
</P>
<P>
   The top four senior, junior and novice division finishers at the
three sectionals qualify for nationals, Feb. 7-14, at the Delta
Center as an early tuneup for the 2002 Winter Olympics site.
</P>
<P>
   Singles skaters who came through through the Pacific Coast
sectionals en route to the 1998 nationals were  &UR; Trifun  &UR; Zivanovic
(seventh),  &UR; Michael Chack (ninth),  &UR; John Baldwin (12th) and  &UR; Jere
Michael (13th);  &UR; Amber Corwin (sixth),
 &UR; Sarah Devereaux (11th),  &UR; Amy Evidente (16th) and  &UR; Cohen Duncan
(withdrew/injury).
</P>
<P>
   The sectional could be the prelude to a Valley bid for the U.S.
Junior Figure Skating Championships, a spring event for
intermediates and juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix chose not to bid on the 2002 nationals, the qualifier
for the Salt Lake Olympics, because Los Angeles was considered a
shoo-in. The main LA venue will be the new Staples Center, a

EARNHARDT, BURTON COME OUT OF NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO

<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Ariz. - Here were two drivers, starting so far back in
the field that they might as well have been part of the traffic jam
on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Where would they wind up in Sunday's Dura-Lube/Kmart 500? A good
guess might have been right where they started, the 38th position
for Dale Earnhardt and 39th for Jeff Burton. That guess would have
been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Both were provisional starters in the 43-car field. Had the rain
stayed away, there's no telling what they could have accomplished.
As it was, what they did was phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt finished third and Burton fourth, and the way they
bobbed and weaved their way through the crowd was quite a sight.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish, Earnhardt was 4.193 seconds behind the
rain-shortened race's winner, Rusty Wallace, with Burton about two
seconds behind him.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of ground to make up, sure, but that's what they'd
been doing all day, so it would have been hard to discount their
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave it our all today,'' Earnhardt said. ``Jeff Burton and
I came from the back together. I wish we could have moved up a
couple more spots, but that's the way it goes. Who would have
thought it would rain in the desert?''
</P>
<P>
   Could either have caught Wallace?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be humble on that one,'' Wallace said. ``But every
restart we had, I just drove away. I just hope I don't read in the
paper that I won just because it rained.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt recorded his fifth top-five finish of the year and
made the top 10 for the eighth time in 10 tries at PIR. He
increased his winnings to more than $2.5 million, and Burton went
over the $2 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   Burton exuded a lot of joy in a radio interview with MRN before
the race was officially called off. He told the interviewer that
his headset made him a prime target to get struck by lightning and
made him resemble a Martian.
</P>
<P>
   For Earnhardt, the fun is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry Labonte (10th place) and I are getting out of here, and
we're going to have some fun elk hunting before we go to
Rockingham,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt said his Chevrolet ran well but needed a little
tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little tight in the center, and we adjusted for
that,'' he said. ``It got better as we went along. We just kept
tuning on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday (Saturday) afternoon, we were pretty good in
practice. We quit working on the car yesterday in the last half of
practice, and we started hauling the mail. It was a good run for us
today.'' &QL;

FANS SPIN WHEELS IN SLOW LANE TO PIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Ariz. - As multitudes of fans tried to maintain their
sanity and resist the urge to gun it _ their engines, that is _
things were actually worse than they seemed before and during the
early going of Sunday's action at Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   How bad? When ticket scalpers are forced to work overtime and
sell their tickets to late arrivals at discount prices, that's bad.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, not many of the fans who showed up at the track
either right on time, often after waiting up to two hours to
negotiate only a few miles across the new bridge, or even those
driving in after the race began were flustered or angry.
</P>
<P>
   It's NASCAR time in Phoenix, and fans expect traffic snarls.
</P>
<P>
   But what the fans didn't know were the forces at work early in
the day that set the snarls in motion.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 a.m., there was an accident at the 115th Avenue off-ramp on
Interstate 10, one of the major arteries to the track. That was bad
enough, but then the Department of Transportation turned off the
freeway signs that would have directed motorists to other exits.
</P>
<P>
   That caused a huge backup at the 115th Avenue exit. Meanwhile,
up and down the freeway, Department of Public Safety officers
stationed at the other exits were getting lonely. They called PIR
at 9:30 and asked track officials where all the people were.
</P>
<P>
   By the time PIR officials contacted the DOT and the signs were
turned on with the proper information, it was 11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   So for more than five hours, it was gridlock and brain lock.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Kramer of Phoenix spent 45 minutes crawling in traffic
over the bridge, but she had no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But let's hear from Bryan Garlow of Phoenix, who was grumbling
all the way from the parking area to the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to do a better job of routing traffic,'' he said.
``We came from west Phoenix, and it took two hours. But I expected
this kind of traffic, and it's still a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the scalpers, even when they slashed prices for the
late-comers, it didn't do much good.
</P>
<P>
   One scalper was getting nowhere with an asking price of $100 for
a $130 ticket. When one fan offered $50, he turned and walked
away. &QL;

MUSGRAVE LAMENTS LOSS OF CHANCE FOR FINAL RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Ariz. - When Ted Musgrave was asked whether he felt
good about finishing fifth Sunday in the rain-shortened Dura
Lube/Kmart 500 at Phoenix International Raceway, his answer was no
doubt a popular one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel wet,'' Musgrave responded regarding his performance in
the First Plus Financial Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   But as with most auto racers, a three-word answer for Musgrave
is rare. He went on to explain that the timing of the stoppage hurt
his team because he had prepared for a race to the finish in his
final pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind being a bridesmaid again, but this pit stop deal
just got us,'' Musgrave said. ``We put on four tires and some
(drivers) took on two and got ahead of us. We were geared up for
the run, but it never showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   The much-traveled Musgrave, a Daytona Beach, Fla., resident,
said he definitely would have placed second if the race had not
ended when it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rusty ( Wallace) was awfully good,'' Musgrave said. ``We ran
the same lap times, but he just worked the traffic a little bit
quicker than I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just needed to get up there and maybe pressure him
(Wallace),'' Musgrave said. ``You don't cry over spilled milk, but
I was sure hoping for a second and at least give him a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Musgrave, who qualified 10th, has been with several teams this
year and will finish out the season with First Plus after the team
let driver Jerry Nadeau go this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all they needed was a little direction, and maybe I
gave it to them on some points that they needed to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrave began his Winston Cup career in 1990 and has no wins,
but he has finished second three times. His best season was 1997,
when he finished seventh in the points race. &QL;

JARRETT FINISHES RACE AT HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Ariz. - Give  &UR; Dale Jarrett credit. Or a Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, stricken with what was first described by racetrack
officials as flu-like symptoms before the start of the
Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 on Sunday at Phoenix International Raceway,
stayed with it for 126 laps before signaling for relief.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett pitted on Lap 126, climbed out with assistance from
members of his pit crew and watched as  &UR; Michael Waltrip climbed in.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip was available because he failed to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett then was air-evacuated to St. Joseph's Hospital, where
he was admitted for treatment of ``gall stones and gall bladder
problems,'' according to a racetrack spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip finished 32nd, four laps down, which were the four laps
the team lost during the switch in drivers. &QL; 
The King and I &QL; 
King  &UR; Richard Petty watched driver  &UR; John Andretti rally from 19th
place to finish sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti was running as high as fourth before the final caution
flag was brought out due to rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good Pontiac, and I just had to be patient,'' Andretti
said. ``I had to pass a lot of guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rain didn't help because I think there were some cars up
there that we could have beat and we could have had a top five.
What was so good about my car is the changing cloud cover didn't
affect it at all. The track got slicker when the sun came out, and
my car freed up a little bit.'' &QL; 
More Gordon &QL; 
 &UR; Jeff Gordon will drive in five NASCAR Busch Series races next
season but not the inaugural event at PIR.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already picked our five, but (PIR) might be one we put
on the schedule for the following year,'' Gordon said. ``If you
look at the tracks we've picked _ Las Vegas, Charlotte, Texas _
they're all kind of the same size and shape. And they're also
tracks I wouldn't mind getting more laps on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made many laps at Texas. The ones I made at Vegas
weren't worth a darn. We can basically build two cars, one being a
primary and one being a backup and run at those tracks. If we want
to come (to PIR) and be competitive, we'd have to build another
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our budget is not quite that high yet.'' &QL; 
Irvan bows outs &QL; 
 &UR; Ernie Irvan, who spent one night in the hospital after suffering a
concussion two weeks ago in a hard crash at Talladega (Ala.)
Superspeedway, chose to sit out the race.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ricky Craven, who relieved Irvan last week at Daytona
International Speedway, filled in and finished 30th.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan started last week's race at Daytona International Speedway
but climbed out after the first stop. &QL; 
Keep on truckin' &QL; 
Of next season's 25 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races, four will
be held at the same venue and during the same weekends as CART
events.
</P>
<P>
   Another four races will be held in conjunction with Indy Racing
League events, including the March 26-28 weekend at PIR.
</P>
<P>
   Two races are scheduled during Winston Cup events. &QL; 
Pit stops &QL; 
There were four caution flags for 25 laps, leaving  &UR; Rusty Wallace
with an average winning speed of 108.211 mph average. The time of
the race was 2 hours, 22 minutes, 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has won a race in 13 consecutive seasons, three fewer
than leader  &UR; Ricky Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, looking for a second successive manufacturer's title,
holds a 1-point lead (223-222) over Chevrolet with two remaining
races. Ford has 15 wins this season, Chevy 14. &QL;

GOLD ELUDES RAINBOW WARRIOR  
 7TH-PLACE FINISH LEAVES GORDON SHORT OF CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DEWAYNE SMITH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Ariz. - The rain produced no rainbows Sunday for the
Rainbow Warrior, but it got him a seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon will have to wait for another day to clinch his
third NASCAR Winston Cup stock-car championship.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and his DuPont Chevrolet Monte Carlo led Mark Martin by
358 points going into Sunday's rain-stopped Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 at
Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   All Gordon had to do was outscore Martin by 12 points, but it
was not to be as Martin and his Valvoline Ford Taurus took second.
Gordon will have two more chances to clinch the points crown and
the big money and prestige that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 27-year-old from Pittsboro, Ind., was philosophical
about not settling the points issue, he was disappointed about
ending his streak of top-five finishes at 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had a top-five car today,'' said Gordon, who was
hoping to tie David Pearson's 1968 mark of 18 in one season.
``Seventh isn't bad, at times we were back there at 14th or 15th.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we wanted to keep that top-five streak alive and give Mark
a run for his money to the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   If the downpour hadn't ended the race at Lap 257, Gordon felt
his top-five goal could have been realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car started out pretty tight, and as the race went on, we
were able to free it up,'' he said. ``We actually got too loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went too far (in the chassis adjustments), and we were
coming back on it. I think the adjustments we made on the last stop
were enough to get us in the top five.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who at 13 years old began working his way through the
open-wheel ranks before hitting it big on the stock-car circuit,
can win the crown with a 41st-place finish or better at Rockingham,
N.C., on Sunday. The season ends Nov. 8 at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter to me where it happens, just as long
as it happens,'' Gordon said. ``You can't really expect to come in
here and clinch it with two or three races left to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get the best finishes we can right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon qualified 12th and started the 312-lap race right next to
Martin. He was unhappy with his starting position, not because he
was next to Martin, but because he felt he could have done better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of messed up qualifying,'' Gordon said. ``We had a
great race car, and and I overdrove it into one (first turn) and
missed my line big time. I made up for it a little bit in three and
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in myself. I'm always out there trying to
give it everything I've got. I feel like I've let them (the team)
and myself down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, however, was happy with his second place. As far as the
points race with Gordon, winning the race was Martin's primary
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what position you're racing for in points,
you still race every race to win, and that's what we did today,''
he said.

UA CONSIDERS GAME VS. OREGON A TREAT  
 WIN WOULD PUT WILDCATS IN LINE FOR TOP BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - It's scheduled for Halloween, but no disguise is
needed. Saturday's Oregon-Arizona game in Tucson is a monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope that you give yourself a chance to play games like
this in November and late October,'' Arizona coach Dick Tomey said
Sunday, about 15 hours after his Wildcats won a tuneup, 45-7, over
obscure Northeast Louisiana. ``This is a very important game for
us, for Oregon and for the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months from now, the Pac-10 clash probably won't have the
prominence of UCLA's victories over Arizona and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, unbeaten and second-ranked UCLA is playing
in a league of its own.
</P>
<P>
   For the here and now, Oregon and Arizona are the show.
</P>
<P>
   The game at Arizona Stadium is loaded with angles:
</P>
<P>
   Bowl implications. The winner stays in the hunt for a major
bowl. There's talk about Notre Dame, Nebraska or Florida State
taking the Pac-10's old spot in the Rose if probable league
champion UCLA stays on track for the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. The Rose
is under no obligation to take a Pac-10 team if it isn't the champ.
If Notre Dame, Nebraska or Florida State stumbles, Saturday's
winner has a good argument about its Rose Bowl worthiness.
</P>
<P>
   The polls. Oregon (6-1, 3-1 Pac-10) stayed at No. 12 in the
Associated Press rankings after its gutty victory over Southern
California. Arizona, also 3-1 in the Pac and 7-1 for only the fifth
time in 30 years, jumped a spot to 13th. Saturday's winner has a
chance to crack the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The game, itself. It promises to be wildly entertaining. Both
the Wildcats and Ducks can score at a basketball pace. Each roster
is loaded with big-play artistry. You want highlight moments? The
best have come from the quarterbacks, with Oregon's Akili Smith on
a 62-yard touchdown run against USC and Arizona's Ortege Jenkins in
a game-winning somersault against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Akili Smith's experience and elusiveness get Tomey's nod over
Arizona's quarterback tandem of Jenkins and Keith Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Akili Smith is clearly the best quarterback in the
conference,'' Tomey said. ``I talk to other coaches in the
conference and pro scouts, and they all say he is having a
tremendous year. He has wheels and great poise. It's tough to get
to him because he runs so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's running against USC was pivotal because of injuries to
Oregon's tailbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arizona might have to deal with an injury to one of
its emerging running backs, Leon Callen. He hurt a foot in the
opening quarter against Northeast Louisiana. X-rays were negative,
but Tomey said Callen was having ``trouble getting around,'' and
his status for Saturday is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Callen was impressive 10 days ago with 101 rushing yards in an
Arizona victory at Oregon State. Tomey had hoped to move him into a
rotation with Trung Canidate and Kelvin Eafon.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Arizona's offensive look happens to be, Tomey said his
team is confronted with a difficult challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oregon has so many more weapons and more poise than they have
had in the past,'' he said. ``They have a skilled quarterback and
what I think is an underrated defense.'' &QL;

NEW FACTOR ENTERS BOWL PICTURE  
 STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE INCLUDED IN EVALUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - College football fans will have one more ranking
to follow starting today, when Bowl Championship Series officials
release their standings, which are based on a complicated,
four-part formula.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS ranking is devoted solely to determining the nation's
top two teams, which will play Jan. 4 in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
The ranking was not released until today because officials reasoned
that the strength of schedule part of the formula meant little
until most teams had played at least five or six games.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts don't think the ranking will contain many
surprises. Some media outlets have used the BCS formula and have
come up with virtually the same teams that are ranked on top of the
AP and coaches poll. No. 1-ranked Ohio State is expected to be
first, followed by UCLA, Tennessee and Kansas State, all of which
are undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   Some have speculated, however, that UCLA might be the top-ranked
team. ESPN ran the numbers according to the BCS poll and came up
with the Bruins as No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anxious to see what rolls out of the computer,'' said
John Junker, Fiesta Bowl executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS formula is composed of four parts: record, strength of
schedule, average ranking in the AP and coaches polls, and the
average ranking of three computer power rankings.
</P>
<P>
   With four undefeated teams at the top of the polls and three
others (Wisconsin, Arkansas, Tulane) scattered through the rest of
the top 25, Junker is glad to have a formula for determining the
top two teams. More than two teams could be undefeated, and Fiesta
Bowl officials would no doubt irritate someone by having to choose
from among them, as bowls did in the old system.
</P>
<P>
   Junker, however, thinks the competition for the two top spots
will be less muddled by the end of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still of the old school that by the end of November, all
the talk about these unbeaten teams and what we do might be a
little fruitless,'' he said. ``It never seems to fail that the
thing we worry about in October never seems to be as big a problem
in November or the end of the December.''
</P>
<P>
   And if three or four teams are undefeated, Junker isn't going to
sweat it. He's not the one who has to decide which schools get left
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are three or four undefeated teams, I'm not so sure
that's a problem,'' he said. ``That's what the formula brings, a
way to objectively decide some of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens in the Fiesta Bowl obviously will trickle down to
the other bowls. For instance, if UCLA and Ohio State meet in
Tempe, the Rose Bowl has the first two choices after the other
bowls _ the Orange and Sugar _ take their anchor teams.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the SEC champion still goes to the Sugar Bowl
unless it is playing for the national title. And the Orange can
choose either the Atlantic Coast or Big East champion. The Rose
Bowl would have its pick then and would be free to choose teams
such as Notre Dame, Wisconsin, Oregon, the Big 12 champion or
Arizona. &QL;
