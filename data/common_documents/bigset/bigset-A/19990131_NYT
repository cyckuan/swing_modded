<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The electric light is very probably a great invention,
and...let us take it for granted that its future development will
be vast. But this, unhappily, cannot be urged as a reason why the
pioneer companies should be prosperous.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and technology have moved on since 1882, when these words
appeared in The Economist (as recently spotted by the Wall Street
Journal, assiduously reading our back copies). But the same
sentiments apply to today's great invention, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a potent and entirely new medium, the net will
change the way the world works and plays. Even so, today's
pioneering Internet companies are unlikely ever to earn the vast
profits needed to justify their current share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, future historians may well add Internet shares to a long
list of industrial assets _ including biotechnology firms in the
1990s, radio companies in the 1920s, electric-light companies and
railways in the 19th century _ that have come spectacularly
crashing to earth.
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper has long argued that shares in general are
overvalued, especially in America. And, because American consumers
have used their newfound paper wealth to justify spending more and
saving less, the economy looks vulnerable to a collapse in share
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the inflation of Internet shares is, in many respects, quite
different. Whereas investors on Wall Street are merely exuberant,
the casino capitalists who spend seven or eight hours a day at
their PCs trading Internet shares appear to be stark-raving mad.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who have watched enviously from the sidelines
sense that gravity will assert itself sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the online gamblers who have earned a fortune in paper
profits betting their savings on shares in Yahoo!, Amazon and the
rest will never get their money out. For the very features that
have led to a near-vertical climb of Internet share prices also
favor its precipitous collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet companies go public by selling only a handful of
shares: only 34 percent of Amazon's equity is publicly traded, and
a mere 9 percent of that of eBay, an online auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The few available shares are greedily snapped up by a cyber-army
of online ``day traders'' via electronic brokerages, such as
E*Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's entire float changes hands twice a week. Hedge funds
that sold what they thought were already overvalued shares they did
not actually own have scrambled to buy back as prices rose.
</P>
<P>
   Just as tulips only became truly manic when ordinary people
started trading bulbs in Dutch taverns, so the trebling of Internet
values since September has been accompanied by a surge of trading
among people unskilled in the art of valuation and unburned by past
losses.
</P>
<P>
   All this is likely to reverse with brutal rapidity. A thin
market exaggerates falls as well as rises. The new online
brokerages may not be able to handle large volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, hedge funds will start selling. As losses mount, and
buyers disappear, inexperienced investors could well panic.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can predict the extent of the fall. Even the experts do
not know how to value Internet shares.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sharpe, for example, who won the Nobel prize in economics
for work on pricing financial assets, is enough of an Internet
believer to have founded an online financial-advice company. Even
he admits that ``we are all pretty much flying blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not merely that few Internet companies actually
make a profit (though this makes traditional measures of value
somewhat redundant). Although few now doubt that electronic
commerce has a thrilling future, reasonable people differ over
what, and how profitable, that future will be.
</P>
<P>
   Some venture capitalists and executives reckon that the biggest
profits will be earned by companies that establish a strong brand
by virtue of being first in a market. They believe the coming
collapse will affect only second- and third-tier firms.
</P>
<P>
   Even this may be optimistic. In the end, valuation comes down to
one simple fact. To justify today's share prices, Internet
companies will have to enjoy unprecedented growth in sales and
margins.
</P>
<P>
   It would take average annual profits of over $1 billion to make
sense of Amazon's current $20 billion-odd market value. Yet
Amazon's total sales in 1998 were only $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sales of many of today's Internet stars will never soar that
high. If anything, the Internet will give consumers more power and
make it hard even for firms with a large market share to raise
their margins for long.
</P>
<P>
   And after the fall? Much will depend on whether the bigger stock
market bubble bursts too. If it does, concerns about Internet
shares will be lost amid worries about the world economy as a
whole. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 800. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   If Internet share-values topple in isolation, however, the
effects might actually be salutary.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists in Silicon Valley have more money than they
know what to do with. Even after an Internet crash, there would be
enough wealth to back good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Because current valuations have inflated what Internet
entrepreneurs think they and their ideas are worth, it would become
cheaper for venture capitalists to invest in them.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation today is to sell up and move on without having
taken the trouble to build a real business. Lower share prices
would force entrepreneurs to lower their expectations and restore
sanity to the net's job market, in which people spend much of their
day looking for employers offering juicier share options.
</P>
<P>
   Investment in Internet businesses would suffer only if venture
capitalists lost faith in electronic commerce itself _ as opposed
to particular firms or the judgment of online traders.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an Internet share-bust holds a warning for other
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Today's appetite for equities rests on an erroneous belief that
they are a one-way bet: that, in the long run, they always pay
higher returns than other assets. Disappointing profits are
dismissed with a wave of the hand and the promise of a better
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   When Wall Street crashes it is unlikely to fall so far or so
spectacularly as will Internet shares. All the same, when Internet
shares plunge, the screams should strike fear into investors
everywhere. &QL;

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As the aircraft Shepherd One opened its doors, and
the shockingly frail and weak 78-year-old Pope John Paul II slowly
emerged, he scarcely looked like someone who could command the
attention of a president.
</P>
<P>
   That president, having stolen away from trial-locked Washington
to sneak an hour with the pope, waited with the First Lady in a
hangar. At the airport and in the streets of St. Louis more than a
million others were also waiting; but mostly just to see the pope,
rather than to listen to anything he might say.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what the pope has said in recent weeks has grated on
American ears. He has attacked America's policy of air strikes and
sanctions against Iraq and the decades-old embargo against Cuba. He
has advocated millennium forgiveness of Third-World debts, a
non-starter in Washington and on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's 1973 ruling establishing a woman's right to
abortion, although slightly chipped, remains the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's opposition to the death penalty (underlined by his
appeal, made at mass in the cathedral, for ``a consensus to end the
death penalty, which is both cruel and unnecessary'') managed to
commute the execution of Darrell Mease, who was due to die by
lethal injection on the very day of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff and the president talked alone for 20 minutes. What
they discussed is a mystery; it was said to include neither
President Clinton's private life nor his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor of Rome (who bears a startling resemblance to
Clinton) received some sharp words in private from the pope about
the sanctity of marriage, he immediately decided to marry his
partner of 15 years. But it seems that Clinton may have been spared
that galvanizing message.
</P>
<P>
   One columnist, writing in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, pointed
out that John Paul II could never win office in America. His views
on abortion and his attitudes towards homosexuals and women would
sink him in a Democratic primary; and the Republicans could never
nominate a man who opposed the death penalty and favored curbing
the excesses of capitalism for the general social good.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if cheers were votes, the pope could have won any office in
St. Louis. His mass in the Trans World Dome and the adjoining
convention center was said to be the largest indoor event in
history, drawing more than 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the wild popularity of the pope in America stands in
almost inverse proportion to his influence. &QL;

   Silly slogans are the early-warning signals of an election
season, and the recent Conservative Political Action Conference was
full of them.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts proclaimed ``Bauer Power'' in honor of powerless Gary
Bauer, a long-shot presidential aspirant. A stall sold Gore Blend
coffee, bland-tasting and decaffeinated. Stickers exhorted
conference-goers to ``Pave the Rainforest'' and ``Save the Male'';
another said, ``Don't steal, the government hates competition.''
</P>
<P>
   From all this pageantry, two conclusions flow. The first is that
the Republican primaries will be fun. The second is that the
ebullient clashes that they bring will be especially fun for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This second conclusion is reinforced by the contemplation of
Steve Forbes, one of several presidential hopefuls at this month's
conservative conference.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, there is nothing fun about Forbes. His campaign
pamphlet, entitled ``A Strategy for America's Future,'' says
unfunny and unconvincing things like ``Tie the value of the dollar
to a fixed measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign sticker says, boringly, FORBES; Forbes aides
say scintillating things such as, ``Steve is a real decent
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes himself has a nervous, wide-eyed stare, like an
accountant who has been plucked from the comforting tedium of his
spreadsheets and plonked before the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for Democrats at least, the Forbes campaign affords a
cruel kind of humor. It is pointed and pointless at the same time:
it skewers other Republican hopefuls, but its own candidate seems
too gauche to make it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of Forbes, and others like him, ensure that
Republicans will spend much of the coming year beating each other
about the head. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Vice-President
Al Gore seems likely (for the time being, at least) to face barely
any serious primary opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's speech to this month's conservative powwow gave a taste
of head-beatings to come. He railed against ``professional
politicians'' and the ``Republican establishment'' _ meaning his
own party's best candidates for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He poured scorn upon ``the Washington political class and its
media pets'' _ meaning, presumably, Senator John McCain, a
telegenic Republican war hero who has expressed an interest in the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And, repeatedly, Forbes denounced worn-out names from Republican
campaigns past, as well as the scions of political families.
</P>
<P>
   This was a way of lancing three rivals at once: Elizabeth Dole,
the wife of the Republican nominee in 1996; Dan Quayle, a former
vice-president; and, most of all, Governor George Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the most charming and best-financed Republican around;
he runs America's second-most populous state; he is his party's
best hope of recapturing the White House. So Forbes strained
especially hard to damage him.
</P>
<P>
   He sneered at ex-President Bush, the father of the governor.
Daddy Bush promised a ``kinder and gentler'' conservatism; Forbes
lampooned the ``siren song of these mushy moderates.''
</P>
<P>
   Daddy Bush broke a promise not to raise taxes; Forbes boasted
that he comes from ``a family of tax-payers, not tax-raisers.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the younger Bush's talk of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' Forbes had this to say: ``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric
and poll-tested cliches are no substitute for a muscular,
substantive agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Forbes is not alone in his assault on Bush; other
Republican White House wannabes have gathered around, forming a
circular firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   The ``compassionate conservatism'' slogan is nothing more than
``weasel words,'' according to Lamar Alexander, the former
education secretary under President Bush; it is ``silly and
insulting,'' according to Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   But, of all the assailants, Forbes matters most. Despite his
gauche manner, he is the only one with the oomph to wound the
younger Bush seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes matters, first, because of money. He is the heir to the
Forbes publishing empire, and is prepared to spend his own millions
on his campaign. In 1996 Forbes entered the primaries late, and
spent his way to victory in two minor states. This time he will be
more formidable by far.
</P>
<P>
   He has been campaigning nonstop these past three years: he has
visited all 50 states, given more than 400 speeches, paid for 60
radio ad campaigns, and deluged journalists across the land with
tiresome press releases.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Forbes fortune will count for more than it did
last time around. The big-state primaries will happen almost
simultaneously in 2000, rather than being spread out, as they were
in 1996. This will make it impossible to campaign much in person:
expensive television ads will matter more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason why the Forbes campaign may
seriously wound Bush. The Texas governor may be charming, and
spectacularly good at the sweaty job of working crowds; but he is
short on striking policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, by contrast, is full of bold ideas. As in 1996, he wants
to scrap the tax code and replace it with a 17 percent flat tax,
free of loopholes and complex exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1996, he wants to replace health and pension entitlement
programs with individual savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, he delights hard-core Republicans by
denouncing multilateral institutions such as the IMF and the United
Nations, and by rekindling Ronald Reagan's enthusiasm for a
ballistic defense system.
</P>
<P>
   He is staunchly conservative on social issues: he opposes
abortion; he denounces euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, in sum, has ideas to please his party's social and
economic wings: he talks excitedly about ``rebuilding the Reagan
coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were a charismatic man, he might well pull this off. But
he is too nerdy, and his inherited wealth makes him a disastrous
messenger for a reform that would abolish taxation on investments.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates _ governors and senators and former cabinet
members _ will assail the politically inexperienced Forbes for
regarding the presidency as an entry-level job.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle, he will never make it to the White House. But
he may manage to wound his party rivals enough to ensure that none
of them gets there either. &QL;

OLOWOKANDI'S NAIVE APPROACH COULD WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Olowokandi, the son of a Nigerian
diplomat, could have a bright future in the family business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic to be here... finally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's study the significance of this statement, issued
Saturday to a welcoming posse of L.A.-area reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Is it slick diplomacy, or healthy exuberance from a 23-year-old
millionaire who's a bit light on historical perspective?
</P>
<P>
   The ``here'' Olowokandi indirectly referred to was the good ol'
Sports Arena, one of the last NBA venues still refusing to go
condo. It is home to a long-running, maximum circus known as the
Clippers, who _ Friday's exhibition result in Inglewood
notwithstanding _ are exhibiting signs of life, hope for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstatic? Yeah, sounds like he means it.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi, selected by the Clippers with the very first pick in
the 1998 NBA Draft, represents 7-feet and 269 pounds _ give or take
a forkful of lasagna _ of that future.
</P>
<P>
   But in his world, the future has been moving at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to help right away,'' said Olowokandi, who, in three
seasons at the University of Pacific, went from project to king of
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the rest of the story should be familiar. He signed a
pro contract with a team in Italy one day before the NBA lockout
was settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do it again,'' he said, ``I'd probably do it that
way again.''
</P>
<P>
   He participated in six games for his European team, but a clause
in Olowokandi's contract that allowed for an escape to the NBA
meant he wouldn't be given a starring role. News reports were filed
from Italy declaring the NBA's top pick was something of a buster.
</P>
<P>
   And now, he's a Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Olowokandi think of his European adventure and the
attending criticism?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I went,'' he said in a diplomatic tone. ``The people
were very nice. The game itself was different than I was used to
here. The paint (key area) is somewhat wider; it has this triangle
shape to it. And the players are more crafty in terms of fouling.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the circumstances and a healthy apprenticeship in upcoming
Clippers practices, Olowokandi should be crafty enough to
contribute in a few weeks, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I won't be on the sidelines too much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take time,'' said Clippers first-year coach
Chris Ford. ``But we do have to get him ready as quickly as we can.
He's a bright young man. I think he'll pick things up quickly. It's
good that he wants to contribute right away. That's better than
having a guy come in and say he doesn't expect to do anything for a
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't think the idea of speeding around the learning curve is
lost on Olowokandi. He watched Friday's 107-76 loss to the Lakers
on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the only one who's behind,'' he said. ``We have a lot
of work to do as a team.''

SEISMIC SOOTHSAYING: NEW EARTHQUAKE THEORY CAUSES A RUMBLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, CALIF. _ The earthquake which devastated central
Colombia on Jan. 25 took its thousands of victims by surprise. No
wonder, since predicting earth tremors is far from an exact
science.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of effort, most would-be earthquake forecasters
have concluded that it will never be possible to make specific
predictions of the precise time, location and intensity of a
seismic shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are pursuing statistical approaches, such as
estimating the chances that an earthquake of a particular size will
strike a given region within a certain period.
</P>
<P>
   So a promising new ``stress-transfer'' theory, which sets out to
explain how an earthquake in one place affects the probability of
subsequent earthquakes nearby, is causing a bit of a rumble.
</P>
<P>
   One of the theory's leading proponents, Ross Stein of the U.S.
Geological Survey, likes to explain its underlying principles with
a string of house bricks interconnected by elastic ``bungee''
cords.
</P>
<P>
   Having arranged the bricks in a line on a table, Dr. Stein
stands at one end and winds a small crank which tightens the cord
attached to the nearest brick.
</P>
<P>
   Once the tension in the cord exceeds the frictional force
preventing the brick from sliding along the table, the brick slips.
This causes the cord between the crank and the brick to go slack,
but tightens the cord between the brick and the next brick along
the line.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Stein continues to wind the crank, the bricks slip at
different times and by different amounts.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, the system is unpredictable, but the movement of a
particular brick has a predictable effect on its two neighbors, one
of which becomes more likely to slip (as the cord between the two
tightens) and one of which becomes less likely to slip (as the cord
slackens).
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, says Dr. Stein, work in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The constant turning of the crank corresponds to the inexorable
motion of the earth's tectonic plates, and each slip of a brick
represents an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Just as movement changes the tension of the cords, each
earthquake increases the stress in some nearby areas of the earth's
crust, and releases it in others.
</P>
<P>
   These small changes may not be enough to trigger subsequent
earthquakes immediately, but other earthquakes in the area become
more or less likely as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the particulars of an individual earthquake, the
stress changes it causes can be worked out using a computer model
of the region. The result is a color-coded map showing the change
in stress distribution _ and hence the change in probability of
subsequent earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   To test the theory, Dr. Stein, working with Geoffrey King at the
Institut de Physique du Globe in Paris, Jian Lin at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and Shinji Toda of the
Electric Power Industry in Chiba, Japan, have looked at records of
aftershocks following major earthquakes, including the ones in
Northridge, Calif. in 1994 and the Japanese city of Kobe in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They chose to study aftershocks because there are thousands of
them, and their statistical theory needs lots of data to work
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, aftershocks were found to congregate in the regions
of increased stress as predicted by the model, while in the regions
of reduced stress (called ``stress shadows'') the number of
aftershocks was very small.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that even though the theory makes a number of
simplifying assumptions about the physical properties of the
earth's crust (for example, that it behaves like bricks and bungee
cords) there is a real link between changes in stress and the
probability of subsequent earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   As well as making short-term forecasts of aftershocks, the
theory can also be used to evaluate how a large earthquake changes
the long-term likelihood of other earthquakes in the region.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a paper published in the Journal of Geophysical
Research, Dr. Stein and his team estimated that the Kobe earthquake
increased the probability that a similar major earthquake will
occur in the Osaka metropolitan area between 1997 and 2007 from 5
percent to as much as 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And although the timing of large earthquakes is as unpredictable
as ever, the stress-transfer theory's ability to predict the likely
locations of aftershocks could still be useful in the hours and
days after a major earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   With a modest increase in computing power, Dr. Stein says, the
forecasting algorithm (which currently runs on a desktop computer)
could be made to work in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Using data from automated sensors, a map showing areas most at
risk from aftershocks could then be generated and displayed on a
World Wide Web page within minutes of an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The general public and the emergency services would obviously
prefer a precise prediction several days in advance, but any
warning is better than none at all. &QL;

<P>
   ANAHEIM, CALIF. _ The earthquake which devastated central
Colombia on Jan. 25 took its thousands of victims by surprise. No
wonder, since predicting earth tremors is far from an exact
science.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of effort, most would-be earthquake forecasters
have concluded that it will never be possible to make specific
predictions of the precise time, location and intensity of a
seismic shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are pursuing statistical approaches, such as
estimating the chances that an earthquake of a particular size will
strike a given region within a certain period.
</P>
<P>
   So a promising new ``stress-transfer'' theory, which sets out to
explain how an earthquake in one place affects the probability of
subsequent earthquakes nearby, is causing a bit of a rumble.
</P>
<P>
   One of the theory's leading proponents, Ross Stein of the U.S.
Geological Survey, likes to explain its underlying principles with
a string of house bricks interconnected by elastic ``bungee''
cords.
</P>
<P>
   Having arranged the bricks in a line on a table, Dr. Stein
stands at one end and winds a small crank which tightens the cord
attached to the nearest brick.
</P>
<P>
   Once the tension in the cord exceeds the frictional force
preventing the brick from sliding along the table, the brick slips.
This causes the cord between the crank and the brick to go slack,
but tightens the cord between the brick and the next brick along
the line.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Stein continues to wind the crank, the bricks slip at
different times and by different amounts.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, the system is unpredictable, but the movement of a
particular brick has a predictable effect on its two neighbors, one
of which becomes more likely to slip (as the cord between the two
tightens) and one of which becomes less likely to slip (as the cord
slackens).
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, says Dr. Stein, work in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The constant turning of the crank corresponds to the inexorable
motion of the earth's tectonic plates, and each slip of a brick
represents an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Just as movement changes the tension of the cords, each
earthquake increases the stress in some nearby areas of the earth's
crust, and releases it in others.
</P>
<P>
   These small changes may not be enough to trigger subsequent
earthquakes immediately, but other earthquakes in the area become
more or less likely as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the particulars of an individual earthquake, the
stress changes it causes can be worked out using a computer model
of the region. The result is a color-coded map showing the change
in stress distribution _ and hence the change in probability of
subsequent earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   To test the theory, Dr. Stein, working with Geoffrey King at the
Institut de Physique du Globe in Paris, Jian Lin at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and Shinji Toda of the
Electric Power Industry in Chiba, Japan, have looked at records of
aftershocks following major earthquakes, including the ones in
Northridge, Calif. in 1994 and the Japanese city of Kobe in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They chose to study aftershocks because there are thousands of
them, and their statistical theory needs lots of data to work
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, aftershocks were found to congregate in the regions
of increased stress as predicted by the model, while in the regions
of reduced stress (called ``stress shadows'') the number of
aftershocks was very small.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that even though the theory makes a number of
simplifying assumptions about the physical properties of the
earth's crust (for example, that it behaves like bricks and bungee
cords) there is a real link between changes in stress and the
probability of subsequent earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   As well as making short-term forecasts of aftershocks, the
theory can also be used to evaluate how a large earthquake changes
the long-term likelihood of other earthquakes in the region.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a paper published in the Journal of Geophysical
Research, Dr. Stein and his team estimated that the Kobe earthquake
increased the probability that a similar major earthquake will
occur in the Osaka metropolitan area between 1997 and 2007 from 5
percent to as much as 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And although the timing of large earthquakes is as unpredictable
as ever, the stress-transfer theory's ability to predict the likely
locations of aftershocks could still be useful in the hours and
days after a major earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   With a modest increase in computing power, Dr. Stein says, the
forecasting algorithm (which currently runs on a desktop computer)
could be made to work in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Using data from automated sensors, a map showing areas most at
risk from aftershocks could then be generated and displayed on a
World Wide Web page within minutes of an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The general public and the emergency services would obviously
prefer a precise prediction several days in advance, but any
warning is better than none at all. &QL;

IS RIMSZA ON RIGHT PATH FOR PHOENIX? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS FISCUS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Smiles, speeches, photos, handshakes _ they are daily
rituals for Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza. He reads ``The Three Little
Javelinas'' to first-graders, explains later how he saved the name
of the Phoenix Coyotes, then zips off to a reception with the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza seems always on the go. But even his friends are
beginning to ask where he's headed _ whether he's more concerned
with stoking the city's image than taking on weighty problems.
</P>
<P>
   City Council members and neighborhood leaders worry that he is
standing idly by while urban sprawl goes unchecked and the
municipal transit system remains one of the worst for a city its
size in the country.
</P>
<P>
   They see a mayor who changed City Council meetings from weekly
discussions about tough issues _ keeping guns out of the hands of
children, saving neighborhoods in the path of development _ to
feel-good sessions, usually without substance.
</P>
<P>
   They see a mayor who demands higher ethical standards _ then
asks companies seeking a $70 million city contract to help pay for
a party for the police and fire chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   And they say the city will pay the price if long-term challenges
such as revitalizing neighborhoods are downplayed while the mayor,
for years a real estate salesman, sells the image that problems
don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza, who will kick off his campaign for re-election with a
$300-a-plate luncheon this week, has heard the complaints, too.
</P>
<P>
   But he dismisses the criticism and says bluntly, ``Look at the
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   One poll, commissioned by the city, showed the vast majority of
Phoenix residents are satisfied with city services. In a separate
poll, which Rimsza commissioned, 70 percent said he is doing a
``good'' job as mayor; 14 percent said his performance is
``excellent.'' That poll showed 57 percent said he should be
re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has stepped forward to run against him.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza sees himself as a mayor who brings a business and
customer-service approach to his job in the nation's sixth-largest
city, and who understands what residents care most about:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Make sure there's a firefighter or police officer at your door
as quickly as possible with the equipment to help. And that when
you roll the garbage can out, you don't think twice about whether
it's going to be picked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really what I think is my strength,'' Rimsza said. ``I
understand what our core businesses are and I try to focus on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as the guy always watching the big picture.''  &QL; 
MAYOR SETS THE DIRECTION
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix's form of government, the city manager has charge of
the day-to-day operations of the city. The role of the City Council
and the mayor is to make broad policy decisions about the city's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor sets the agenda for council policy meetings, ranging
from tax increases for transit to bond elections for preserving
land.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, former Mayor Terry Goddard clearly had an
agenda. He used the mayor's chair to fight for neighborhoods,
especially historic ones. He was instrumental in helping get a
billion-dollar 1988 bond election passed that helped build the
Arizona Science Center, Central Library and expand the Phoenix Art
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Goddard also opened the city politically to people who
traditionally had not been involved in city government.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Another Rimsza predecessor, Paul Johnson, battled successfully
to turn the city's historic Phoenix Indian School into a city park,
instead of losing it to development. And he helped set the
foundation for downtown's rebirth. He also guided the city through
bleak financial times without cutting key services.
</P>
<P>
   But after Rimsza has spent four years in the mayor's chair, many
are still waiting for a hint of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; His critics include council members who once were staunch
supporters. They, too, are growing impatient, saying Rimsza would
rather avoid controversy and not make enemies. All but one _ Sal
DiCiccio _ asked not to be identified, fearing that rocking the
boat could hurt their own agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all frustrated,'' DiCiccio said. ``There's no
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Another council member, who is considered a Rimsza ally, said of
the mayor: ``Let's stand up and say, `This is a problem, let's deal
with it.' But he won't.''
</P>
<P>
   No Phoenix mayor is solely to blame for inadequate transit, air
pollution or the destruction of the desert. But Rimsza's critics
_ &UR; and even his supporters _ say he should use his influence much
more aggressively to seek solutions to long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix resident Louisa Stark sees a lack of commitment to
historic preservation and protecting pieces of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elected leaders seem to be very much in favor of tearing
down the old and bringing in the new. The uniqueness of the city is
vanishing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also sees a lack of leadership by the mayor and others when
it comes to social problems such as homelessness: ``Theo

   ``The elected leaders seem to be very much in favor of tearing

</P>
<P>
   She also sees a lack of leadership by the mayor and others when
it comes to social problems such as homelessness: ``There seems to
be a feeling that if we don't acknowledge it, maybe it will go
away. . . . We elect people to have leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Roxana Bacon co-chaired the 1988 citizens bond committee. She
looks at the city these days and is concerned about social and
racial divisions, especially in areas being eyed for widespread
redevelopment, such as south-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   How will city leaders keep existing neighborhoods _ and
residents _ intact? Will there be enough affordable housing? Will
redevelopment mean ``gutting the place and casting them out?''
Bacon wonders. ``Nobody's thinking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Burke, executive director of Arizona Common Cause, has
known Rimsza for decades and generally gives him high marks. But
Rimsza, he notes, does not have the personality to push for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who look at the city and see deficiencies _
inner-city schools, transit, homeless, the cultural life of the
city, low-income housing, social services _ I don't think we're
going to get much there from Skip,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there's not a big vision sitting over the City
Council chambers and the Mayor's Office. There needs to be one
pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   AVOIDING TOUGH ISSUES?
</P>
<P>
   Adds Goddard, ``Phoenix is going to pay the price for not
thinking about growth, for not thinking about open space. . . .
Where else but at the City Council should discussions (about those
topics) take place?''
</P>
<P>
   Debate or soul-searching about tough issues is rare these days
in Phoenix City Council meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Agendas for the council's Tuesday meetings _ the forum to form
city policies _ are set by the mayor. In recent years under Rimsza,
they generally are collections of employee awards and glowing
presentations about successful city programs. Rimsza says such
discussions can recharge city leaders and help them stay focused.
</P>
<P>
   But council members refer to the meetings as ``dog-and-pony
shows.'' ``Fluff and puff.'' ``Sit around and sing ``Kumbaya''.''
</P>
<P>
   At least six of the eight other council members quietly
questioned Rimsza's leadership, although two say that leadership
shows signs of improvement in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1990s open debate during full council meetings
proved so stressful to council members that one, Frances Emma
Barwood, wore a bulletproof vest to a vote. Another talked in later
years of wanting to bring a gun inside council chambers for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1992, for example, the council debated a proposed gay
rights ordinance before an aggressive crowd of 3,000 at Phoenix
Civic Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned we're much better off to try and get people in a
smaller, committee setting with a narrow topic without TV and all
the elements that add to people being a little more extreme,''
Rimsza said.
</P>
<P>
   But some council members see a different motive: Create an image
that all is well in Phoenix. They say it is part of a broader
approach by the mayor to publicly say one thing, then privately do
another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he publicly supported a tax increase for transit but
angered some in City Hall who believe he hurt the proposal by
telling business leaders he considered it too severe.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed for higher ethical standards at City Hall, saying the
public won't accept anything less. Then he drove a vehicle provided
him for being mayor on a family vacation to California, and on a
trip to northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; His use of the &UR; mayor's vehicle for personal business was no big
deal, he said. Ford, which leases the vehicle to the city, doesn't
mind. City management didn't object, either.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he also solicited money from corporations to pay for
a string of lavish parties at his home. He said the corporate money
saved taxpayers from footing the bill for gatherings to thank
people for helping the city. Others view the parties as a way for
the mayor to ``wine and dine'' influential people before
re-election without picking up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the posh parties in April, Rimsza agreed to let
zoning attorney Paul Gilbert, a lobbyist for developers, pay the
bill. The party, however, was for citizen committees that often
referee disputes between developers and neighborhoods. Some guests
were outraged at the apparent conflict; the mayor agreed to write a
check to cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   For a party for the police and fire chiefs, Rimsza asked several
companies to help pay the $9,500 cost, one of those approached
said. The problem: The companies are preparing to compete for a $70
million project for the Police and Fire departments. &QL; 
SAVING THE DESERT
</P>
<P>
   It was a spring day in 1998, not long after the sun climbed over
the horizon in the desert in far northern Phoenix. The mayor was in
a hot-air balloon, floating over cholla and barrel cactuses,
paloverde trees and creosote bushes that dot thousands of acres
Phoenix hopes to turn into a Sonoran desert preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to save this,'' he said, almost under his breath.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza vowed to create a 15,000-acre preserve, roughly from 67th
Avenue to Cave Creek Road, from the Carefree Highway to the Central
Arizona Project canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza, in fact, pushed the idea as far back as February 1993 in
a memo urging the city to create a desert preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward six years. The city has applied to have proposed
preserve land considered for conservation. But Rimsza hasn't said
yet how he plans to pay for the land, which could cost up to $250
million. In about a year, a down payment of 10 percent could be
owed to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other Arizona cities and counties have sped past
Phoenix in the race to preserve the desert. Pima County has
millions of dollars available, thanks to a bond election last year.
Scottsdale's efforts are fed by a sales tax to preserve the
McDowell Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   When Arizona voters approved a state initiative providing
millions of dollars in matching funds for open space, Pima County
and Scottsdale both had sources of money to match the additional
funds. Phoenix did not.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza has set other ambitious goals, only to see them fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   He declared war on incentives for developers in April 1997,
touting a plan where Phoenix and Scottsdale would share revenue
generated along their border. He called the program ``monumental''
saying, ``We will no longer be extorted upon by retail
developers.''
</P>
<P>
   The program never took shape.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, he announced the city would help clean up a
neighborhood by buying a house where a teenage girl was reputedly
gang-raped. The plan was to tear down the house or turn it into a
community center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we leave it as is, it will be a terrible monument there for
the next 50 years,'' a Rimsza spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The house remains in the neighborhood. It was never acquired by
the city. &QL; 
RIMSZA'S SUCCESSES
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza and his supporters say he has had plenty of success since
he joined the City Council in 1990. A graduate of Camelback High,
he became vice mayor in 1993, and mayor in 1994. He was re-elected
in October 1995, coasting by Councilwoman Thelda Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza created several programs to improve education, including
Operation AIM (Attendance Is Mandatory), which uses the city court
to combat truancy. Credited with reducing truancy days in one
school district by 4,000, Operation AIM soon could go citywide.
</P>
<P>
   Another Rimsza program raised $100,000 during its first year for
teachers to buy basic classroom supplies. The program was turned
over to a bank, which now raises about $250,000 a year, and may use
the program statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza also helped fight graffiti and pushed successfully for an
``infill'' housing program to reward developers who built on vacant
lots in the central city.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Rimsza strength is being able to ``market'' the city _ as
when negotiations were being completed for the Phoenix Coyotes to
play in America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coyotes had decided to name their team the Arizona Coyotes
and that was fine with me. That's their business decision,'' Rimsza
recalls. ``But they needed to understand that our business decision
to rent them America West Arena at below-market rents was based on
them being the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it was OK if they wanted to be the Arizona Coyotes _ but my
philosophy was, then the deal we've given you on rent needs to
adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza said the team gave in, put Phoenix in the name, and gave
a tremendous international marketing boost to the city.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rimsza understands the importance of ``image'' for himself and
the city. Rimsza is smooth, whether working a crowd or reaching out
to voters.
</P>
<P>
   He uses a database to send birthday cards to would-be voters. He
has delivered flowering plants along with campaign literature on
the campaign trail. He hands out cactuses for a speech on the need
for a desert preserve; apple lapel pins when touting the importance
of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is a salesman,'' says one City Council member,
referring to Rimsza's years in real estate and business. ``Don't
forget that. It's `make the sale, make the sale.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Throughout a busy day of appointments, Rimsza maintains the
high-energy &UR; personality that characterizes his public persona.
Rimsza says he truly enjoys meeting and talking with people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely love doing this,'' he said of his job. ``You've
got to reach out to folks and thank them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is in a big city, people don't run into their
mayor at the hardware store. They don't run into their mayor at the
movie theater. We have to really spend a lot of effort and energy
making sure we're touching people and asking 'em, `How we doing?
How can we do a better job? Were you well taken care of?' '' &QL; 
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS
</P>
<P>
   There have been rumblings that Rimsza eventually will run for
the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He fueled such rumors by landing former presidential candidate
Bob Dole as a keynote for this week's fund-raiser luncheon, an
event Rimsza says could raise $300,000 _ far more than usually
raised in a Phoenix mayoral race.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor insists that after September's election, he's done
with politics.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants one more term as mayor and then will likely
work for the Gill Group, the kitchen equipment company run by his
wife, Kim.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is pleased with his performance and his
accomplishments and has no desire for higher office.
</P>
<P>
   Some, particularly within City Hall, want more from Rimsza. But
despite his criticisms of the mayor, Burke of Common Cause says he
may offer exactly what many people want from the mayor's chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a face for a big, friendly, Western, sprawling city,'' he
said. ``He's youthful, clean. It's an honest, or at least
well-intentioned, government.'' &QL;

PEPPERDINE DEPENDS ON DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU _ If Pepperdine isn't steamrolling an opponent as the
Waves did the previous night to San Diego, there is always the
defense. Pepperdine has suffocated its opponents during a West
Coast Conference winning streak that grew to six with another
stellar defensive performance Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves limited visiting St. Mary's to 25 points less than the
Gaels' season scoring average in a 58-44 win before a crowd of
1,789 at Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves (7-1, 16-7) weren't the same team Saturday that
blitzed San Diego 21-3 in the opening minutes of a 72-58 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't expect to have games like that every night,''
declared senior guard Jelani Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   But the Waves pulled away early in the second half behind a
defense that held St. Mary's (2-6, 9-14) scoreless for the first 7
minutes, 16 seconds of the second half. In that span, Pepperdine
turned a 27-23 halftime advantage into a comfortable 39-25 cushion
after the 12-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they say defense wins championships, I agree with that.
(And) we have our defense to get us through when we're not playing
as well on the offensive end,'' Waves coach Lorenzo Romar said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaels committed 16 turnovers, had eight shots blocked (five
by Kelvin Gibbs) and finished the night at just 37 percent (17 of
46) from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a lot of pride in our defense,'' said forward Marc
McDowell, who came off the bench in the second half to help the
Waves pull away. The senior finished with nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Tommie Prince is usually Pepperdine's defensive stopper
and was the key performer again. The senior's assignment Saturday
was Gaels forward Eric Schraeder, who stands 6-foot-9 and was
averaging 20.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   Prince hounded Schraeder all night, allowing him to take just
four shots. He made three of them and led the Gaels with 12 points,
but Prince once again earned the admiration of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to put Tommie on the other team's best scorer
every night and he shuts them down,'' McDowell said. ``I think he's
the best (defender) in the league. Only once the past two years has
the guy he's guarded scored his average.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves placed just one scorer, Gardner with 15, in double
figures. But that should be expected considering St. Mary's
followed the same strategy in the teams' first meeting (a 50-44
Pepperdine win) by slowing the pace down and using all or most of
the 35-second shot clock on possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew St. Mary's was going to do that again. It was a
four-point game at the half and we needed to use our defense to get
the game at our tempo,'' said Gardner, who made a 3-pointer, fed
McDowell for a fast-break bucket and hit a short jumper during the
Waves' surge in the first 10 minutes of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do that, we can use our transition game to get some
easy baskets and we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Gibbs' 11 boards, Pepperdine outrebounded the Gaels
35-24, grabbing 11 of those on the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area where we haven't done that well and that's
being aggressive with offensive rebounds,'' Romar said. ``But
tonight Kelvin Gibbs, Marc McDowell and (center) Nick Sheppard
really attacked the glass.''

USC'S PLAY ANGERS BIBBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. _ USC's losing streak reached six Saturday, but
this loss was unique _ the Trojans made more noise after the game
than during their 95-86 loss to Washington State before 4,687 at
Friel Court.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least USC coach Henry Bibby did. He chewed out the team
for more than 20 minutes in the locker room, apparently fed up with
the Trojans' lackadaisical play.
</P>
<P>
   As USC's once-promising 10-2 start has self-destructed into a
10-8 record, patience has begun to wear thin for Bibby and his
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team I've recruited every one of them and we have
nine games to go and now we'll see what we're made of,'' Bibby
said. ``We were flat. We're letting too many games get away. It was
a game we could have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby just wasn't as diplomatic when he explained this to the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing we didn't deserve to hear,'' senior guard Adam Spanich
said. ``We need to stop being so selfish. Everybody needs to look
in the mirror and realize what they need to do to help the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking and snickering doesn't help the team. Guys need to
stop complaining about how we do things, saying things like `We
don't run this play or that play.' That includes everybody on the
team. Coach had a reality check and asked if everybody is with him
and they said they are.''
</P>
<P>
   They just didn't show it against the Cougars (9-11, 3-6),
falling behind 16-5 at the outset and spending the rest of the
contest trying to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``No heart. I'm embarrassed and ashamed,'' Spanich said. ``It
hurts bad. I hate it. It shouldn't be happening like this.''
</P>
<P>
   What made this loss worse than the others during this losing
streak is that it followed one of USC's best games of the year, an
85-83 loss to Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As well as we played against Washington, we played just as bad
tonight,'' Bibby said. ``You can't give up 95 points and think
you'll be in a basketball game.''
</P>
<P>
   This was also viewed as one of those rare remaining road games
left on the schedule that USC might have had a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   But USC trailed by 13 points at halftime and fell behind by 20
(78-58) with 6:01 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (10-8, 2-7) then showed their resilience and began
chipping away at the deficit. Elias Ayuso (a game-high 22 points)
hit a pair of 3-pointers down the stretch, with Spanich and Jeff
Trepagnier also hitting long-range shots. USC cut the lead to seven
points (93-86) with 28 seconds left, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played very well the last five minutes, but when you're
down 16, 17 points, it's tough to get back,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news for the Trojans is that month is finally
over, a disastrous four-week stretch that saw USC go 2-7. USC
hasn't won since Jan. 9, and Bibby was asked if he was wondering if
the Trojans might ever win again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more optimistic than that,'' Bibby said. ``This team has a
lot of character. If we can hang in the game, we can win down the
stretch. We're short a couple pieces and we're young.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Former Chatsworth High player Eddie Miller, a sophomore
forward, had 13 points and four rebounds for the Cougars....
Jan-Michael Thomas and Kojo Mensah-Bonsu led the Cougars with 21
points each.... Washington State set USC opponent season highs in
free throws attempted (39) and free throws made (33).

   LOS ANGELES _ The smell of fresh paint lingered in the depths of
the Sports Arena _ an odd new fragrance and a seemingly pointless
makeover for a building doomed to its last season as an NBA
outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else was as good as old, from the dark upper reaches
of the third deck to the dim prospects down on the floor, as the
Clippers opened their final season in the venerable old building
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In their final exhibition tuneup, the hosts looked as
overmatched as ever against their cross-town rivals, losing to the
Lakers, sans Shaquille O'Neal, 91-77 before 16,021. The Lakers
wrapped up the exhibition season 2-0, the Clippers 0-2, after their
two-night set.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, bothered by tendinitis in his right knee, skipped
shootaround and did not dress for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The injury isn't serious, but coach Del Harris withheld O'Neal
on the premise that practice time is more important than exhibition
games in the brief period the Lakers have before opening the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather have him for practice than for the game, actually.
So hopefully we'll have him for practice (today),'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal could have played if needed. Instead, he'll go through
light drills today in the hopes he can practice at full speed the
rest of the week. The Lakers open the season Friday against Houston
at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game, obviously, doesn't mean anything, whereas our
practices are vital to us now,'' Harris said. ``That's where you
get your habits re-established, on execution of both offense and
defense. We've got a short time as it is, so we need all the
practice time we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   And the game provided ample evidence of that. Elden Campbell,
subbing for O'Neal, was the only Lakers starter to score in double
figures, with 13. Kobe Bryant added 16 off the bench. But the
starting backcourt of Eddie Jones and Derek Fisher struggled,
combining to hit 5 of 18 shots.
</P>
<P>
   With the season due to start in seven days, Harris mostly stuck
with his veterans. Ruben Patterson was the only rookie to see
significant playing time, logging 14 minutes. Rookies Tyronn Lue
and Sam Jacobson _ who missed Friday's game with a strained right
hip flexor _ didn't enter the game until the 3:10 mark in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took the lead for good, at 39-37, with 5:36 left in
the first half, and the Clippers rarely got closer than eight
points for the duration.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Rogers scored a game-high 18 points to lead five Clippers
in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Good Knight: Travis Knight's 14 rebounds and 10 points in 17
minutes Friday night qualified as the best line of the game. Knight
said he still has work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game obviously feels good to get off on the right
foot. But there were still a lot of mistakes I made in that game,''
he said. ``Just getting in the flow. As a team we need to get some
game-time experience and learn how to react to other guys on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Knight _ a Laker again after a season with Boston _
doesn't mind getting used to is the presence of O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a new appreciation for all the things that Shaq does,
just his presence,'' Knight said. ``Sometimes you don't realize
what his presence does for you until you go play somewhere else
without it.''

KAFELNIKOV AUSSIE CHAMP 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ One day, when his gleaming career is packed away,
Yevgeny Kafelnikov will be the first Russian player of countryman
Leo Tolstoy's favorite game _ tennis _ to march into the Hall of
Fame at Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   That seems well in the future, with a lot of war and peace in
between for the sometimes volatile man from Sochi on the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But he will be only 25 next month, and his triumph over burly
Swede Thomas Enquist Sunday gave him the Australian Open title, his
second major. That's the usual minimum for a berth among the game's
gods, and he seems capable of more.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov broke into the select major winners' club by beating
Pete Sampras and Michael Stich in succession for the French
championship in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A superstitious Yevgeny, who promised to shave his rusty,
scraggly beard ``when I win the title _ the way Bjorn Borg used to
do,'' was too slick and quick for No. 21 Enqvist, 4-6, 6-0, 6-3,
7-6 (7-1). The 24-year-old Swede's boisterous cheering sections
were finally muted by his concluding double fault in the
tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we go for a family double,'' exhulted Larry Stefanki,
Kafelnikov's new coach. Stefanki, a Californian, is the
brother-in-law of Super Bowl quarterback Chris Chandler of the
Falcons, having married another of John Brodie's daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time, in Paris, I didn't understand really what it was
all about,'' said Kafelnikov, who won the French Open in 1996.
``This time I can really enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   He saluted the missing No. 1, Sampras: ``Here's a message to
Pete _ thanks for letting me do this. It's an awesome feeling.''
Sampras, with 11 majors, would have been a huge favorite, but
copped the plea of mental weariness.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no tournament for favorites, and Sampras's presence
wouldn't have guaranteed victory. Kafelnikov came in No. 10 (he
rises to No. 3), and Enqvist was bidding to become the Aussie's
second unseeded champion, following Mark Edmondson in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Enqvist was a deceptive nonseed since the broad-shouldered 6
foot-3-inch Swede has been a top-10 player, hobbled until recently
by injuries, and now ascends 10 lengths to No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   He was the bludgeon to the springy Kafelnikov's rapier. Enqvist
also was the crowd's man, not just the blue-and-gold compatriots
who sang and chanted his name. Because he had singlehandedly
destroyed the homeland thrust _ Patrick Rafter and Mark
Philippoussis _ Aussies felt he ought to win.
</P>
<P>
   His battering ram forehand and six aces (of 19) carried the
opening set, all right, but the Russian began to chase down too
many of the blasts, and Enqvist began to miss _ 62 unforced errors
to the champion's 35.
</P>
<P>
   Enqvist barely came out ahead in the opening set, holding to 6-4
through four deuces and a break point.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Kafelnikov, with his wristy forehand flicks and low
sliced backhands went on a toot like the train that ran over
Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, racing down the track for nine straight
games to 3-0 in the third over a barren stretch of 43 minutes for
the Swede.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know if Thomas can handle the pressure of such
a final,'' Kafelnikov had said, and Enqvist proved him correct,
faltering in the crunches as the lethal forehand made friends with
the net.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov's strokemaking variety and ability to take the ball
early kept Enqvist off-balance in a contest fought almost entirely
from the baseline _ not one serve-and-volley point!
</P>
<P>
   ``Yevgeny was too consistent for me,'' said the loser. The
winner will one day want to get the directions to Newport.

   LOS ANGELES _ The smell of fresh paint lingered in the depths of
the Sports Arena _ an odd new fragrance and a seemingly pointless
makeover for a building doomed to its last season as an NBA
outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else was as stale as ever, from the dark upper
reaches of the third deck to the dim prospects down on the floor,
as the Clippers opened their final season in the venerable old
building Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In their final exhibition tuneup, the hosts were overmatched
again against their cross-town rivals, losing to the Lakers, sans
Shaquille O'Neal, 91-77 before 16,021. The Lakers wrapped up the
exhibition season 2-0 against the Clippers in the two-night set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I told you the Clippers would play better tonight and
they did,'' Lakers coach Del Harris said, ignoring the 14-point
winning margin.
</P>
<P>
   And that gap would have been larger if O'Neal, bothered by
tendinitis in his right knee, hadn't been in street clothes. The
injury isn't serious, but Harris withheld O'Neal on the premise
that practice time is more important than exhibition games in the
brief period the Lakers have before opening the season. The Lakers
open the season Friday against Houston at the Forum and Harris
wants O'Neal to be able to practice all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game, obviously, doesn't mean anything, whereas our
practices are vital to us now,'' Harris said. ``We've got a short
time as it is, so we need all the practice time we can get.''

<P>
   And the game provided ample evidence of that. Elden Campbell,
subbing for O'Neal, was the only Lakers starter to score in double

else scored more than nine.

significant playing time, logging 14 minutes. Rookies Tyronn Lue
and Sam Jacobson _ who returned after missing Friday's game with a
strained right hip flexor _ didn't enter the game until the 3:10
mark in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you only have such limited time, you want to get your key
guys enough action,'' Harris said. ``We know that these rookies are
not going to be a big part of what we do as the season begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Rogers scored a game-high 18 points to lead five Clippers
in double figures. James Robinson and Lamond Murray added 13 each
and Tyrone Nesby strengthened his bid to make the team with 11
points in 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Good Knight: Travis Knight's 14 rebounds and 10 points in 17
minutes Friday night qualified as the best line of the game. Knight
said he still has work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game obviously feels good to get off on the right
foot. But there were still a lot of mistakes I made in that game,''
said Knight, who posted eight points and eight rebounds Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a Laker again after a season with Boston, said it's
taken time for him to reacquaint himself with teammates, but he's
more than happy to readjust to O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a new appreciation for all the things that Shaq does,
just his presence,'' Knight said. ``Sometimes you don't realize
what his presence does for you until you go play somewhere else

HULL APPOINT MENT TILTS COMMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Gov. Jane Hull recently appointed two new members to
the five-man Arizona Game and Fishing Commission, which sets policy
for the state Game and Fish Department.
</P>
<P>
   Hays Gilstrap of Phoenix was appointed to fill the unexpired
term of Jean Hassell of Scottsdale, who resigned from the
commission last fall and moved to New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The other appointment was Joe Carter of Safford, who was named
to replace Herb Guenther of Tacna, whose term had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Both new appointees are successful businessmen and avid
outdoorsmen. I have been told that both are well qualified to be
commissioners, although both have big shoes to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Hassell had tremendous experience in public land management and
other areas that made him a valuable commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Guenther was perhaps as thoughtful and diplomatic a man as the
commission ever has seen. He also has a degree in wildlife biology.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances both of the new appointees, who must
be confirmed by the Senate, probably would meet no opposition. But
Carter will.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge will have nothing to do with any of his
qualifications except one _ he lives in Safford. That's not an
insult to the town. It's a geographical problem.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor enthusiasts helped create the commission. Commissioners
were to create a buffer between the Legislature and the department.
In other words, there would be no political pressure on wildlife
management. The department gets no money from state tax funds.
</P>
<P>
   The state is so diverse in its topography and wildlife that
traditionally commissioners have been named from geographic areas.
One each from the north, south, east and west plus one floater.
That floater usually is from the Phoenix area, which makes sense
since the vast majority of the state's population is here, and it
also is in the central part of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And here lies the problem: Guenther's home, Tacna, is near Yuma
in the western part of the state. Carter's home, Safford, is far to
the east.
</P>
<P>
   The east already has a representative in Dennis Manning of
Alpine.
</P>
<P>
   Now a challenge might seem like a silly thing if the candidate
is qualified, but it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado River country of western Arizona has far different
needs and understanding than that of the east. These two areas have
almost nothing in common.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what Hull was thinking. Perhaps she didn't know. To
leave out representation from the western part of the state is
almost unthinkable. Phoenix would be the westernmost part of the
state represented. No commissioner here would have that much
knowledge of needs and problems in the west.
</P>
<P>
   The Yuma Valley Rod &AMP; Gun Club, the largest sportsman's group in
the western part of the state, reacted to Hull's appointment with
shock.
</P>
<P>
   It pointed out to Hull in a letter that the western part of the
state has been represented for 35 consecutive years. It also
pointed out that its objections were not a personal attack on
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   It wants knowledgeable representation for the Colorado River
region.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildlife Conservation Advisory Council, a conglomerate of 28
hunting and fishing organizations that it says represents 40,000
people, also has jumped into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   It, too, has no problems with Carter's qualifications. But it
believes Carter should be named in three years when Manning's term
expires.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Hull, Joe Melton, president of the council, wrote
the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the hope of the council that we do not have to embarrass
your office and Mr. Joe Carter during the Senate confirmation
hearings. Most all would agree that Arizona or any other western
state could not be fairly represented in the United State Senate if
all the senators lived east of the Mississippi River.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Hull has nothing but tradition to keep her from
naming whomever she wishes. But this isn't right.
</P>
<P>
   I just can't believe that there isn't a good commissioner in
Yuma, Lake Havasu City, Kingman, Bullhead City or somewhere else in
the West, somebody who understands Colorado River country.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping Hull can work this out some way, but it won't be
easy. &QL;

SOME SOAR, SOME CRASH  
 ASU'S '98 RECRUITS DRAW MIXED REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - In its press release, Arizona State called the
1998 recruiting class ``one of the most highly touted in the
school's history.'' It also was one of the most uneven.
</P>
<P>
   The class produced standout tight end Todd Heap and two starting
defensive lineman. It also produced seven players that are no
longer on ASU's roster. Four either quit or were dismissed, and
three never qualified academically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The calendar for recruiting, it's a factory,'' ASU Coach Bruce
Snyder said. ``You end up signing players when there is still work
to be done. It involves some gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe the core of this class is excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Two players, defensive back Kyion Graves and defensive linemen
Ryan Pittinger, were kicked off the team. Pittinger wouldn't
specify why he was told to leave, only that it was a ``Chad
Elliott-type thing.'' He is still enrolled at the university but
likely will transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder acknowledged he doesn't like losing players, but for ASU,
letting go of the two ``was the prudent and right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another recruit, 6-foot-6 offensive lineman Adam Williams, from
Garland, Texas, left during freshman drills and seemed overwhelmed
by the college experience.
</P>
<P>
   Three recruits _ Casa Grande wide receiver Joey Graves, Mesa
Mountain View offensive lineman Damien Niko and Tucson offensive
lineman Ralph Zarate _ never made it into the program because they
failed to qualify academically.
</P>
<P>
   Zarate was a holdover from the 1997 class for which ASU retained
a scholarship. He is enrolled in a junior college and likely will
join the team in 2000. The Sun Devils are holding a scholarship for
Niko this recruiting season because they believe he will qualify
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder believes the risk for the two is worth it because they
will eventually join the program.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, the Sun Devils will benefit from the losses this
signing. Extra roster spots will allow them to sign between 27 and
29 players, one of their biggest classes ever.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players who left, tight end Aaron Winterswyk, quit
the team during the season after he said Snyder questioned his
commitment. The player had returned home several times during the
season, at Snyder's blessing, to deal with some personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Winterswyk, who is back home in La Habra Heights, Calif., and
taking classes at Orange Coast College, said he had trouble
communicating with Snyder. But Snyder said Winterswyk would avoid
coming to his office to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kicked a couple of guys off the team and suggested I could
leave if I wasn't into it,'' Winterswyk said. ``The whole program
really kind of burned me out on football.''
</P>
<P>
   Winterswyk insists he does not hold a grudge against the program
and said he had a good relationship with tight ends coach Dick
Arbuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Do several of the ``misses'' from the 1998 class reflect the
program's no-nonsense approach to discipline? Do they also suggest
a tendency to miss potential risks? Snyder said his staff does as
thorough a background check on recruits as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ASU recently restructured its Academic Services department to
help fight the attrition problem with Sun Devil athletes.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Sun Devils have pulled back on several
high-profile recruits after learning of academic, or other,
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 class was fruitful in several areas. It produced two
defensive line starters _ Junior Ioane and Erik Flowers _ as well
as two other players, tight end Heap and defensive back Willie
Daniel, who saw plenty of playing time. Several others, including
defensive lineman Mike Pinkard and defensive back Brandon Faulkner,
could be impact players down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he is also pleased with the 1998 class because it is
further along than any other freshman class he has had in terms of
conditioning.

PAC-10 COMPETITIVE IN RECRUITING  
 NEW COACHES SHOW THEY CAN CLOSE GAPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Two coaching changes, a team that went from first to
worst and a poor showing in the postseason didn't keep the Pac-10
from landing some of the nation's top high school and junior
college football recruits.
</P>
<P>
   With national letter of intent day just three days away, the
conference is having one of the strongest showings in the nation
from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those teams are doing well,'' said Allen Wallace, the
editor of ``SuperPrep'' magazine and online service. ``It's a
highly competitive conference that's appealing to many of the top
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivalnet, an Internet site that posts a national Top 25 based on
several recruiting lists, ranks three Pac-10 teams in its Top 10,
the most by any league. The Big Ten, Big 12 and Southeastern
Conference each had two.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, USC and Arizona are ranked fifth, eighth and ninth,
respectively. Five more teams _ California, Arizona State,
Stanford, Oregon and Washington State _ fall between 12th and 18th.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins and Trojans are Nos. 4 and 9, respectively by
``SuperPrep.'' California (17), Arizona (18), Stanford (20) and ASU
(23) also fall in the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars have been the biggest surprise, landing several
marquee players despite a last-place finish in 1998. Washington
State appears to still be capitalizing on its Rose Bowl appearance
two seasons ago and has secured a class that includes Matt Kegel, a
6-foot-5 quarterback from Montana who happens to be Ryan Leaf's
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Other big names who are expected to sign (oral commitments are
non-binding) include Jeremy Williams, a 6-foot-5 defensive lineman
from Spokane, Wash., and Josh Shavies, a 6-7 tight end from
Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe (the tough season) made us work even harder,'' Cougars
Coach Mike Price said. ``I think a lot of the success, at least
perceived success, is through word of mouth of our other players.
And that makes me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   The other surprise is that Washington and Oregon State seem to
be holding their own despite head-coaching changes in the
off-season. Although the two probably are running near the bottom
of the league, they are starting to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, who fired Jim Lambright and replaced him with
former Colorado Coach Rick Neuheisel, secured a big-time commitment
late last week from Paul Arnold, a tailback from Seattle's Kennedy
High School. They also landed Cody Pickett, a 6-4 quarterback from
Idaho that had caught the eye of a variety of schools, including
ASU.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pickett, who had a strong interest in Washington early
on, found himself recruited aggressively again after Lambright's
firing. In the minds of other schools, he was fair game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to stop and think, of course,'' Pickett said. ``It made
it harder because I liked the other schools that were recruiting
me. But Washington still felt right.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU was among the schools that felt a need to adjust following
the coaching changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It obviously changed our recruiting (process) because we
recruit against Washington and Colorado and to a lesser degree
Oregon State,'' Sun Devils Coach Bruce Snyder said. ``But I think
as it washes out, at least in terms of our recruiting, it really
didn't cause any kind of major shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sent ripples, and it sent some guys doubting and this and
that, but in the final analysis, I think it's going to end up the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the coaching change caused some Huskies recruits to
rethink their strategy, Neuheisel, who has a reputation as a strong
recruiter, kept the change from being a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State, which lost Coach Mike Riley to the San Diego
Chargers, replaced him with a high-profile figure, Dennis Erickson,
who had been fired by the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often with a coaching switch comes a huge sense of optimism,''
Wallace said. ``Generally speaking, when someone gets fired a
recruit thinks someone better is going to get the job. They think
in short spatial periods anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers are going for a quick-fix approach and at least nine
of their recruits are expected to come from junior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, on the heels of a 12-1 season, are doing well in and
out of the state. It landed much sought-after Bobby Wade, the
running back from Desert Vista, and two high-profile out-of-state
linebackers: Lance Briggs of Elk Grove, Calif., and Joe Sioffle of
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats were the only Pac-10 team to win in the postseason.
Four others lost.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA appears to have the strongest class in the conference. The
Bruins' top picks include 6-3 quarterback J.P. Losman of Venice,
Calif., 6-7 offensive lineman Bryce Bolhander of Salem, Ore., and
6-5 offensive lineman Shane Lehmann of Corona, Calif. At least
seven recruits are 6-4 or taller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think the Pac-10 is a closely packed group,'' Wallace
said. ``I don't anticipate any program establishing any significant
advantage at this point. They're all doing well.'' &QL;

UA FRESHMEN SHOW SIGNS OF MATURITY  
 WILDCATS BREEZE PAST CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TUCSON _ Television critics would have panned Arizona's showing
Saturday against California, but Coach Lute Olson hopes it gets
renewed for the Pac-10's second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats had been a made-for-television drama, taking each
of the previous six games to the final scene no matter the plot
lines along the way. But riding the efficiency of Thursday's upset
of No. 3 Stanford, Arizona sustained a big lead for a change, to
the point that Jason Terry actually watched the final three minutes
of slop from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's 91-74 victory, its 26th straight at McKale Center, was
its biggest since a 48-point home rout of Holy Cross on Dec. 28.
And it came against a team that Olson picked in the preseason to
finish as Pac-10 runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hardly know how to act when it doesn't come down to the last
possession,'' Olson said. ``It was a welcome relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Tossing out the final 2:30 of garbage time, Arizona scored on 60
percent of its possessions to look nearly as efficient as
Thursday's six-turnover effort. The 13th-ranked Wildcats (15-3, 7-2
Pac-10) shot a season-high 57 percent and never trailed. They
bursted to an 18-6 lead off Michael Wright's energy. Wright
accounted for six points and four rebounds in the first 2:30.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Terry's transition push helped the Wildcats sink 10
straight baskets for a 26-10 lead. Arizona finished the half by
scoring on six straight possessions, including two A.J. Bramlett
hooks backed by nine straight Terry points for a 51-33 halftime
bulge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got better this week more than any other,'' said
Terry, who shook off a horrible game in last week's Oregon State
loss and 15 pounds of illness-related weight loss for a brilliant
week. ``It takes games like Stanford really to get yourself going.
It's the focus more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry's health was back up well enough to go into his ``alley
cat'' jig when his seven straight points held off Cal's biggest
second-half threat. The Golden Bears (12-7, 3-6) closed the gap to
73-62 with 8:15 remaining, but went into a 1-for-9, four-turnover
funk for the next six minutes as Arizona opened up a 91-65 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the five-freshman team's lack of a killer instinct.
Leading the youngsters, Wright had a 15-point, 12-rebound night and
Douglas scored 10 in eight first-half reserve minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've grown up so much this week,'' Bramlett said. ``We've
become a team so much more than in the past. We can move into the
second half with some momentum. We're just starting to come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson is tickled to take a team with so many key freshman to 7-2
at the Pac-10 turn. The rookie quintet has accounted for 54 percent
of Arizona players' minutes, 47 percent of the offense and 45
percent of the rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   But his credit starts with Bramlett and Terry for their daily
senior leadership and junior Eugene Edgerson, who was a defensive
menace Saturday on the interior and finished with four steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing a better job with the screens, the defense, and
we are getting good ball movement,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Cal entered Pac-10 play at 11-1, but again looked like a
reckless, frustrated team. Just when Geno Carlisle appeared to have
busted his shooting slump, Terry made challenging him a No. 1
priority and enticed a 5-of-17 night from him.
</P>
<P>
   Terry let the offense come to him, and it happened in
transition, where he picked up most of his points on 9-of-14
shooting from the field and 6-for-6 free-throw marksmanship. His
shakes actually turned defender Raymond King full circle on one
possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's Arizona team is like night and day compared to
last year's team,'' King said. ``Jason Terry put on one of the best
shows that a guy has put on against me in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal came into the game ranked third in the conference in scoring
defense at 67.2 a game, but gave up the most points it had all
season. For the Wildcats, it was their best week of the season,
putting themselves a game out of first with five of their remaining
nine Pac-10 games at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd probably come out with more ails than we did,''
Terry said. ``This team amazes me, and there's more room for
improvement.'' &QL;

ANOTHER LATE DUVAL MIRACLE IS IMPROBABLE  
 66 STILL LEAVES HIM 9 SHOTS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ.- Can lightning strike twice in two weeks for
David Duval?
</P>
<P>
   Last week Duval entered the final round of the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic trailing leader Fred Funk by 7 shots and fired the first
final-day 59 in PGA Tour history to beat Steve Pate by 1 stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Duval flashed signs of last week's form Saturday by cranking out
a snappy 66, tying for the low round of this year's Phoenix Open,
and moved himself to within 3 strokes of second place Tiger Woods
at 2 under. But he's 9 strokes behind leader Rocco Mediate, who's
playing a tournament all by himself at 11 under after shooting 66
himself.
</P>
<P>
   So the truth probably is that while Duval routinely performs
miracles with his golf sticks, digging himself out of a hole left
by two days at 3 over will be the equivalent of making a sand save
from the Sahara Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Or Mediate will have to break a leg and Duval will have to shoot
a . . . well, another 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to shoot a 59 on this course, I know that,''
said Harrison Frazar, who's in a three-way tie for third at 4
under. ``If they do, they need to go directly to the Hall of
Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Duval has finally put the 59 behind him. For much
of the early part of this week, he said the hullabaloo surrounding
his miraculous 59 was behind him. It wasn't hurting his game.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's round, the world's No. 2-ranked golfer finally
admitted it did bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally started to get my timing and rhythm back today. I
played better and holed a couple of putts,'' he said. ``In
retrospect, it did kind of feel like this tournament started
quicker than it should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was primed on Thursday, but I still felt like I
was jumping around on the 18th green in Palm Springs. It was kind
of tough. At some point, I knew I was going to have to start
playing again. It took me a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also admitted that his early struggles had just as much
to do with a Tournament Players Course that has grown fangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course is playing very different from the past,'' he
said. ``The rough and greens are different, and it's a lot tougher
to get the ball to the hole than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played OK here in the past, but I was always baffled by
the (low) scores. What did Steve Jones shoot here when he won a few
years ago _ 26 under? I just never saw that here. I like how its
playing now, rather than having to shoot 26 under to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval hoped to start today's final round within 5 or 6 shots of
the lead and allow nature take its course. But with Mediate on an
island to himself, one might think Duval will set a target figure
and aggressively go after the course . . . and Mediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find you start to press when you do that,'' he said. ``Who
would've thought somebody would shoot 5 under today? You don't
really know when things are going to come together, so that's why I
don't set a target figure. You have to let your game and how you're
playing that day dictate your game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when the course is playing so much more difficult
that it used to. If you set a goal for 6 or 7 under, you can really
get into trouble here and start pressing. You might start finding
yourself throwing some 7- or 8-irons at the flag when you
shouldn't. That's when you make bogeys.''
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for a pair of double bogeys on Friday, the first
when he 3-putted No. 18 while completing Thursday's
darkness-shortened round and the second during Friday's regular
round at No. 12, he would be within 5 shots of Mediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate double bogeys _ just hate 'em,'' Duval said. ``One was
just silly. I bladed a chip over the green and some elderly lady
said, `I coulda done that.' I just laughed. It's true. I'm sure she
could've bladed one just like I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of have to enjoy the cracks they make here. If not,
you're just not going to have a lot of success here.'' &QL;

WOODS LURKING AT OPEN  
 6 SHOTS BACK BUT HE'S GOT CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ.- Tiger Woods said he hit plenty of shots
Saturday that he'd like to take over, but he was up to the
challenge on the one he needed most.
</P>
<P>
   Woods knocked in a 10-foot birdie putt at his final hole of the
day, the ninth hole, putting him at 5-under 208 and 6 shots behind
leader Rocco Mediate heading into today's final round of the
Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   Had he missed the putt and finished at 4-under, Woods would not
have been paired with Mediate in the final group, and as he saw it,
being in the same pairing gives him the best chance of staging a
comeback win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really needed to make that putt,'' said Woods, who shot
1-under 70 for the round. ``Now if I can get off to a hot start and
put some heat on him, at least he has a chance to look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods carded four birdies and three bogeys on a day when he
said, ``I just couldn't get anything going.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting on the back nine, Woods bogeyed the 12th hole but fired
back-to-back birdies at the 14th and 15th, putting him at 5-under
and, at the time, within 2 shots of Mediate. From there, they went
in opposite directions, with Woods falling behind by as many as 7
before his much-needed birdie putt on his last hole.
</P>
<P>
   It would take one terrific comeback to catch Mediate, but if any
one has shown the ability to do that, it's Woods. He came from
eight shots back last year to catch Ernie Els in the final round of
the Johnnie Walker Classic and won the title in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone, if they get it going (today) . . . I think someone
can realistically shoot something in the low 60s,'' Woods said.
``But if you get too aggressive going into these pins and
short-sight yourself with these little bowls and valleys, you're
not going to shoot a very low score.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make sure you play smart, give yourself some
chances. So you go ahead and attack if you can attack, but you pick
your spots.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Woods definitely will have on his side is fan support,
as has been obvious the first three days. Shouts of ``Tiger'' ring
out every hole, and while Mediate also had some fan support on
Saturday, there were negative comments directed at him as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a couple stupid comments today towards me, but I don't
care,'' Mediate said. ``I can't stop them. That's how they feel,
that's fine. I'm not going to do anything about it. It's not like
they're trying to hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Mediate's steady play under those conditions, Woods
said he doesn't expect the hoopla to be a big factor today. It
could, however, be a distraction for young Harrison Frazar, who is
in his second year on the PGA Tour and is paired in the final group
that tees off at 11:05 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Rocco is, I don't think it will affect him at all,``
Woods said. ``Rocco is very loose. Just smiles all the time . . .
hits a bad shot and no big deal. Goes about his business. That's
just the way he's always been. It's his personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediate definitely has been the more steady of the two through
the first three rounds, putting together scores of 69, 67 and 66,
respectively, which tied for the lowest round of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who started Saturday's round 2 strokes behind, has shot
71, 67 and 70. His erratic tee shots, he said, have given him the
most problems, and it's something he planned to work on this
morning in hopes of getting off to a better start and putting
pressure on Mediate.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenge Mediate said he's looking forward to facing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this to happen,'' he said. ``If I can pull it off, I
should be able to win in any situation. And Tiger will be firing. I
know how he is. He wanted _ ``I know'' _ he wanted to make that
last putt and play in that last group.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wanted to play with him. Because I want to be there and
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Those feelings definitely are mutual. &QL;

GOLFER'S FATHER AIDS VICTIM OF SEI ZURE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - The 10th hole at Scottsdale's Tournament
Players Course will not soon be forgotten for the Family Kaye of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   While son  &UR; Jonathan Kaye was preparing to chip back to the green
in hopes of salvaging par, his spectator father, Dr.  &UR; Joel Kaye,
was suddenly rendering aid to an elderly woman who was suffering a
grand mal seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who was not identified by medical officials, was
taken to Mayo Clinic-Phoenix, where she was reported conscious and
in stable condition, while undergoing further observation.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports on CBS television said the woman had a heart
attack and Dr. Kaye had administered CPR (cardiopulmonary
resuscitation), but Dr. Kaye, a pediatrician, said that wasn't
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an elderly lady who was having a seizure,'' he said.
``Her daughter was also there, who is a nurse. She is a pretty
healthy woman and when the seizure stopped, she was stable. I
didn't have to perform CPR.
</P>
<P>
   ``She opened her eyes as I comforted her and said, ``What the
hell is going on?'' Then the paramedics came and did what they
needed to do at that point. I don't know her medical history, but
she probably had a stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   The seizure definitely put a somber tone on what is a fun-filled
event, a fact that wasn't lost on Dr. Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most bizarre thing is after I realized she was OK and
there was nothing I could do at that moment, I looked up and saw
Jonathan standing there and I realized we were in the middle of a
golf tournament,'' he said. ``It seemed surreal. I realized he was
having trouble, and I wished I could help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kaye, who started the day 3 strokes off the tournament
lead, double-bogeyed the hole and bogeyed the next en route to
finishing with a 76 to put him 13 strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely got off to a bad start,'' he said. ``I hit my
drive in the rough, then hit it into a bunker and then I hit it
over the green and the lady collapsed. We kind of sat around until
she could be helped and then I chilly-dipped a chip shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have too many good things to say about my day.'' &QL; 
Odd couple &QL; 
 &UR; Justin Leonard and  &UR; Harrison Frazar, both of whom were on the
leader board at 4-under par after Saturday's round, are close
friends who also were college roommates at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Frazar, who matched the low round of the week with a 5-under 66
Saturday, said he and Leonard had an Oscar and Felix kind of
relationship as roommates.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' he said. ``He's, you know, he organizes his
sock drawer. He's got them color coded. I'm lucky if I have them
washed.'' &QL; 
In the spotlight &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frazar, who's in his second year on the PGA Tour, is in for an
experience, being paired in today's final group with  &UR; Tiger Woods
and
 &UR; Rocco Mediate. Like Woods, Frazar made it into the final pairing
with a birdie putt at the last hole.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas native posted three top-10 finishes as a rookie last
year, but hasn't been subjected to the pressures of playing in an
event with huge, rowdy crowds like the Phoenix Open in the final
group.
</P>
<P>
   While the other two also have the experience of playing the TPC
of Scottsdale in other years, Frazar says it might be working in
his favor to be playing the course for the first time this week.
That's because with added length, harder greens and deeper rough,
it isn't playing the same as it did in previous years. &QL; 
Hearing boos &QL; 
The biggest jeers on the 16th hole Saturday were directed at
Mediate's tee shot, but he didn't take exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deserve to be booed,'' said Mediate, who scrambled to par
the hole. ``It was a horrible shot. It was terrible. I should have
been booed. But they did applaud my chip, which was better.''
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time Mediate had been booed in a tournament?
</P>
<P>
   ``The same hole last year,'' he said. ``But like I said
(Friday), if you can't deal with that, don't come here.'' &QL;

EXPANSION TEAM'S GM HITTING ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NHL has trophies for just about everything. If the league
ever gave one out for the team executive who racked up the most
frequent-flier miles in a single year, the undisputed champion
would be  &UR; Don Waddell, the vice president and general manager of
the expansion Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   He's been on the road so much, scouting players and personnel to
get the Thrashers ready for their debut next season, the bags under
his eyes are about as big as the ones he lugs around from airport
to airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've only been home for one day during the entire
month of January,'' said Waddell, who was checking up on the
Coyotes last week during their trip through the East Coast. ``It's
been a pretty hectic schedule, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's complaining. It was exactly this kind of hard work
and tireless energy that enabled Waddell to do something few NHL
executives have been able to accomplish in recent history. Start at
rock bottom, as he did in the 1980s with the fledgling San Diego
Gulls of the International Hockey League, and slowly climb up the
ladder of success to where he is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donny's going to be great GM,'' Detroit Red Wings Senior Vice
President  &UR; Jim Devellano predicted. ``Nobody works harder.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Poile, the veteran general manager of the expansion
Nashville Predators, has been drawing rave reviews for the
successful way he constructed his organization. Expect Waddell to
get double the praise by this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He already scares me,'' said one veteran NHL scout, who
continually runs into Waddell on the road, even in the smallest of
hockey towns.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell's building process will be different than that of
Poile's, the 15-year executive who put the Predators together
mostly by a sea of pre- and post-expansion draft trades and a river
of deals based on ``future considerations,'' including two with the
Coyotes involving
 &UR; Cliff Ronning and  &UR; J.J. Daigneault.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will focus on the draft to stockpile its future, meaning
the club probably won't be a playoff contender anytime soon. But if
Waddell does it right, and he and his assistants probably will, the
Thrashers will be an annual contender well before the Predators.
</P>

   The only high-priced free agent the team will consider would be
a No. 1 goalie, Waddell said. But that's only if the Thrashers
can't land the goalie they want in the June expansion draft, where
most NHL teams will likely only protect one netminder.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Waddell will keep hitting the road. He has his third
trip of the calendar year to Europe coming up. There are trainers
and equipment men to hire. And in April or May, he will begin his
interviews for a head coach. It will be someone with previous NHL
head coaching experience, he said. Former Buffalo Coach  &UR; Ted Nolan
has been identified as one of the many potential early candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want somebody with some security in the business,'' Waddell
said. ``Somebody who's been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, unlike Waddell, who's never around at home, according to
wife
 &UR; Cheryl and 10-year-old daughter  &UR; Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to take them to the All-Star Game in Tampa, though,''
Waddell said. ``That was nice. Unfortunately, though, I'm right
back on the road for 12 straight days. . . . When the puck drops on
Opening Night, it's going to be totally release for me. OK, we made
it. By the time the third period rolls around, it's going to be,
`OK, now we need to win the game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fortunate that way. I've won all my home openers
where I've been in this game.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Sabres veteran enforcer  &UR; Rob Ray was sitting in front of
his locker talking about the Coyotes when teammates  &UR; Alexei Zhitnik
politely interrupted the conversation to ask Ray a favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you pick me up tonight again and drive me to the game?''
Zhitnik asked, almost apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure. No problem, Alex,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   As Zhitnik walked away, Ray turned to a visitor and shook his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid millionaires,'' he said. ``The guy's got more money
than God, and he's only got one car. What's with all these guys
anyway? These young players today make all this money and when they
need their car, their wife or their girlfriend's got it or it's in
the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a Taurus that's about six or seven years old and all
the guys make fun of it. But who do you think they call when they
need a ride? Me!''
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Ray just load them all up in the Taurus, drive them
to a car dealer, and tell the players he's not driving them home
unless they pick out new cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't work,'' Ray said. ``They're all too cheap to do
something like that.'' &QL; 
Frank and Bob
</P>
<P>
   The early votes are starting to creep in around the league and
guess who's emerging as one of the top candidates to win the Frank
J. Selke Trophy as the NHL's best defensive forward?
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes center  &UR; Bob Corkum, who quietly has become one of the
game's best faceoff men, penalty killers and shadowers of the top
offensive skaters around. Corkum has heard his name mentioned for
the award, something that almost makes him feel uncomfortable, but
honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most definitely, just to be mentioned in the same breath as
some of those guys is a big thrill,'' Corkum said. ``To be put in
the same class as a guy like (Buffalo's)  &UR; Michael Peca or a  &UR; Jere
Lehtinen of Dallas, those guys are two of the greatest defensive
forwards out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he like his chances?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Corkum said. ``I guess it depends how the team
does down the stretch. Obviously, your goaltenders and your overall
team defense plays a big role in that. Maybe if that was the only
criteria, my chances might be pretty good. But who knows? I'll just
go and out and play the same way and continue to try and keep the
puck out of our zone as much as I can, continue to win faceoffs and
do what I can to help the team.'' &QL; 
Book plug
</P>
<P>
   We usually don't like to use this space for free publicity, but
hockey fans _ especially those of the Toronto Maple Leafs _ should
pick up a copy of ``Toronto Sun'' writer  &UR; Lance Hornby's new book,
``The'' ``Story of Maple Leaf Gardens, 100 Memories at Church and
Carlton''.
</P>
<P>
   It's more coffee-table reading than anything, but it contains
fascinating photos and some keen insight on hockey's Grand Ol'
Dame, which will be closing its door on the Maple Leafs in a couple
weeks. To order it, call 1-800-327-5557. &QL;

COYOTES READY FOR ENCORE  
 PLAYERS HOPE TO ATONE FOR 1ST LOSS IN NASHVILLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ The last time the Coyotes came to Music City, USA,
they hit such a sour note with their musically-inclined head coach,
they were lucky Jim Schoenfeld didn't hit each of them over the
head with a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Or worse, lock them all in a room and make them listen to that
funky lounge-music album he recorded several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' 2-0 loss to the expansion Nashville Predators
earlier this month was so heartless and lethargic, Schoenfeld
openly chastised them for their ``stupidity and arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   They haven't forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   And they promise the same thing won't happen today when they
meet the Predators at 12:30 p.m. at the Nashville Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't there and I didn't play, so I'm not going to go shoot
my mouth off,'' said Keith Tkachuk, who missed the game because of
a fractured rib. ``But we should not lose to a team like that. And
we're not going to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes (24-12-9) can wrap up a four-game trip with four out
of a possible eight points if they can beat the Predators
(18-26-4), who are led in scoring by former Coyotes center Cliff
Ronning.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1-1 tie in Buffalo, a 4-2 loss in Philadelphia and a 4-4
tie against the New York Islanders, Nashville could be the perfect
place to throw a much-needed, going-away party. And this time, if
the Coyotes happen to grab a 1-0 or 2-0 lead, expect them to try
and bury the Predators, something they haven't done to an opponent
in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no feeling sorry for them, no feeling afraid
to try and run up the score,'' forward Rick Tocchet said. ``We'll
take whatever we can get right now. But the first thing on our
minds should be staying with the system and winning the hockey
game. Whether it's 1-0 or 10-0, we've got to get back on the
winning track.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are 10-10-7 since opening the season with a 14-2-2
start that made them the talk of the NHL. But a series of
uninspired efforts, mixed in with a sprinkle of key injuries here
and there, have prevented them from picking up the pace and making
a serious run at the No. 1 overall seed in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't catch the first-place Dallas Stars and finish
second to them in the Pacific, the best the Coyotes can hope for is
the No. 4 seed in the new three-division format. That's good enough
for home ice in the first round of the playoffs, but because slots
are re-seeded, it also probably means a date with Dallas in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to correct any problems before they snowball out
of control. And there are enough little things to worry about in
Coyoteville, from trade rumors, troubling inconsistent play by
some, to players privately speaking their mind and then getting
grilled about it later by the coaching staff. And don't forget,
this is also around the time when some players, set to become free
agents, start thinking about their contract situations.
</P>
<P>
   After the Philadelphia loss, when the Coyotes were outmanned
almost exclusively by just the Flyers' top line of Eric Lindros,
John LeClair and Keith Jones, Tkachuk said it was time for each
player to look at himself in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just sleeping right now, and you can see it happening
and happening and happening,'' he said. ``If I was Niki Khabibulin,
I'd snap. We're relying way too much on Nik and it's killing us
right now. It's killing us. We better turn this ship around and
everybody better take some responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   One Phoenix player stepping to the forefront in that department
is No. 1 center Jeremy Roenick, the team's leading scorer with 43
points. Pointless in six straight games prior to recording an
assist at the Islanders, Roenick said he just hasn't been himself
lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been playing on the edge and I don't know why,''
said Roenick, who just a week ago was skating alongside Lindros in
the NHL All-Star Game. ``I can't focus myself. I don't feel like I
have the energy. I just feel off. Everybody goes through a part of
the season where you have a lull . . . but it's been six, seven
games now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about scoring goals or scoring points. I just
want to play well and contribute and feel like I'm being part of
the game. Lately, I feel like I haven't even been a factor. It
hasn't made me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet said he admires Roenick's honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me on the bus the other day, `I stink,' '' Tocchet
said. ``But the good thing with JR is he realizes it and he's just
got to pick a couple things to focus on. It's good he's reacting
that way, though. He's not blaming it on anybody else. He'll get it
worked out.'' &QL;

ASU BANKS ON JUCO TRANSFERS  
 DEVILS TRY QUICK FIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - It either will be one of the best recruiting
classes at Arizona State in years, or a gamble with long-term
implications.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' decision to make at least nine junior college
players part of their 1999 recruiting class reflects the mind-set
of a football program in need of a quick fix. ASU finished 5-6 just
two years removed from its Rose Bowl season. Its scoring defense
was ranked 90th in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils also landed many of the state's top prospects,
including Superior's Tony Aguilar and Brandon Tomerlin, Mingus
offensive lineman Nick Johnson and Shadow Mountain wide receiver
Shaun McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had superior in-state recruiting,'' said Allan Wallace,
editor of ``SuperPrep'' magazine. ``There were a lot of good
players in Arizona, and they got many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great class if the junior college players pan out,''
recruiting analyst Bobby Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Most recruiting services rank the Sun Devils fourth, fifth or
sixth in the Pac-10, a conference that attracted many of the top
players in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is national letter of intent day. Oral commitments are
non-binding.
</P>
<P>
   Five of ASU's junior college players already have reported to
school. Among the nine transfers is John Leonard, a quarterback
from El Camino Junior College in Torrance, Calif., who still has
three seasons of eligibility. He threw eight touchdown passes in
the team's bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils were in need of an experienced backup for Ryan
Kealy once Chad Elliott was dismissed from the team.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest name on ASU's list could turn out to be Leonard's
junior college teammate, Delvon Flowers, a much-sought-after
tailback. Flowers committed to the Sun Devils but is believed to be
waivering between ASU and Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   JC recruits often make immediate impacts because of their
experience, but are perceived as academic risks because most were
unable to qualify for Division I programs out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he is aware of the stigma but is not concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually feel strongly about the five JC players that we
have in our system right now,'' he said. ``All five of them are
squared away. All five of them have good to very good academic
credentials. They never wavered in their commitments. I feel really
good about those five guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know there's a group of JC guys out there that aren't as
squared away, and we've had a share. These guys I really like, and
I think we're going to be fine from that standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said, ``JC transfers can be great or they can be
disruptive. In reality, maybe only 25 or 30 who come out live up to
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils have benefitted from junior college players in
the past. Defensive end Derrick Rodgers was an impact player. Erik
Flowers and Junior Ioane, two JC transfers from last season, both
became defensive line starters.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils received many early commitments this recruiting
season, including one from Johnson, a 6-foot-8, 320-pound offensive
lineman. Early commitments are a plus, although they can also pose
problems. Once other schools know where an athlete's attentions
are, they suddenly have a single target to recruit against.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a double edge to the knife,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder
said. ``But if you get a player that has a good foundation about
what a commitment means and you get that commitment, then you know
you've got it. Because he's going to live by what he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you take a kid that has less structure in his life,
they may in all honesty say something to you one day, and say
something the next day different, and some of them don't know that
they did something wrong. I do believe that comes from family
structure and principles that a kid has learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``So for some kids, it's the last people that's going to talk to
them that's going to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils appear to have landed a quality offensive line.
Depth at the position was a problem last season ,and ASU will be
losing experienced linemen Grey Ruegamer, Troy Davis and Randy
Leaphart.
</P>
<P>
   Likely incoming linemen include Johnson, Regis Crawford, from
San Diego's Morse High, Brandon Marcias from Los Altos, Calif., and
Kenneth Williamson of San Bernardino City College.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers Ryan Dennard, of Phoenix College, and Marshaun
Tucker, of Southwestern Junior College in San Diego, will help make
up for the losses of Lenzie Jackson, Kenny Mitchell and Creig
Spann.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he still does not know whether Ricky Boyer, who was
declared academically ineligible last season, will return.
</P>
<P>
   The next few days could be hectic for the Sun Devils, as they
await definitive word from several recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is like an octopus,'' he said. ``There's a lot of
tentacles to each individual case, and you try to manage them the
best you can.'' &QL;

REVEL IN REBEL LION OF 16TH-HOLE FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Sobriety never had a chance. Refinement was
a misguided idea. And on a glorious afternoon for a rebellion,
oppression was overthrown with drunken disdain.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to give the Phoenix Open a lobotomy. Etiquette
implants for the 16th hole. Expanded corporate suites, no beer
sales above the tee box, a camera-toting vehicle eating up space on
the hill. An ill-fated attempt to chase away the frat rats and
restore dignity to a white-collar sport.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but the people would have no part of it.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a finer performance by the crowd at No. 16, no one
seems to remember it. Despite the restrictions, the crowd dwarfed
last year's gathering. They were riotous, loud, a crowd estimated
at 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   They did the wave. They sang happy birthday to Payne Stewart.
They took everything to the edge and backed off at the last moment.
Threatened with extinction, they took a raucous reputation to
another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most unique hole we'll play all year,'' David Duval
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not sure why the PGA would want to listen to Tom Watson, so cold
that he belongs in a wax museum. Or Fred Couples, whose perspective
qualifies for a senior citizen discount. And shame on anyone who
wanted to give this golf tournament a personality transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Plain and simple, the 16th hole gives the Phoenix Open an
identity, a sense of place among the non-majors. It is the one
place on tour where golf is humanized, pared down to the lowest
common denominator, subjected to real people behaving like real
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Take that away, and all that's left is one giant corporate orgy.
A course full of disgusting white tents and shrimp cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, how they tried.
</P>
<P>
   When the first group approached shortly after 1 p.m., a TPC
official made this announcement:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please respect the proper golf etiquette. Do not cheer until
after the player has struck.''
</P>
<P>
   Response: ``We want beer! We want beer!''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Verplank batted lead-off and shanked an iron to the right.
The boos came raining down.
</P>
<P>
   When the next group approached, the same official made this
announcement:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not boo under any circumstances. We have Scottsdale
officers here. We will patrol the crowd today.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. Ready to issue booing citations.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Saturday was not only the rebellion, but the
trend. The Thunderbirds tried so hard to change the gallery that
they couldn't recognize the obvious: Slowly but surely, the gallery
is changing the golfers.
</P>
<P>
   All afternoon, the professionals played along. They smiled in
disbelief when they stepped on the tee box. They waved in
appreciation. And Scott Hoch was king, pretending that the gallery
had interrupted his swing, whipping the crowd into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, if you come here, you've got to embrace it,'' Duval
said. ``Just have fun with it. If you're nice with them, that's how
they'll be with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they get it. All the gallery wants is a little
interaction, a moment when a button comes off the starched collar
of a country club sport.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Ted Purdy came to the green wearing a great big grin. No
coincidence that, after his shot landed in a bunker, not a boo was
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were a few goofballs, a few college kids who
hadn't been to bed since Thursday night, a few obscenities lacing
the air. A few prissy golfers unnerved by the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they said they're not going to sell any beer, but
they're getting it somewhere,'' said someone named Harrison Frazar.
``I went through early enough that they weren't good and liquored
up yet, which is nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, what did they expect? No beer in the immediate vicinity,
but Coke sales did just fine, especially among those with bottles
of rum stashed in their pockets. No beer, but plenty of hard stuff
smuggled in the front door, working twice as fast as the suds.
</P>
<P>
   Point is, the gallery has claimed this hole as their own, and
until they outlaw spectators on the 16th tee, any resistance will
be met with resistance.
</P>
<P>
   A victory for the people. And the golfers who have grown to
accept a little good-natured commotion in their pampered lives. &QL;

ROCCO'S ON A ROLL  
 66 EARNS MEDIATE 6-SHOT LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - With Rocco Mediate out in front of the 64th
Phoenix Open by a staggering 6 shots, and playing with rocklike
stoicism, there might be a tendency to believe this one is over.
Except for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   This is the PGA Tour, where final-round theatrics seem to take
place almost weekly. Look no further than last Sunday, when David
Duval won the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, rallying from 7 shots down
with a record 59.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco knows. He is well-aware that there is cast of characters
who could give him a run for what looks like his $540,000 when the
final 18 holes unfold today at the TPC of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, where is Duval at anyway?'' the easygoing Italian
quipped after his 5-under 66 opened up his huge advantage Saturday
before a throng of 114,450.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is he shooting? You want to make sure he stays away.''
</P>
<P>
   Told Duval was 2 under after also posting a 66, Mediate exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Tiger Woods factor. Woods birdied the last
hole for a shaky 70 to get to 5 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I needed that putt on the last hole to get in the group
with him,'' said Woods of his clutch 8-footer that went down about
the same time as the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can get off to a hot start on the front nine, and put a
little heat on him (today), at least he has a chance to look at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds intimidating, it was meant to be. Woods certainly
could do just that if he can keep from playing army golf _ left,
right, left, right _ as he did during Saturday's third round.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about Justin Leonard (67) and former Phoenix Open champ
Lee Janzen (69) at 4 under? Remember, Leonard has rallied from 5
shots back in the final round for two of his biggest wins _ the
1987 British Open and the '98 Players Championship.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be a moot point if Mediate continues his
right-down-the-middle approach. He has hit 64 percent of his
fairways this week, 63 percent of the greens in regulation, and has
averaged a mere 1.46 putts per hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I shoot the same score I shot today, I should win the
tournament,'' Rocco reasoned. ``But I can't play conservatively.
Look what happened last week. Someone could still shoot 63 or 64.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be intriguing to see whether Mediate, who has not won
since the 1993 Greater Greensboro Open, can add a third victory to
his resume. But at this point, he's in uncharted territory, his
best finish in the past five years being a tie for third in the
1996 Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done this. It's all new to me,'' Mediate said of
his substantial lead. ``I just have to hit fairways and greens.
It's the old cliche.''
</P>
<P>
   Can the TPC give up a number low enough to catch Rocco? Tiger
thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, someone could shoot in the low 60s,'' Woods
said without a blink.
</P>
<P>
   But only if Rocco's long putter comes up short more often than
it did Saturday, when he holed seven birdies _ five from outside 15
feet _ to offset two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as good as I can putt on these greens,'' Mediate
said of the fast and firm surfaces of the TPC. ``I made a lot of
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Duval, who kept pecking away throughout the afternoon
until he finally holed out from the bunker at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never wish ill-will for a fellow player, and certainly not
Rocco, who's a buddy of mine,'' Duval said. ``It's a situation that
if I can stay within 5 or 6 shots, you never know what can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A thought that seems to be crossing several of his challengers'
minds. If the charge comes, it will have to take place early.
Mediate will have to cooperate by not playing the front side like
he has the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the front nine is way harder than the back,'' said
Mediate, who has gone 5 under over that stretch, which essentially
accounts for his lead considering everybody else has fell flat on
it.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect him to be intimidated by Woods and his
rampaging fan club, which breaks like wild horses for the next tee
the moment Tiger holes a putt.
</P>
<P>
   Told he will be the villain today, Mediate just broke into one
of those big smiles he flashed all day while being paired with
golf's icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine. I know what I've got to do,'' he said. ``I heard
a couple of stupid comments (Saturday) towards me, but I don't
care. I can't stop them. It's not like they're trying to hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Mediate can do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But like I said, I want this to happen (being paired with
Tiger). If I can pull it off (today), I should be able to win in
any given situation. And Tiger will be firing, I know how he is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing to lose sleep over, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to sleep like a rock. It's going to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   For everyone.

FOUL PLAY DOES IN DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - In their first season at Arizona State, Coach Rob
Evans and his staff have talked about defense first, last and
always. Saturday against third-ranked Stanford, the Sun Devils
played as if all the teaching and preaching has finally sunk in,
except for one lapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They defended real well,'' Evans said. ``They just can't
defend free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans knows how to walk the tightrope when it comes to
discussing the officials. And he managed to keep his balance after
Stanford beat ASU, 73-63, at Wells Fargo Arena, making 31 of 43
foul shots to 6 of 11 for the Sun Devils. He spoke calmly, but the
fire in his eyes told another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pitiful,'' Evans said of the disparity. ``With three
minutes in the game, we were keeping (track) on the side. It was 29
to six (attempts). We fouled some. But we're not the most
aggressive team on the floor. I can't fault the kids. They gave
great effort. They played well enough to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort was typified by little-used reserve Jason Patton,
6-foot-4 junior, throwing around his body and ending up with a
season-high seven rebounds. But the Sun Devils didn't help
themselves by shooting 35.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And it's tough to win when you go more than eight minutes
without scoring, as ASU did when a 56-50 lead with 10:23 left
dissolved into a 66-56 deficit with 1:59 to go. That's 16
unanswered points by Stanford (18-3, 8-1 Pac-10) if you're
counting.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Eddie House had 25 points for the Sun Devils (12-9, 4-5),
but was 10 for 26, including 4 for 16 in the second half. Mike
Batiste had 21 points, but just six after halftime. And forward
Bobby Lazor, who has nine games of 20 points or more, was held to
six, his lowest output of the season. Plus, he had six turnovers.
With its brains, brawn and experience, Stanford, which starts four
seniors and a junior, statistically is the best defensive team in
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, I thought we defended better,'' said
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery, whose team stayed in first place
but is nonetheless concerned about recent slow starts.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite all that, ASU had seven more field goals than
the Cardinal, which was coming off its first Pac-10 loss of the
season Thursday to Arizona. Stanford shot 35.3 percent, its
second-worst percentage of the season, going 8 for 25 in the first
half to help the Sun Devils to a 37-31 lead at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had a chance,'' Lazor said. ``We felt we were doing
things to put us in a position to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford's front line _ 7-2 Tim Young, 6-9 Mark Madsen and
6-7 Peter Sauer, with 6-9 Jarron Collins coming off the bench _
dominates most teams, especially smaller foes like the Sun Devils.
Its 50-38 rebounding edge made up for much of the offensive
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   The foul situation took care of the rest. The Cardinal's 43
attempts from the line was the most by an ASU opponent in the
1990s, and the 13 fouls called against Stanford was a season-low
for a team playing the Sun Devils this season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a purported home-court advantage, Lazor said, ``I'm
convinced there's no such thing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Batiste's comments were slightly more pointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refs got us frustrated but we shouldn't fall to their
level,'' he said. ``But if there were no refs, I'm pretty sure we
would have beat the crap out of this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a lot of calls. I'm pretty sure if it was fair play,
we would have had the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, Batiste said the Sun Devils could have done a
better job of running their offense in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt when I got the ball, everyone was just standing,
looking for me to do something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But House seemed pretty busy himself, hoisting up the
second-highest number of shots by an ASU player this season. House
also had the most, 27 against Nevada-Las Vegas. But he scored 39
points in that game, and ASU won.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery said Stanford turned up the pressure on House in the
second half. House disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sense that at all,'' he said. ``I got to the hole
when I wanted to. It was just a matter of me converting. I
definitely was getting the looks I wanted.'' &QL;

GUGLIOTTA LEADS SUNS TO EXHIBITION VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Suns forward Tom Gugliotta said he felt a little out of
place Saturday, and not just because he was making his debut in a
Phoenix uniform, scoring 20 points and taking down 11 rebounds as
the Suns beat the Dallas Mavericks, 116-110, in their exhibition
opener.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't because the Suns were on the court for the first time
since the NBA lockout finally ended, or because Gugliotta last
played in a game a year ago today thanks to an ankle injury in
Minnesota and the lockout that cut an 82-game schedule to 50 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was all that hugging at the morning shootaround. Five of
the Mavericks are former Suns, and all played in Phoenix within the
last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another reason to call it Reunion Arena, I guess,''
Gugliotta said. ``I felt like the only one who didn't know
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because of all those familiar faces, the intensity of the
game was better than in most preseason contests, and it wasn't as
sloppy as might have been expected after such a bad layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the victory, though, Suns Coach Danny Ainge came away
far from satisfied after the Suns survived a combined 49 points
from their former teammates, Michael Finley and Cedric Ceballos and
an 11-point, 12-assist, four- steal effort from another former Sun,
Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pretty bad,'' Ainge said. ``I thought our
execution was pretty bad. We have a long way to go. With the long
layoff, and adding a lot of young players, I guess it's to be
expected. I guess it could have been worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to some of the preseason games that have been played
around the league following a hurried training camp schedule, it
wasn't bad at all. And there were some good signs for a Phoenix
team that went through considerable off-season change.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta was solid, getting three assists and a couple of
steals in addition to his points and rebounds. He played 39 minutes
and didn't appear to have any conditioning problems or lingering
effects from the ankle, which required surgery to remove bone
spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Manning made his return from reconstructive knee surgery
and picked right up where he left off last season, when he won the
NBA Sixth Man Award. He scored 15 points in only 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The club's three rookies, Pat Garrity, Toby Bailey and Gerald
Brown, performed well. Garrity, whom the Mavericks initially
drafted and traded to Milwaukee for Dirk Nowitzki, scored 14 points
and grabbed seven rebounds. Brown hit all three of his field goal
attempts and scored 10 points. Bailey added eight points and five
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Respert, who was signed to provide backcourt depth, scored
12 points on 5-of-6 shooting off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe most important, point guard Jason Kidd set the tone early,
scoring six of his 11 points in the first three minutes. He added
13 assists and a pair of steals as the Suns shot 51.7 percent, beat
the Mavericks on the boards, 48-42, and shared the ball for 29
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of positive things out there,'' Gugliotta
said. ``We moved the ball effectively on offense. I thought we
utilized our weapons pretty good. We've got to work on some things,
like timing and spacing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only ran two or three plays, and when they broke down, we
got into a pick-and-roll. We got a lot of options off those two or
three plays.'' &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
General Manager Bryan Colangelo came on the trip, contract in hand
for forward Martin Muursepp, who was waived by the Chicago Bulls
not long after the Suns sent him there in a sign-and-trade deal for
Luc Longley. But Muursepp opted to sign a contract with a
professional team in Greece. The 6-foot-9 forward tried to get into
the European League during the NBA lockout, but his NBA contract
precluded it.
</P>
<P>
   Respert wore No. 7, the number Kevin Johnson wore for the Suns.
KJ's number will eventually be retired, but the Suns announced when
Gugliotta signed and took Tom Chambers' No. 24 that names and not
numbers will be retired from now on.
</P>
<P>
   KJ's number didn't go unnoticed by Ceballos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't even let the dust settle on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks distributed 18,121 free tickets, but the
attendance appeared to be about half that number. &QL;

FEAR OF FAILURE DRIVES DAVIS  
 CAREER, TEAM GOALS KEEP MVP FOCUSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - Even expert nitpicker Mike Shanahan surveys Terrell
Davis and is given pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only guy I've ever been around who doesn't have a
weakness,'' Shanahan, coach of the Denver Broncos, who prides
himself on attention to detail, said of his running back.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, maybe Davis didn't take the medication for his migraine
headaches before last year's Super Bowl, but even a temporary loss
of vision brought on in the second quarter didn't prevent Davis
from becoming the game's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   Properly medicated this season, Davis rushed for 2,008 yards and
won the league's Most Valuable Player award. Only three backs ever
have gained more ground in an NFL season. Had it not been for an
uncharacteristic 29-yard output in the next-to-last game against
Miami _ in the stadium where the Broncos take on the Atlanta
Falcons today in Super Bowl XXXIII _ Davis might have run past them
all. He was on pace most of the season to eclipse the league record
of 2,105 by Eric Dickerson in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   After rushing the Broncos to their first championship in Super
Bowl XXXII, Davis is positioned to do it again, but he faces the
defense that was second in the league against the rush.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is only 26 and in his fourth season. It boggles the mind
to imagine what kind of yardage and how many championship rings and
MVP trophies he might have by the time he is finished.
</P>
<P>
   This is a guy that nobody wanted. He was a nose guard and
fullback in high school because he was deemed a slowpoke. He went
to Long Beach State after being lightly recruited before
transferring to Georgia and struggling. He was a sixth-round pick
in the NFL draft, after 195 others had been selected. Yet Davis
probably is going to be the guy every back is compared with.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he quit today, he'd go down as one of the greatest ever to
play the game,'' said Broncos tackle Matt Lepsis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' life has changed at a dizzying pace. He gets mobbed when
he goes to a restaurant. He can't even go to a Pop Warner game,
which he says he still loves to do because it reminds him where he
started, without being besieged by autograph hounds.
</P>
<P>
   His adversary today, Jamal Anderson of the Falcons, has more of
a taste for the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he would prefer to be just a guy. A guy nobody
bothers. A guy who respects the history of the game, who has a deep
appreciation of the players who played it before him, who still
can't quite believe that his name is mentioned in the same sentence
with some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fairly new to me,'' Davis said. ``I'm not used to
having to walk around and hide and be in a situation where I can't
go out a lot. Jamal welcomes it. He's been around the big stars so
long he knows how to handle this situation. He grew up around it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Davis grew up around in San Diego was a father who abused
him verbally and physically while instilling discipline. To
reinforce his points, Davis' father once lined up his sons against
a wall and fired a gun over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of thing that perhaps caused one of his brothers
to wind up doing time for shooting a woman. For Davis, it became
the driving force to a life that was better. And, after receiving a
$56 million contract extension during the off-season, his life is
much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done things wrong, I'm not an angel,'' he said. ``But you
can control your life. You can turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has turned around the fortunes of the Broncos, who had
fallen to 8-8 in Dan Reeves final year as coach, and continued to
stagnate at 16-16 during Wade Phillips' two-year reign. Shanahan
became coach four years ago today. He figured spending the
low-round pick in his first draft on Davis was safe.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Over the past three seasons, the Broncos have had
the best record in the NFL, losing only 10 games, with Davis
establishing the run to complement John Elway's passing.
</P>
<P>
   Davis came into this season prepared to rush the Broncos to
another title, figuring that John Elway would take his Super Bowl
ring and retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started preparing a couple of weeks after the last Super
Bowl,'' Davis said. ``I knew if John wasn't coming back I had to be
the rock, because if he wasn't there people would be coming after
me. I did a lot of stuff in the off-season, and you wouldn't
believe how much more I had to turn down. But one thing I always
did was make time to work out, even if it was in a hotel gym
someplace. I didn't miss a workout. That was important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Elway decided to stick around for another run, the Broncos
and the hardened Davis came back even better.
</P>
<P>
   Davis rarely loses yards. Shanahan says Davis runs as hard in
the fourth quarter as he does in the first. He has become more
adept at identifying and reading defenses, and at setting up
blockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great standing behind there and watching him run,'' Elway
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Davis seems to have improved what was perceived as his
greatest weakness, open-field running.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Long Beach State that first year, I was on the
scout team. And when you are on the scout team, they hold up these
cards with the plays on them that tell you where to run, like your
opponent that week does. But you can improvise a little bit after
you hit the hole, so that's when I kind of developed my cutback
skills, experimenting with different moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become even better in the open field in the pros. My line
here is going to get me past the line. When you get into the
secondary, it's then up to you to make plays. They can't help you
once you get to the safeties. I was getting upset early in my
career when I was getting tackled by one man. I realized I had to
learn how to make a guy miss.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also has learned by watching the greats with whom he now
is compared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire Emmitt Smith because he has not only a lot of yards
but also a lot of championships,'' Davis said. ``I grew up kind of
patterning myself after Tony Dorsett. I respect what Walter Payton
did over his career. I've only seen Jim Brown in the movies. I
don't know if our running styles are similar or not. He was a
fairly large back for those times. I'm a small back in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goals are career goals. In order for me to achieve those, I
have to be the best I can be each year. I won't be satisfied until
10 years from now when hopefully I have about five rings when it's
all said and done. I want to leave my signature on the game. The
way you do that is by winning championships because ultimately this
is a team game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that scares me the most is failing. One of the
things that I do carry from my father is that you don't take
anything for granted because it might not be there the next day.
That's something that he always said. I want to stay on this level,
but I know one day it won't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But that day appears to be far away. &QL;

ANDERSON LOVES SPOTLIGHT  
 BUT FALCONS' STAR INSISTS HE'S NO HAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - One punch. A friendly slap from Mike Tyson convinced
Atlanta Falcons running back Jamal Anderson that there had to be a
better way to make a living than looking at the world from his
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 16 and messing with Mike,'' said Anderson, whose dad,
James, is one of Tyson's security personnel and used to hold the
same job for Muhammad Ali. ``We were slap boxing, messing around. I
took a swing at him, and Mike swung back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind from that swing knocked me back. The wind. Whoa. That
was enough for me to say, `No boxing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, I saw Muhammad (Ali) after some of those losses _
the blood, the sight. That's not for me.''
</P>
<P>
   So Anderson, who helped lead the Falcons to their first Super
Bowl appearance, decided to stick with football and being a ham.
</P>
<P>
   He's always on stage, and why shouldn't he be?
</P>
<P>
   Donna Summer, the queen of disco, once baby-sat him. Sugar Ray
Leonard sang at one of his birthday parties. Richard Pryor and
Arsenio Hall have been houseguests. Michael Jackson is a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when I was 7 was the last time I got stage fright,''
Anderson said. ``My parents used to have these huge barbecues, and
they used to ask me and my brothers to do these huge performances.
But I didn't want to do it. . . . It was one of those New Edition
songs or something. But I was nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years later, Anderson is having the time of his life
preparing for today's Super Bowl XXXIII game against the Denver
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   He has a national audience and doesn't disappoint anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to be natural,'' Anderson said. ``People say
I'm a ham. I'm not a ham. I'm just doing my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's thing is to talk, and he has an opinion about almost
anything:
</P>
<P>
   His skin texture. ``I got a facial,'' he said. ``Europeans have
shown us the way.''
</P>
<P>
   His hair. ``I wanted to make sure I looked good today,'' he
said. ``Is my hair tight?''
</P>
<P>
   Camera angles. ``You should come around the front,'' he said.
``I don't like that side of my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Sportswriters. ``You look like you just woke up and showed up
for work,'' he said. ``You look terrible. You must have stayed up
all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Few outside of Atlanta had heard of Anderson until he started
doing the ``Dirty Bird'' dance to celebrate touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson didn't invent it. That honor goes to tight end O.J.
Santiago, but Anderson has made the dance famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. was like Jermaine Jackson,'' Anderson said. ``I'm like
Michael Jackson. O.J. took us to the point where everyone
recognized us, but I took us platinum.''
</P>
<P>
   What the nation learned about Anderson was that he was very
good. He led the NFC in rushing this season with 1,846 yards, a
team record, and scored 16 touchdowns, second-most in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 5-foot-11, 234 pounds, has a unique running style, a
halfback in a fullback's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever been down to Rio de Janiero, running on the beach
naked with the rain just hitting your butt?'' Falcons offensive
tackle Bob Whitfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield then explains Anderson's running style in football
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal makes little holes in to big holes and big holes into
bigger holes, and the biggest holes into touchdowns,'' Whitfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson knows there are faster and niftier backs and others who
are better blockers. But he thinks he can do a little bit of
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal for me is to not have a style,'' he said. ``I've
never wanted to be pigeon-holed. I always wanted you see that I can
cut when I need to, I can run over if I have to and can go around
you if you let me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the fastest back in the league, but I'm never getting
into situations where guys are running me down from behind. When
I'm split out as a wide-out, I want you to be able to say,
`Goodness gracious, he runs his routes just like a wide receiver.'
In my blitz pickups and everything, I want to have a little bit of
some of the great runners in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the NFL believed in Anderson. There were 24
backs taken ahead of him in the '94 draft, which is why he can
relate to Denver's Terrell Davis, who wasn't taken until the sixth
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm part of Terrell's army,'' Anderson said. ``We kind of
carry the flag for the unwanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons weren't sure they wanted to keep Anderson after last
season. He rushed for more than 1,000 yards, but Coach Dan Reeves
shopped him around, including talking to the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials were interested, but the price was too high.
Atlanta wanted at least a first-round pick. So, instead, the
Cardinals traded with the New York Jets for Adrian Murrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix, all the nice golf courses,'' he said of the deal that
fell through. ``That would have been great. It's close to home
(Salt Lake City).
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was not a great season for me. A lot of things
needed to be addressed for me in the off-season. I didn't know what
direction this organization wanted to go. They liked (running back)
Byron Hanspard. I don't like rotating running backs. I felt I was
capable of being an every-down back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard (knee) has been on injured reserve all season. Now, the
Falcons wouldn't trade Anderson for anything.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left for him is to unveil his Super Bowl version of
the ``Dirty Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `All Around the World Bird,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he refused to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sneak backstage to see the showgirls before the
show,'' he said. &QL;

TAYLOR ELECTED TO HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In the most controversial Pro Football Hall of Fame
election in years, former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence
Taylor was voted in Saturday along with four others.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a 10-time Pro Bowl selection who has the second-most
sacks in NFL history, entered along with former Los Angeles Rams
and Indianapolis Colts running back Eric Dickerson, former Rams
offensive guard Tom Mack, ex-Cleveland Browns tight end Ozzie
Newsome and old-timer Billy Shaw, who played guard for the American
Football League's Buffalo Bills in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Taylor in the first year he was eligible came
after a long debate by the 36 voters about whether his problems off
the field should be a consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was suspended once and arrested twice on drug charges,
and was found guilty of filing false income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The bylaws of the Hall of Fame say that a player should be
judged only for football performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be like baseball,'' said voter Paul Zimmerman
of ``Sports Illustrated.'' ``We want to be football oriented and
let the judge and juries in the outside world determine who is a
good guy and a bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Goldberg of the Associated Press said the bylaws say
``off-the-field doesn't count'' and that he voted accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in there who have thrown people off
balconies,'' Goldberg said, referring to former Cleveland running
back Jim Brown. ``LT was a slam dunk. You don't keep out the best
defensive player ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who played 13 seasons for the Giants, was the NFL's Most
Valuable Player in 1986, the first defensive player to win that
honor. Not even that swayed some voters, who were among five to
seven to vote against him. Vote totals are kept by a private firm
and are not made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hall of Fame is a place for heroes,'' Jerry Magee of the
``San'' ``Diego Union-Tribun''e &QL; 
said. ``LT is not my idea of a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was elected on the same day that his oldest son, Lawrence
Taylor Jr., told the ``New York Daily News'' that his father has a
drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs help,'' Taylor's son said. ``Instead of criticizing
my dad, someone should try to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still young, and I am scared. There are nights I can't
sleep for worrying about my father.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who will turn 40 next week, was unavailable for comment
following his election. He did issue a statement that he is
``humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it is the ultimate reward for playing the game
that I love so much and gave so much,'' Taylor said in his
statement. ``Ultimately, this honor has to do with how I played the
game. Obviously, the majority of the committee felt that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Giants General Manager George Young, now an executive in
the NFL office, said he is happy for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it works to his advantage,'' Young said of Taylor's
July 31 induction. ``People have to realize he's a troubled
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, who ran for a record 2,105 yards in 1984, is third on
the career rushing list with 13,259.
</P>
<P>
   He also has fond views of playing against Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of my funniest moments,'' Dickerson said. ``As a
rookie, I was supposed to to cut (block) LT. He rushed in, and I
cut him. He got up and said, `Don't you ever cut me again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `OK.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mack, an 11-time Pro Bowl choice, was one of the best blocking
guards of his generation, 1966 through 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome tops all tight ends in catches with 662 catches for
7,980 yards and 47 touchdowns in 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, a guard, played nine seasons with the Bills and made pro
football's All-Decade team of the '60s and the all-time AFL team. &QL;

ROOTING FOR REEVES IS EASY TO DO

<P>
   MIAMI - Dan Reeves knows this trick.
</P>
<P>
   He places a dime on a table so that the coin overhangs the edge.
He gets down on all fours, draws a deep, deep breath, and blows.
</P>
<P>
   The dime lifts off the table and _ ``voila!'' _ clinks into a
glass, like a tiddlywink.
</P>
<P>
   Dan is fond of the trick. He takes delight in the surprised
looks of skeptics who bet him that he can't possibly perform such
magic. He loves making people laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves didn't demonstrate the trick during Super Bowl week. He
knew better than to try. His breathing is shallow. He doesn't have
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous heart patient in America is still recuperating
from emergency surgery. Last month doctors opened Reeves' chest and
repaired his ailing heart.
</P>
<P>
   The bypass operation forced the 55-year-old coach to slow down.
His lung power isn't what it was. Though wary of medicine, Reeves
dutifully takes 10 pills a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get those things in your hand, throw 'em in there and
you're just hoping they're going to the right place,'' Reeves said
in his scratchy Georgia drawl.
</P>
<P>
   You listen to Dan Reeves and smile. You watch him carefully pick
up the Super Bowl trophy and hold it, posing for photographers.
Cameras chatter. Strobes reflect off his glasses and wash the
silver hardware in bright stuttering light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only practiced this,'' Reeves muttered, away from the
microphone, speaking to no one in particular. He has held the
trophy before the Super Bowl game _ never after it. Not as a head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   He took Denver to three Super Bowls. The Broncos lost all three.
``The lowest of the low,'' he said of the experience. The memories
still pain him.
</P>
<P>
   You watch Dan Reeves cradle the Lombardi Trophy and then draw it
to his chest, close to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Think this game, this moment, isn't special to him? In December
Reeves didn't know what tomorrow held. Now here he is, back on his
feet, breathing a little less deeply but his fierce competitiveness
undiminished. A man thankful beyond words for his family and for
the football team he loves and for the opportunity that awaits him
today.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Falcons win the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Do I hope they will? Absolutely, for Dan Reeves' sake. If the
Falcons beat the Broncos today, what an ending to a story that
would be.
</P>
<P>
   Out of intensive care, the Falcons coach takes an underdog team
that finished 3-13 two years ago and wins the Super Bowl, beating
the defending champions and the franchise that fired him. Hollywood
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't want to see Reeves holding the trophy at last? He
won two Super Bowls as a player and an assistant coach with the
Dallas Cowboys. But his three defeats as a head coach have troubled
him and followed him. They haunt him still.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't want to see Reeves finally win? Not many coaches
are honest enough to say what Reeves did this week about his Super
Bowl shortcomings. He blamed himself. ``Those three games hurt the
most, because in all three I never felt like I got our football
team to play as well as it was capable of playing. That's the
coach's responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't want the man Denver Coach Mike Shananan calls ``the
ultimate competitor'' to be rewarded? Perhaps the only person who
takes losing harder than Reeves is Mike Ditka. The two coached
together in Dallas on Tom Landry's staff. One night at training
camp Reeves drubbed Ditka in gin rummy. Ditka picked up his chair
and hurled it. The piece of furniture hit the wall and stuck there,
all four legs imbedded.
</P>
<P>
   How can you not wish the best for a man who is jaw-clenching
intense and stubborn to a fault but doesn't take himself so
seriously that he can't laugh at his own expense?
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves won me over this week when a foreign journalist asked
the coach to comment on his kicker, Morten Andersen. The journalist
spoke with a noticeable accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you from?'' Reeves asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denmark,'' the reporter said. As all eyes turned on him, he
flushed as if embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you were from south Georgia,'' the coach said. It
was Reeves' playful way of reminding that all kinds of people sound
funny, not the least of whom is the man from Americus, Ga., who can
blow a dime into a glass and deliver a losing franchise to a
magical place it has never been before. &QL;

HELPFUL HINTS FOR SUPER ENJOYMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ What will it take for the Denver Broncos to defend their
title today in Super Bowl XXXIII? What will it take for the Atlanta
Falcons to pull an upset in their first appearance ever in the NFL
championship game?
</P>
<P>
   What will Cher wear or leave uncovered while performing our
national anthem?
</P>
<P>
   Here are XXXIII things, in no particular order, to look for in
the clash at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I. The Falcons can't act as if  &UR; they've never been here before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the same `We're not done yet' attitude we've
had throughout the playoffs, and we're not done,'' said Falcons
linebacker Cornelius Bennett, who has been here before, with the
Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; II. The Falcons must handle the Broncso' early-down
run-blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our practices this week have been basically two-hour
blitz periods,'' said Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler. ``They'll
have new wrinkles in. I think they will blitz as much to stop the
run as to get sacks. If we throw on early downs we have to pick
them up.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; III. Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan must live up to his reputation
for
 &UR; being a nitpicking genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does spend time in the film room breaking teams down,''
said Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe. ``He doesn't go out there
and try to beat an entire defense. He takes advantage of a
particular situation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IV. The Broncos defense must play with perfect technique.
Failing
 &UR; that, it must be effective with its taunting game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to beat them is with great technique, beat them
with ability,'' said Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski. ``But some
guys, you get in their face and say a few words and they start
reacting. I've played with a lot of guys like that. You yell
something about a family member, or something about they're not a
very good player _ not necessarily in those words _ and guys will
lose it a little bit and get out of their game.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; V. No matter what Cher wears, neither team should look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've studied the national anthem,'' Cher said. ``I think it is
a really beautiful song. I want to do it justice. Football is my
favorite game, and I've wanted to do this all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VI. Atlanta Coach Dan Reeves, who had quadruple-bypass surgery
seven
 &UR; weeks ago, can't pop a gasket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're nervous for him, and shaky,'' said Falcons center
Robbie Tobeck. ``He was getting on somebody in practice
(Wednesday), and I heard the comment `Coach Reeves is back.' I
don't think his heart is bothering him at all right now.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VII. Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan must validate his
guarantee of a
 &UR; win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put on a dog collar to prove we are underdogs,'' Buchanan
said. ``Dogs like real grass, and that's what we're playing on. I
haven't seen too many dogs squatting on turf.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIII. Falcon defenders must not stray beyond their assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's staying low, not being nosy, not trying to do your job
and someone else's job at the same time,'' Bennett said. ``If
everybody is where they're supposed to be, we have a great
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IX. The Broncos offensive line must continue to be dominating.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me Atlanta's defensive front four, the Bomb Squad I believe
they call themselves, is a big key,'' said Rod Smith, a Broncos
receiver. ``They get two, three yards deep on every snap.
Dominating the line of scrimmage is the most important factor in
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; X. Everyone must stay dry.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service says chances of rain are about the
same as chances of FOX selling ads during the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XI. Broncos back Terrell Davis must run like an MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backs are taught to read blocking schemes, progressions from
one block to the next,'' Davis said. ``That's what I look at first.
Once I'm in the secondary and people are kind of displaced, I tell
myself, `OK, that's an object, you're an object, run away from that
object.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XII. The Falcons, who played their past 10 games in domes, must
be at
 &UR; home on Pro Player Stadium's natural grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like natural grass better, but I like domes better,''
Chandler said. ``We practice all the time on grass, in the wind and
in some of the wet weather we have that we might have here.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XIII. Buchanan must throttle Broncos receiver Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of receiver that bothers me the most,'' Buchanan
said, ``is the kind that gets open.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XIV. The Broncos must rattle the unflappable Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy working the system as well as anybody in the
league,'' Romanowski said. ``He's one of the reasons why they are
here. He's playing outstanding football, the best I've seen him
play in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XV. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy can't get the shakes about a potential
 &UR; worldwide audience of 800  &UR; million watching the halftime show,
which
 &UR; includes Stevie Wonder and Gloria Estefan.
</P>
<P>
   Crisp, flawless presentation must be carried on in the halftime
tradition established in Super Bowl I by the University of Arizona
Symphonic Marching Band.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XVI. It's OK to have a chip on their shoulder, but the Falcons
can't
 &UR; let it weigh them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of our front four made a Pro Bowl,'' said defensive end
Chuck Smith. ``I've been an alternate going on 30 years. Travis
Hall (defensive tackle) has been an alternate going on 80 years in
a row. The last three years we put only 35,000 people in the
stands. Other teams put 80,000 in there and every fan is voting. We
don't get TV games. We didn't have the Madden Cruiser popping up in
Atlanta many times this year. No one knows us.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XVII. The Falcons must be creative against Denver's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NFC championship, we put Chris Chandler at wide
receiver and used the direct snap to (receiver) Tim Dwight,'' Coach
Dan Reeves said. ``We saw Minnesota do it with David Palmer against
Arizona and it gave us food for thought.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XVIII. The Broncos, as defending champions, can't take
themselves too
 &UR; seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure we all play the best game to get the job
done,'' said Terrell Davis, the NFL rushing leader. ``I might run
20 times for 30 yards. If that's good enough to make our
play-action passes work and John Elway throws for 400 yards, then I
played a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XIX. The Broncos must use their experience to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see mistakes made all the time, but if you
make one in the Super Bowl, the whole world knows it,'' said
Broncos middle linebacker Glenn Cadrez. ``That always creates a
little more pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XX. There must be harmony among the multicultural fans on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter will attend. The leaders of Panama
and Nicaragua also want to come, but need tickets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXI. The Falcons defense can't overpursue Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to get on the other side of the ball because
that makes the opposing team have to do something different,'' said
Bennett. ``But with Terrell, that's what he sort of likes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXII. The Atlanta Bomb Squad defense, second in the league
against the
 &UR; run, can't be shot down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their line plays together as a team the best of any I've
seen,'' Chuck Smith said. ``A lot of lines we play want to be
finesse. Denver is not like that. They've got a mean offensive
line.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXIII. The Broncos defense, which yielded 14 rushing yards to
Miami
 &UR; and 14 more to the New York Jets, must throttle Jamal Anderson, the
 &UR; NFC leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch him throughout this year and he's an unbelievable
talent,'' Romanowski said. ``We're a gap-control defense.
Everything is responsibility oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXIV. Davis can't forget his migraine medicine. A headache in
last
 &UR; year's game temporarily blinded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had any this year,'' he said. ``I will remember to
take my medicine this time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXV. Players must keep those shirts tucked.
</P>
<P>
   Nat Moore, retired Dolphins receiver, is the uniform policeman
with binoculars. Violators are fined.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXVI. The Falcons must have faith, but not too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami and New York made Denver look vulnerable, made them mere
men,'' said Falcons safety Eugene Robinson, who lost to the Broncos
in last year's Super Bowl while with Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXVII. Be careful from whom you take advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Cornelius Bennett and he just talked about how not
to lose a Super Bowl,'' said Falcons back Jamal Anderson. ``He
could write a book on that, unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXVIII. The Broncos, who've been here before, must remember
it's about
 &UR; more than renting expensive sports cars and tooling around South
 &UR; Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a business trip for me,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXIX. Broncos kicker Jason Elam, a licensed pilot who kicked a
 &UR; 63-yard field goal this year, tying a record, must be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised I even got the chance to kick one from 63,''
he said. ``Flying an airplane is easy. Kicking a football is
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXX. Players must not yield to distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a 3.0 grade-point average in industrial engineering at
Stanford,'' said Falcons defensive end Lester Archambeau.
``Football was a little bit of a distraction there.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXXI. Players must be careful what they wish for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make big-time plays in big games,'' said Atlanta second-year
cornerback Michael Booker. ``I would love for Denver to target me
and come at me, but I don't think they will.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXXII. The Broncos must capitalize on superior depth in their
 &UR; defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rotate guys,'' said defensive end Maa Tanavasa. ``At the
elevation we play at in Mile High Stadium, you can't have just four
guys going all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; XXXIII. Players can't forget that with two similar, evenly
matched
 &UR; team, little things do make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it may come down to game plan, and we put ours in
during the off week,'' said Denver fullback Howard Griffith. &QL;

   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Senator John McCain, still hesitant to
declare whether he will become a candidate for president, said
three times Saturday that he would not campaign in Delaware if he
decides to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen how the people of New Hampshire feel about the
preservation of the first-in-the-nation status,'' said the Arizona
Republican, adding that he is committed to it, too.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire political officials have been trying to discourage
presidential candidates from campaigning in Delaware in order to
stop the state from encroaching on New Hampshire's turf. Delaware
wants to schedule its primary four days after New Hampshire, which
hasn't yet set a date for its primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain met Saturday morning with potential supporters, including
House Speaker Donna Sytek and US Representative Charles Bass, over
breakfast at the Center of New Hampshire Holiday Inn. He was
escorted by former New Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman, who is
touting McCain's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been quite a reaction from across the state, from all
the counties, from everyone,'' said Rudman.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he intends to sit down with Rudman and other
advisers this week to help him set up a timetable for a decision,
which should come by the end of February. He said he is trying to
gauge whether he would have support in New Hampshire, Iowa, and
South Carolina, as well as enough money, to run a strong race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all kind of a mosaic,'' said McCain, who is also
considering the effect on his family.
</P>
<P>
   If he does run, McCain said he would like to talk about
``freedom'' for people in this country and around the world. He
said he wants to see more democracy, less government intervention,
a continuation of Ronald Reagan's government reform efforts, and a
restoration of respect for the office of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has visited New Hampshire frequently during the last five
presidential cycles. In 1996, McCain supported Senator Phil Gramm
of Texas in his bid for the nomination and then threw himself
behind former Senator Bob Dole when Gramm dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I understand that the people of New Hampshire expect
you to be visible, they expect you to understand their concerns,
and they also _ I'm of the belief they are fiercely independent,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is well known for his leadership to overhaul campaign
finance laws. If he decides to run for president, McCain said, he
would not take money from political action committees, would not
exploit any legal loopholes, and would not take so-called soft
money from the GOP. He said he would take only contributions up to
$1,000, which is the legal individual limit.

FAMILY SUPPORT SPURS MILLER TO DALLAS PBA TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAULA CABALLERO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mike Miller clasped his hands and shook them at the sky
as he dropped to his knees on the lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, baby,'' he screamed, jumping up to high-five his wife,
Jodi-Anne, and son, Chris.
</P>
<P>
   Miller struck in the 10th frame of the championship match of the
Don Carter Professional Bowlers Association Classic to beat David
Wodka, 232-223, sealing his first victory since 1992. Miller earned
$17,000 and his third PBA title in 12 years on tour with the
victory at Don Carter's All Star Lanes-West.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was there every moment for seven years between
wins,'' Miller said. ``They were either with me or at home when I
called up and told them I missed the cut again and I don't know if
I should do this any more and I hate bowling and I hate this
lifestyle, and they always said, `Keep going. You're not done yet.'
''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm not done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The finals are scheduled to be televised on ESPN at 1:30 p.m.
today.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the only professional bowler using a thumbless delivery,
led the tournament entering the finals with a dominating match-play
record of 20-3-1, two victories short of the all-time PBA record
set in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Wodka led Miller by eight pins entering the 10th frame. Wodka
struck in the first frame of the 10th but left the 1-2-4 and 10
pins in the second frame, converting for two pins in the final
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball fell off my hand,'' said Wodka, who has made six
stepladder finals but never won. ``I bowled great for 19 frames and
made one bad shot. Unfortunately, it was a shot that affected the
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Wodka beat fourth-seed Roger Bowker, who had won two matches
before falling to Wodka, 258-237.
</P>
<P>
   Bowker bowled a 279 in his first match against Jason Hurd.
Bowker took down Jason Couch in the second match, 259-144. Couch,
the only left-hander in the finals, couldn't seem to find his
groove, leaving two splits and five open frames in the match.
</P>
<P>
   Bowker, who made one one-board adjustment in three matches,
needed to strike out in the 10th frame. Instead, he left a solid
8-pin on his first ball to give Wodka the 258-237 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a great shot,'' Wodka said of Bowker. ``Ninety-nine
percent of the time, he would have struck.''
</P>
<P>
   The PBA Tour moves to Austin next week for the Columbia 300 Open
at Highland Lanes.

MAVERICKS WILL KNOW EARLY IF THEY'RE A CONTENDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His team is three-deep with legitimate players at virtually
every position. If the Mavericks' Don Nelson isn't careful, he's
going to have to actually prove that he can still coach.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen him ride a Harley. We've heard him do great radio
commercials promoting fan support for the team. We've even seen
some sleight-of-hand GM wizardry in assembling a cast of players
that have people talking about the Mavericks again.
</P>
<P>
   Now it'll be interesting to see if the Mavs have gotten good
enough to actually force Nelson _ or maybe at least Donnie _ to do
some coaching for a change.
</P>
<P>
   The depth that Nelson has provided with the signings of players
like John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, Gary Trent and Cedric Ceballos
could be very important given the intensity of the NBA's
abbreviated schedule and the fact that the NBA has already put the
Mavs under the gun by scheduling them on the road for nine of their
first 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson says the Mavs' second team may even be better than the
first. If the Mavs' young legs can come at their opponents in waves
with an up-tempo pressure game, they may be able to wear down teams
with less depth and older players, especially after a short
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving those first 11 games could be the key to the season.
</P>
<P>
   See, he's even got me doing it.
BILLY SAID WHAT?
</P>
<P>
   Billy Tubbs apologize? Excuse me if I have a little trouble
believing that. Call it an educated guess, but I'll bet you a
Kincaid's double-cheeseburger none of those words you read in this
newspaper last week ever actually slipped through Brash Billy's
lips. The purpose, however, was to avoid a WAC suspension for the
TCU basketball coach and to that end, it worked.
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH
</P>
<P>
   Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler has listened to those who say
he's better than Denver's John Elway, but seldom with a straight
face. ``I would say that is flattering,'' he says, ``if I wasn't
laughing.''
THE HELLING FILE
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling's three-year contract with the Rangers still leaves
him with the possibility of one year of arbitration after it
expires. There was talk of an option or even a four- or five-year
deal, but they couldn't work out an agreement. ... Many are
skeptical about whether Helling can win 20 games again, but not
manager Johnny Oates. ``He's a 20-game winner and he's a marked man
now,'' Oates says. ``I see no reason, though, with our offense and
improved defense, why he can't win 20 again.''
THAT MELVIN MAGIC
</P>
<P>
   Don't underestimate the signing of starting pitcher Mike Morgan
by Rangers general manager Doug Melvin. Morgan's nonguaranteed
contract provides no risk to the Rangers if he can't make the team
this spring but don't be surprised if he winds up as the fifth
starter, pushing Esteban Loaiza into the bullpen where Oates wants
him to shore up the team's long and middle relief.
THE FOUR-DECADE MAN
</P>
<P>
   Morgan came to the majors out of high school in '78, pitching
for the A's. If he can pitch a couple of more years, he'll become
one of those few players who have played in four decades. ``That's
a goal of his,'' says agent Doug Baldwin. ``He's very much aware of
it. However, this is not a guy just hanging on, trying to reach
that achievement.'' ... The Rangers were focused on getting another
starter and were zeroing in on Bob Tewksbury before he announced
his retirement.
COLONIAL TURNING TO STONE
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a good year for media relations directors in our
area. The resignation of the Mavs' Kevin Sullivan a few months ago
has now been followed by one by Lone Star Park's fine young PR man,
John Naylor. Plus, Colonial is about to announce that Jerre Todd,
who has handled media relations for the club for 30 years, is
stepping down from that post. The good news is that Glen Stone, the
former TCU sports information director, is expected to fill Todd's
spacious moccasins.
THE HITZGES EDGE
</P>
<P>
   Here's a Super Bowl tendency I'm surprised Norm Hitzges hasn't
jumped all over, and one you might keep in mind if you're headed to
Vegas this morning. Teams with animal nicknames _ Colts, Dolphins,
Broncos, Rams, Eagles, Bengals, Bears _ making their first-ever
Super Bowl appearance are a dismal 1-6.
THE BEAN-COUNTER STRIKES AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Somebody's counting those beans at TCU. The only Sun Bowl
bonuses handed out went to the football coaching staff. When TCU
went to the Weedeater Bowl in Shreveport, La., bonuses were also
handed out to the sports information office staff, the trainers,
equipment managers, etc. The kicker is that a lot of folks who
didn't get a bonus assumed they would.
THE WORM TURNS
</P>
<P>
   Miami Heat coach Pat Riley throwing out feelers about Dennis
Rodman? That's the same Riley who just two years ago said this: ``I
think he's ridiculous. Rodman is the most ridiculous thing to come
along in the league ever.'' Riley must be smelling that chance at
an NBA title now that the Bulls have been dismantled.
GOT YOUR SCUBA GEAR?
</P>
<P>
   What's this? Scottie Pippen says he's happy in Houston because
he always wanted to live on the West Coast? I knew it looked kind
of wet out there this weekend.
NOT COUNTING THE BIG EASY
</P>
<P>
   Here's a shocker. Members of the '94 San Diego Chargers say that
NFL security men have told them they were the wildest, partying-est
team ever at Super Bowl XXIX in '95 at Miami. No way. I'll put the
Cowboys, in their limos, in Phoenix the following January, against
any Super Bowl party team ... in any game outside of New Orleans,
that is.
WRESTLE-MANIA
</P>
<P>
   Mark Von Erich, cousin to the famed Fritz Von Erich family, has
opened a school for aspiring professional wrestlers at Cowtown Gym
in west Fort Worth.
REVO'S RIMSHOTS
</P>
<P>
   There's a company that says it's going to distribute 100,000
condoms to Super Bowl fans today, which makes the little
chip-and-dip party you had planned sound a little on the mild side,
doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' offensive line prides itself on not talking to the
media and there's a system of fines for those who occasionally
break the code of silence. Some $5,500 wound up in the kitty
(somebody must have been talking some reporter's ear off), so they
used it to go out to dinner at (yummy) Joe's Stone Crab in Miami
Beach last week. South Florida's stone crab population may never
recover.
</P>
<P>
   Can Rangers president Tom Schieffer imagine a time when the
Rangers will have to pay somebody $100 million? ``I hope not. If we
do, God help us all.'' Sorry, Tom, like the sign says, ``In God we
trust; everybody else pays cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevie Wonder and Gloria Estefan I can believe as part of the
Super Bowl halftime extravaganza. But Big Bad Voo Doo Daddy? Who
does he have pictures of?

NAILON CAN'T HALT TCU FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Chants of ``overrated'' were once again showering down
on TCU coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   No. 24 TCU had just been upset by Rice, 76-69, less than a week
after being upset by Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs' defense looked spotty in squandering a
double-digit, second-half lead to Rice. The Horned Frogs' leading
scorer looked rusty as they struggled to score in crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   And overrated looked to be a pretty accurate description for a
Horned Frogs team that has lost three in a row for the first time
since the beginning of the 1996-97 Western Athletic Conference
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a down time right now,'' Horned Frogs coach Billy
Tubbs admitted. ``We need to get back and regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss came despite Lee Nailon returning to the Frogs lineup
after a one-game suspension. TCU's leading scorer missed Monday's
game against Tulsa while serving an NCAA-mandated suspension after
he was ejected 34 seconds into TCU's overtime loss to Nevada-Las
Vegas last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon finished with 15 points, eight rebounds and four fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have a good night, as you all know,'' Tubbs said.
``I think Lee's out of sync. I also think he took another physical
beating. It's hard to shoot with a player draped all over you.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquise Gainous led TCU (15-6, 3-4, WAC) with 17 points and 10
rebounds, and Shannon Long and Ryan Carroll each added 12. Rice's
Robert Johnson led all scorers with 24 points, and Alex Bougaieff
had 14 points and 18 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's huge,'' Owls coach Willis Wilson said of Bougaieff's
rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Bougaieff, along with some timely buckets, helped to erase a TCU
lead that had grown as big as 12 four minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson banged in a pair of free throws with 2:42
remaining, the Owls (14-5, 5-2 WAC) had their first lead since
early in the first half. They never trailed again, improving their
record to 11-1 at Autry Court.
</P>
<P>
   TCU was outscored 14-2 in the final 5:38.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem like in the last two minutes we could stop them
defensively,'' Tubbs said. ``When it got down to time to make plays
with the game on the line, we didn't make any plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs couldn't make a free throw, either. They were 6-of-16
on the game. Rebounding was a struggle, too. Rice held a 47-36
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If they didn't have enough problems, the Frogs were also
battling foul trouble. Long and Thomas McTyer both fouled out while
Nailon played with four fouls down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs guard Vladimir Jaksic wasn't available. He suffered
an injury to his left heel early in the first half and did not
return. He will be examined today to determine his status for
Saturday's game against SMU.
</P>
<P>
   The loss closed out the first half of Western Athletic
Conference play for the Frogs. They finished 3-4 but play five of
seven games in the second half at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.

TEXAS TECH WOMEN SLEEPWALK THEIR WAY PAST BAYLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Sleeping late may have been the next order of
business for Texas Tech's Lady Raiders after last night's
harder-than-it-looks 65-48 victory over Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing we've done lately has been pretty or easy,'' Texas
Tech coach Marsha Sharp said. ``I don't know if we're not in sync
or it's indicative of the strength of the Big 12. I think maybe
some of both.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech led only 50-46 with five minutes to play before scoring 15
consecutive points to slip away from the Lady Bears (11-9, 3-5).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to take a win if we can get it,'' Sharp said.
``At this point, it's called survival. We're glad to have a week
off. We're tired and dead-legged.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-ranked Lady Raiders (19-2, 8-1) don't play again until
Saturday's battle at Texas. They look like they could use the rest.
Tech was outrebounded for the third consecutive game and made only
35 percent of their shots.
</P>
<P>
   Center Angie Braziel, a 50.7 percent shooter at tipoff, made
only five of 19 shots, yet finished with 14 points and eight
rebounds. The boost came from guard Julie Lake, who scored a game-
and season-high 21 points. That included 15 of 16 from the
free-throw line, seven of eight in the last 2:27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever taken 16 free throws in a game,'' Lake
said. ``I just concentrated and acted like it was practice every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said it was Lake's best performance since returning on
Jan. 6 after missing five games with an elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw her do more of the things we've come to expect from
her,'' Sharp said. ``She slashed to the basket and tried to draw
some fouls and was our most efficient offensive player.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead changed hands seven times before Braziel hit two free
throws three minutes into the second half for a 31-30 Tech lead.
But the game stayed tight until Lara Webb hit a short bank shot
with 5:01 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The score doesn't represent the way the game was played,''
said Webb, who led Baylor with 16 points. ``We got stuck on 46. It
was down to the wire. Just with the fouling at the end, it seemed a
blowout.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech went on an 8-0 run. And then Lake hit five of six free
throws with 1:13 to play _ two on a foul by Mandy Hayworth, two
more when Hayworth got a technical for stamping her foot and two
more when Baylor coach Sonja Hogg received a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually suspend a player who gets a technical, but Mandy
won't be suspended,'' Hogg said. ``If that's a comment on
officiating _ whatever.''

NOWITZKI MAKES GOOD IMPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dirk Nowitzki wore noticeable red-and-white sneakers in
his first game as a Mavericks player.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the young man from Germany was trying to make sure he
wasn't missed. And Nowitzki made his statement, scoring 15 points
and grabbing eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   However, it wasn't enough as the Mavericks dropped their
preseason opener to the Phoenix Suns, 116-110, before a crowd of
about 13,000 last night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki made five of 13 shots and said he was satisfied with
his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the first time out, it was all right,'' he said.
``I should have gotten a couple more rebounds and knocked down a
couple more shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley led the Mavericks with 26 points, and Cedric
Ceballos added 23 and a game-high 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Cedric Ceballos is our leading rebounder with 12,
something's wrong,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said. ``I was a
little disappointed with our defense in the first half, but in the
second half we picked it up.''
\Nsubheds:CLASS REUNION
</P>
<P>
   It was a most unusual shootaround yesterday morning at Reunion
Arena.

<P>
   On one side was current Mavericks players and former Phoenix
Suns players Finley, Ceballos, Steve Nash, John ``Hot Rod''
Williams and A.C. Green. On the other side was current Suns players
and former Mavericks players Jason Kidd, George McCloud, Shawn
Respert and Pat Garrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a class reunion out there,'' said Mavericks
assistant coach Donnie Nelson, himself a former Suns assistant
coach. ``We were out there for 15-20 minutes talking to each other.
It was amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You started getting in deep conversations about a guy's
family, and then another guy's coming up to talk to you. It's like
your wedding day. You can't do everybody justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash said to him it felt ``like a company picnic or yearbook
signing. Everyone knew everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   When Don Nelson inserted Green for Chris Anstey with 55.7
seconds left in the first period and the Mavericks trailing, 30-26,
Nelson had all five of the former Suns in the game at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Nelson said the old gang was going to get together to go
out to dinner Friday night in Dallas, but canceled because of the
bad weather.
\Nsubheds:INJURY UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Gary Trent (hip flexor), Samaki Walker (ankle) and Erick
Strickland (flu/ankle) did not play last night because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Donnie Nelson said Walker and Trent were
sidelined for precautionary reasons.
\Nsubheds:KIDD A FAN OF NASH'S
</P>
<P>
   Add Phoenix Suns guard Jason Kidd to the list of folks who said
Steve Nash's signing a six-year contract extension with the
Mavericks last Monday was one of the smartest moves the franchise
has made in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Nash was the Suns' third point guard behind Kidd and
Kevin Johnson. Although Nash averaged just 21.9 minutes per game,
Kidd saw enough of him to know that the Mavericks' offense is in
capable hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him and love to still have him,'' Kidd said. ``He has
his dreams of running his own team and I think Dallas made a good
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made some bad ones down here, but I think Steve will
work out fine for them. Hopefully he'll do the little things to get
these fans excited again. It was a special place here in '95, but
it looks like they're turning the corner to get back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd was the Mavericks' first-round pick in 1994. But he was
shocked and extremely upset when they traded him to the Suns on
Dec. 26, 1996.
\Nsubheds:SLIPPERY CAB
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks center John Williams received a scare yesterday when
he stepped out of a taxi in Dallas, slipped and scraped his chin
and hurt his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams wasn't going to let a little nick keep him out of
his first game as a Mavericks player, and his first game against
his former team. He played last night and had eight points and four
rebounds.
\Nsubheds:NASH'S SUPER BASH
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash will host a Super Bowl party today at his home in
Phoenix for the entire Mavericks team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going straight from the plane to the bus to his house,''
Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson said. ``That'll be nice to
have all of us together at his home.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas plays its final preseason game in Phoenix at 8 tomorrow
night. The Mavericks' plane will leave Dallas at 1 today.
\Nsubheds:BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   When he entered the game for the first time midway through the
second quarter, center Shawn Bradley was greeted with half cheers
and half boos.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks gave away all 18,121 tickets for last night's
game. That new sellout crowd is 76 more than the Reunion Arena
capacity last year. The added seats are along the baseline and in
the press box area for the Stars games. About 13,000 fans were
actually inside Reunion Arena last night.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:MAVERICKS REPORT
</P>
<P>
   News of the day: Samaki Walker said he and the Mavericks are not
far apart, as far as him signing a new contract with Dallas. The
Mavericks offered Walker a four-year, $20 million deal on Friday,
and Walker and agent Norm Nixon have yet to make a counter offer.
``There's no bitter feelings about their offer,'' Walker said. ``If
I sign for four years, then I can come back in four years and sign
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nowitzki Watch: Nowitzki hit his first shot last night. He
said he got a little winded during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Shots: Michael Finley and Cedric Ceballos played beautiful
music together last season, and they were in rhythm again last
night. On one play, Ceballos received a long pass, did a pirouette,
and while in the air flipped a pass to Finley, who converted a
nifty layup.
</P>
<P>
   The Lineup: Michael Finley and Steve Nash started in the
backcourt, Dirk Nowitzki and A.C. Green at forwards and Chris
Anstey at center. The second half started with Finley and Nash in
the backcourt, Cedric Ceballos and Nowitzki at forward, and Shawn
Bradley at center.
</P>
<P>
   The Quote: ``We were exciting and colorful.'' _ Don Nelson
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming: The Mavericks play their second and final preseason
game at 8 tomorrow night in Phoenix.

TWENTY-THREE ODD STEPS TO THE NEW NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get ready for the NBA's irregular season.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-month lockout, Michael Jordan's retirement, the
breakup of the Chicago Bulls and a frenzied free agency, the NBA
returns Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first glance it may not be attractive, but you don't go out
with a woman on the first date and say you're going to marry her,''
Rockets forward Charles Barkley said. ``Let's give this season a
chance before we judge it. It might turn out to be a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In honor of Jordan's departure, a look at 23 oddities fans must
get used to in a Cliff Notes version of the NBA season:
</P>
<P>
   1. No All-Star Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   2. Kurt Thomas off crutches. And actually playing. In New York.
</P>
<P>
   3. Scottie Pippen and Antoine Carr in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Bulls joining the post-Bill Russell Celtics of '70-71 as
the only defending champs to miss the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   5. Paul Westphal in Seattle; George Karl in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   6. Players making time to sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   7. Jud Buechler playing key minutes in Detroit. Coach Alvin
Gentry said he expects the former Bulls reserve to ``be shooting 10
or 15 times a game.''
</P>
<P>
   8. Someone other than Jordan winning the scoring title. Utah's
Karl Malone, the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal or Orlando's Anfernee
Hardaway will lead the league.
</P>
<P>
   9. Tim Floyd in Phil Jackson's seat.
</P>
<P>
   10. Latrell Sprewell in New York and Isaiah Rider out of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   11. The first-ever mascot _ a leprechaun gymnast _ in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   12. Dennis Rodman in Miami, and still married.
</P>
<P>
   13. Derek Harper in L.A., with the Lakers, Sam Perkins in
Indiana, and Shawn Bradley on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   14. Bison Dele, no longer Brian Williams, starting at center in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   15. Back-to-back-to-back games. Older players such as the
Knicks' Patrick Ewing will sit out No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   16. Antonio McDyess, Nick Van Exel and Raef LaFrentz leading
Denver to more victories than last season's 11.
</P>
<P>
   17. Mitch Richmond in Washington; Chris Webber and Vlade Divac
in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   18. Empty seats and no television cameras at Chicago's United
Center.
</P>
<P>
   19. Stockton-to-Malone. Some things never change.
</P>
<P>
   20. Suns point guard Jason Kidd becoming irritated with
slow-footed teammates Rex Chapman, Tom Gugliotta and Luc Longley.
</P>
<P>
   21. The Mavericks finishing less than 26 games out of first
place in the Midwest Division, which will be their best showing
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   22. For the first time since 1948-49, the Celtics and Lakers not
facing each other.
</P>
<P>
   23. Mavericks forward Cedric Ceballos being the only significant
player wearing Jordan's old number.
SPOTLIGHT ON WHERE WILL RODMAN'S CIRCUS SIDESHOW PLAY?
</P>
<P>
   Where will The Worm turn up?
</P>
<P>
   After an off-season in which he got married, almost un-married,
retired then un-retired, Dennis Rodman says he'll snare rebounds
and force double-takes in Orlando or Miami. Both Magic coach Chuck
Daly and Heat boss Pat Riley are hesitatingly intrigued by His
Freakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would entertain that thought only on the fact that it would
have to be on the Miami Heat's terms, not Dennis' terms,'' said
Riley, who indicated those terms would include perfect attendance
at practices, punctual arrival for games and workouts, and a
commitment to work under the same guidelines as his teammates.
``There's no denying his talent and what he brings to a team.''
</P>
<P>
   For Riley, the reversal in tone is remarkable. During the 1997
playoffs against Chicago, when Rodman was taunting and pestering
Heat center Alonzo Mourning, Riley said of Rodman: ``I think he's
ridiculous. Rodman is the most ridiculous thing to come along in
the league ever.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, when reminded of the comment, Riley smiled and
said, ``I may have said that at one time.''
QUICK HITS
OFFBEAT BEAT
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, Dwayne Schintzius fell in love with
basketball, a woman and tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   When all three feelings subsided, he quit basketball, got
divorced and ... oops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rub it off,'' he said, noting that an artist has
since fashioned a panther to cover the name of his ex-wife. ``This
other one,'' he said, looking at his left arm, ``I have no idea
what I was thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   His love of the game restored, the 7-foot-3 Schintzius has been
the surprise of the Celtics' camp. His playing time, in turn, has
rekindled his inkling toward body art.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my boy and mentor: Bart Simpson. He's who I try to
emulate,'' said Schintzius, displaying the fresh tattoo on his left
ankle. ``Let's face it, I'm a natural goofball.''
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on a possible reunion with his wife.
BEST AND WORST
</P>
<P>
   Worst trade: Brent Barry's free-agent signing in Chicago leaves
coach Pat Riley and the Heat with nothing to show for trading Ike
Austin to the Clippers last February.
</P>
<P>
   Best debut: Latrell Sprewell's opening night on Broadway was a
smashing success _ 27 points on 11-of-14 shooting. As for his
relationship with Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy? ``He's been
everything you want a guy to be,'' said Van Gundy. ``He works hard,
doesn't say anything, stays late and comes early, and wants to
learn. He's great.''
QUOTE OF NOTE
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to play basketball. I'm tired of breaking rules,
fighting the system and being a knucklehead.'' _ Blazers guard
Isaiah Rider, who surprisingly stayed out of trouble during the
lockout
CRYSTAL ROUNDBALL
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce will be a decidedly better rookie in Boston than
Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas. ... Rod Strickland signs in Washington,
Jim Jackson in New Jersey and Kevin Johnson in Detroit.
DRIBBLING AROUND THE EAST
Knicks forward Larry Johnson dropped 20 pounds while fasting over
29-day Ramadan. ... The Wizards' free exhibition was littered with
chants of ``We Want Rod!'' from sellout of 14,000. ... He Got
Brains: Instead of hiring an agent, Bucks guard Ray Allen has hired
O.J. Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran on an hourly basis to assist
him in the contract extension he hopes to work out with Milwaukee.
DRIBBLING AROUND THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   Biggest lockout loser is Joe Smith, who signed a one-year deal
worth $1.75 million in Minnesota after turning down a four-year,
$36 million offer in Golden State. ... Mavericks coach Don Nelson
on Phoenix settling for Tom Gugliotta instead of Antonio McDyess:
``Googs is as good if not better than McDyess. He's not as
spectacular, but we're talking basketball.'' ... Sonics coach Paul
Westphal has been stunned by Houston teen-ager Rashard Lewis, whom
he calls ``a can't-miss, big-time star in this league.''
INSIDE THE NUMBERS
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   For once, an athlete making the well-worn claim has backed it
up. Tom Gugliotta chose the Phoenix Suns over the Minnesota
Timberwolves last week, leaving an unprecedented, guaranteed $28
million on the table. ``Either way, you'd have to live about 440
years to spend all that money, and I don't think that's going to
happen,'' said Gugliotta, who could have made $86 million in
Minnesota but will instead settle for a measly $58 million in
Phoenix. A breakdown of the offers: Year Minnesota Phoenix 1998-99
$9.0 $7.8 1999-00 $10.1 $8.5 2000-01 $11.0 $9.3 2001-02 $12.3 $10.1
2002-03 $13.5 $10.9 2003-04 $14.6 $11.7 2004-05 $15.7 _ Total $86.6
$58.5

WITH SPORTS OF THE CENTURY PACKAGE 
A MYSTERY IS SOLVED FOR A TURN-OF-CENTURY MAJOR-LEAGUER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On March 24, 1901, one month before the Detroit Tigers began
their first season as a major-league team, manager George Stallings
reached an important decision regarding his lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings announced that William G. ``Kid'' Nance, a 25-year-old
native of Fort Worth, would be the Tigers' starting left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the field, where Nance is at home, he will bat much
stronger than last year,'' Stallings told the ``Detroit Evening
News''. ``I like his way of going at a ball and he is a good judge
of flies, besides being much the best thrower we have ... there is
nobody in the American League who can get one from the fence to the
plate as fast as he does.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers had just acquired Nance from Minneapolis of the
American Association, reaffirming the one genuine distinction for
one of the most obscure baseball players ever. Nance was the first
person born in Fort Worth to play in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings had high hopes for the former Texas League batting
champion, who had been a part-time player for two seasons with
Louisville in the National League. Those hopes would not be
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Nance would play one season in Detroit, then drift back to the
minor leagues. He would serve a stint as manager of the Texas
League's Fort Worth Panthers and six seasons as TCU's baseball
coach before fading into near-oblivion. Much of his life and
playing career has been lost by time.
</P>
<P>
   When Nance died in 1958, less than 50 people showed up at his
funeral, mostly ex-Fort Worth baseball players. Many of them
remembered Nance as the player who lost his job to Ty Cobb, which
was not true.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, few people even knew he was the first major-league
player from the Fort Worth area, the forerunner of Rogers Hornsby,
Ben Grieve, Ellis Burks, Pete Donohue, Spike Owen and others. This
is the first time his career has been fully documented.
TRUE SON OF TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Nance was born Aug. 2, 1876, in Fort Worth. His family
originally came to Texas in the Stephen F. Austin Colony near
Houston. He was born Willie G. Cooper, but his mother remarried and
he took the surname of his stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in the Daggett Addition of Fort Worth, where he must
have been a player of some note. He signed with the Fort Worth
Panthers of the Texas League at age 18, but then jumped to Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Nance was quoted as saying, ``I would have been in
trouble, but the Fort Worth manager didn't think I'd amount to
anything and let me stay in Sherman.''
</P>
<P>
   The story goes he was called ``Kid'' because he signed so young.
He was 5-foot-7, weighing around 165 pounds and could run fast.
Baseball historian Bill James said many players of that era who
were small and fast often were called Kid.
</P>
<P>
   He played for Fort Worth and Galveston in 1896. His breakthrough
year was 1897, when he hit .395 for Galveston and won the Texas
League batting title. That prompted the Louisville Colonels of the
National League to purchase his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Nance made his major-league debut on Aug. 19, 1897, going
0-for-3 in the Colonels' 3-0 loss to the New York Giants. He played
right field. The ``Louisville Times''' only comment was: ``Nance,
the new outfielder, doesn't seem to be the only pebble on the
beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other pebbles were significant players, including
two future Hall of Famers: shortstop Honus Wagner and
outfielder/manager Fred Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Nance hit his first home run in his second game, and the
Colonels beat the Giants, 9-3. He was dubbed the ``Texas Wonder''
by newspapers, but glory was fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   He played 35 games with Louisville the rest of the season,
hitting .242. He stayed with the Colonels the following year as a
reserve, hitting .316. But he couldn't break into a starting
outfield of Clarke (.307), Dummy Hoy (.304) and Charles Dexter
(.316) and at some point was sent to Paterson (N.J.) in the
Atlantic League.
</P>
<P>
   He never did get back to Louisville. Instead, he was bought by
the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association, the highest
minor league. He hit .269 the first year in Minneapolis, then
raised it to .309 in 1900. He also played third base that year,
presumably because of his strong arm, but committed a
league-leading 73 errors.
TIGERS TALE
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were attracted by his batting average and signed him
to play left field. The 1901 season would be the high point of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers opened at home April 26 against the Milwaukee
Brewers, a team that would become the St. Louis Browns the next
season and eventually the Baltimore Orioles. The Brewers led 13-4
going into the ninth inning before the Tigers rallied for 10 runs
and a 14-13 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Nance was 1-for-5 and committed one of Detroit's seven errors.
His contribution in the 10-run ninth was making the only out.
</P>
<P>
   His season was solid but not spectacular. He batted sixth or
seventh in the lineup and hit .280. Six regulars on the Tigers hit
higher than that, but he was third on the team with 24 doubles, 66
runs batted in and 51 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Nance, always a good bunter, had 24 sacrifice hits and his
strong arm produced 19 assists. But he also committed 20 errors and
his nine stolen bases were the eighth-lowest on a team that stole
204 bases overall. He also showed a temper _ not unusual for the
rough-and-tumble era _ by getting kicked out of one game for
arguing balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   He lasted in Detroit one year. Stallings, his biggest supporter,
had a running feud with league president Ban Johnson over the
umpiring and lost his job at the end of the season. The Tigers were
sold, and new owner Frank Navin brought in Frank Dwyer, a former
National League umpire, to manage.
</P>
<P>
   Nance was let go. The Tigers raided the National League for Dick
Harley, a five-year veteran who had hit .273 with 37 stolen bases
for Cincinnati. Harley had also played minor-league baseball in
Detroit years before and was something of a local legend.
</P>
<P>
   Nance spent the next five years in the American Association,
first in Kansas City and then with Toledo. He was one of the best
outfielders in the league, regularly among the leaders in hitting
and runs scored. It was about this time the two mysteries
surrounding his life were created.
THE ``DOC'' IS OUT
</P>
<P>
   For many years Macmillan's ``The Baseball Encyclopedia'' showed
Nance played in one game with the 1904 St. Louis Browns, going
1-for-3. It was through that erroneous reporting he was giving the
nickname ``Doc,'' which he was never called in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Research by the Baseball Hall of Fame determined that a
typographical error in a St. Louis newspaper referred to Browns
catcher Mike Kahoe as Nance and somehow that game eventually was
merged into Nance's record. The problem has since been cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of supposedly being the player who lost
his job to Ty Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Nance was with Kansas City until midway through the 1905 season,
when he was traded to Toledo for another major-league outfielder,
Dave Zearfoss. He finished the season with Toledo and spent 1906
with the Mud Hens as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb, meanwhile, made his major-league debut for the Tigers on
Aug. 30, 1905, having just been purchased from Augusta (Ga.) of the
South Atlantic League. He replaced center fielder Jimmy Barrett,
who was injured.
</P>
<P>
   In 1906, Cobb won a regular job as the Tigers center fielder
with Hall of Famer Sam Crawford in left and Matty McIntyre in
right. Davy Jones and Freddy Payne were the reserves. Barrett was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   It is Barrett, not Nance, who lost his job to baseball's
all-time leading hitter.
COACH NANCE
Nance's career began to decline at this point. He hit .274 for
Toledo in 1906 with 20 doubles and seven triples. But that was his
last year in the American Association. He played for Sioux City
(S.D.) the following year and hit .297, but in a part-time role.
</P>
<P>
   He started to drift through the minors: Waco of the Texas League
in 1908, Fort Worth and Shreveport in 1909 and the Jackson (Miss.)
Senators in the Cotton States League.
</P>
<P>
   He managed the Senators to a 71-37 record and they finished a
half-game game behind Greenwood (Miss.) in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   By 1913 he was through as a player, and TCU hired him as
baseball coach. His team lost only one game, and that June, in a
move that caused big headlines in the ``Star-Telegram'', Nance
replaced J. Walter Morris as manager of the Fort Worth Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The story said, ``Kid Nance, the new field manager, is one of
the most popular players that ever donned a uniform. He is known
wherever baseball is known. ... It has been said of Nance, that
what he doesn't know of baseball `ain't.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nance managed the Panthers for parts of three seasons and later
returned to coach TCU in 1918, according to ``Sports Champions of
Fort Worth'' by Flem Hall. The Horned Frogs won four Texas
Interscholastic Athletic Association titles under him, and his
teams included future major-league pitchers Pete Donohue and Tex
Carleton.
</P>

   In 1926, after a second-place finish in the Southwest
Conference, Nance was replaced as baseball coach by Dutch Meyer. He
was almost 50 and his baseball career was over. He spent his final
32 years in Fort Worth and raised bird dogs, according to his
obituary in the ``Star-Telegram''.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Fay, passed away in 1951. There are no reports of
children. He spent his last five years in a rest home and, at one
point, his right leg was amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's first major-league player died on May 28, 1958, and
is buried in Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Park. The apartment
building on 408 Grainger, where he last lived in Fort Worth, is now
an empty lot. There is no marker on his grave.

FOOTBALL'S DEADLY EARLY DAYS ALMOST RESULTED IN ITS BEING BANNED
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening years of the 20th century, the relatively new
game of football was still trying to figure itself out.
</P>
<P>
   The original collegiate game between Princeton and Rutgers in
1869 actually resembled a huge soccer//rugby match, and the sport _
played mostly in the East and Midwest _ was refined during the next
few decades.
</P>
<P>
   By 1905, it had become so refined President Theodore Roosevelt
considered abolishing it.
</P>
<P>
   Appalled at the sport's violent toll _ 18 deaths were recorded
in 1904 _ Roosevelt called a meeting of representatives of Yale,
Princeton and Harvard, plus Walter Camp and others among the game's
notables.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a new set of rules that ended the ``Flying
Wedge.''
</P>
<P>
   Included was the introduction of the forward pass in 1906,
helpfully suggested by a young coach named John Heisman, who
predicted it would ``scatter the mob.''
</P>
<P>
   But the game remained largely a contest of brute force for many
years; there were 53 recorded deaths in 1907-09, according to the
``Chicago Tribune''. As yet, nobody wore a helmet, and players
simply tried to grow their hair long for extra padding.
</P>
<P>
   During one early game in Oklahoma, a passing county sheriff came
upon the scene and _ naturally assuming it to be a drunken brawl _
rushed in to break it up and make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   By 1900, several Texas schools had taken up the sport, including
future Southwest Conference members Texas, Texas A&AMP;M, Baylor and
TCU _ which was then located in Waco and called AddRan College.
</P>
<P>
   The unquestioned king of the hill was the team from Austin,
which in 1900 launched an undefeated season with a 28-2 victory
over the Oklahoma Rough Riders, who had not yet learned to call
themselves Sooners. It was the first game in what would become a
long and storied series.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns were coached by Samuel Huston ``Shy'' Thompson,
who would later become an assistant U.S. attorney general under
President Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1901, Thompson had Texas rolling along toward another
unbeaten season when, between road games at Missouri and Kansas,
the team stopped off in a small town for a game with a group of
local osteopaths.
</P>
<P>
   The town was Kirksville, and the team eventually became known as
the Missouri Osteopaths. They beat the Longhorns, 48-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a real bunch of outlaws,'' said Lou Maysel, retired
sports editor of the ``Austin American Statesman'' and author of
the 1970 book /Here Come The Longhorns''.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were composed of players picked up from all over the
countryside,'' Maysel said. ``And during the game, their coach
served as one of the referees. Every time one of his players was
running for a touchdown, he would stand in the way of the Texas
tacklers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was customary in those days for the hometown fans to come
down to the sideline and taunt the opposing team. In this game,
they actually came onto the field and interfered. Technically,
however, it was one of the cleanest games ever played; only two
penalties were called the whole afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   The account in the UT student newspaper later summed up the
affair by noting that, ``They cussed us and beat us and just ran
all over us.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1904, the Longhorns considered themselves sufficiently
advanced to schedule a game with one of the true national
heavyweights: the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a real national power,'' Maysel said ``The coach was
Amos Alonzo Stagg, and they had a famous All-American named Walter
Eckersall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas team stopped off in St. Louis and beat Washington
University on the way up to Chicago, and they got a really big
buildup when they finally got up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to newspaper accounts, the Texas team averaged 197
pounds per man, which would have been incredible for that day and
age, if it had been true. Actually, they averaged out at 166.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a cartoon in the paper depicting three Texas players
with horns growing out of their heads, while another one was firing
a couple of pistols. On game day, the crowd was about 10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas star Don ``Mogul'' Robinson returned the opening kickoff
to midfield, and the Longhorns swept downfield to the Maroons' goal
line. There, they fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eckersall picked it up and ran 100 yards for a touchdown,''
Maysel said. ``And that was the start of it. The final score was
68-0.''
</P>
<P>
   On its own block, however, Texas was virtually invincible,
compiling a winning percentage of nearly .750 for the decade. At
the beginning of the 1909 season, the combined efforts of A&AMP;M,
Baylor, TCU and Oklahoma had produced a total of two victories over
the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1909, the Aggies hired an aggressive coach named Charley
Moran _ who beat Texas twice that year, 23-0 and 5-0 _ and the
state began gradually to move toward the formation of an eight-team
conference, which opened play in 1915. /

THE GREAT RACE EPITOMIZED A DECADE OF ADVENTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Schuster took one look at Lt. Hans Von Koeppen at the
wheel and knew the German car would be the one to beat in the
``Around the World Race.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuster and the other crew members of the American entry
``Thomas Flyer'' had no idea of the epic hardships that lay ahead
on the sensational but ill-planned automobile race from New York
City to Paris, including a winter try across the frozen Bering
Straits into Siberia, that covered more than 12,400 miles.
</P>
<P>
   All Schuster knew on Feb. 12, 1908, when six cars and thousands
of excited onlookers jammed Broadway just north of Times Square,
was that the Prussian held the Americans in complete contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never did trust that fellow, always strutting around looking
like he just stepped out of a band box,'' Schuster told writer Mark
Sufrin in the book, ``The Brave Men''. ``He smelled too pretty to
be on the square.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of one of the most extraordinary sporting
events ever held in a decade that specialized in the unique and the
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   There were relatively few organized sports in the first decade
of this century. Major League Baseball was established, but there
was no professional football or professional basketball. College
football was in its infancy. Tennis and golf were limited to
Wimbledon and the United States and British Opens.
</P>
<P>
   There was an abundance of great individual courage and unlimited
optimism among men and women eager to go higher, farther and faster
than ever before in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   The same adventurous ardor that on Dec. 17, 1903, allowed
Orville and Wilbur Wright to fly an airplane across the sand dunes
of Kitty Hawk pervaded the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps nothing better demonstrated the spirit of the decade
than the Great Race, as it was called.
</P>
<P>
   The race started in February to allow for a summer try across
the Arctic. There were six cars entered: three French, one Italian,
the German Protos and the Thomas Flyer, a 70-horsepower, 4-cylinder
American car. Montagu Roberts drove with Schuster as the mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty miles outside New York, the cars ran into one of the
worst blizzards on record. One French car broke down and dropped
out while the others slipped and slid their way across the country,
continually spinning into ditches and snowbanks. The Thomas Flyer,
a late entry, had to be overhauled in Buffalo, but then slowly
pulled away from the others as they progressed across the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A second French car dropped out in Iowa. Another ran off the
snowy road in Indiana. Farmers demanded outrageous fees to pull
them, but the driver instead forced them to do so at gunpoint,
Sufrin reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans led by 600 miles going through Omaha but Roberts
grew tired of the race and withdrew. Schuster took over as driver
and another mechanic was brought aboard. The Protos threw two rods
in Utah and Koeppen had his car shipped by rail to Seattle, which
allowed him to miss 1,000 miles of the worst country.
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas Flyer reached Alaska on April 8 but found the roads
impassable and had to be shipped back to Seattle. The committee
redrew the route, allowing for a fresh start in the Russian city of
Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were given a 15-day bonus for their trip to Alaska
and the Protos was given a seven-day handicap for shipping by rail,
which would prove crucial to the outcome. The last French car
dropped out and the Italian Zust was delayed by three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a two-car race from there across Northern China, Mongolia
and Russia through snow, rain, cold winds and other hardships. The
Thomas Flyer's luck began to run out.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster lost five days getting stuck in a swamp and might still
be there if the Thomas Flyer hadn't been pulled out and towed to
the nearest town by a band of Cossacks. Later a ferry sank taking
them across a Russian river. Fortunately the water was shallow and
a team of oxen came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Their worst problem was a defective transmission that broke down
three times, once while graciously pulling the Protos out of a mud
bog. After great neck-and-neck racing across the heart of Russia,
the Germans pulled away while the Americans continued to have
engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Protos entered Paris on July 27, three days ahead of the
Thomas Flyer. The city was silent. Koeppen drove to ``Le Matin'',
the newspaper sponsoring the race, but the offices were closed. So
was the French Automobile Club. The French ignored him everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later the Thomas Flyer was greeted outside the city
by thousands of people and cars, and was escorted into the city.
The reception was tumultuous.
</P>
<P>
   As Sufrin wrote, ``The French knew who had won the epic race.''

   MIAMI _ Into each Super Bowl, a little craziness must fall.
</P>
<P>
   Yo, Tim, that's your cue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy myself, man. That's why I love playing this sport,''
Tim Dwight says. ``Every time you're on the field, you can do
something wild and crazy, especially on special teams. It's 100
miles an hour. I just try to do some things people wouldn't
normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the abnormal world of Dwight, the kamikaze rookie who
returns and covers kicks and punts for the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   And doesn't look the part.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight is all of 5-foot-8 and 184 pounds. He has thinning hair
that makes him look older than his 23 years and an insatiable
thirst for the hair-raising that makes you wonder if this guy will
live to be as old as he looks.
</P>
<P>
   In just one season, he has become the poster boy for those
fringe fans of the NFL who also dwell on the edge and accept the
game even if it is a tad tame for their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just my game. If people call it fearless, that's great.
If people like the way I play, that's great,'' he said. ``I just
play football 100 miles per hour, the way it should be played, and
like every play is my last play.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Dwight plays, there is always that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   As Falcons coach Dan Reeves puts it, ``Tim does things that make
you go, `No, no, no! Yes, yes, yes!' You can't help but like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight just shrugs, which is one of the tamest things he has
done this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people like to see players play like that,'' he said.
``Sometimes we get the bad rap because we get paid all this money
and guys don't play to their potential. I just play every play as
hard as I can. The biggest challenge for any athlete is to try and
dominate yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight can't play any other way because he is an adrenaline
junkie.
</P>
<P>
   When the players had the day off Tuesday, most spent the time
relaxing. Dwight rented a jet ski.
</P>
<P>
   He has raced motorcycles at 145 mph. He once dove off a 90-foot
cliff into the icy Wisconsin River. While at Iowa, he jumped out a
third-floor dormitory window into a pile of snow.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight also is a sprinter and plans to use his final year of
eligibility in track and field this spring by running at Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to try snowboarding, too. Dwight has been watching the
Winter X Games on TV this week and can't wait to give it a go.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, there's this little thing called the Super Bowl
on Sunday at Pro Player Stadium. Dwight will be there. So will his
Falcon teammates, and the defending champion Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight wants to have an impact on the outcome. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 27 yards returning kickoffs and 8.5 running back
punts this season. He returned one kickoff 93 yards for a
touchdown. He had 173 combined yards in the Falcons' upset of the
Minnesota Vikings in the NFC championship game, raising his playoff
averages to 15 yards on punt returns and 26.6 on kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special teams can be the X factor in a game like this, and I
want to be the X factor in this game,'' Dwight said. ``Sure, you
get scared playing special teams. But that's the excitement about
it, overcoming your fear. It gets you jacked up.''

 &HT;    Scientists say Everglades restoration could take a decade
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Are you hoping for a healthier Lake
Okeechobee, a cleaner Lake Worth Lagoon, an Everglades where great
throngs of wading birds once again soar above the saw grass?
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Congress approves a $7.8 billion Everglades restoration
plan next year, scientists say it will take more than a decade
before South Florida's threatened marshes, lakes, bays and rivers
see any major relief. Two big reservoirs, intended to help restore
the Everglades' life-giving pulses of water, wouldn't be finished
until 2036.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, farmers and the region's expanding suburbs would
see improvements in their water supply by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say the Everglades can't wait. They want
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to rewrite its $400 million-a-year
work schedule for the project, placing the environmental
improvements first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress isn't going to go for this,'' said Shannon Estenoz of
the World Wildlife Fund after the corps release its schedule last
week. ``We can't be 10 years and $3 billion down the road and see
almost no improvements in the natural system.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club activist Rod Tirrell agreed: ``This doesn't show any
kind of restoration other than a couple token projects in the first
decade.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Sierra Club, the schedule could be a make-or-break issue
for the restoration. The club's Florida representative, Frank
Jackalone, said Jan. 23 that his group will oppose any plan that
doesn't promise any gain for the Everglades during its first
decade. The club also wants the corps to submit the plan to an
outside group of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups, including the World Wildlife Fund and the Florida
Audubon Society, say they think they can fix the plan without going
that far. For one thing, the corps and the state shouldn't
arbitratily limit the project to $400 million a year, Audubon
lobbyist Charles Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's creators, however, say it will take years to give the
Everglades what it needs most: a network of reservoirs and storage
wells to ease the havoc created by South Florida's federally
created drainage network. One big task is buying the land _ enough
to cover Manhattan eight times.

 &HT;    Trial may cost us House, some GOP members fear
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Fearing that they could lose control of
the House, some Republican members of Congress are becoming
increasingly exasperated with what they see as a futile effort to
continue the trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some are breaking ranks with their GOP colleagues, publicly
questioning why Monica Lewinsky is being forced to meet with House
prosecutors today when it is clear that the Senate will not convict
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, party pollsters, such as the Tarrance Group, are
telling members of Congress that when voters are asked if they
would vote Democrat or Republican, significant numbers are opposing
the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   If that trend is not turned around before next year's elections,
Democrats could win control of the House, where the GOP leads by
only 11 seats.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Republican poll of Florida voters found that two-thirds
of those asked oppose the Clinton trial and would consider voting
Democratic if the congressional elections were held now, according
to Tom Slade, former chairman of the state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about Florida incumbents from either party but
when you look around the country, it's pretty clear that we could
lose the House,'' Slade said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican political operatives are arriving at the same
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get off this and move on to other issues pretty
quickly, President Clinton is going to retire and we'll be in the
minority,'' said the strategist for one Florida congressman.
``There are some people who are losing sight of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of continuing the trial are wondering: What is the
point? They argue that it is impossible for Republicans to get the
67 votes needed to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confused, and I think a lot of people are,'' said U.S.
Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fort Lauderdale. ``Do the House managers know
something we don't know? I don't think so, and this thing isn't
going to change unless there is something dramatically new. There
are no senators that are on the fence. Everyone has made up their
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the House members who voted for impeachment expected the
Senate trial to be a swift one that would conclude with a censure
of Clinton, not his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The determination of the House managers to call witnesses and
aggressively prosecute the case, despite what appear to be
insurmountable odds for winning a conviction, has surprised some of
their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the Senate to wrap it up,'' said U.S. Rep. Mark Foley,
R-West Palm Beach. ``People are furious at Republicans. We have
some damage to repair.''
</P>
<P>
   One concern is that voters are becoming convinced Republicans
are too moralistic, too judgmental, too vengeful and too
unconcerned about issues such as saving Social Security and
improving public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could absolutely lose the House,'' warns Foley. ``People
are tired of it. Some Republicans have demonstrated a persistent
determination to be the divining rod of what is moral and what is
not. Now that's coming back to haunt us.''

   TEEN-DRIVE _ ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ Wanda Coates, the registrar at
the 1,225-student high school in this western N.C. mountain
community, has one tough duty ahead of her this week. She must sort
through the grades of all ninth- and 10th-graders, siphoning off
those who failed two or more courses, to send letters telling them
they've lost their driver's license. Last year, the N.C.
Legislature tied driving privileges to school performance. The
first grading period since then has just ended, with some 30,000
students expected to lose their license this month, according to
Artie Kamiya, who is overseeing the project for the N.C. Department
of Instruction. In all, 17 states tie school attendance to driving
privileges, but only a few add the extra provision of maintaining
good grades. In Georgia, the state can yank a license if students
are suspended from school for violence, drug or alcohol use on
school grounds or for having a weapon at school. It does not punish
dropouts or those with poor grades. (Riddle, Atlanta

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The first thing you notice about William Jefferson Clinton is
how tall he is. The second is the seductive power he has of making
you feel, from the first moment of meeting, that he is someone you
know well. The third is his sharp intelligence, which allows you to
speak to him about anything at all, even the prickliest topics,
provided you know when to bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, someone not enamored of him forewarned me: ``The
dangerous thing about these gifts is that Clinton uses them to make
you feel that nothing could interest him more than what you are
saying to him.''
</P>
<P>
   I met him first at a dinner given by William Styron in his
summer house in Martha's Vineyard in August of 1995. During his
first campaign, Clinton had mentioned that his favorite book was
``One Hundred Years of Solitude.'' I said at the time _ and I was
quoted in print _ that I thought he had said it simply to pull in
the Latin vote. He had not forgotten _ after greeting me in
Martha's Vineyard, he at once assured me that what he said had been
quite sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Fuentes and I have good reason for considering that
evening as a whole chapter in our memoirs. From the beginning, we
were disarmed by the interest, respect and humor with which he
listened to us, treating our words as if they were gold dust.
</P>
<P>
   His mood corresponded with his appearance. His hair was short,
like a scrubbing brush, his skin tanned _ he had the healthy and
almost insolent look of a sailor ashore, and he was wearing a
college sweatshirt with some logo on the chest. At 49, he looked
like an exuberant survivor of the generation of '68, who had smoked
marijuana, knew the Beatles by heart and had demonstrated against
the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner began at eight, with some 14 guests around the table, and
lasted until midnight. Bit by bit, the conversation came down to a
kind of literary round table involving the president and the three
writers. The first topic to come up was the forthcoming Summit of
the Americas. Clinton had wanted it held in Miami, where it did
take place. Carlos Fuentes considered that New Orleans or Los
Angeles had stronger historical claims, and he and I argued
strongly for them until it became clear that the president had no
intention of changing his plans because he was counting on
reelection support from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the votes, Mr. President,'' Carlos said to him. ``Lose
Florida and make history.''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase set the tone. When we spoke of the problems of
narco-traffic, the president heard me out generously. ``Thirty
million drug addicts in the U.S. go to show that the North American
mafia are more powerful than those in Colombia, and the authorities
much more corrupt.'' When I spoke to him about relations with Cuba,
he seemed even more receptive. ``If Fidel and you could sit and
talk face to face, all problems would completely disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   When we talked about Latin America in general, we realized that
he was much more interested than we had supposed, although he
lacked some essential background. When the conversation seemed to
stiffen a bit, we asked him what his favorite movie was, and he
answered ``High Noon,'' by Fred Zinneman, whom he had recently
honored in London. When we asked him what he was reading, he sighed
and mentioned a book on the economic wars of the future, author and
title unknown to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to read `Don Quixote,''' I said to him. ``Everything's
in there.'' Now, the `Quixote' is a book that is not read nearly as
much as is claimed, although very few will admit to not having read
it. With two or three quotes, Clinton showed that he knew it very
well indeed. Responding, he asked us what our favorite books were.
Styron said his was ``Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   I would have said ``Oedipus Rex,'' which has been my bedtable
book for the last 20 years, but I named ``The Count of Monte
Cristo,'' mainly for reasons of technique, which I had some trouble
explaining.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his was the ``Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,'' and
Carlos Fuentes stuck loyally to ``Absalom, Absalom,'' Faulkner's
stellar novel, no question, although others would choose ``Light in
August'' for purely personal reasons. Clinton, in homage to
Faulkner, got to his feet and, pacing round the table, recited from
memory Benji's monologue, the most thrilling passage, and perhaps
the most hermetic, from ``The Sound and the Fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner got us to talking about the affinities between
Caribbean writers and the cluster of great Southern novelists in
the United States. It made much more sense to us to think of the
Caribbean not as a geographical region surrounded by its sea but as
a much wider historical and cultural belt stretching from the north
of Brazil to the Mississippi basin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and so many others
would then be just as Caribbean as Jorge Amado and Derek Walcott.
Clinton, born and raised in Arkansas, a southern state, applauded
the notion and professed himself happy to be a Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight, and he had to break off the
conversation to take an urgent call from Gerry Adams, to whom at
that moment he gave the authority to campaign and raise funds in
the United States for peace in Northern Ireland. That should have
been the ending to an unforgettable evening, but Carlos Fuentes
took it further by asking the president who he thought of as his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   His reply was immediate and abrupt: ``My only enemy is
right-wing religious fundamentalism.'' That pronouncement ended the
evening. The other times I saw him, in public or in private, I had
the same impression as I had that first time. Bill Clinton was the
complete opposite of the idea Latin Americans have of presidents of
the United States.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, does it seem right that this exceptional human
being should be prevented from fulfilling his historical destiny
simply because he was unable to find a private place to make love?
That is just what happened. The most powerful man in the world was
kept from consummating his secret passions by the invisible
presence of a secret service that served as much to restrain as to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   There are no curtains on the Oval Office windows, no bolt on the
door of the president's private bathroom. The vase of flowers that
appears behind the president in photographs of him at his desk has
been claimed by the press to be a hiding-place for microphones to
consecrate the mysteries of presidential audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Even sadder, however, is the fact that the president only wanted
to do what the run of men have done in private with their women
from the beginning of the world, and a puritan stolidity not only
impeded him, but even denied him the right to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas invented the literature of fiction when he convinced his
wife that his homecoming was three days late because a whale had
swallowed him. Sheltering behind that ancient argument, Clinton
denied having any sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and denied
it with his head held high, like any self-respecting unfaithful
husband. In the end, his personal drama is a purely domestic
matter, between himself and Hillary, and she has stood by him in
the eyes of the world with Homeric dignity.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to lie in order to deceive; but it is quite
another to conceal truths in order to protect that mythical
dimension of human existence that is private life. Quite rightly,
no one is obliged to give evidence against himself. For having
persisted in his first denials, Clinton would have been prosecuted
in any case _ that's what it was about _ but it is much more
dignified to perjure oneself defending the privacy of the heart
than to be absolved at the expense of love.
</P>
<P>
   Disastrously, with the same insistence with which he had denied
blame, he later admitted it and went on admitting it over all the
media, written, visual and spoken, to the point of humiliation _ a
fatal error in an uncertain lover, whose secret life will go into
the history books not for having made love badly but for having
made it a lot less glorious than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrously, he submitted to oral sex while he talked on the
telephone with a senator. He supplanted himself with a frigid
cigar. He naturally used all kinds of tricks of avoidance, but the
more he tried the more his inquisitors came up with evidence
against him, for puritanism is insatiable and feeds on its own
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a vast and sinister conspiracy of fanatics aimed at
the personal destruction of a political adversary whose stature
they could not abide. The method was the criminal use of justice by
a fundamentalist prosecutor called Kenneth Starr, whose fierce and
salacious questioning seemed to excite these fanatics to the point
of orgasm.
 &UR; -0- &QL;

   The Bill Clinton we met some four months ago, at a gala dinner
in the White House for Andres Pastrana, president of Colombia,
seemed quite different _ no longer the open-minded academic of
Martha's Vineyard, but someone under sentence, thinner and
uncertain, who could not conceal with a professional smile an
organic weariness like the metal fatigue that destroys planes.
</P>
<P>
   Some days before, at a press dinner with Katherine Graham, the
golden woman of The Washington Post, someone had remarked that,
judging by the trials of Clinton, the United States still seemed to
be the country of Nathaniel Hawthorne. That night in the White
House, I realized just what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to the great American novelist of last
century, who denounced in his work the horrors of New England
fundamentalism, where the witches of Salem were burned alive. His
main novel, ``The Scarlet Letter,'' is the drama of Hester Prynne,
a young married woman who bore a child in secret by another man. A
Kenneth Starr of the day condemned her to wear a penitent's shirt
bearing the letter ``A'' of the puritan code, the color and smell
of blood.
</P>
<P>
   An agent of the order followed her everywhere beating a drum so
that pedestrians could keep out of her way. The ending must surely
keep prosecutor Starr awake, for the secret father of Hester's
child turned out to be a minister of the cult that made a martyr of
her.
</P>
<P>
   The method and the morality of the procedures were essentially
the same. When Clinton's enemies failed to find what they needed to
bring him down, they hounded him with mined interrogations until
they trapped him here and there in minor inconsistencies. Then they
forced him to accuse himself in public, and to apologize for things
he had not even done, live, using the technology of universal
information that is nothing more than a trimillennial version of
the drums that persecuted Hester Prynne.
</P>
<P>
   From the prosecutor's questions, cunning and concupiscent, even
small children became aware of the lies their parents told to keep
from them how they came into being. Suffering from metal fatigue,
Clinton committed the unpardonable folly of violently punishing an
invented enemy 5,397 nautical miles from the White House, to
distract attention from his personal plight.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and a
great writer of this agonizing century, summed it up in one
inspired phrase:
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated him like a black president.''

   The first thing you notice about William Jefferson Clinton is
how tall he is. The second is the seductive power he has of making
you feel, from the first moment of meeting, that he is someone you
know well. The third is his sharp intelligence, which allows you to
speak to him about anything at all, even the prickliest topics,
provided you know when to bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, someone not enamored of him forewarned me: ``The
dangerous thing about these gifts is that Clinton uses them to make
you feel that nothing could interest him more than what you are
saying to him.''
</P>
<P>
   I met him first at a dinner given by William Styron in his
summer house in Martha's Vineyard in August of 1995. During his
first campaign, Clinton had mentioned that his favorite book was
``One Hundred Years of Solitude.'' I said at the time _ and I was
quoted in print _ that I thought he had said it simply to pull in
the Latin vote. He had not forgotten _ after greeting me in
Martha's Vineyard, he at once assured me that what he said had been
quite sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Fuentes and I have good reason for considering that
evening as a whole chapter in our memoirs. From the beginning, we
were disarmed by the interest, respect and humor with which he
listened to us, treating our words as if they were gold dust.
</P>
<P>
   His mood corresponded with his appearance. His hair was short,
like a scrubbing brush, his skin tanned _ he had the healthy and
almost insolent look of a sailor ashore, and he was wearing a
college sweatshirt with some logo on the chest. At 49, he looked
like an exuberant survivor of the generation of '68, who had smoked
marijuana, knew the Beatles by heart and had demonstrated against
the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner began at eight, with some 14 guests around the table, and
lasted until midnight. Bit by bit, the conversation came down to a
kind of literary round table involving the president and the three
writers. The first topic to come up was the forthcoming Summit of
the Americas. Clinton had wanted it held in Miami, where it did
take place. Carlos Fuentes considered that New Orleans or Los
Angeles had stronger historical claims, and he and I argued
strongly for them until it became clear that the president had no
intention of changing his plans because he was counting on
reelection support from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the votes, Mr. President,'' Carlos said to him. ``Lose
Florida and make history.''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase set the tone. When we spoke of the problems of
narco-traffic, the president heard me out generously. ``Thirty
million drug addicts in the U.S. go to show that the North American
mafia are more powerful than those in Colombia, and the authorities
much more corrupt.'' When I spoke to him about relations with Cuba,
he seemed even more receptive. ``If Fidel and you could sit and
talk face to face, all problems would completely disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   When we talked about Latin America in general, we realized that
he was much more interested than we had supposed, although he
lacked some essential background. When the conversation seemed to
stiffen a bit, we asked him what his favorite movie was, and he
answered ``High Noon,'' by Fred Zinneman, whom he had recently
honored in London. When we asked him what he was reading, he sighed
and mentioned a book on the economic wars of the future, author and
title unknown to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to read `Don Quixote,''' I said to him. ``Everything's
in there.'' Now, the `Quixote' is a book that is not read nearly as
much as is claimed, although very few will admit to not having read
it. With two or three quotes, Clinton showed that he knew it very
well indeed. Responding, he asked us what our favorite books were.
Styron said his was ``Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   I would have said ``Oedipus Rex,'' which has been my bedtable
book for the last 20 years, but I named ``The Count of Monte
Cristo,'' mainly for reasons of technique, which I had some trouble
explaining.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his was the ``Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,'' and
Carlos Fuentes stuck loyally to ``Absalom, Absalom,'' Faulkner's
stellar novel, no question, although others would choose ``Light in
August'' for purely personal reasons. Clinton, in homage to
Faulkner, got to his feet and, pacing round the table, recited from
memory Benji's monologue, the most thrilling passage, and perhaps
the most hermetic, from ``The Sound and the Fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner got us to talking about the affinities between
Caribbean writers and the cluster of great Southern novelists in
the United States. It made much more sense to us to think of the
Caribbean not as a geographical region surrounded by its sea but as
a much wider historical and cultural belt stretching from the north
of Brazil to the Mississippi basin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and so many others
would then be just as Caribbean as Jorge Amado and Derek Walcott.
Clinton, born and raised in Arkansas, a southern state, applauded
the notion and professed himself happy to be a Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight, and he had to break off the
conversation to take an urgent call from Gerry Adams, to whom at
that moment he gave the authority to campaign and raise funds in
the United States for peace in Northern Ireland. That should have
been the ending to an unforgettable evening, but Carlos Fuentes
took it further by asking the president who he thought of as his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   His reply was immediate and abrupt: ``My only enemy is
right-wing religious fundamentalism.'' That pronouncement ended the
evening. The other times I saw him, in public or in private, I had
the same impression as I had that first time. Bill Clinton was the
complete opposite of the idea Latin Americans have of presidents of
the United States.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, does it seem right that this exceptional human
being should be prevented from fulfilling his historical destiny
simply because he was unable to find a private place to make love?
That is just what happened. The most powerful man in the world was
kept from consummating his secret passions by the invisible
presence of a secret service that served as much to restrain as to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   There are no curtains on the Oval Office windows, no bolt on the
door of the president's private bathroom. The vase of flowers that
appears behind the president in photographs of him at his desk has
been claimed by the press to be a hiding-place for microphones to
consecrate the mysteries of presidential audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Even sadder, however, is the fact that the president only wanted
to do what the run of men have done in private with their women
from the beginning of the world, and a puritan stolidity not only
impeded him, but even denied him the right to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas invented the literature of fiction when he convinced his
wife that his homecoming was three days late because a whale had
swallowed him. Sheltering behind that ancient argument, Clinton
denied having any sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and denied
it with his head held high, like any self-respecting unfaithful
husband. In the end, his personal drama is a purely domestic
matter, between himself and Hillary, and she has stood by him in
the eyes of the world with Homeric dignity.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to lie in order to deceive; but it is quite
another to conceal truths in order to protect that mythical
dimension of human existence that is private life. Quite rightly,
no one is obliged to give evidence against himself. For having
persisted in his first denials, Clinton would have been prosecuted
in any case _ that's what it was about _ but it is much more
dignified to perjure oneself defending the privacy of the heart
than to be absolved at the expense of love.
</P>
<P>
   Disastrously, with the same insistence with which he had denied
blame, he later admitted it and went on admitting it over all the
media, written, visual and spoken, to the point of humiliation _ a
fatal error in an uncertain lover, whose secret life will go into
the history books not for having made love badly but for having
made it a lot less glorious than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrously, he submitted to oral sex while he talked on the
telephone with a senator. He supplanted himself with a frigid
cigar. He naturally used all kinds of tricks of avoidance, but the
more he tried the more his inquisitors came up with evidence
against him, for puritanism is insatiable and feeds on its own
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a vast and sinister conspiracy of fanatics aimed at
the personal destruction of a political adversary whose stature
they could not abide. The method was the criminal use of justice by
a fundamentalist prosecutor called Kenneth Starr, whose fierce and
salacious questioning seemed to excite these fanatics to the point
of orgasm.

 &HT;    N.C. tries to steer teens toward good grades with driver's
license rule
 &HT;    By Lyn Riddle
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ Wanda Coates, the registrar at the
1,225-student high school in this western N.C., mountain community,
has one tough duty ahead of her this week that could make her the
scourge of many teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   She must sort through the grades of all ninth- and 10th-graders,
siphoning off those who failed two or more courses, to send letters
telling them they've lost their driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the North Carolina Legislature tied driving
privileges to school performance. Those between the ages of 15 and
18 must show that they are in school and have passing grades to
hold a driver's license or learner's permit.
</P>
<P>
   The first grading period since then has just ended, with some
30,000 students expected to lose their license this month,
according to Artie Kamiya, who is overseeing the project for the
state Department of Instruction. That translates into roughly one
of every eight students, Kamiya said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very punitive,'' said Kamiya, but it is the state's
way of trying to turn around a troubling trend. Some 16,000
students drop out of North Carolina schools each year for a variety
of reasons, including bad grades _ a number about average for most
Southern states. Hopefully, Kamiya said, the new law will keep
3,200 of them in school this year.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 17 states tie school attendance to driving privileges,
but only a few add the extra provision of maintaining good grades.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's law differs from the 17. The state can yank a license
if students are suspended from school for violence, drug or alcohol
use on school grounds or for having a weapon at school. It does not
punish dropouts or those with poor grades.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, students must prove they have good grades to
get a license in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The first state to enact such legislation was West Virginia, in
1988. Yet, there, the dropout rate barely changed from 17.4 percent
the first year to 17.3 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, the jury is still out on what kind of an impact
this is having,'' said Kathy Christie, who collects such
information for the Education Commission of the States, based in
Denver. ``People are looking for any tool to keep kids in school
and this captures of the attention of legislators because it
doesn't cost a lot or take a lot of time. It's a bit of leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators have found such laws have actually caused more
problems from students in states where attendance is the only
prerequisite to keeping a license. Some students were biding their
time in class just to keep their license, not doing any work and in
some cases, disrupting lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called them drop-ins,'' said Gary Nixon, a policy analyst
for the Tennessee school board. ``They came but didn't do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Tennessee changed its law to require good grades
as well as attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Some administrators consider the North Carolina law a problem to
implement. Parents must be notified and given the opportunity to
appeal the revocation if it would create an undue hardship on the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``If both parents are blind, that would be a hardship,'' said
Kamiya. ``If the student works to support the family, that would be
a hardship, but if the student works to support his car and
insurance, that is not a hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ike Thomas, principal of Northern High School in Durham, said he
doubts the law will have a huge effect on drop outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many kids already drive without a license,'' he said. ``We
have kids who show up for drivers' education and they drive up.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect will be on his staff, who possibly could be saddled
with deciding 100 appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a monumental administrative
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Coates, the registrar here in Asheville, agreed the
administrative element will be a true hassle, she believes the law
may prove worthwhile. She said already teen-agers who had dropped
out have re-enrolled so they can keep their driver's license.

RETURN OF A DISK-DRIVE JOCKEY 
MARKET CHAT
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If any companies in the personal-computer industry are prone to
painful cycles and oversupply problems, it is the makers of disk
drives, the unglamorous but critical components that store a
computer's data. And nobody knows this better than one of the
disk-drive pioneers, Finis Conner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite his travails, or perhaps because of them, Conner is
back, and with a new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Conner's new company, Conner Technology, based in San Jose,
Calif., plans to make drives for the budget end of the market,
selling $100 drives for PCs that would be priced around $600.
Mining this low-margin end of the market, Conner is trying some
profit shortcuts, including incorporating in Ireland to cut taxes
and subcontracting manufacturers in China to trim costs.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Conner is no stranger to risk in the drive business.
Twenty years ago, along with Al Shugart, Conner co-founded what
would become Seagate Technology, the disk-drive industry's biggest
survivor. In 1986, the partners had a bitter falling out, and
Conner struck out on his own, founding Conner Peripherals. Ten
years later, despite phenomenal growth, the company became buried
in debt, battered by increasingly heavy competition. Conner was
forced to sell out _ to Seagate.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1996, and shortly afterward Conner disappeared from the
scene, self-exiled by a noncompete agreement with Seagate that kept
him out of the drive market for two years. Within a few months
after the contract expired last year, Conner founded Conner
Technology. Shugart, incidentally, lost control of Seagate last
year and was forced by its board to sign a noncompete agreement
that will keep him on the disk-drive sidelines for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Conner said his goal is to sell 2 million drives the first year
and to make his new company grow at the same rate of Conner
Peripherals, which sold $113 million in 1986 and reached $2.7
billion 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
   But it is far from certain whether Conner's model for
outsourcing will work in the crowded drive business, which has had
its share of casualties the last few years. But Conner put a
positive spin on the skepticism that greeted word of his new
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any measure of success is how much your competitors don't
understand you, we're in good shape,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   An Online Chat to Invest In
</P>
<P>
   As if it wasn't enough to stare blankly into the computer screen
all day and watch the numbers in one's stock portfolio go
roller-coastering about, here now is perhaps another reason for eye
strain: 12 hours of live online chat with market experts daily.
</P>
<P>
   America Online and Sage, a financial site already carried on the
online service, plan to introduce this new offering Monday, in an
attempt to ``replicate television business programs,'' Stephen
Cohn, a Sage co-founder, said. He cited CNBC's ``Squawk Box'' and
``Power Lunch'' as two shows from which he'd like to woo viewers.
</P>
<P>
   As with the televised shows it seeks to emulate, the chat
service, called AOL's Market Watch, plans to offer a roster of
financial experts and pundits from the likes of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist,
John Hancock and Smart Money magazine, who will interact with users
as the day unfolds. The difference is you don't have to turn down
the volume when there's a particularly bombastic guest _ since the
``chatting'' will all be done through typed text.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect category for the online medium,'' Tom
Ziemba, a spokesman for America Online, said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the personal-finance part of its service, the company
already provides about 100 million stock quotes each day, and it
contends that more than 9 million users actively manage their
portfolios through America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide everything television can and more,'' Ziemba
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like commercials. Asked what Sage gets out of the deal besides
more work and potential users of the site, Cohn said, ``This is an
opportunity to sell marketing programs, like sponsorships and
advertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   Scudder Funds, T. Rowe Price, Kauffman Funds and E-Annuity have
already signed up as sponsors. &UR;

   FAT-ACTRESSES (New York) _ Camryn Manheim surprised herself a
bit at the awards ceremony last September when she raised her Emmy
in a kind of power-to-the-people salute and heard herself shout,
``This is for all the fat girls!'' But her exuberance on the Emmy
broadcast, as well as her growing popularity on ``The Practice,''
has brought her an unexpected opportunity to speak out about women
_ not just fat women _ and self-esteem. By Jane Fritsch.

   U.S.-MUSEUM-MOBS (Undated) _ If any people doubted that American
art museums were experiencing a record attendance boom, they no
longer should. The annual survey of visitors to art exhibitions in

   TV-BLACKARTISTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ What is a black artist's
highest responsibility: to the work of art or the progress of the

questions shape and add intellectual ballast to ``I'll Make Me a
World: A Century of African-American Arts''; the issue makes this

   PHONE-PRICE-WARS (Undated) _ When AT&AMP;T Corp. announced it would

ONLINE CRITIC GETS CRITIQUED 
FINAL SEASON FOR `MELROSE PLACE' 
THE JOURNAL CELEBRATES ITSELF
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Shuger spends the small hours each morning reading
newspapers online and writing a daily column for Microsoft's online
magazine, Slate, critiquing newspapers across the country. The
column, Today's Papers, appears unedited.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Shuger was the target of some pretty fiery critiques
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The reason was his comments in last Monday's column about
African-American college students. He was critiquing an article in
The New York Times about a survey that showed a wide disparity in
computer use between students entering elite private colleges and
those attending traditionally black public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Shuger suggested that ``it might be good to add a question to
the survey: ```Do you have a luxury sound system or a car less than
two years old, or a luxury sound system in that car?' Today's
Papers recalls being in Atlanta a few years ago at the annual
spring break for traditionally black colleges, Freaknik, and being
amazed at the numbers of students' hot cars and loud stereos. Any
computer/Internet paucity among students attending traditionally
black colleges may be a function of their own interests and choices
rather than that of affordability.'''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail responses to the magazine were overwhelmingly negative,
calling Shuger's remarks ``racist'' and ``idiotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuger, in his posted response to readers, defended his column.
It reads, in part: ``I merely suggested that it would make sense to
add some questions about this to the survey. If it turns out that
there's nothing to this, then so be it. What are readers so afraid
of finding out?''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Shuger again defended his tone: ``Before we
have some big program to supply computers to college students, I
think it would be wise to find out how the money that is available
to students is being spent.'' He added: ``Anytime you write
anything about race, you're going to get a lot of emotional
reaction if you get beyond the most cliched language.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, Shuger acknowledged that his late deadline
might have muddied his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have said it better,'' he said. ``And that's
the problem with items you write at 3 a.m. in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kinsley, the editor of Slate, defended his writer. ``I
think an unfortunate passage once or twice a year is a price worth
paying for a regular feature like that,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   ``Melrose Place,'' the nighttime soap opera that became one of
television's leading symbols of pop culture in the mid-1990s, will
broadcast its final episode this spring, the Fox network will
announce Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives confirmed that the show will shut down production
at the completion of episodes this season. Speaking on condition of
anonymity, two Fox executives said Aaron Spelling, whose production
company owns the show, was to tell cast members of the decision
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made now, the executives said, so that the
show's writers could prepare concluding storylines for the show's
host of characters. They did not offer any specifics on how the
series will end.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Fox network, a unit of News Corp., thanked
the show's cast and Spelling for the seven years of broadcast and
promised that Melville would go off ``with the fanfare it
deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Seinfeld,'' which left NBC last season as the
highest-rated show on television, ``Melrose Place'' has seen its
ratings slide in recent seasons. Fox program executives had
contemplated the possibility of canceling the series last spring,
but reconsidered and tried a different strategy, beginning new
episodes of the show in midsummer in an effort to regenerate
interest.
</P>
<P>
   This season the show has continued to decline, finishing no
better than third on most Monday nights in overall ratings. But the
show was still extremely strong with the young female viewers who
had first made it a hit. ``Melrose Place'' still usually has the
best ratings of the night among young adult women.
</P>
<P>
   In one twist, ``Melrose Place'' has been most hurt in the last
two years by the growing strength of another of Spelling's shows,
``Seventh Heaven'' on WB. ``Seventh Heaven'' is broadcast at the
same time, Mondays from 8 to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the growing strength of WB, the Time Warner network, has
been built on a formula that Fox used to best advantage in
``Melrose Place'': aiming shows at teen-agers and young women. Fox
first did that successfully with ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' and after
that show became a hit used it to spin off ``Melrose Place.''

</P>
<P>
   Gloating
</P>
<P>
   It is usually Variety magazine, the hometown publication of
Hollywood, where a reader can find the headline ``For Your
Consideration'' above film-studio advertisements touting a
particular movie or actor. The audience for the ads tends to be
people who nominate and select the winners of the academy awards.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``For Your Consideration'' form was transported to a
different stage last Thursday, as The Wall Street Journal ran a
full-page ad in The Washington Post, the hometown publication of
national politics. At first blush, the message seemed to be: We
Told You So.
</P>
<P>
   Under the headline ``Who Is Bill Clinton?'' the advertisement _
essentially a reprint of Thursday's editorial page in The Journal _
excerpted seven years' worth of editorials about the president.
</P>
<P>
   Two passages are favorites on Liberty Street, where the
Manhattan-based newspaper is published. One, which first ran on
Jan. 18, 1994, reads, ``A special prosecutor will have
irreconcilable mandates; if he sticks too strictly to the law the
public will remain unsatisfied and skeptical; but if he exposes
everything of legitimate public concern, he will look abusive by
normal prosecutorial standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The second, entitled ``Character Questions,'' first ran Oct. 4,
1996. It reads, ``These questions, and many related ones, will not
go away even if Mr. Clinton is re-elected. Better they should be
addressed during the campaign than after. While direct light may be
elusive, in watching the debate we should be asking ourselves
whether faulty character will once again give us a second term
paralyzed by constitutional crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's advertisement also bore a passing resemblance to
the proud ads newspapers run after winning a Pulitzer Prize.
Perhaps the message really was: ``You aren't going to celebrate our
foresight, so we'll do it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood at The Journal and its parent, Dow Jones &AMP; Co., was not
all celebratory last week. The company's annual earnings report
Tuesday included a note that the homegrown Global News Management
word-processing system, loathed by many editors, was being largely
scrapped after eight years of tinkering, and Dow Jones was taking a
charge of about $17 million for a system that cost four times that.
</P>
<P>
   In another bit of cost-cutting, the company informed employees
that its annual practice of contributing 15 percent of an
employee's salary to that employee's pension fund will soon be a
thing of past, thanks to years of sub-15-percent profits.
</P>

   The plan dated back to 1949, and the 15 percent figure was
originally set as the maximum amount of profit to be shared per
employee. But, according to a note that Peter Kann, Dow Jones'
chief executive, sent to employees Thursday, the company has paid
out that maximum since 1980, first using actual profits, then, from
1989 to 1996, drawing down surpluses collected in the fat years of
the 1980s. But, Kann's memo said, the surpluses are all gone.

<P>
   There have been two appointments to top-level executive
positions at D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications, a unit
of MacManus Group. Patrick Sherwood, managing director at DMB&AMP;B
Detroit in Troy, Mich., was named to the additional new position of
executive vice president and worldwide account director for the
General Motors Corp. account at DMB&AMP;B Communications; the account
includes the Cadillac and Pontiac brands.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of Sherwood, 47, who will also join the DMB&AMP;B
worldwide board, came after Advertising Age reported that the
agency ``struck a deal'' to keep him after he had been wooed by
TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of Omnicom Group, to work there on the Nissan
Motor Corp. account. John Farrell, president of DMB&AMP;B North America
in New York, said on Friday that the promotion was ``not in any way
a response to that,'' adding, ``Patrick has done an outstanding job
leading our Detroit office.''
</P>
<P>
   And at DMB&AMP;B Los Angeles, Terry Balagia was named executive
creative director, succeeding John Armistead, who left, the agency
said. Balagia, 43, had been executive vice president and executive
creative director at the Toronto office of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, a
unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.

   Chicago Executive Leaving Bozell
</P>
<P>
   David Wojdyla, managing partner and executive creative director
at the Chicago office of Bozell Worldwide since May 1995, is
leaving, effective on Feb. 16, to open his own agency in Chicago,
with the name of &AMP; Wojdyla.
</P>
<P>
   Wojdyla, 43, who has also worked at agencies like Young &AMP;
Rubicam Advertising in New York, said his new shop would specialize
in ``brand makeovers.'' Adrienne Scordato, a spokeswoman for
Bozell, a unit of True North Communications, said a successor to
Wojdyla was being sought.

 &HT;    Bill to set regional milk prices on fast track in Georgia
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bills to create a system of regional milk price
supports appears to be on the fast track this session, only months
after former Gov. Zell Miller vetoed a similar plan.
</P>
<P>
   One bill to let Georgia join a Southern dairy compact with nine
other Southeastern states sailed through the Senate Agriculture
Committee 8-1 last week, while a similar bill is scheduled to go
before the House Agriculture Committee today.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do nothing would be a terrible mistake,'' said state
Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin. ``It's essential that we
establish a level playing field for our dairy farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranks of Georgia dairy farmers have been thinning for years
while the volume of imported milk has risen sharply. Prices farmers
earn for their milk can fluctuate sharply, depending on local
supplies that are dramatically affect by weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   John Bagwell, a Floyd County dairy farmer, said the farm price
of milk has climbed slowly. In fact, it's doubled only since 1947,
when a brand new pickup truck cost him $972.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge any industry to put up a record like that,''
Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia joins the regional compact, and it wins congressional
approval, a newly-appointed commission would set a floor price paid
to dairy farmers for their milk. It would not affect retail milk
prices, at least not directly.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller felt the compact would tend to drive up retail milk
prices. His legal advisors also said the bill appeared to violate
the due process provision in the Georgia Constitution, based on
Georgia Supreme Court price-fixing decisions in 1951 and 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harold Ragan (D-Cairo), chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee and a supporter of the dairy compact, hopes Barnes will
see the issue differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Barnes) would not give us an up or down as to whether he'd
veto it,'' Ragan said, ``but he encouraged us to move forward with
the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes voted for the diary compact bill last year when he was a
member of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill has legs, it's moving really fast,'' said Kay Young,
who represents low-income families with Georgia Access for Justice
Project. ``But the only way to help dairy farmers is to pay them
more money, and it's inevitable that cost will be passed on to the
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the dairy compact passed both the House and Senate
with relative ease despite heavy opposition lobbying from the Milk
Processors Foundation. That group wasn't on hand to protest before
the Senate Agriculture Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of nine Southeastern states have already signed
laws clearing the way for formation of a regional dairy compact.

 &HT;    Parade to honor Falcons _ rain or shine, win or lose
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're going to the Falcons parade today, pack an
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service in Peachtree City is predicting a
50 percent to 60 percent chance of rain, with high temperatures in
the mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
   The parade is scheduled to start at 2 p.m. at the Varsity
restaurant and will run down Peachtree Street to Woodruff Park,
where players and coaches will be introduced. Singer Peabo Bryson
will perform at the park, according to Mayor Bill Campbell's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Neither police nor the company producing the parade, Argonne
Parades of Atlanta, would predict how many people will show up, but
Atlanta police are bringing in extra officers to be on the safe
side.
</P>
<P>
   When the Braves won the World Series in 1995, an estimated
500,000 people showed up for the parade, many of them
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for Atlanta, Fulton and DeKalb county schools said
they're trying to make Monday a regular school day. Students can't
leave school to watch the parade unless they're checked out by
parents who show up in person. That means no notes.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta and Fulton school spokeswomen said leaving school for
the parade, even with a parent's permission, will be considered an
unexcused absence. To receive a day's attendance credit in DeKalb
County, students must participate in a minimum of three hours of
classes and may not be checked out before 11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown employees also will be tempted to leave their desks and
cheer the Falcons. But the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce said it
doesn't know of any firm that will excuse its employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons hired Argonne to organize the parade. Argonne has
put on several Atlanta parades, such as the Salute to America
parade, as well as the Indianapolis 500 and the San Francisco
Chinese New Year's parades, said Barkley Russell of Argonne. The
company is not receiving payment from the city, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the Falcons players and staff will ride fire trucks
so all the fans can see them. About 15 fire trucks from various
outlying metro departments will carry the players, so no area will
be without fire protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Players will come straight from Hartsfield International Airport
to the parade launching point at North Avenue and Spring Street,
near the Varsity restaurant. The Falcons cheerleaders and several
high school marching bands will perform.
</P>
<P>
   The parade is free. Police urge fans to take MARTA. The parade
route and two expressway ramps (North Avenue southbound and Pine
Street northbound) will be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Jabari Simama, Campbell's director of communications, said 200
to 300 city employees will serve as parade marshals. Some employees
will be allowed to take compensatory leave or use vacation time. No
employees who perform what the city considers essential duties will
be allowed to leave work to watch the parade, Simama said.

NOT MODEL-THIN, BUT A ROLE MODEL ANYWAY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif. )  By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Camryn Manheim tries to explain her struggle
with self-loathing, she tells a story about her last semester at
New York University's acting school, more than a decade ago. Tony
Kushner, the playwright, was directing the final production, and he
picked Ms. Manheim for the role of the ingenue. ``I burst into
tears and begged him not to make me play the part,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you want the female lead?'' he asked. ``Well, I'm sorry.
I've made my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she had lost 70 pounds by taking amphetamines, Ms.
Manheim was still overweight and afraid she would look ridiculous.
``It was traumatic for me,'' she said. ``I had never kissed a boy
onstage before.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than a decade later and substantially heavier, Ms.
Manheim, 37, is eager for an on-camera romance. Colleagues and
critics seem to have accepted her as she is: she won an Emmy last
fall and a Golden Globe award last week as best supporting actress
for her performance as Ellenor Frutt ``The Practice,'' on ABC.
David E. Kelley, the creator of the quirky legal drama, says a
relationship is in the works for her character.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Manheim, the transformation from quivering acting
student to self-confident role model has been a painful one. Having
been down for so long she is now, her friends say, in a period of
unapologetic elation.
</P>
<P>
   Luminous on a gray day recently, she beamed at a couple of fans
who called out to her as she walked along 42d Street in Manhattan.
``Hey, thanks! Thanks!'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   She had surprised herself a bit at the awards ceremony last
September when she raised her Emmy and heard herself shout, ``This
is for all the fat girls!''
</P>
<P>
   She had planned to thank the usual suspects, then toss in some
encouragement for other women who don't fit the Hollywood mold. But
Her exuberance on the Emmy broadcast, as well as her growing
popularity on ``The Practice,'' has brought her an unexpected
opportunity to speak out about women, not just fat women, and
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My platform is not fat acceptance, it's self-acceptance,'' she
said over a long lunch in Manhattan during a break from shooting in
Los Angeles. She has been invited on just about every talk show and
accepts most invitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My weight is being celebrated,'' she said with a hint of
wonder. It is her moment, but it may be just a moment, and at 37
she has lived long enough to understand that. ``I'll talk about it
to anyone who will listen,'' she said. ``But at some point I'm
going to bore people, and then we'll talk about other things.''
</P>
<P>
   She has given up on the kind of punishing diets that could have
made her desire for an acting career more realistic _ and less
tormenting. Why she stuck with acting in the face of every sort of
discouragement and occasional self-loathing she cannot easily
explain. ``It's not reasonable; it's not rational,'' she said. ``If
there were anything that would satisfy my passion for acting, I
would have done it long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   She plays a lawyer, and not necessarily a fat lawyer. With just
a little adjusting of the script, the part could be played by a
thin actress. It's a major departure from the one-note roles _ the
best friend, the battle-ax, the docile grandmother _ that are the
domain of overweight actresses.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is about the only overweight female character in prime-time
drama. Two heavy women have appeared as regulars on ``N.Y.P.D.
Blue'' in recent seasons: both played secretaries, one a battle-ax
type, the other pathetic and sex starved. It is by no means clear
that Ms. Manheim's casting and subsequent success will have any
effect on the casting on other shows.
</P>
<P>
   If Kelley, who also created the offbeat series ``Picket Fences''
and ``Ally McBeal,'' was taking a chance with Ms. Manheim, the
choice did not seem to give him much pause. ``I wanted the
character to be unconventional,'' Kelley said. When Ms. Manheim
showed up for an interview, he recalled, he knew little about her,
but was immediately impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There she sat with about a hundred and four earrings in her
ear and this great presence that filled the room,'' he said. ``I've
since heard that she thought the meeting was a disaster. I must be
a horrible bore.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he objects to using classically beautiful and
improbably thin actresses, like Lara Flynn Boyle, whose
three-square-meals-a-year look ratchets up the dyspeptic aura of
the prosecutor she plays on ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She eats like a pig,'' said Ms. Manheim, apparently without
bitterness. The two have become good friends, having first met when
they worked on a 1994 feature film, ``The Road to Wellville.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lara is my barometer of Hollywood,'' said Ms. Manheim, whose
home is in New York. Over the Christmas holidays Ms. Boyle (``I do
eat like a fat pig; it's the luck of the draw,'' she said) stayed
with Ms. Manheim in her Manhattan apartment, where they ate a lot
of food together and watched a lot of television.
</P>
<P>
   As physical types, at least, they could hardly be more
different, but Ms. Boyle said Ms. Manheim is her role model. ``She
truly has done wonders for me,'' Ms. Boyle said. ``The way she
walks into a room. She's fearless. She's comfortable in her skin. I
call it her diva walk. I idolize her.''
</P>
<P>
   When the two walked around on the streets of Manhattan, Ms.
Manheim, wearing a firefighter's jacket with reflecting tape, was
constantly noticed and recognized, Ms. Boyle said. ``It was like
walking around with President Clinton. She would turn and say, `My
friend Lara's in the show, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Far from begrudging her friend the attention, Ms. Boyle said,
she enjoys watching her savor the moment. ``She's not trying to act
cool or blase,'' she said. ``This is her time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manheim's long struggle for acceptance as an actress began
in earnest when she entered the New York University acting program
after graduating from the University of California at Santa Cruz.
Her talent, developed in small theaters in California, got her into
the highly competitive program, but her size was always an issue.
She responded with hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an attitude problem,'' she said. ``My parents were
activist rebels. I was trouble at N.Y.U.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be told things like `Your body is your instrument, and
you show a lack of interest in your art.''' Or the stinging ``We'd
like to see a lot less of you in the fall,'' she recalled. ``I had
so much self-loathing that it seemed reasonable to me at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after more than a decade of slights and rejections, she
sees some wisdom in the school's nudging.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me to lose weight, and rightly so,'' she said.
``The industry isn't lining up to embrace fat girls. I give it to
them for not kicking me out. I left a trained actor despite my best
efforts not to take anything with me.''
</P>
<P>
   With acting jobs scarce, Ms. Manheim learned sign language and
spent seven years working in the New York courts as an interpreter
for the deaf. She spent a lot of time taking amphetamines and
ruminating about her weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three ways you can go,'' she said. ``You can either
destroy your spirit and hate yourself; and I tried to destroy my
spirit by drugs. That led to major depression. Or you can change
yourself so you like yourself. That's the Oprah thing. Or you can
live your life loving yourself as you are.''
nn
</P>
<P>
   She attributes her enduring belief in herself at least in part
to the fact that she was a thin child; she began to gain weight in
her early teens. The years after she graduated from NYU in 1987
were not without some professional achievements. She performed a
small part written for her by Kushner in his 1987 off Off Broadway
play, ``Hydriotaphia.''
</P>
<P>
   She had a meatier role several years ago in an episode of ``Law
and Order.'' She also appeared in feature films including ``Romy
and Michele's
</P>
<P>
   Her one-woman off-off-Broadway show in 1994, ``Wake Up, I'm
Fat,'' was an autobiographical piece that brought her some
attention, but, in retrospect, she views it as flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an artificially induced cathartic experience,'' she
said. ``I was smart enough to know what people wanted to hear, but
I wasn't feeling it.'' It was also an attempt to find a boyfriend,
which she did by passing out questionnaires to the audience asking
whether anyone was interested. Some were, but this did not lead to
anything lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manheim is ever on the lookout for inaccuracies about fat
people, like a scene in which she was supposed to be eating a
doughnut while walking down the street with the actor Dylan
McDermott. It would never happen, she said. The scene was changed;
McDermott ate the doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said he had a long talk with her about a plot involving
an overweight woman who had filed a discrimination lawsuit. He used
much of what Ms. Manheim told him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's married to Michelle Pfeiffer,'' Ms. Manheim said. ``He's
bound to get a couple of things wrong.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: PATENT ABSURDITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the industrial age gets creakier, the information age is
lubricating a new economy with the flow of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas are given their literal currency through patent and
copyright laws, originally intended to stimulate innovation by
protecting inventors from idea snatchers and allowing them to
profit more easily from their talents. But some experts worry that
an increasing number of individuals and companies are perverting
that original purpose with increasingly specious claims to
ownership, as well as by stockpiling patents into competitive
arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Several examples of patent absurdity have been in the news
lately. Relatively new on the scene are ``method of doing
business'' patents, otherwise known as ``soft'' patents because
they do not actually cover a physical invention. Such patents,
which also included software, were rejected by the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office as a matter of course until very recently, when
courts began overturning its refusals.
</P>
<P>
   Soft patents are frowned on by many people involved with
intellectual property because they often lay claim to some of the
most mundane activities of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for example, Internet Patent News Service,
an online newsletter, bestowed its ``Worst Method of Doing Business
Patent in 1998'' award upon Patent No. 5,851,117, granted to a
company for its blindingly original idea of using an illustrated
book to teach janitors how to clean a building.
</P>
<P>
   A patent for using a book as a teaching tool? ``This claim
should never have been written, let alone allowed,'' Gregory
Aharonian, editor of Internet Patent News Service, wrote in a
recent issue of his newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   A similar patent claim is being made against MP3.com
(www.mp3.com), the Internet music seller. MP3 has the music
industry in a panic because its Web site allows visitors to
download audio files of thousands of copyrighted songs free; it
also enables musicians to sell their CDs directly to customers,
thus bypassing record labels and pocketing much more profit.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger, Sightsound.com, claimed in a letter to Michael
Robertson, president of MP3.com, that it holds patents that control
``among other things, the sale of audio or video recordings in
download fashion over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter then asked Robertson to pay its licensing fee: 1
percent of all revenue that MP3 derives from the sale of downloaded
audio files.
</P>
<P>
   Nice work if you can get it. Robertson, however, who received
the letter last week and has posted it on MP3's Web site, notes
that MP3 does not sell the music it downloads, but gives it away.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point: a patent for downloading files over the
Internet for a fee? Given the fundamental capabilities of networked
computers, this sounds remarkably like patenting the combination of
a pencil, a piece of paper and a stamp as a method for writing a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to wonder if the Patent Office has completely lost
its mind,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Such sweeping ``method of doing business'' patents are only part
of the problem. In a recent issue of the venerable high-technology
trade journal, Electronic Engineering Times, one of its executive
editors, Ron Wilson, wrote in an editorial that ``U.S. intellectual
property law is rapidly reducing itself to absurdity,'' adding that
the patent process ``has turned into a bludgeon to crush
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson cites several examples of how various technology
companies, including IBM, Intel and Hewlett-Packard, use their vast
holdings of patents as competitive weaponry in seeking to disable
each other with infringement charges.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just last week a new arms dealer opened its online
doors: a company based in Pasadena, Calif., called the Patent and
License Exchange (www.pl-x.com), promotes its site as offering an
``easy-to-search patent inventory, online bid placement, secure
chat room negotiation, closing services (escrow) and aftermarket
license administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's relaxed rules for granting patents, and the greater ease
with which arsenals can thus be amassed, gives a decided battle
advantage to industry heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big guys couldn't care less about the quality of their
patents,'' Aharonian said. ``They just want as many as possible
because they trade them like baseball cards. When you have a
thousand patents and your competition has 1,500, you don't care
what they are, you just swap them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's far easier than hauling one another into court, he said.
But small companies, even if they are defending good, solidly
researched patents, are seldom taken seriously by big companies,
Aharonian said. He added: ``If you're a small company, have you got
a million bucks to sue Microsoft over patent infringement? I don't
know if these companies realize ahead of time what the game is. A
patent is just the first step to spending a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this money would be spent without expert
counsel. Wilson recalls attending a conference a year or so ago
given by a patent lawyer who was giving instructions on how to
build competitive patent bludgeons. ``He was describing the
strategy they recommended to their clients,'' Wilson said, ``which
was basically a pyramid of patent protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Aharonian sees the wielding of patent portfolios as a form of
class warfare, where the lines are drawn between big companies and
small, with consolidation and mergers creating a constant tension
between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is always good, and change usually comes from new
people; and if those new start-ups can't get protection, you'll see
less change, less innovation, less entrepreneurialism,'' Aharonian
said. ``That's why big companies don't want the system to change _
they'd get a lot less patents.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's business environment, in which a company's market
value is measured with increasing frequency by the intellectual
property it owns, arsenals of patents _ specious or not _ make an
unfortunate kind of sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're concerned about the planking,'' Wilson said, ``you
don't want someone rocking the boat.''

`I'LL MAKE ME A WORLD:' BLACK ARTISTS GRAPPLING WITH ART AND RACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1937 Zora Neale Hurston's novel ``Their Eyes Were Watching
God'' was published, and Richard Wright panned it. He accused her
of using a ``minstrel technique'' in her writing, rooted in the
folklore and language of the Southern blacks she knew so well.
Wright, whose socially outraged novel ``Uncle Tom's Children'' came
out the same year, thought art should be political and help move
the race ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 James Baldwin moved to Paris, was befriended by Wright,
and soon attacked him in print. The novel of social protest,
Baldwin argued, was too limiting to an artist.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s Raven Wilkinson, a light-skinned black American
with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, toured the American South,
quietly violating segregation laws by dancing onstage and staying
in hotels with her white colleagues. Looking back, she says some
black people would have called that ``passing,'' but ``I felt I was
going as a human being, as an artist.'' When one hotel asked if she
was black, she recalls, she said yes and was sent away.
</P>
<P>
   What is a black artist's highest responsibility: to the work of
art or the progress of the race? Can the two be reconciled? Those
profound, still volatile questions shape and add intellectual
ballast to ``I'll Make Me a World: A Century of African-American
Arts''; the issue makes this provocative, uneven six-hour PBS
series more than a celebratory roundup of great and obscure black
artists.
</P>
<P>
   The subject has even spilled outside the series. Two weeks ago,
in an event to publicize ``I'll Make Me a World,'' Spike Lee said
``The PJ's,'' Eddie Murphy's new animated Fox series set in a
housing project, was ``hateful toward black people.''
</P>
<P>
   Such different approaches have contributed to the vast range of
art by black Americans. As Lee says so irrefutably in the
introduction to this series, without black contributions to
American culture ``America would be one bland place, bland as
Wonder bread.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface the series merely embraces the wealth of that
creation. Moving chronologically through the 20th century, its
often absorbing and occasionally flat six hours are spread over
three nights, each with a different director. The greatest
disappointment is that a program dedicated to creativity displays
so little of its own. Only the second night's installment succeeds
on esthetic terms.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's two hours are the least satisfying, despite a
wealth of unfamiliar material from the first three decades of the
century. Crammed full of talking heads, the opening episode comes
with the stale whiff of mockable ``educational television.''
</P>
<P>
   The content, though, redeems it. Among the most poignant figures
is Bert Williams, a light-skinned black who became successful only
when he put on blackface and teamed up with a dark-skinned partner,
George Walker. Billed on their posters as ``two real coons,'' the
minstrel-inspired Williams and Walker were a smash vaudeville team.
Williams was criticized by some for perpetuating the minstrel
stereotype; others saw his career as a means of paving the way for
the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle in this first installment is the scarcity of film
and recordings from the period. A scratchy snippet heard from the
blues singer Mamie Smith demonstrates the problem. Yet there must
have been livelier ways to compensate. When voice-overs describe
the 1924 dinner given by W.E.B. Du Bois that helped set off the
Harlem Renaissance, for long minutes the camera pans a table set
with china and silver. Perhaps this was meant to be ghostly; in
fact, it means looking at dishes.
</P>
<P>
   There is not a moment's dullness in Tuesday's installment
(written, produced and directed by Tracy Heather Strain), which
leaps off the screen. There is film of Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie
Parker playing. There is the deservedly towering figure of Paul
Robeson, his voice and image preserved in clips: being interviewed
about ``Othello,'' singing ``Ol' Man River,'' giving the speeches
about social equality that caused him to have his passport revoked
during the McCarthy era. As the evening soars toward the present,
it comes to include a glimpse, preserved on film, of Al Freeman Jr.
onstage in Baldwin's ``Blues for Charlie.''
</P>
<P>
   But the episode may be strongest in the visual arts. Augusta
Savage created ``The Harp,'' a sculpture commissioned for the 1939
World's Fair, but she was more important as the founder of an art
school in Harlem. There are photos and film of her students at
work, and interviews with some who remember her. Jacob Lawrence,
whose eloquent ``Migration Series'' about the black movement north
was shown at the Museum of Modern Art in 1995, recalls how Savage
took him by the hand when he was 20 to sign him up as a WPA.
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The third night is livelier than the first, though it is also
the most familiar, with segments on hip-hop and rap. The stirring
bits of film include interviews with Gwendolyn Brooks as a young
woman and an older one, charting her movement from writing rhyming
poems to rougher-edged social protest. There are illuminating
interviews with contemporary artists, including the choreographer
Bill T. Jones and the visual artist Kara Walker, whose silhouette
figures have been criticized as stereotypical.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the series, the most articulate commentators include
Amiri Baraka, John Edgar Wideman and Cornel West. Yet the producers
avoid some thorny issues. There is the briefest glimpse of Michael
Jackson's video ``Billie Jean,'' which catches him partway through
his startling physical transformation; his career and cosmetic
changes are otherwise ignored. Maybe the series' silence about his
whiter-looking incarnation speaks louder than paying attention to
him would have.
</P>
<P>
   The series ends with a dynamic performance by the young
spoken-word artist Saul Williams, which demonstrates the vibrant
heritage of black American art. Reflecting the issue it so astutely
chronicles, this series is itself an uplifting voice rather than a
work of art. Yet it is a rich, expansive voice, which more than
repays the hours it demands.

OFFICE RETAILERS BATTLE FOR DOMINANCE IN GROWING MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y., Mich., Ohio, Mass.)  (jw) 
 B y PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The office products business _ once the province of mom-and-pop
stationery stores _ is witnessing a high-profile consumer marketing
war as the nation's three giant superstore companies battle for
more of what has become a growing $225 billion industry.
</P>
<P>
   The market leaders _ Office Depot Inc., Staples Inc. and
Officemax _ have established multibillion-dollar businesses in the
last decade with the superstore concept. But combined, they hold
just 15 percent of the market share, and face an expanding list of
competitors ranging from giant warehouse clubs to computer stores,
all offering similar products.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, the leader, Office Depot, is making a big
advertising push with a new creative approach that uses humor to
promote the idea that it offers helpful business solutions and low
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign _ the first from DeVito/Verdi in New York _
will compete with the funny, award-winning advertising by Staples,
its chief rival and former merger partner. A merger agreement
between Staples and Office Depot was killed in July 1997 when the
Federal Trade Commission rejected it on antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are shopping for office products in an extraordinary
broad range of retailers,'' said Tom Cross, Office Depot's senior
vice president for marketing and advertising, in Delray Beach, Fla.
``It's a huge market out there with lots of room for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot began introducing its estimated $40-million-plus
advertising campaign over the weekend with four network and spot
television commercials. Each ends with the tag line ``Low prices
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising is aiming at the ``SOHO market,'' Cross said _ a
common acronym in the office business, not for the trendy Manhattan
neighborhood south of Houston Street, but for the small office/home
office market.
</P>
<P>
   That market, important for all office product retailers, is
growing about 5 percent annually with the increase in small
businesses, telecommuting and independent home offices. The
Michigan Small Business Development Center estimates that a
home-based business starts every 11 seconds in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Business Products Industry Association, about
80 percent of the superstores' sales is in the small office and
home office market.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are direct, with an almost newsy quality, like
one opening with an attractive 60-ish couple sailing in what
appears to be a retirement spot. Then an announcer explains that
the couple is free of financial worry ``all because you left your
credit receipt in the wastebasket and they stole it.''
</P>
<P>
   The point: ``Prevent credit card theft with a paper shredder,''
which then appears on screen.
</P>
<P>
   In another commercial, a worker shows a frustrated colleague how
to make his computer go faster by tossing it out the window. The
spot ends by promising that Office Depot has ``the latest computers
at the fastest speed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a third commercial, shocked employees are standing outside a
supply room, listening to an attractive chief financial officer
inside the room with her clerk ``oohing'` and ``aahing'' _ about
great prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If saving money is what gets you excited, go to Office
Depot,'' the spot urges.
</P>
<P>
   Though the commercial is suggestive, said Ellis Verdi, president
at DeVito/Verdi, he does not consider it risque because ``we're all
in on the joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot has always used humor in its advertising; a
campaign from its previous agency, Wyse Advertising in Cleveland,
featured the cartoon character Dilbert. This time, Cross said, the
humor is used strategically and informs viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of advertising doesn't provide new information,'' he
added, ``and we feel strongly that our advertising should.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Office Depot campaign has its work cut out in trying to
capture attention in the category. The advertising for Staples by
Cliff Freeman &AMP; Partners in New York, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
PLC, is largely credited with bringing creativity to the industry's
pitches with a clever campaign, introduced in 1995, carrying the
theme ``Yeah, we've got that.'' Those ads have won virtually all
the top advertising awards and continue to run today.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Staples plans to introduce another commercial in the
campaign next on Feb. 8, said Dwight Garland, vice president for
advertising in Westborough, Mass. The spot is also aimed at the
small office and home office market, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The new Staples spot presents a refugee from corporate life who
drives up a mountain, triumphantly shedding his tie, briefcase and
other shackles of the business world. On the other side of the
mountain, meanwhile, the liberated man's shoe hits a hiker, who
says, ``Wingtip.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot ``shows that we understand our target customer,''
Garland said, who is ``individualistic, self-motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Officemax will continue its ``Stickmax'' stick-figure
advertising this year, created in-house, which offers a ``155%''
low-price guarantee, said Steve Baisden, a spokesman in Shaker
Heights, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   All three superstore chains are opening stores and spending
heavily to advertise in an industry that was barely promoted a
decade ago. For the 10 months through October, they spent $162.5
million in advertising, compared with $146.3 million in the
corresponding period in 1997, according to Competitive Media
Reporting in New York, a unit of VNU N.V. that tracks ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   Staples led with $60.4 million for the 1998 period, followed by
Office Depot at $55.6 million and Officemax at $46.5 million.

BLUE WING DANCE COMPANY: THE DELICATE SKIPPING OF DEER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The Netherlands)  By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ritualistic solemnity prevailed at the Cunningham
Studio on Friday night when the Blue Wing Dance Company presented
three works by Maryse Jacobs, a choreographer from the Netherlands.
The dancers' earnestness and quiet intensity were admirable. Yet
their performances would have had greater impact if Ms. Jacobs'
choreographic images had been sharper. It was not always clear what
she intended to commemorate in her ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The most attractive of them was ``Stillness of Deer,'' inspired
by a poem by Pablo Neruda. Moments of delicate skipping that
suggested human vulnerability as well as the gentleness of deer
were contrasted with periods of immobility. The dancers looked as
alert when they were standing still as they did when they were in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sakura'' was unremittingly somber in tone and cryptic in
content. The movements ranged from self-consciously finicky
gestures to the throwing of real stones. Both ``Sakura'' and
``Stillness of Deer'' were enhanced by an ensemble that played
original scores by Julius Petty. The shifting rhythms and textures
helped make Ms. Jacobs' rituals mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Fejko composed ominous, dark-hued music for ``Haunted
Red,'' a premiere, in which red-robed dancers with black veils
obscuring their faces ran monotonously about in a state of vague
disquiet. The most memorable feature of the production was the
well-timed way in which Karen Wilson spoke, sang and chanted texts
by Doris Lessing about death, intimacy, cruelty and kindness.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers were Georgia Corner, Joy McEwen, Jessica Moss, Rod
Rufo and the company's directors, Jacques Burgering and Ms. Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   The program will be repeated on Friday and Saturday nights at
the Cunningham Studio in New York.

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Simpson is so worried about year 2000 computer problems that
he is planning to welcome the new year at his Independence, Mo.,
home with a four-month stockpile of food and a shotgun to protect
it.
</P>
<P>
   John Quinlan wants to store three barrels of gasoline in his
back yard in Prairie Village, Kan., so he can generate electricity
in case the power goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Stewart expects technology to fail us on Jan. 1. When that
happens, Stewart and her family will leave their home in the
Northland and move into a self-sufficient, year 2000-ready lake
home they're building an hour from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Those three are among a growing number of people across the
country who are patching together plans for a life without
technology.
</P>
<P>
   They think year 2000 computer problems won't be solved, causing
a loss of the nation's power supply on or before Jan. 1.
Technology-dependent trains won't run and trucks won't be able to
get fuel. The nation's food supply routes will be cut. Water plants
will fail. The economy will follow.
</P>
<P>
   And the resulting civil unrest will turn those who haven't
prepared for a Y2K crisis against those who have.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they're computer professionals, homesteaders,
blue-collar workers or conservative Christians, they're all bracing
for TEOTWAWKI, shorthand for ``the end of the world as we know
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some think the problem could last a year or more. They're buying
food by the case, water filtration systems, electric generators,
cold-weather gear and weapons they think they'll need to protect it
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather be prepared and never have to use it than be
shaking in my boots and not know what to do,'' said Ron Stafford,
an organizer of a Y2K preparedness group.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford, who describes himself as the commanding general of the
U.S. Militia, is in the minority, but his worry is migrating to the
mainstream. Army surplus stores now count business executives and
housewives among their best customers. Bulk food distributors
report half-year backlogs. Portable generators for electricity are
selling at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   Most government officials and Y2K experts think that families
should be prepared but that long-term stockpiling is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for people to feel it is time to buy a lot
in Mexico or stockpile a six-month supply of dried foods,'' John
Koskinen, the head of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than say, `It's every person for themselves,' and, `I'm
going to go hide in the cellar with my canned goods and rifles,'
there are a lot of dedicated civic organizers who are telling
people not to run and hide.'' Visions of worldwide chaos mean
backlogs for the companies that supply back-to-basics essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Orders placed today at Walton Feed, an Idaho company and one of
the nation's largest bulk food suppliers, will be filled in early
July. And the company isn't guaranteeing delivery on some items
before New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an incredible backlog,'' said Steve Portela, manager
of Walton Feed. ``It ranges from one week to over a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton, which traditionally has made most of its sales to Mormon
Church members in Utah, sees business boom after every disaster _
the San Francisco earthquakes, the grain shortage, the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K is bigger than all of them combined,'' Portela said.
</P>
<P>
   Walton had a Y2K-inspired record year in 1997. In 1998, sales
doubled. And it's on pace to double again, he said. The company has
almost tripled its staff and now operates around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only out-of-town companies that are experiencing a
sales rush.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hess, coordinator for the Overland Park Natural Food Co-op
in Overland Park, Kan., said his organization had signed up 20 to
30 members in the last month who joined to stockpile for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The average Y2K customer has spent $800 a person for a
three-month supply of storable food, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Generators, surplus supplies, water pumps and filters, solar
panels and even gasoline cans are selling at a record pace. One
generator company isn't taking new orders until after New Year's
Day. An owner of an Army surplus store said he had sold all his
sleeping bags and couldn't find more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business has doubled since last October, and it hasn't let
up,'' said Don Bossert, owner of Bossert's Military Surplus.
</P>
<P>
   He said much of his new business was coming from ``housewives
coming in and buying supplies for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers are picking up cold-weather gear, blankets and meals
ready to eat, Bossert said. ``They figure it will all be gone at
this time next year,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a little more than two years, William Dean Singleton has
become the No. 2 newspaper publisher in Southern California, buying
up a string of small dailies in a pincer-like move around the
dominant paper, The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton's Media News Group Inc. already owns 12 daily
newspapers in California, and its most recent deal, obtaining
control of the Donrey Media Group papers in the state, will add 10
more. The merged operations will have a daily circulation of
830,000 statewide _ 63 percent in the Los Angeles area, where Media
News owns The Daily News, The Press-Telegram of Long Beach and
other dailies. Some say the expansion may hinder The Los Angeles
Times, which is owned by the Times Mirror Co., from pursuing growth
in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singleton is consolidating local coverage, putting a ring
around The Times and trying to blunt its circulation growth,'' said
Jeffrey Brody, an assistant journalism professor at California
State University in Fullerton and the co-author of ``The Newspaper
Publishing Industry'' (Allyn &AMP; Bacon, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Media News is competing with The Los Angeles Times for
readership and advertising sales, on another front _ the
distribution of preprinted circulars _ they are cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   That arrangement is now the subject of a preliminary
investigation begun by the Justice Department, according to a rival
publishing executive who had been contacted by a federal
investigator. And the Donrey deal, announced two weeks ago, is
expected to put the arrangement on circulars under a brighter
light, according to Maxwell Blecher, a Los Angeles antitrust
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   An inquiry is likely to focus on whether the alliance amounts to
a price-fixing arrangement in which advertisers are without real
alternatives, Blecher said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials did not return telephone calls
requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Massey, the president and chief executive of the Media News
Los Angeles group, said that company lawyers believed the pact did
not violate antitrust laws. ``The complaint will go away quickly,''
he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   After failing in two previous tries to get a toehold in Los
Angeles, Media News succeeded in October 1996, buying three dailies
in the suburbs east of Los Angeles, and later buying The
Press-Telegram in Long Beach, the seaport south of Los Angeles, and
The Daily News, which circulates mainly in the northern tier of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal with Donrey concludes next month, the Media News
franchise will span 100 miles, and include three more dailies in
nearby counties. The largest is the 67,809-circulation Inland
Valley Daily Bulletin in Ontario, which has been losing readers in
recent years despite its position in fast-growing suburbs that are
also a target of The Los Angeles Times and the Riverside
Press-Enterprise, which is owned by A.H. Belo &UR;  &LR; Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion fits the clustering strategy of Media News, a
privately held company based in Denver and now the seventh-largest
newspaper publisher based on circulation. It has similar groups of
papers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Massachusetts. Forbes
magazine estimated that the company earned $40 million on $620
million in revenue in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clustering seeks to increase revenue by combining the group's
circulation in a one-stop-shopping pitch to advertisers. Margins
improve by sharing overhead _ including some news coverage _ across
more papers. Local editors remain autonomous and individual papers
stay distinct, emphasizing local news like school board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Pooling has already allowed the Los Angeles cluster of papers to
open a news bureau with three reporters in Sacramento, the state
capital, and to start a travel section _ additions none of the
papers could support alone. ``By consolidating, they all will have
access to things a half-million circulation paper has,'' Singleton
said.
</P>
<P>
   An exception to the hands-off management style is in staffing.
Since buying his first newspaper at age 21, Singleton, now 47, has
earned a reputation for eliminating jobs and cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   In Long Beach, Media News bought The Press-Telegram's assets,
but not its union contracts. The staff of 500 was cut 20 percent.
Newsroom employees were retained at 21 percent lower wages. In
December, in a call for contract talks that coincided with the
anniversary of the ownership change, 100 people marched outside the
paper's building wearing black arm bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Group-owned entities can pool resources,'' said Michael
Sigman, the publisher of the LA Weekly, an alternative paper.
``Does it make up for the elimination of jobs? I'd argue you'd make
more money if it's a better paper.''
</P>
<P>
   In its first year, Media News papers raised advertising revenue
10 percent while circulation was flat in the six months ended Sept.
30. In comparison, ad revenue at The Los Angeles Times rose 2.3
percent in the first 10 months of the year, and circulation for the
six months ended Sept. 10 gained 1.6 percent, to 1,067,540. Despite
recent disappointing results, The Times has revived plans to grow
in the suburbs of Riverside and San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have complete confidence in our ability to compete in that
area,'' said Robert Magnuson, senior vice president for regions for
The Times. &QL;

THE WILD _ AND NOT SO WILD _ WARNINGS ABOUT Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
 - 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Central States Special Products in Kansas City, generator
sales have been ``outstanding,'' said sales manager Lisa Magnuson.
Sales of smaller generators at Payless Cashways are up 60 percent
to 80 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   And the potential for power shortages has brought new life to
the home solar industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K has put us on a lot of people's radar screens where we
haven't been before,'' said Bill Roush of Solar Electric Systems in
Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Backup solar systems can range from $700 to $15,000. The company
also is selling solar-powered radios, flashlights, lanterns and
motion sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Gun shops haven't yet seen a significant increase in Y2K sales.
``We've had a few people come in who normally would not be who came
in and showed some interest in shotguns,'' said Marta Griffith of
Bob's Gun Rack in Lee's Summit, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be pretty busy eventually. They'll wait until
the last minute.'' Simpson, pastor of High Places Christian
Fellowship Church in Independence, is planning to greet Jan. 1 with
a gun, beans and canned goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I see is that (the Y2K crisis) is probably going to
happen,'' he said. ``This is more real than people think.''
</P>
<P>
   He is preaching preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of his congregation live paycheck to paycheck and
``have not budgeted for tragedy of this nature,'' he said. He tells
them to cut out luxuries and instead buy extra food or extra soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me a kook if you want,'' he said. ``But the fact is we
just don't know what is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinlan has purchased a 5,000-watt, gasoline-powered generator
to keep the electricity flowing to his Prairie Village home in case
Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. can't.
</P>
<P>
   The retired engineer knows the generator needs gasoline, some
140 gallons to run continuously for a week. But storing three
barrels of gasoline is both dangerous and illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could probably just keep my mouth shut and quietly bring
gasoline into our 12- by 16-foot storage barn and say nothing,'' he
said in a letter to city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The city won't let him store that much gasoline on his property
and also denied his other request _ parking gasoline tank trunks
behind earthen berms in city parks.
</P>
<P>
   So now Quinlan doesn't know what he'll do if power remains out a
long time _ only that he's more anxious than ever about the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northland, Stewart started taking notice of the year 2000
bug about three months ago. She's been planning ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart thinks a combination of things will make life in the
city nearly impossible if computers go down.
</P>
<P>
   Her new self-sufficient home is being built adjacent to a lake
and will have a hand water pump and filtration system. She'll rely
on wood heat, she'll have food set aside and she'll move her family
to the lake house when things begin to look bad.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, director of facilities and safety coordinator of Hope
House for battered women, also is working to make sure the center
is ready for Jan. 1. She's attending community meetings and working
with the Red Cross and Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a generation that has never suffered,'' she said. ``We
take technology for granted, and we have come to rely on it too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, more than 80 persons crowded into a meeting
room at Kansas City's Trails West Public Library to talk about ways
to take their homes off the national power grid in case electricity
fails.
</P>
<P>
   An Independence electrician told the crowd he had a generator to
power his house, as well as another backup generator. And if that
fails, he goes to propane and then wood.
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to light only one room of his house and black
out those windows so the light does not act as a beacon to
marauding neighbors. His generator will be muffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is going to hit us like a ton of bricks,'' the
electrician said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was a semimonthly session of the Kansas City
Preparedness Network, a group described as ``ordinary people
planning for extraordinary events.'' It's one of many groups that
have sprouted across the area in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   The network includes a mix of blue-collar workers,
businesspeople and hard-core survivalists. Generators to firearms,
home remedies to canning, all are topics of conversation. About 50
persons attend most meetings, although one drew more than 150.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Lynch sees their fears as rumors run amok.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, author of a book examining how beliefs spread through
society, says wild tales catch the imagination and crowd out more
rational thought.
</P>
<P>
   People believe only what they want to believe, Lynch argues, and
their fears are reinforced through ``thought contagions'' _ beliefs
that spread through the population much like computer viruses do in
PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Fantastic visions of a Y2K cataclysm _
planes falling from the sky, nuclear warhead strikes _ grab the
imagination and crowd out more rational explanations. ``Suggesting
the whole power grid will automatically collapse is easier to
spread than the more complicated truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, a former engineering physicist with the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., wants people to catch
their breath and apply critical reasoning to the purveyors'
predictions of digital doom.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart doesn't see her preparations as extreme.
</P>

STRESS IS GROWING AS WORKERS' MALADY OF THE '90S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Dunlap can sense when there's a big business push at area
companies, when businesses are reorganizing or when firms are
spinning merger cycles. The evidence walks in the door of his
Overland Park, Kan., medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, a general internist, has in the 1990s noted a remarkable
increase in patients seeking help for fatigue, headaches,
gastrointestinal distress and other complaints that can't be linked
to an identifiable medical illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the manifestation of stress,'' Dunlap concluded. ``And a
lot of it relates to their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   When the doctor checks for the source of that stress, one phrase
reoccurs: lack of control at work.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap perceives what health and business researchers are
finding in study after study.
</P>
<P>
   ``A heavy work load itself is not the issue,'' said Steve
Sauter, primary author of ``Stress at Work,'' a new report by the
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. ``The issue
is the feeling of having no control over rapid change and job
security.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute was created through the Occupational Safety and
Health Act of 1970. That legislation formed the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, the watchdog for physical safety in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The new report focuses the federal regulatory eye on emotional
health and safety as well. It is, in effect, the agency's first
laymen's language sermon on the subject directed specifically at
employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps now more than ever before, job stress poses a threat
to the health of workers,'' the report warns.  &LR; brk:Seeing the signs
 &LR; tx:Increased absenteeism. Reduced civility. Physical ailments.
Sleep dysfunctions. Rapid job turnover. Less human interaction.
</P>
<P>
   These are symptoms of job stress. Barbara Smith saw them all _
even in a job she loved at a company where employees were well paid
and had plenty of benefits and rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband looked at me one day and put it in a nutshell: `You
have a good job which provides you a wonderful lifestyle you don't
partake in because of your job,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith then was a human-relations executive at ERC Corp. The
company was growing and changing in a competitive industry. Smith
said she always had worked hard by choice, but her husband's remark
helped her take stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waking up at 3 a.m., thinking about work and not getting
back to sleep,'' Smith said. ``I was working 10 to 14 hours a day
and going in on Saturdays and still wasn't accomplishing what I
should _ and the `should' was coming from myself as well as from
corporate demands.''
</P>
<P>
   After working with five new bosses in 14 months, Smith opted for
change. She now works 30 hours a week as a career consultant at
DeFrain Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wake up at 3 a.m. anymore,'' she said. ``I have time
to read, to work out, to see friends and do community projects. The
stress vanished when I put balance and a support network back in.''
 &LR; brk:Reasons for stress  &LR; tx:Many workers can't change jobs as Smith
did. But many try. Kathleen Boas, a Kansas City career counselor,
says clients looking for stress relief say three things:
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, I have too much to do with too little time to do it.
No. 2, the organization is constantly changing direction, and it's
the flavor of the month management. No. 3, I have no control.''
</P>
<P>
   Boas said workers of all kinds felt they had no support, no
effect, no control.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Nelson, president of NationsBank, Kansas City region, said
nearly one-third of the calls last year to the company's Employee
Assistance Program were about stress. It was the most common reason
given by those seeking counseling.
</P>
<P>
   What caused the stress?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more work to do,'' Nelson observed. ``Then there are
special stresses from cost-cutting and merger environments.
Mergers, especially, blow apart existing hierarchies.''
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank is uniting with BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a merger, nobody knows where he stands, people with
different backgrounds are thrown together,'' Nelson added.
``There's the pressure to keep up with technological change. And
then stress is very evident when an acquiring company thinks their
way is automatically better and throws out the old people or the
old ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Valdes would agree.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes resigned a position last year as a hospitality industry
executive. He pursued other options partly because he was tired of
watching co-workers lose their jobs and wondering if he'd be next.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes recently discussed job stress with Terry Bertelsmeier, a
manufacturing industry manager who was let go when a major Kansas
City employer reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stress happens when you take on more than you should, when you
know it can't get done but you can't say no because you know that
if you say no, somebody else will say yes, even if it's not
realistic,'' Bertelsmeier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you have deadline stress, it's hard to get all the
necessary buy-ins from everybody,'' Valdes added. ``And it's even
harder when you don't have the authority to implement the
project.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it!'' Bertelsmeier agreed. ``Responsibility without
authority equals stress.''  &LR; brk:Regaining control  &LR; tx:Sauter said
the government noted a big jump in workers' compensation claims for
job stress in the mid-1980s. For the first time, claims were
awarded for ``stress injuries'' and for ``gradual mental stress,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such claims captured some employers' attention. Many employers
locally and nationally are building stress relievers into their
employee benefits programs. These include child-care assistance,
on-site exercise facilities, and flexible or reduced hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things let people have more control over their work
lives,'' said Stan Sword, the new chief people officer at Cerner
Corp., a North Kansas City computer company that handles data for
health-care networks. ``People know this is an intense industry
with high expectations when they get into it, but anything we can
do to take competitive pressures off them, we'll try.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes on-site dry cleaning and at-your-desk massages.
Some other major employers offer moderately priced take-home
dinners and even a concierge service to help cope with the
nitty-gritty of living.
</P>
<P>
   Those benefits are valuable stress relievers, said Connie
Russell, a Kansas City mental health counselor who attributes about
half her business to career-related issues. But, she said, the most
important stress eliminator is a change in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Stress is tied to low self-esteem and feelings of being cut out
of the information flow, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You overwork to overcome feelings of inadequacy and you begin
to resent your employer and your life in general,'' Russell said.
``That's when you need help realizing you need to change jobs or
change your situation. Sometimes you just need help getting up the
courage to ask the right questions of your boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Sauter said there was no evidence that American workers had lost
their coping skills or were emotional wimps. Rather, workplace life
today removes much individual control over decisions that affect
them.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health calls
on employers to respond in two ways:
</P>
<P>
   Provide stress management training and stress counseling for
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Make organizational changes _ such as redesigning work loads,
chains of command or production schedules _ to reduce identified
stressors.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is easier made than accepted. There is a tendency
to do things as they've always been done. The pace of daily
business presents all the challenge and change that most can
handle.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers and workers agree on one stress tonic that
doesn't take a lot of time or money: better communication.
</P>
<P>
   A better information flow up, down and between co-workers helps
workers understand the reasons why things are being done the way
they are, the report said. It also gets worker input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many people come to me saying, `I can do
the job. I like the people. The pay is fine. But I'm made to feel
totally inadequate by the company, the chain of command,' '' said
Jerry Touslee, a Kansas City job counselor. ``No wonder people are
stressed if they feel like they're always in line for censure or
the ax.''

CORPORATE ADVERTISERS SAVING THEIR BEST PLAYS FOR SUPER BOWL
SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is the Super Bowl really about?
</P>
<P>
   Is it about grit and guts on the gridiron, accented by the bad
blood between Atlanta's Dan Reeves and Denver's Mike Shanahan and
John Elway?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it about HAL, Halle, Louie and Lovitz, all pitching for
one of 30 advertisers paying $53,333 a second to capture the
hearts, imagination and cash of the estimated 130 million people
watching the game?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a coin toss.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those 130 million people will tune in just to see
whether the Denver Broncos can keep the Vince Lombardi Trophy out
of the hands of the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Some will turn on their TVs just to watch the ads.
</P>
<P>
   And some will snuggle into their easy chairs to witness both.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case for years, the Super Bowl is the place for
advertisers to be seen and to showcase the best their advertising
agencies have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   It gives advertisers a great melting-pot television audience.
Young, old, black, white, rich, poor and more _ every demographic
group imaginable _ will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   And like the wily network that it is, Super Bowl XXXIII
broadcaster Fox is squeezing every last penny out of its investment
by dragging out a seven-hour pregame show. Last year's Super Bowl
broadcaster, NBC, started its pre-game show less than three hours
before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Fox paid $550 million a year for eight seasons to
cover NFL games, and it needs to recoup its money.
</P>
<P>
   By dragging its Super Bowl coverage through breakfast, lunch and
dinner, Fox expects to reap the largest single-day advertising
reward in network history _ Advertising Age puts the number in the
$150 million range, compared with $93 million for NBC last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl is more than a game,'' said Fox pregame
producer Scott Ackerson. ``For the fans who are attending and
people who are watching on TV, it's a big party.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people who say it's too long, my response to them is,
the advertisers believe we have quality programming. I don't feel
that we have to apologize for anything. Nor will I. I'm pretty ...
proud of, knock on wood, what we're going to accomplish during the
Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will finally begin at 5:18 p.m., and the kickoff will
launch a parade of commercials that cost $1.6 million in 30-second
chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Some Super Bowl ads are hard to forget _ which isn't always a
good thing. A sex-change-operation spot a couple of years ago for
Holiday Inn had some of the hotel chain's franchisees demanding
that heads roll.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the spots entertain and get people to notice the
advertiser's product _ and maybe, just maybe, to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the ads are sure to be a topic of discussion,
debate and discourse in break rooms throughout America come Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer, widely credited with transforming the Super Bowl
into the Ad Bowl in 1984, will be back this year for the first time
since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Its 1984 spot, titled ``1984,'' was breakthrough advertising
that set the standard for all that has followed. According to some
critics, no subsequent ads have risen to that standard.
</P>
<P>
   In that spot, a woman ran through a crowd of zombielike people
while clutching a sledgehammer, which she used to smash the screen
of a giant, mind-controlling television. It was simple, stirring
and to the point.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's 1985 spot was less memorable. However, this year's ad
sounds promising, playing off the Mac's built-in year 2000
compatibility and using HAL, the ill-behaved computer from Stanley
Kubrick's classic movie ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   In a spot set in the future, HAL tells astronaut Dave that
computers began misbehaving in 2000, creating global economic
disruption, because they weren't programmed to recognize the new
age.
</P>
<P>
   Then HAL says, ``You like your Macintosh better than me, don't
you, Dave?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the spot will be lost on thousands of people
wondering who and what Dave and HAL are, but at least
``2001''-compatible viewers will get it.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a series of ads for the new Crispy M&AMP;Ms
candy. Crispy is a paranoid little critter of a candy lusted after
by many, including the lovely Halle Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Also playing on an amusing note is the celebrity book tour of
Jon Lovitz, the acclaimed author of the Yellow Pages, or so he
says.
</P>
<P>
   And as always, sex is expected to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret will make its Super Bowl debut hoping to
``make women smile and men take notice.'' Of course, rather than
smiling, more women will probably be taking notice of their
husbands' and boyfriends' taking notice of the lingerie-clad
Victoria's Secret models.
</P>
<P>
   And Doritos will bring back the alluring model Ali Landry from
last year's effort to introduce its new Smoky Red BBQ chips. Landry
sets off a sprinkler system as she sashays through a library eating
the hot new chips.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial big-spender Anheuser Busch is spending a reported $20
million to be the exclusive Super Bowl beer advertiser and is
expected to run at least nine spots, including ones starring the
obnoxious yet lovable Louie the lizard.
</P>
<P>
   Remember last year when Louie tried to off the Budweiser frogs
by electrocuting them in the swamp? No one is saying for sure, but
the rumor is that Louie had better watch out. He could be in for
quite a tongue-lashing from the frogs.

WHAT KEEPS THE SENATE TRIAL OF PRESIDENT CLINTON GOING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On this weekend a year ago, a mere 10 days after
the world became acquainted with the name Monica Lewinsky, the
public was already tiring of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anybody do any real work there?'' a manager of several
Caterpillar plants in Peoria, Ill., was quoted as saying about
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, even after it became clear in the impeachment
trial last week that the Senate was not going to remove President
Clinton, the scandal continues to drive capital politics, continues
to exasperate much of the public, and continues to defy persistent
efforts to bring it to a close.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps it going?
</P>
<P>
   The question is simple. The answer, however, is not.
</P>
<P>
   Many Senate Democrats will tell you politics is driving the
final phases of the impeachment trial. They say the desire of many
Republicans to at least further embarrass and perhaps politically
cripple President Clinton, even if they can't muster the votes to
oust him, propels their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And they argue that the House impeachment managers, the 13
Republican prosecutors, are steering the process, not the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the deference that the Republicans leadership is
showing to their House colleagues,'' said Democratic Sen. Robert
Torricelli of New Jersey, ``but they have to decide whether to
follow them off the cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans counter that they think the House should be
given a good opportunity, by at least deposing witnesses, to make
its case for convicting the president, with the same courtesy
extended to his defense. To do anything less, they say, would be to
not uphold the Constitution. And they dismiss all the speculation
about them bowing to pressure from the House or right-wing groups
who allegedly are threatening political retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world where there seems to be a conspiracy theory about
everything, we owe it to history to get the facts out,'' said
Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the aims of the Senate Republicans are more complex than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Many are embarrassed that the impeachment process in the House
looked more like a partisan alley fight. They want to ensure that
the Senate's dignity is upheld.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also those who just want Clinton's head, and don't
want him or his defenders crowing over an acquittal. And looming
over it all is an uncertainty over how to gauge the political
fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans already have seen, in short order, both Speaker of
the House Newt Gingrich and then his likely successor, Rep. Robert
Livingston, resign from Congress with the party caught in the briar
patch of the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the political equivalent of divorce court, where all
other means of having an amicable or productive result have failed,
so the only goal is to get out of the process alive,'' said Mark
Merritt, a Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Republicans haven't had several opportunities to
declare victory and go home.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, for instance, just days after the House impeached
President Clinton, a Republican senator and Democratic senator
proposed a plan to short-circuit the trial by holding a quick
up-or-down vote on whether his alleged offenses _ even if true _
justified his removal from office. Senate conservatives cried foul,
and the plan quickly sank.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, several Republican senators openly voiced
reservations about calling witnesses, indicating that things might
wrap up soon. But two days later, every Republican supported
witnesses. Meanwhile, the Senate has held two separate votes to end
the case. Though both failed, each got enough support _ all from
Democrats _ that it appears it will be all but impossible to
convict Clinton of the perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Senate begins a week guided by a plan that envisions an
end by Feb. 12. But it has enough loopholes, and the trial's
momentum has shifted enough times, that nothing is certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through this now for the last virtually six months,
and anyone who makes predictions about how this process will end
does it at their peril, because every prediction has been wrong,''
said Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, a member of the
House Judiciary Committee that passed the articles of impeachment.
``This is sort of like Sisyphus. Every time we roll the rock up and
we're about to get to the top of the hill, it rolls back down
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the House prosecutors, who since they first walked into
the Senate have waged an uphill battle to press their case as fully
as they would like, have been to the brink more than once. But each
time they are rescued, and then given slightly more latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest recovery is apparent in the plan, passed Thursday
on a straight party-line vote, that allows for the possibility of
calling even more witnesses than the three who will give videotaped
depositions beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see what will come from these witnesses and then
we'll decide next,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a
Mississippi Republican. ``I don't think we should preclude
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats salvaged an important caveat, however. Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota will have a veto over
any attempt to call witnesses beyond Lewinsky, presidential friend
Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Except for possibly a few solo drivers following their own
route, the Senate has seemed like a very large family piled into a
van, stuck on the interstate and hoping for an exit ramp. The
cramped backseat is full of passengers all chiming in with
different ideas about how to get there and how far down the road it
might be.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is in the driver's seat, stuck with trying to find a route
that will balance everyone's views, and especially the conflicting
demands among his own colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The witness issue tested that. That vote, along with the failed
attempt to dismiss the case, pumped life into the tensions that
have been lying just below the surface during two weeks of relative
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the witness vote, for instance, Democratic
Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland was fuming over the likelihood that
the Senate would permit witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House didn't call witnesses,'' he said. ``Now they come to
the Senate and say, `To assess the credibility of this person, you
have to look them in eye.' They didn't look them in the eye on the
House side when they voted articles of impeachment. It's just
preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping onto the Capitol subway a few minutes later, Republican
Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri shot back: `` He's just full of it. The
House acts as an accusatory body. It had the information from the
grand jury. That's the appropriate role.''
</P>
<P>
   In opinion polls, many people appear to side with the Democrats
on the witness issues, just as many do on the need to end the
trial, given the near certainty that Clinton will not be convicted.
But a recent poll showed the disparity is not overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, it seemed clear that even if all 55 Republicans
vote to convict Clinton _ and there's no assurance that will happen
_ they still would never reach the required 67 votes. But even if
they couldn't script the trial's end, their majority gives them the
power to force how the Senate gets there _ if they choose to use
that power. And they did last week, when party-line votes set in
motion the final phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   After depositions, which will end Wednesday, the Senate
reconvenes Thursday to possibly hear motions about either calling
the witnesses to appear at the trial or at least introducing the
videotapes of their depositions. Adding witnesses may also be
debated, and the White House would have 24 hours to decide about
calling its own witnesses. The next step would be final arguments,
then a vote, by noon Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps expressing the sentiments of the entire Senate,
Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone of Wisconsin said, ``The people of
this country are just going to hate this if goes on much longer.''

`THE WAY OF THE WORLD':   HUMANKIND'S GIANT STEPS IN THE MARCH OF
TIME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are many ways of demonstrating how far humanity
has come over the millenniums, and David Fromkin's way is as good
as most. ``Arbitrary rule, the divinity of kings, the hereditary
principle: these were among the burdens of the human race for
almost the whole of political history, burdens that therefore
seemed to be unchangeable,'' he writes in his new book, ``The Way
of the World.'' But even if an ancient Egyptian or Sumerian would
have predicted that his way of political life was indelibly
inscribed in the very nature of being, clearly he would have been
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Fromkin, who teaches international relations, history and law at
Boston University and whose most recent other book was ``In the
Time of the Americans,'' has written a history of humanity in 222
pages (plus notes and index).
</P>
<P>
   While galloping through the centuries, he identifies ``eight
giant steps'' that produced the world as we know it and three
additional steps that humankind needs to take if current trends are
to continue. His book certainly has the virtue of conciseness, and
the giant steps he has chosen _ from ``becoming human'' to
``achieving rationality'' to ``ruling ourselves'' _ are wisely
chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, reading Fromkin is a little like listening to Beethoven
with the volume turned down. You know that there are grand themes
here, sweeping passages, but Fromkin's striving for a kind of
innocuousness and his high school textbook tone prevent them from
reverberating in your ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Nile proved central to the history of Egypt,'' he
writes in a typical passage, attempting to link past and present in
a single thematic strand, ``so science, industry, and technology
were to the making of the modern world _ and they go on making the
world of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly nothing incorrect about that statement or,
for that matter, about most of the statements Fromkin makes as he
surveys the past and projects into the future. But just as he
relies elsewhere in this book on rather overused riverine
metaphors, there is nothing very surprising in his treatment of
universal history, no theoretical or conceptual breakthroughs that
lead historically informed readers to say very often, ``Ah, I never
thought of that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Fromkin begins at the beginning. His first giant step, in the
chapter entitled ``Becoming Human,'' has to do with the evolution
of Homo sapiens from our less brainy primate ancestors. His larger
point here is that change is the only constant. ``The way of the
world _ our world _ is to promiscuously propagate differences,'' he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   His next step, in ``Inventing Civilization,'' stresses the idea
that ``for what must have been the first time, a species was
altering its behavior independent of external coercions.'' Here we
have the creation of agriculture in ancient Sumeria and Egypt, the
organization of armies, the struggle between desert-toughened
nomads and the softer residents of sedentary societies.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Developing a Conscience,'' Fromkin surveys the great
religions and moral philosophies that, for a reason that remains
unexplained, emerged in the Middle East, India, China and Greece
all around the same time, roughly the fifth century B.C.
Individuals begin to play a role in Fromkin's story _ the Buddha,
Confucius, the redactors of the Hebrew Bible, Plato, Thucydides and
others _ but each of them gets only a small number of lines.
</P>
<P>
   Fromkin's overall scheme is one in which history is a kind of
halting progression from one stage to a more advanced and generally
happier one (though he is perfectly aware that the 20th century was
the bloodiest in history). Ancient times, in his view, gave birth
to ``conscience,'' modern times to ``the pursuit of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   This process is not without its paradoxes. Whereas ancient times
saw the proliferation of many civilizations, modernity, based on
the scientific revolution and democratic forms of government, has a
powerful homogenizing influence. ``Sumerians and Egyptians and
others invented civilization independently and for themselves,''
Fromkin writes, ``but there is only one
scientific-industrial-technological revolution,'' and sooner later
all peoples will either belong to it, or they will languish.
</P>
<P>
   What this amounts to, in essence, is that history has been
tending toward the duplication across the globe of the American
model, which Fromkin presents as the purest and most advanced
expression of the trends that produced modern life.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, of course, empires have declined and disappeared.
``Will the United States, too, prove to be a transitory great
power?'' Fromkin asks. His answer: If the United States continues
to be a leader in the scientific revolution, it ``should continue
to play the role of a great power for a long time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   One's response is not to disagree but to agree too readily to
generalizations so broad that they often come across less as
insights than as platitudes. We learn in the chapter ``Releasing
Nature's Energies,'' for example, that the inventions of the
telegraph, the wireless and the telephone have ``had the effect of
turning the planet into a neighborhood.'' Or in ``Ruling
Ourselves'' that ``in our own time, the ideology of revolution has
been discredited.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more interesting phenomena _ the epic, prolonged
life-and-death battle within the human soul between the will to
power on one side and the liberal philosophy of limits and
restraint on the other _ seem to get lost in Fromkin's rather bland
formulations. When he gets to his chapters on the future, his
points are embedded in a kind of kitchen-sink State of Humanity
survey in which covering every possibility seems to be the main
goal.
</P>
<P>
   At one point he deals in about half a page with Galileo, Francis
Bacon, Rene Descartes and Michel de Montaigne, saying that they
were all men of ``skepticism in thought and moderation in action''
who helped draw Europe out of ``the long sleep of feudalism.''
</P>
<P>
   That is correct, and to be correct is an achievement. The
achievement would have been more impressive had Fromkin allowed
himself to go deeper, to be more audacious as well.

   WASHINGTON _ Their small office is tucked away in Washington's
eclectic Eastern Market area, bordering the seedier side of Capitol
Hill. The hours are long, the pay low and the benefits modest.
</P>
<P>
   With an annual budget of just $250,000 to cover salaries for
three full-time lawyers and three half-time helpers, they don't
even have a fax line.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with just the touch of a button, employees of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center can reach more than 10,000 people, an
international audience that is educated and technologically savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why executives from Intel Corp., facing a
boycott from the privacy center over an identification feature in
Intel's new computer chip, traveled across the country on Thursday
to meet with the center's lawyers, Marc Rotenberg, Dave Banisar and
David Sobel, aggressive advocates for protecting privacy and civil
rights in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have fancy K Street offices,'' Banisar said,
referring to the Washington street that is home to many lobbyists.
``We don't have fancy K Street salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Rotenberg said, ``we know how to use the Web. And on
the Web, this stuff really spreads like wildfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just hours after the privacy center and two other
groups, Junkbusters and the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
announced their planned boycott of Intel, the world's largest
computer-chip maker, the company reversed a plan to activate an
identifying signature in its soon-to-be-released Pentium III chip.
Privacy advocates say the feature, intended to enhance the security
of electronic commerce and safeguard against software piracy, would
make it easy for online marketers, even governments, to track
people on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although questions were being raised by more groups than just
the privacy center, the boycott did play an important role in
Intel's decision to review its plans for the Pentium III, an Intel
spokesman, Tom Waldrop, said. ``I think it is safe to say that the
concerns were heightened greatly by the three privacy groups'
issuing the threat of the boycott, but those concerns were not
new,'' Waldrop said. ``We had heard them from others, just not as
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1994, the Electronic Privacy Information Center is
one of several online civil liberties groups that are playing an
increasingly visible role in the shaping of policy for the digital
age. It has often focused on the government, earning a pit-bull
reputation in fights with the Clinton administration over export
controls on computer security technology, or encryption, and the
administration's refusal to pass Internet privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   But it also has no hesitation about going after the
high-technology companies that are its allies on other issues. And
the privacy center has been quite successful defending the Internet
user.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel, a 45-year-old Miami native, played an important role in
two disputes with America Online, one a successful challenge to the
company's plan to sell customer information to marketers, the other
a high-profile lawsuit over the company's release of personal
information on a gay sailor that resulted in his discharge. America
Online has since vowed to keep such personal information about its
customers private.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg, a 38-year-old Boston native, is credited by some with
starting the digital age privacy movement in 1991 with a campaign
that forced Lotus to abandon plans for releasing a CD-ROM for
marketers with personal information gathered by Equifax Inc., one
of the nation's largest credit bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   Banisar, a 32-year-old native of Baltimore, has dedicated a lot
of his time recently to studying international encryption laws,
writing reports challenging the administration's claims that its
desire to control the technology is a position supported by a
majority of countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The group has used the Freedom of Information Act to monitor the
government's actions, and has been the first to disclose, among
other things, the FBI's desire to redesign the telephone system to
ease wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think EPIC right now is sort of the pre-eminent privacy
advocacy group in the United States,'' said Joel Reidenberg, a
professor at Fordham University Law School in New York and an
expert on international privacy laws. ``Marc Rotenberg has really
taken the lead on privacy issues in pushing American public policy
toward strong, fair information practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Hoffman, a computer science professor who heads the
Cyberspace Policy Institute at George Washington University in
Washington, called the group ``the closest thing to a sort of
consumer ombudsman for privacy that we have in cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ira Magaziner, who as President Clinton's top Internet
adviser often drew EPIC's harshest criticisms, said the group
played an important role in tough policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that as an advocacy group it is their role to be a
kind of burr in the saddle of policy-makers,'' he said. ``And in a
sense it is not always their job to be completely reasonable. It is
their job to make noise and get press attention. And I think they
do that very effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg, Sobel and Banisar formed the privacy center after
working together in the Washington office of the Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility. Much of their financing
comes from the Fund for Constitutional Government, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to protecting civil liberties. They also
receive money from other organizations and, occasionally,
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy center has perhaps been most visible in the
encryption debate. It has also strongly opposed the
administration's continued call for self-regulation of the privacy
practices of online marketers, pushing instead for laws to protect
consumers. It has joined the American Civil Liberties Union and
other groups in their fights against online censorship, and has
worked with Congress on privacy issues involving automated health
care records, Social Security and copyright and database
protections.
</P>
<P>
   And the list keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the environmental issue of the 21st century,'' Banisar
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were born doomed, the poor things: programmed
expressly to destroy themselves, to decompose before our very eyes.
Yet anyone watching the set of short, self-sabotaging plays by
Caryl Churchill called ``Blue Heart,'' which opened on Friday for a
24-performance run at the Majestic Theater of the Brooklyn Academy
of Music, is more likely to feel a steady, rushing exhilaration
than morbid thoughts about the demise of drama.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Churchill, the English author of ``Cloud Nine,'' ``Top
Girls'' and ``Mad Forest'' and the possessor of one of the sharpest
and most restless theatrical imaginations in the world today, has
described the two works that make up ``Blue Heart'' as anti-plays.
Wired with explosive devices that cause plot and language to come
irrevocably unglued in mid-performance, the plays, in the opinion
of their director, Max Stafford-Clark, ``come out of a distrust or
an anger with theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Churchill, however, has never been merely angry in the
tradition of John Osborne and his splenetic heirs. True, she has
never hidden her dissatisfaction with, and even contempt for, the
corrupt, predatory ways of her fellow humans, whether in
Thatcherite England (``Top Girls,'' ``Serious Money''),
revolutionary Romania (``Mad Forest'') or a cosmically polluted
spirit world that parallels a much abused planet earth (``The
Skriker''). But you never leave a Churchill play murmuring, ``What
a downer.'' There's too much creative energy at work, a doggedly
reassertive life force.
</P>
<P>
   That same force is evident in the anarchic breeze that sweeps
through ``Blue Heart,'' giving an almost giddy vitality to this
production from the London-based touring company Out of Joint.
Directed and acted with a finesse and wit that are far more warm
than chilly, the evening eventually starts to feel like a love poem
to the endless possibilities of theater, even as it ruthlessly
exposes its limitations. And what could have registered as mere
form-bending exercises acquire residual emotional depth that keeps
you thinking about them.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that the two one-acters of ``Blue Heart'' are
seriously ill, though suffering from quite different maladies.
``Heart's Desire,'' set in a middle-class home where domestic
quarrels sprout like fungi in a petri dish, is plagued by a fatal
inability to decide where it wants to go or what it wants to be. It
proceeds in scenes that, beginning from roughly the same starting
point, keep swerving into an assortment of different directions,
suggesting a series of discarded first drafts from a dizzyingly
dissatisfied writer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blue Kettle,'' a portrait of a cool but confused con artist
whose motives are mysterious even to himself, it is language that
has gone wrong, wrong to the point of pathology. Ms. Churchill
subversively infiltrates the play's dialogue with the two words of
the title, ``blue'' and ``kettle,'' which by degrees start showing
up as random substitutes for other words, finally taking over the
language in mutant, fragmented forms.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two works, ``Heart's Desire'' is the more obviously
entertaining and the more familiar, bringing to mind the kind of
impudent, self-conscious story tweaking that has been a staple of
experimental theater from Ionesco to David Ives. It is set in the
spic-and-span kitchen (designed with just the right hint of
artificial abstraction by Julian MacGowan) of Alice (June Watson)
and Brian (Bernard Gallagher), who, along with Brian's sister,
Maisie (Mary Macleod), await the return of the couple's grown
daughter from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting, as Maisie points out on quite a number of occasions, is
always hard, and frictions between husband and wife turn into the
sorts of classic confrontations that have always made kitchen-sink
drama something like a boxing ring. Well, at least that's one route
the play takes. The actors keep retracing their early gestures and
dialogue (sometimes at high speed, sometimes in slapstick shorthand
speech) before following their play into alternative series of
developments that manage to encompass a survey of theatrical
cliches since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters show up to steer the action onto its different
paths: a whining alcoholic son in grimy underwear (Pearce Quigley),
a pair of Uzi-toting, stocking-masked terrorists, a flood of young
children who erupt from kitchen cabinets and drawers, the
daughter's lesbian girlfriend and a giant ostrich. Guess who's
coming to dinner, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The actors exude a quality of brisk, good-natured comic
exasperation throughout all this, and much of ``Heart's Desire'' is
achingly, aggressively funny. Yet it is not, finally, an antic
spirit that prevails. Ms. Churchill and Stafford-Clark find haunted
shadows in the satire.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the turns that the play takes, none is more unexpected
than a quiet, exquisitely delivered monologue from Ms. Macleod in
which Maisie describes the fears of death that attack her in the
middle of the night. A similar spirit is embodied more grotesquely
when Brian's face stretches into a cavernous, silent scream. At
another moment, the three principal characters sit frozen through a
brutally protracted silence
</P>
<P>
   Waiting is hard, and unfortunately it's what much of human
existence is. The different events that hijack ``Heart's Desire''
become an implicit catalog of the worries, the multiform
anticipations with which most of us fill that waiting time. The
whisper beneath the jaunty surface of the play is one that keeps
saying that anything, everything can go wrong in life, and in so
very many ways.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The darkness of ``Blue Kettle'' is more immediately apparent. In
it, the 39-year-old, unemployed Derek (Quigley) has made a
``hobby,'' as another character puts it, of seeking out elderly
women who once put babies up for adoption, claiming to be their
lost son. The whole enterprise makes his girlfriend, Enid (Sally
Rogers, who is terrific), extremely uneasy, and she can't even
figure out why he's doing it. For money? As a means of compensating
for an unsatisfactory relationship with his own mother (Gabrielle
Blunt), now infirm and senile?
</P>
<P>
   This doleful ambiguity, beautifully captured in Quigley's taut,
sullen performance, isn't limited to Derek. All of the eight
characters in the play seem disfigured by a sense of
incompleteness, and it is to Ms. Churchill's and the actors'
immense credit that each of them registers as a person of
subterranean fears and anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   When the dialogue starts to go haywire, as the words ``blue''
and ``kettle'' are increasingly substituted for nouns, verbs and
adjectives, it makes an appalling sense. (It should be noted that
the actors all speak this bastardized speech with unself-conscious
fluency.) The suggestion is that there is a frightening, shadowy
core in each personality for which there is no expressive
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   In the play's final scene, Derek and one of his putative mothers
(Ms. Watson) are reduced to communicating in nonsense sounds made
from the letters of the shattered words of the play's title. If Ms.
Churchill has meant to portray the failure of language, she has in
fact made an argument for its endless flexibility. Quigley and Ms.
Watson achieve the evening's sharpest moment of eloquence in this
decimated language, and it is heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in ``Heart's Desire,'' Brian confesses to a fantasy
in which he eats himself, body part by body part, until nothing is
left but his mouth. Can the mouth then eat itself, he asks? The
answer seems to be yes. On some level, this is a metaphor for what
Ms. Churchill has attempted to achieve, a brace of
self-cannibalizing plays.
</P>
<P>
   But if she had really done that, there would be only silence at
the evening's end, a sense of a vacuum, and ``Blue Heart'' plants
seeds that keep germinating in your mind long after the plays are
over. When it comes to her own work, Ms. Churchill is no Medea: She
may have intended to murder these latest offspring, but she has
given them resonant, open-ended life. This failure turns out to be
one of the season's happier successes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Boris Eifman's story ballets are provocative and
fascinating. They entertain as pure theater whether one agrees with
what they have to say.
</P>
<P>
   The best example is ``Red Giselle,'' which tells us immediately
that there is a difference between a cartoon and a lampoon. The
ballet is not a lampoon; it does not mock its subject.
</P>
<P>
   But Eifman's choreographic essay on the life and mental illness
of the Russian emigre ballerina Olga Spessivtseva is expressed in a
style with cartoonlike simplicities. These were evident last spring
when the Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg made its New York debut
with ``Red Giselle,'' and they were just as obvious (and dazzling)
when the ballet returned to City Center on Friday night. The season
was presented by Sergei Danilian's Ardani Artists.
</P>
<P>
   Here again were the same vividly exaggerated, even outrageous,
images. A marching, elbow-swinging crowd, set off by a red banner,
signified the revolutionary rabble that destroys art. A floating
head, presented through a theatrical sleight of hand, was one of
several hallucinatory visions. Spectacular scenic glitter, thanks
to Vyacheslav Okunev's decor, contrasted the closed world of the
Russian Imperial Ballet and the outside world, including the Jazz
Age in Paris, as Eifman charted his heroine's descent into madness.
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon distills complexity of character and Eifman's
choreography, his steps and use of the entire body, is brilliantly
expressive. Nonetheless his scenario is schematic rather than
contemplative. A young ballerina in the hothouse of the Russian
Imperial Ballet is swept up by the Bolshevik Revolution and her
love for a secret police agent. She recoils at the revolution's
excess and emigrates.
</P>
<P>
   At the Paris Opera, her partner prefers men. Like Giselle, she
goes mad and recedes into a world of blurred visions. The real
Spessivtseva, a world-famous Giselle, died a few years ago at the
Tolstoy Farm in upstate New York. She was no mystery to her
colleagues and admirers in the West. One can recommend the
documentary film about her made some 30 years ago by Ludovic
Kennedy, a British journalist who married Moira Shearer, the
British ballerina and star of the feature film ``The Red Shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The trail from ``The Red Shoes'' to ``Red Giselle'' is not that
winding. In each case the myth is that a dancer dies for her art,
and today Spessivtseva is a cult figure in Russia, the subject of
two recent films as well as this ballet. Not everyone stresses her
early identification with the Bolshevik elite: the red stands for
Communist in ``Red Giselle.'' But there is a strong tendency to
mythologize and to sentimentalize Spessivtseva's life.
</P>
<P>
   Eifman is astute enough to give his characters generic labels.
Yelena Kuzmina was again the Ballerina, wonderfully intense as she
moved from ballet student to voluptuary with a secret police lover,
enjoying the Bolshevik high life before cringing in her madness.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Galichanin, impassive and then desperate as her lover,
was superb as the Secret Police Agent. Igor Markov projected his
usual appeal as the ambiguous Partner, who becomes Albrecht to the
heroine's Giselle in a striking pastiche that Eifman creates out of
several scenes from ``Giselle.''
</P>
<P>
   One can contest the ballet's picture of good and evil. But one
also has to admire the impact of Eifman's choreography and the
sheer originality of his theatrical vision.  &QL;

ALL-IN-ONE RATE OPENS NEW ERA IN PHONE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let the battle of the bundles begin.
</P>
<P>
   When AT&AMP;T Corp. said last week that it would start selling a
communications package that charged an identical 10 cents a minute
for long-distance calls made from either a standard home telephone
or a wireless mobile phone, the announcement was about much more
than savings for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sign that the long-simmering battle among the nation's
giant phone companies to provide an integrated yet
easy-to-understand basket of communications services had moved to
the front burner. Look now for things to heat up in the battle of
the nation's network titans, which besides AT&AMP;T includes companies
like Sprint Corp., MCI Worldcom Inc. and the regional Bell
companies.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost certainly true that the first beneficiaries of that
fight will be consumers, who are set to see lower rates for all
sorts of communications services _ and for new, futuristic features
that seem inspired by Dick Tracy, if not the Jetsons. But the
stakes are much higher for the behemoths wrangling over a U.S.
communications market of at least $200 billion. In the
communications business, it has become an article of faith that the
ultimate winners will be the companies that can put together the
biggest, broadest bundles.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, there is little new in all of this. Whether called
bundles, baskets or ``one-stop shopping,'' the assumption that
consumers want simple solutions to their diverse communications
needs has been a postulate of the communications industry for at
least a decade. It was even one of the premises of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, which removed some of the
regulatory barriers separating the long-distance, local phone and
cable television industries.
</P>
<P>
   But while some sort of bundling has been available to big
business customers for several years, most consumers have known it
more as a promise than a fact. The equilibrium shifted last week
with AT&AMP;T's so-called Personal Network announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing about the new AT&AMP;T plan is not simply the
variety of services that the company says it will provide on a
single bill _ wireless, long-distance, calling card services and a
personal toll-free number. Far more important is the pricing. By
charging the same rate for both wireless and traditional calls,
AT&AMP;T may be set to make a psychological breakthrough in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   There is no certainty, of course, that AT&AMP;T's arresting sales
pitch will succeed. But if AT&AMP;T's Personal Network idea catches on,
there will be one simple and very profitable implication for its
business: higher customer loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   That is important, because it has become clear in recent years
that most communications services have essentially become
commodities. Sprint, for instance, which used to tout the
technical, hear-a-pin-drop superiority of its network in national
television advertisements, no longer does so. That is because most
people have come to realize that no one company provides a better
phone call than any other.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, for all the advances in wireless technology, most
people do not discern a big difference in sound quality among
different providers.
</P>
<P>
   Turning many communications services into commodities has
undermined customer loyalty and prompted many consumers to switch
to whatever company seemed to dangle a better deal. From the point
of view of the communications carriers, this tendency has posed at
least two big problems. First, and most obvious, it fosters a
headlong race toward lower prices, squeezing already-thin profit
margins to the breadth of an optical fiber. Second, and not so
obvious: That profit pressure becomes even more intense as the
companies have to spend more money on marketing to vie for
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of acquiring customers is one of the most important
financial yardsticks in the communications business _ which is why
it is often a closely guarded secret. The cost of winning a new
customer through advertising or telemarketing, for instance, is
much higher than for selling an additional service to an existing
customer _ by, say, inserting a promotional offer into the bill you
are already sending them.
</P>
<P>
   The essential financial case for service bundling is that by
selling a customer a bunch of services in one package, the carrier
not only makes money from each of those services but, just as
important, significantly reduces the chance of that customer's
switching to another company.
</P>
<P>
   After all, to get the 10-cent rate from AT&AMP;T's Personal Network
plan, the user must sign up for both long-distance and wireless
service. If the customer then switches long-distance providers, the
10-cent rate for the wireless service disappears, too. If AT&AMP;T can
use its breadth of services to keep its customers from switching
carriers, the acquisition costs decrease and the profit margins
expand.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In AT&AMP;T's case, the concept will find additional expression as
the company completes its planned acquisition of
Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable television provider. The
TCI deal is meant to give AT&AMP;T a way to expand into local phone
service, high-speed Internet access and, of course, cable
television. With that menu, the company's ability to keep patrons
at the AT&AMP;T table becomes even stronger. For instance, customers
might get a premium television channel like Showtime free, but only
if they also used AT&AMP;T long-distance and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   At least in the short run, the only company that could come
close to approximating the new AT&AMP;T plan is Sprint. That is because
Sprint is the only other major long-distance carrier that also has
a significant wireless operation. Little surprise, then, that
Sprint says it is studying the bundling concept.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that neither AT&AMP;T nor Sprint has a wireless network
that covers the entire country. AT&AMP;T, for instance, is not
initially offering the Personal Network plan in Los Angeles,
Houston and San Francisco. And while Sprint has wireless licenses
for the whole country, the company has not yet built an entire
national system.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, each of the regional Bell telephone companies
has major wireless operations in its traditional service area. And
some, like SBC Communications Corp., have a big wireless presence
outside their region, as well. But none of them has yet passed the
regulatory tests to sell long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   While a Bell's offering of local and wireless on a single bill
may have its appeal, it is not as compelling as a single-rate
wireless and long-distance package. Most people do not pay
per-minute fees for local service anyway.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, meanwhile, does not have its own wireless
operation at all. Not that this lack has hurt the company
financially; its stock has far outperformed those of the other
long-distance giants over the last few years. And MCI Worldcom's
wireless situation could change. The company sniffed around
Airtouch Communications, one of the world's biggest wireless
carriers, last month before Airtouch agreed to be acquired by
Vodafone Group PLC of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Were MCI Worldcom devoted to becoming a factor in the wireless
market, companies like Nextel might seem to fit the bill as
acquisition targets. MCI Worldcom also has no consumer Internet
business, though it is a major provider of Internet ``backbone''
services to other Internet carriers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, AT&AMP;T must execute its strategy, doing the mundane
things necessary to bringing the Personal Network successfully to
market. But as of last week, AT&AMP;T is the company to beat when it
comes to consumer communications bundles.

`TOM CLANCY'S NET FORCE':   HEROES MAKE THE WEB SAFE FOR AMERICA

   The year is 2005, and the 21st century is already beginning to
look creepy. The Internet has spread everywhere, controlling
everything: traffic flow, operating rooms, the marketplace. The Mob
has wised up, tapped in and made out like, yes, bandits. There's
still a president, but the real power rests with his golfing buddy,
a diabolical boyish wonder who sits atop a computer empire with his
sneakers propped on his desk. Across the Potomac, the FBI, trying
to protect the American way of life from crashing, has set up a
special branch to police the Net, herding a band of baby-faced
prodigies into a windowless command center where they are
apparently under orders to act dead serious at all times.
</P>
<P>
   But not everything in ``Tom Clancy's `Netforce,''' a two-part
ABC movie that starts Monday night and concludes on Thursday,
throbs with the sociopolitical paranoia of a Clancy novel. The
movie also features exciting advances in computer technology. One
lets you reconstruct a walking, talking person on screen from bits
of personal data. Another, and definitely the coolest, offers
virtual-reality Web sites. Snap on a pair of goggles and, click,
you're in a dreamy bordello run by a Lonnie Anderson look-alike.
</P>
<P>
   All this in just six years, mind you. ``Netforce'' may not think
much of human nature, but it has boundless faith in the computer
industry's endless ability to outstrip itself.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, in fact, ``Netforce'' looks as if it were made by
people who need to log off more often. Spread over four hours of
prime time, the movie has all the hermetic sprawl of a trip through
cyberspace. Plot developments arrive in byte-size scenes, each like
a window on a computer screen, one opening onto another, the links
not altogether clear, until you forget where you were when you
started. Along the way is a lot of chat, interactive and otherwise,
sandwiched between pyrotechnic shoot'em-ups right out of a computer
game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its enervating surface complexity, the movie has a
conventional black-and-white story to tell, one hatched for the
tube by Clancy and Steve Pieczenik, a former deputy assistant
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   It centers on the straight-shooting hero Alex Michaels (Scott
Bakula), who takes command of Netforce when his leathery boss (Kris
Kristofferson) is apparently rubbed out. A Mob hit? Michaels thinks
not. Soon he and his soft-eyed new deputy (Joanna Going), who also
happens to be his girlfriend, are poking into the suspicious doings
of one Will Stiles, a computer magnate who, we're told,
``apprenticed under the great Bill Gates of Microsoft.'' Hmmm. The
arrogant, power-hungry Stiles, played with glee by Judge Reinhold,
even loosely resembles Gates here.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, before long national life has been disrupted by Internet
breakdowns, some of America's most dangerous terrorists have been
electronically sprung from prison, the Mob has been defanged, and
events are leading predictably to a messy power grab inside a
famous Washington building, where a surprise ending and a
cautionary moral await.
</P>
<P>
   The movie does gather suspense and momentum in Part II, but so
much is going on, and so much dialogue is devoted to explaining it,
that no one has time to be interesting. Even Brian Dennehy, these
days playing Willy Loman on Broadway after an acclaimed run in
Chicago, seems bored in the supporting role of a White House chief
of staff with a bad Southern accent. By the look of things on the
screen, he sent this performance by modem. &QL;

MAKING MONEY BY PAYING COMPUTER USERS TO READ INTERNET ADS 
ANGRY INTERNET JOUSTING OVER SIMULATED WARFARE  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Va.)  (jw) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The basic premise of Cybergold, an electronic commerce company
in Berkeley, Calif., is that the best way to get consumers to read
Internet advertisements is to pay them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It finds advertisers willing to pay people who sign up at its
World Wide Web site (www.cybergold.com) and look at the ads. It
then compensates consumers who demonstrate in some way that they
have read an ad by crediting an account in the consumer's name;
amounts range from 50 cents for downloading America Online software
to $100 for referring a new paid-up subscriber to the At Home
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Once enough money accumulates in a consumer's account, it can be
put in a bank account by direct deposit, used to pay credit card
bills or sent to a favorite charity.
</P>
<P>
   Cybergold recently received its second patent covering the
concept of offering incentives to people to pay attention to ads.
But the company's patents cover two other intriguing approaches to
advertising in cyberspace. The first is a way for consumers to
store direct-marketing information about themselves on their
computers _ like their income bracket, ZIP code, hobbies and
profession _ so they can be compensated every time they decide to
release such information to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion here is that the information about you belongs to
you and doesn't belong to anybody else,'' Goldhaber said. ``And you
can decide when you release it and whether you want to be paid for
it globally or on an ad hoc basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The patents also cover a way of turning conventional
advertising-based publishing on its head. In Goldhaber's patented
Internet publishing system, which he said the company planned to
introduce in coming months, online authors or other creators of
online content would not be paid a set fee by a publisher. Instead,
they would receive a tiny commission from each new reader, who in
turn has been paid to read an accompanying advertisement. Cybergold
would act as a clearinghouse for these transactions, effectively
cutting out the role of a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you get paid to see the ads and then you use that to pay
for the content,'' he said. ``You change the flow of money. But you
don't change the basic setup, which is that advertising supports
publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldhaber contends that these are concepts that empower people
who want to self-publish or consumers who want to compensated for
their time. But he and Gary Fitts, co-founder of Cybergold, are
coming under fire for having patented these ways of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology in
Washington, said he would press Congress to conduct hearings on
Cybergold's patents as well as other so-called business-methods
patents. Love said he disagreed with the idea that Cybergold's
system was novel enough to be patented, contending that he had
written articles on a similar concept back in the 1980s. ``And I
didn't consider myself the inventor then,'' he said. ``This is
typical of the poor quality of review they give at the Patent and
Trademark Office for this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Love described as ``dangerous'' the legal monopoly that these
patents provide, arguing that politicians would likely use such
cash incentives to get potential voters to read their material on
line. ``Suppose one candidate in a given campaign were the only one
to be given a license to the patent,'' he said. ``He would be the
only one who could disseminate information this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldhaber conceded that politicians would probably use the
system, noting that while it was illegal to buy votes, it was not
illegal to pay voters to read political tracts. ``Instead of
offering a drink down at the bar for coming to a rally,'' he said,
``you can offer a buck and let them go down to the bar and buy
their own drink.''
</P>
<P>
   But he argued that Love's concerns were unfounded. ``The
Internet is not just about hackers anymore,'' he said. ``It's about
real business. If patents are valid in other arenas, they ought to
be valid on the Internet as well. People who globally criticize
patents on the Internet are just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cybergold most recently received patent 5,855,008. &QL;

   ANGRY INTERNET JOUSTING OVER SIMULATED WARFARE
</P>
<P>
   Computer programmers were busy spewing vitriol last week on
Slashdot, an Internet site (www.slashdot.org) that proclaims itself
as specializing in ``news for nerds,'' over another Internet
patent.
</P>
<P>
   The patent, assigned to Rtime, of Seattle, covers certain
aspects of playing three-dimensional games on the Internet. One
aspect is a type of real-time data filtering that insures that only
relevant data is distributed to participants. Another is a global
time base that keeps different users synchronized within
milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have two or more people distributed across the
Internet that want to act in real time, you have to resolve slow
performance issues,'' said Chip Overstreet, chief executive of
Rtime, a company with eight full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   Overstreet said the technology was developed by programmers who
helped build the U.S. military's Simnet, a virtual-reality system
used to train soldiers for combat.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those weighing in on Slashdot wondered whether Rtime
would try to extract a licensing fee each time someone tried to
play private sessions of Doom or Quake or other three-dimensional
games over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Overstreet declined to comment specifically on the remarks made
on Slashdot.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Snoswell, a founder of Cyberterm, a software company in
Adelaide, Australia, was one of those who derided the patent on
Slashdot.
</P>
<P>
   But after reading the patent carefully, he said in a telephone
interview, he was less concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animosity over this patent arose because it was seen as
cornering the market,'' he said. ``Initially, when you read the
patent you think it covers everything. But then when you read the
fine print, it looks a lot more narrow. It's not going to become a
generic solution over time. It wouldn't surprise me that this will
fit a niche market. But eventually that niche market will get
smaller and smaller as other technologies crowd it out of the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Patent 5,841,980 was granted to Rolland Waters and John Allred
and was assigned to Rtime.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the music business, it was a harbinger. A Scottish rock
band, the Jesus and Mary Chain, played during last summer's Intel
New York Music Festival, and two hours later their live performance
of ``Virtually Unreal'' was on the Internet for the group's fans
worldwide to download and listen to on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Commercially speaking, it was small potatoes: a technology
demonstration by an alternative-rock band with a devoted following
but not a mass public. Yet the uploading of ``Virtually Unreal''
presaged a day when most recorded music will be available as
digital information, distributed not on discs and tapes that have
to be manufactured and shipped, but as data files that can be
zapped instantly across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Jesus and Mary Chain gained valuable publicity from their
World Wide Web demo. But just as significant, the band and its
label, Sub Pop Records, received not a dime from the thousands of
fans who grabbed the song off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the record industry is worried. It is easy to give
music away on the Internet. In fact, thousands of songs now
circulate freely in a technical format known as MP3, an easy way to
swap recordings, authorized and unauthorized, as computer files
online. The question now facing the music business is how to sell
recordings as profitable pieces of data.
</P>
<P>
   The $12-billion-a-year recording industry is trying to catch up
to the Internet era. Just before Christmas, the major companies
announced what they wanted under their trees for the 1999 holiday
season: a uniform, industrywide standard for digital distribution
of music. And this month, a task force of recording companies,
software programmers and consumer electronics makers intends to
begin work on music's version of the Star Wars missile defense
program.
</P>
<P>
   The project, named the Secure Digital Music Initiative, aims to
make recordings available as pure digital information while letting
only the copyright owners choose how the information can be
disseminated.
</P>
<P>
   It would be, in other words, an attempt by the major recording
labels to stake out retail territory in the one part of the music
business they do not control, even as their power is being
challenged on the Internet by home-recorded musicians, independent
labels and countless mouse-wielding music fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're trying to create here is the structure by which the
content would be labeled in a consistent fashion, to serve whatever
business model emerges in the future,'' said Cary Sherman, a senior
vice president and general counsel for the Recording Industry
Association of America, which represents labels that account for 90
percent of the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   European and Asian recording-industry trade groups support the
initiative, along with hardware and software companies including
Microsoft, IBM, America Online and AT&AMP;T. To avoid antitrust
problems, any standards adopted would be voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Singer, chief technical officer of A2B Music, an AT&AMP;T
unit that produces digital distribution software, acknowledges that
the pressure is mounting. ``Every day that ticks by, there's good
news and there's bad news,'' he said. ``The good news is that the
potential client base for secure digital distribution is growing.
The bad news is that they're also getting used to not paying.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the urgency, some participants predict that the process
could drag on past next Christmas. ``These are all highly charged,
very competitive companies,'' said Gerry Kearby, chief executive of
Liquid Audio, which makes its own software for encoding and playing
back music on the Internet and has already amassed a large catalog
of digitally distributed music. ``We won't be surprised if the
process takes a little longer than announced.''
</P>
<P>
   The labels, of course, are already using the Internet to sell
conventional products _ compact discs and cassettes _ through
online retailers like CD Now, N2K and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   That business is expected to exceed $280 million this year,
according to Jupiter Communications, a new-media research company.
But the Secure Digital Music Initiative is planning for an era when
many consumers will be buying music as downloaded computer files
rather than prerecorded discs and tapes.
</P>
<P>
   With a uniform standard, embodied in computer codes that all the
major recording companies would use, consumers could receive
best-selling music directly through modems and play it back using
one kind of software.
</P>
<P>
   Once the labels agreed on a standard, a fan could jump to a top
band's or a label's Web site, bill the purchase through a credit
card, and download a song or an album, saving it to the computer's
hard drive, recording it onto a CD or transferring it to a memory
chip in a portable player. (One such portable device is already on
the market.)
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the recording company would know where the music was
sent, could specify whether or how often it could be copied, and
could tabulate royalties and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Until such a standard is developed, the labels that own the
rights to recordings by everyone from Madonna to the bluesman
Robert Johnson are unlikely to make their catalogs available for
digital distribution. But while the major labels have hesitated,
many of their holdings are already traveling the Internet as files
compressed into manageable size via MP3.
</P>
<P>
   This software format _ whose name is shortened from an
engineering designation known as MPEG-1, Layer 3 _ makes it
practical to send full songs relatively quickly over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Independent labels and individual musicians have made their
music available in the MP3 format, but the major labels are alarmed
by MP3 because the files can be copied without restriction, even
sent as e-mail. The vast majority of MP3 songs circulate free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians encourage this practice. Others shrug and
tolerate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``MPEGs of my music are all over the network,'' said the rock
songwriter David Bowie. ``Things that are embarrassingly
cringe-making, things that I swore never would see the light of
day, they're completely available.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowie has founded his own Internet service (www.davidbowie.com),
whose members have online access to rare Bowie music and videos. He
said that he was now considering making some new music available
for downloading as MP3 files, but that he had a recording contract
with Virgin Records, which he said was ``ambivalent'' about the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   And Bowie is ambivalent about the industry's Secure Digital
Music Initiative. ``I'm not sure about uniform standards,'' he
said. ``They've never appealed to me. And however much they try and
move in that direction, it ain't going to work. Quirkiness and
decentralization are what define the Internet, and the idea of
trying to formalize it and police it is abhorrent. The Internet is
so volatile and idiosyncratic that whoever tries to police it will
be beaten.''

</P>
<P>
   Seeking Control by Standardization
</P>
<P>
   The recording companies are intent on developing software coding
standards that would specify what consumers can do with the music
they download. Some songs may be available to be copied at will, or
copied once, or not at all; some may be listened to for a day, or a
week, or forever. Other codes would direct royalties to the
appropriate recipients _ a particularly tricky process when the
global Internet meets contracts that change at national borders.
</P>
<P>
   Various pieces of such technology exist, but in an unruly
assortment of incompatible systems. So-called streaming software,
offered by Real Networks (www.real.com) and others, lets music be
heard through the computer like a radio signal, but it is not
stored.
</P>
<P>
   Other software companies like Liquid Audio (www.liquidaudio.com)
and A2B Music (www.a2bmusic.com) do incorporate the kinds of
controls the recording business wants. But the two systems are
incompatible. Other companies, including Audiosoft, are adapting
MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   As they seek technological security, the recording companies
want to avoid costly battles between competing formats, like
Betamax vs. VHS videos or eight-track cartridge tapes vs.
cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anything we achieve will be better than the status
quo,'' Sherman said. ``The status quo is simply fragmentation of
the market. Different technology providers will attempt to
encourage different recording companies to make their content
available by offering different kinds of secure systems that are
incompatible. A consumer would need multiple players, or multiple
devices, in order to hear all of the different artists that they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, for example, songs by the hard-rock guitarist Billy
Squier are available for sale as direct downloads from J-Bird
Records through AT&AMP;T's A2B Music. Fishbone offers a song for sale
through Liquid Audio. Songs by Frank Black, formerly of the
alternative-rock band the Pixies, are for sale as MP3 files sold by
Goodnoise (www.goodnoise.com), which prices its MP3 files at 99
cents for a song and $8.99 for an album.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these three formats requires the listener to have
different software for playback, although Liquid Audio recently
announced it would make the next version of its player software
compatible with MP3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process for the next five or six months is not going to be
pretty,'' said Nicholas DiGiacomo, the senior vice president and
general manager for electronic markets of the consulting firm
Scient, and an adviser to the Recording Industry Association of
America, the trade group. ``But if there's going to be a big
market, they're all going to have to play together.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorization: Now or Never
</P>
<P>
   For now, digital distribution is still impractical for the vast
majority of consumers. Conventional home modems cannot download
information quickly enough to make the process convenient. Even
with a 56-kilobit-a-second modem, downloading a high-fidelity song
takes at least twice the playing time of the song.
</P>
<P>
   But faster computer connections that are already available,
particularly on college campuses, make it possible to send and
receive music almost instantly. And with cable modems as well as
high-speed services from some telephone companies, those faster
connections are becoming available in a growing number of
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do this now, it's a lost opportunity,'' Sherman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unauthorized copying has long worried the music business. When
cassette tapes became popular, the recording-industry association
began lobbying for a royalty on blank tape, as compensation for the
sales believed lost to unauthorized copying.
</P>
<P>
   The Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 levied a 2 percent royalty
on the wholesale price of digital recorders and a 3 percent royalty
on blank digital tapes and discs. Even with those royalties, the
recording companies refused to release prerecorded tapes in the
DAT, or digital audiotape, format, fearing the spread of
high-fidelity digital copies. As a result, DAT is used largely by
musicians and journalists, not in home audio systems.
</P>
<P>
   Labels had refused to release prerecorded DATs to protect the CD
format, which has been a boon for the music business. The CD helped
the gross sales of recorded music grow to $12.2 billion in 1997,
the most recent year for which statistics are available, from $3.8
billion in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But for those worried about copying, the CD turned out to be a
grand strategic error. That is because every CD is a digital master
copy that can be duplicated ad infinitum. Recording and technology
companies, still hammering out the specifications for the new
generation of discs, DVD audio, are hoping to limit the potential
for copying.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, much of the music circulating on the Internet
has been converted directly from CDs to MP3 files, which in turn
can be recorded on CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives predict that a public already used to this free
flow of aural bits may resist the industry's effort to clamp down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I buy into a system that give me less control than I
have now with a CD?'' said Michael Robertson, chief executive of
MP3.com, which makes MP3 songs available from independent musicians
and labels. ``You have to give people more value if you want to
charge the same price, or you have to charge a lower price. All the
talk about security is nonsense. The major labels are circling the
wagons to preserve their current business model, the CD. But
scarcity-based models do not work on the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, digital distribution will have larger implications
for the music business. Well-known musicians, with their
reputations already established, would no longer be as beholden to
the major labels and their manufacturing and distribution
capabilities. More musicians might then follow the example of the
well-traveled songwriter Todd Rundgren, who sells $25 annual
subscriptions to his music, downloadable from his Web site
(www.tr-i.com).
</P>
<P>
   Music would not have to be packaged in the conventional forms of
albums and singles, but could be in any bundle the musicians chose.
And with store shelf space no longer defining the limits of choice,
many more selections could find their way to the market at an array
of prices.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians might also choose to make their songs available free
or cheap, build fan bases, and then make their money touring or
selling merchandise. ``What should we do,'' Bowie mused, ``give the
music away, and sell the T-shirts? Maybe we'll become salarymen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the companies in the music business make their Christmas
deadline or not, the digital clock is ticking. ``The notion that
music could be free is really something we have to contend with,''
Bowie said. ``If not, like King Canute, we're just sitting by the
sea and forbidding it to roll in.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge is expected to decide Monday whether to issue a
preliminary injunction blocking a new federal law meant to shield
children from commercial pornography on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In court last week, the judge, Lowell A. Reed Jr. of federal
District Court in Philadelphia, characterized the ruling as one of
``major importance,'' and few would envy his decision. Critics of
the law say that if it goes into effect, it could force a variety
of Web site operators to choose between self-censorship or prison.
Backers say the law is necessary to prevent commercial sites from
making graphic sexual images available to all visitors, including
children.
</P>
<P>
   The case, in which hearings ended on Wednesday, revolves around
the Child Online Protection Act, which President Clinton signed
into law in October. The law has not gone into effect, blocked by a
restraining order issued by Reed that expires at midnight Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The statute would require operators of commercial Web sites with
sexual content deemed ``harmful to minors'' to block children's
access, verifying age through credit cards or some other way.
Violators face up to six months in prison and $50,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The law is a successor to parts of the Communications Decency
Act, which the Supreme Court overturned, saying it was so broad it
violated the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Backers say this law is more narrowly focused, in part because
it tries to define objectionable material more clearly.
Objectionable sexual content must, among other things, lack
``serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value'' for
those under 17.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also say the statute is aimed at free samples offered
by pornography sites and assert that it seeks not to purge the Web
of adult entertainment, but merely to place it behind childproof
electronic gates.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the most powerful witnesses for the Justice
Department, which is defending the law, made clear on the stand
last week that graphic pornography is readily available. The
witness, C. Damon Hecker, a computer crimes investigator for the
Air Force, presented a report on 10 adult Web sites he found easily
after typing words like ``porn'' or ``xxx'' into search engines
like Yahoo. One typical site included an image of a woman appearing
to masturbate a man. All the images, Hecker told the court, ``I
obtained for free.''
</P>
<P>
   But plaintiff witnesses said they feared the law was worded so
broadly that it would sweep away more than pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell S. Tepper, who runs the Sexual Health Network, a site
with sex information for the disabled, said he feared his candid
material could put his site in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers sought to show that such concerns were
exaggerated, arguing that sites like Tepper's publish material of
social value and thus are not in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Government witnesses also insisted that it would be easy and
relatively inexpensive to put questionable material behind
age-verification screens. But plaintiffs operating free Web sites
said that would do them little good, because their sites were often
supported by advertisers attracted to high-traffic pages. Requests
for information, as required in age-verification forms, would drive
away many surfers and advertisers, they argued.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of 17 groups and businesses, represented by the
American Civil Liberties Union, is challenging the law. The
plaintiffs include an online art site, Artnet.com; Planet Out, a
gay and lesbian online service, and the Internet Content Coalition,
which represents 23 Web publishers, among them MSNBC and The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Barr, editor in chief of CNET, a San Francisco-based
online publisher of news and information about technology, said
that if the law stood, the company would probably omit questionable
material. ``We would choose to self-censor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, ACLU lawyers argued, parents concerned about Web
pornography have an alternative less restrictive than the law, the
use of software that blocks access to certain material.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in Internet law are divided over whether the new law
will survive Reed's scrutiny _ or the almost certain appeals.
</P>
<P>
   David G. Post, an associate professor of law at Temple
University, said that the law suffered from the same flaws as the
old one and that the ``harmful to minors'' language was broad
enough to render it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But Eugene Volokh, who teaches law at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said the new law stood a better chance
in court, in part because it mirrored the language of numerous
state ``harmful to minor'' statutes. &QL;

ON HOCKEY: FROM GRETZKY'S STUBBORNNESS TO THE RANGERS' PLAYOFF
CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE  
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten opinions about the Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   1. For a smart, good-looking, wealthy athlete with a lot of
class and talent, Wayne Gretzky has a real stubborn streak. He
showed it last season when he refused to leave a Rangers game at
Madison Square Garden after his wife was taken to a hospital with a
concussion after being knocked unconscious by a falling pane of
protective glass.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky is again showing his short-sighted side by insisting
that, despite a rib injury, he will play Monday night against
Washington at the Garden. He had to leave last Saturday's 3-2
victory in Detroit because the injury limited his mobility. Monday
night's game will be the fourth in seven days for the Rangers and
the 38-year-old Great One. After the game against the Capitals, the
Rangers will not play again until a game against Mark Messier's
Vancouver Canucks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky is justifiably proud of playing every game in three
seasons with the Rangers and he does not want to disappoint fans
who pay to see him in what might be his last season, his 20th in
the National Hockey League and 21st as a professional. He also is
nearing two milestones _ his 900th goal in the NHL and his 1,071st
goal in the NHL and World Hockey Association combined, including
regular season and playoffs. That will tie Gordie Howe. Gretzky is
eight short of the 900 and one short of 1,071.
</P>
<P>
   But Gretzky and his team might be better off for the stretch run
if he misses one game, rests, recovers and returns a well man.
</P>
<P>
   2. Without a goal in 22 games and only six for the season,
defenseman Brian Leetch is playing with a snarl, and not only the
one caused by the fat lip he got last Saturday night when he
blocked a Steve Yzerman shot.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his two minor penalties last Saturday, Leetch rolled
around the ice in an unpenalized wrestling match with Tomas
Holmstrom. During last Thursday's 3-2 loss in Carolina, Leetch
jousted with Jeff O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   With unrestricted free agency approaching, Leetch was left out
of the all-star game and needs a few goals to sell his skills, not
a career low.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he is probably pressing. But Leetch also is carrying
himself more like a captain this season, growing into the role
around his teammates, his coaches and the news media. There is
nothing wrong with a little passion on the ice from this
cool-blooded veteran. Perhaps, if Coach John Muckler allows him to
free-lance a bit more, Leetch will release the sort of pent-up
scoring binge that can carry his team into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   3. Anybody miss Esa Tikkanen?
</P>
<P>
   4. After Mike Knuble helped the Rangers beat the Wings by
setting up last Saturday's winning goal by Niklas Sundstrom, he was
treated like a celebrity by fans and reporters in Joe Louis Arena,
hard by the Canadian border in downtown Hockeytown.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Ranger right wing, Knuble played with Detroit in the
previous two seasons, when the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup. He
grew up in nearby Grand Rapids, Mich., and played in college for
Red Berenson at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In Knuble's home region, the citizens support the NHL, two major
Junior A teams, two minor professional leagues, extensive youth
programs and one of college hockey's four major conferences. From
it, both Michigan and Michigan State are powerhouses that could
reach the final four.
</P>
<P>
   Knuble said he misses the state of Michigan the way any hockey
person would miss this area, but he is happy that his career path
took him to New York. Instead of playing a backup role for the
Wings, he is a significant Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely happy to be here,'' he said of the Rangers.
``I'm not looking back like, `Gosh, I wish I was still here''' in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   5. Muckler, a smart and experienced coach, usually plays goalie
Mike Richter until he gets fatigued and has a bad game. After such
defeats, Muckler then lets the backup Dan Cloutier play. On last
week's three-game trip, Richter and the team went 2-1 but Richter
was busy. He faced 40 shots last Saturday. Why not rest Richter
Monday night before he has a bad game, saving him instead for
Vancouver on Thursday, while giving Cloutier a deserved start
against Washington?
</P>
<P>
   6. No player with zero goals works harder, skates faster or
takes better shots than Brent Fedyk.
</P>
<P>
   7. One of Muckler's good moves this season has been his handling
of Manny Malhotra, the 18-year-old rookie center. By bringing him
along gradually, Muckler has not exposed Malhotra too early to too
many situations that might overwhelm and discourage him. Seeing
Malhotra's surprising scoring touch in the first half, some coaches
would have succumbed to the temptation to overexpose him. In the
second half, Malhotra is playing more and in important moments.
Last Saturday, when Gretzky could not continue, Malhotra took over
and played well.
</P>
<P>
   8. Yes, even if Pavel Bure scores 30 goals in three months for
Florida, Ranger General Manager Neil Smith was right when he
refused to include Malhotra in his trade offer to Vancouver.
Assuming no catastrophic injuries to either player, Malhotra will
be a star in this league for years after Bure retires. For a
rebuilding team like the Rangers, Malhotra is the better bet.
</P>
<P>
   9. Prediction: The Rangers will squeak into the playoffs and
lose nobly in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   10. According to the league's new and more detailed statistical
sheets, defenseman Ulf Samuelsson had seven hits in Carolina and
six blocked shots in Detroit. He spent last weekend's All-Star Game
break in the Bahamas and it revived him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good,'' Samuelsson said. ``I really enjoyed it,
I feel great and I am ready to battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Leetch and Adam Graves, Samuelsson could become an
unrestricted free agent in July. Unlike Leetch, he and his agent
have not talked with Smith about a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something will happen in summer,'' Samuelsson said. ``If it
happens before that, it will be a pleasant surprise.'' &QL;

<P>
   A fireplace, a room with a view and a world-class ski resort.
What better place for a couple to spend the Valentine's Day
weekend, or any winter weekend for that matter, than at a romantic
ski hotel?
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the best. All packages are double occupancy and
based on February rates.
</P>
<P>
   + The Inn at Lost Creek (119 Lost Creek La., Telluride, Colo.
81435; 888-601-5678) is Telluride's newest luxury hotel. Located in
Mountain Village, the 32-room slopeside inn is made of native stone
and weathered timber. Fireplaces, overstuffed chairs, marble
bathrooms with steam showers and Jacuzzi, kitchenettes and mountain
views give each room a distinct character.
</P>
<P>
   The inn's two newly opened restaurants, ``9545'' and the more
casual ``10 Below,'' are part of Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant
Group, which includes such restaurants as New York's Nobu and
Tribeca Grill. Rates begin at $385 per night.
</P>
<P>
   + In the Lake Tahoe region, the Resort at Squaw Creek (400 Squaw
Creek Rd., Olympic Valley, Calif. 96146; 800-327-3353) is an
imposing glass building artfully tucked into the woods. Inside are
surprisingly warm rooms with a nouvelle Arts &AMP; Crafts feel. There
are views to die for and a private chairlift to access the
challenging slopes of Squaw Valley. Not to mention resort pro Franz
Weber, a world champion speed skier, to supervise guest skiing.
</P>
<P>
   The resort has a full-service spa, heated outdoor pool and
outdoor Jacuzzi for relaxation, as well as five restaurants. Rates
from $300.
</P>
<P>
   + Sundance (RR, Box A1, Sundance, Utah 84604; 800-892-1600) is
actor Robert Redford's Utah retreat at the base of Mount
Timpanogos, the highest peak in the Wasatch Range. Rooms boast pine
interiors, stone fireplaces and rustic furniture. There is rarely a
lift line at Sundance.
</P>
<P>
   After cavorting in the powder, enjoy lunch at Bearclaw Cabin on
top of the mountain, a structure built for the film ``Jeremiah
Johnson.'' There's fine dining at the Tree Room Restaurant,
decorated with native American artifacts and Redford's movie
memorabilia. Rates from $195.
</P>
<P>
   + The Little Nell (675 E. Durant, Aspen, Colo. 81611;
888-843-6355) is perhaps the most quietly elegant ski hotel in the
country. It boasts custom furnishings, marble baths, Frette robes
and the most attentive service imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Located at the base of Aspen Mountain, it's just steps to the
gondola. And under new chef Keith Luce, The Little Nell's
restaurant is one of the shining stars of the West. Rates from
$475.
</P>
<P>
   + The Trapp Family Lodge (42 Trapp Hill Rd., Stowe, Ver. 05672;
800-826-7000) is for cross-country mavens and those who love
rolling Vermont countryside. The 2,200-acre property has been owned
by the ``Sound of Music'' von Trapp family since 1942. Down
comforters and views of the mountains give it an alpine feel.
</P>
<P>
   There are 100 kilometers of cross-country trails, and alpine
skiing at Stowe is minutes away. Rates from $150.
</P>
<P>
   + Skiers heading up to Sugarloaf USA in northern Maine might
want to check out The Herbert (PO Box 67, Kingfield, Maine 04947;
800-THE-HERB). This 32-room Beaux Arts hotel at the edge of the
wilderness is the type of place where a moose head shares the lobby
with a grand piano and fireplace. Antique-filled rooms and fine
dining are hallmarks of this unpretentious and comfortable hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Restored to the tune of $1 million, The Herbert is a classic and
affordable New England getaway for alpine and cross-country skiers.
Rates from $98.
</P>
<P>
   + The Lodge at Vail (174 E. Gore Creek Dr., Vail, Colo. 81657;
800-331-5634) is located slopeside in the heart of Vail village.
Vail's very first luxury hotel has recently been revamped, but it
has retained its European flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, it still serves what is possibly the most bountiful
and lavish buffet breakfast in all of ski country, the perfect
preparation for a day on the slopes. Rates from $440 include
breakfast for two.
</P>
<P>
   + The Post Hotel (PO Box 69, Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, TOL
1E0, 800-661-1586) lies minutes from Lake Louise. This Relais &AMP;
Chateaux member is classic alpine- style, with Canadian pine,
whirlpool tubs and fieldstone fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's restaurant serves some of the finest food in the
Canadian Rockies and the Swiss owners have brought a taste of
Europe at prices that reflect the discounted Canadian dollar. Rates
from $220 Canadian (about $146 U.S.).
</P>
<P>
   + The Ski Tip Lodge (764 Montezuma Rd., Keystone, Colo. 80435;
970-496- 4950) at Keystone Resort is an 1860's stagecoach stop
under the pines that became the first skiers' lodge in the state of
Colorado. Started by Max and Edna Dercum in 1946, there are still
ski tips used for door handles and steel pitons embedded in the
fireplace by an ambitious climber.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are quirky and charming, the food quite possibly the
best in the area. Rates start at $160.
</P>
<P>
   + Spring Creek (PO Box 4780, Jackson, Wyo. 83001; 800-443-6139)
is a rustic retreat with monumental views of the Tetons. Set midway
between the town of Jackson and the Jackson Hole Resort, the log
cabin-style rooms have woodburning fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The Granary restaurant is where to fuel up before a day on the
steep slopes or dancing two-step at the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar.
Rates from $190.

A FUNNY MOVIE-MAD FILM WINS SUNDANCE HONORS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wis., Texas, VIETNAM, JAPAN)   By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ Sunday morning Chris Smith was still wistful
about seeing ``American Movie,'' his small, intimate documentary
about a struggling filmmaker from Milwaukee, being discovered by
the wider world. ``It's like having a family photo album and all of
a sudden somebody wants to buy it from you,'' he said, now that the
film he made with Sarah Price is to be distributed by Sony Pictures
Classics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the subject of the film, Mark Borchardt, was becoming
a local hero in classic Sundance fashion, partying till dawn and
sleeping with his jacket as a makeshift tent (``to keep out the
daylight, man'') on Smith's floor.
</P>
<P>
   Things brightened for both of them Saturday night at the
Sundance Film Festival here when ``American Movie'' won the Grand
Jury Prize in this year's documentary competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to feel that people got the film,'' said Smith, who
had never won even a filmmaking grant and who ``never believed that
when you're up against films about social issues, a funny film
about a guy scraping by in Milwaukee could possibly get any
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   As for how this would affect Borchardt's own hopes for a
directing career, he said: ``I'm still going to try to borrow money
off my dad. Otherwise you get stuck having to use somebody's
actress girlfriend in your movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Top honors in the dramatic competition went to Tony Bui's
``Three Seasons,'' a delicately beautiful film about changing
Vietnamese society, more impressive for its pensive visual style
than for its slow-moving and sometimes familiar narrative. ``Three
Seasons'' also won an Audience Award and a cinematography prize for
Lisa Rinzler.
</P>
<P>
   The prize for documentary cinematography was also won by a
woman, Emiko Mori, who shot her own film, ``Rabbit in the Moon,''
about the lingering effects of internment camps on
Japanese-Americans during World War II. She also shot ``Regret to
Inform,'' Barbara Sonneborn's documentary about American and
Vietnamese women widowed by the Vietnam War. Ms. Sonneborn won the
best-directing prize for a documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-one years ago my young husband was killed in the war in
Vietnam,'' Ms. Sonneborn wrote in a letter. ``On the 20th
anniversary of his death, 11 years ago, I felt compelled to make a
film using the Vietnam War and my own experience, along with that
of other widows from both sides of the conflict, to speak to the
enormous issue of the ultimate futility of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The only actor to win a prize this year was Steve Zahn, who
received what was called a Special Jury Award for Comedic
Performance. This was essentially the Audience in Stitches Award,
since Zahn's turn as a glowering, dimwitted escaped convict who
winds up coaching little girls for a beauty pageant in ``Happy,
Texas'' was the funniest sight in Utah last week.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Shine,'' ``Happy, Texas'' was bitterly fought over by
distributors (it wound up with Miramax), and owes its popularity to
a genial commercial style that could fit comfortably at any
middle-American mall.
</P>
<P>
   With a preponderance of similarly polished, conventional films
here this year, the jury chose Eric Mendelsohn as best director for
``Judy Berlin,'' a drama that does its ponderous best to create a
meaningful, black-and-white epiphany on Long Island during an
eclipse. Another relatively experimental film, ``Treasure Island,''
won what was called a prize for Distinctive Vision.
</P>
<P>
   The Waldo Salt screenwriting prize was shared by the actor Frank
Whalley, who directed ``Joe the King,'' about a boy with a tough
family life during the 1970s, and Audrey Wells for ``Tumbleweeds,''
a mother-daughter road movie set in the South, starring Janet
McTeer.
</P>
<P>
   Other prizes included a Freedom of Expression Award for ``The
Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords''; the documentary filmmakers'
trophy for ``Sing Faster: The Stagehands' `Ring Cycle' ,'' which
goes backstage at the San Francisco Opera, and a special Jury Award
to ``On the Ropes,'' about three struggling young boxers. ``More''
and ``Fishbelly White'' were the prizewinning shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The Audience Award for a documentary went to ``Genghis Blues,''
which features Tuvan throat singing. An Audience Award for World
Cinema was shared by ``Run Lola Run,'' a hot-wired German hit
custom made for the 21st century, and ``Train of Life,'' a
Holocaust tragicomedy with shades of ``Fiddler on the Roof.'' Latin
American Cinema winners were ``Santitos'' and ``Life Is to
Whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the most popular film in Park City is once again ``I Know
What You Did Last Winter,'' a video available in ski stores.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAOLIN, China _ ``He was just an honest farmer,'' said the widow
of Zhang Huangli, speaking bitterly in her dirt-floor farmhouse
about the death of her husband on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, here among the rice paddies and scraggly pine
groves of Hunan Province, thousands of farmers _ more than 10,000,
participants claim _ streamed from the surrounding hills to the
government office in Daolin, a town of a few thousand. They came to
demand an end to what they consider excessive taxes and corruption
by the local Communist Party officials who rule over them.
</P>
<P>
   But the rally, possibly one of the largest farmer protests in
China in recent years, was quickly crushed. Zhang was killed by an
exploding tear-gas canister fired by riot police. Scores more
people were wounded by the gas or by clubs, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen people were detained for one or two days, a participant
said in an interview here, and four leaders of the protest escaped
arrest and have been sought ever since, with reward posters
plastered on village walls by police and torn down by angry
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, called by a two-year-old illegal organization of
local farmers, was one of many similar protests that have erupted
in rural areas around the country. Like most others, it was
completely unreported in the Chinese media, and rural protesters
have rarely had a chance to describe their grievances directly to
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the ire of unpaid urban workers, boiling resentment
in the countryside is a major source of the social instability that
has recently preoccupied China's leaders. The rampant discontent
seems less to reflect any new crisis than it does the slow grinding
down of farmers who have long been known for their ability to ``eat
bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   But multiplied across rural China, where two-thirds of the
country's people still live, the alienation of farmers _ whom Mao
Tse-tung once called ``the main force in the revolution'' _ poses a
long-term challenge to Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   The simmering conflict in Hunan is a particular embarrassment
for the party because Hunan is the birthplace of Mao and other top
leaders, including the current prime minister, Zhu Rongzhi.
</P>
<P>
   Adding further to the sense of disorder, in the last month Hunan
was also the site of two unsolved bombings _ one on a bus in the
provincial capital of Changsha that wounded 37 and the other in the
southern town of Yizhang that killed eight. But no evidence has
surfaced to link those events to farmer or worker protests.
</P>
<P>
   Daolin township, an administrative area of some 50,000 people
scattered in many villages, is neither poor nor rich by the
standards of rural China, where families squeeze out two rice crops
a year on small plots of land.
</P>
<P>
   Candid conversations with numerous farmers across the angry
township suggest that resentment of local party and government
officials is pervasive, linked to the multitude of taxes they levy
and a sense that the officials fritter the money away with
extravagant ``wining and dining.'' So general is the antipathy that
local police have not dared to enter the villages to arrest wanted
protest organizers, and large rewards posted for their capture have
yielded no takers.
</P>
<P>
   The national leaders have acknowledged the threat to the party.
President Jiang Zemin, Zhu and others constantly rail against
arbitrary taxes and against corruption both petty and grand. The
party has also promoted elections of village leaders, intended to
vent discontent and root out venal or incompetent cadres.
</P>
<P>
   But an afternoon with farmers in Hunan suggests that here at
least, hostility toward local party and government officials
remains high, though farmers seem to retain some faith in top
national leaders. The farmers, most of whom took part in the Jan. 8
demonstration, spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Several said essentially the same thing: ``The officials just
help one another, and the corrupt ones just get moved on to new
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In several telephone calls to Daolin township offices, officials
refused to comment on the Jan. 8 confrontation or the farmers'
charges.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, concerned farmers from several villages of
Daolin formed an organization, said a man who was involved, who for
fear of arrest would not allow his name to be used. Similar groups
have been formed in at least four of the 12 other townships in the
surrounding county of Ningxiang, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Daolin group was spearheaded by a man named Yang Yaojin,
farmers said, who is now wanted by local police.
</P>
<P>
   The group adopted an intentionally innocuous name: Volunteers
for Publicity of Policies and Regulations. The name was a sly one,
reflecting the farmers' basic complaint and their strategy, which
is to praise national officials and paint local ones as violators.
The central government, the involved man noted, has a policy that
taxes on farmers should not exceed 5 percent of their previous
year's income.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had found that the policies of local cadres ran counter to
those of the provincial and central governments,'' said the man.
The farmers charge that township and county officials have inflated
the incomes of local villagers in their records, so they can levy
higher taxes without seeming to violate the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The real per capita income in Daolin in 1998 was 1,400 yuan, or
about $170, the man said, but officials claimed that it was 2,400
yuan, about $290.
</P>
<P>
   With the outrage of angry taxpayers anywhere, farmers said they
had counted 15 different fees levied by the township alone. They
include a $1.50 fee for every pig slaughtered _ and, farmers said
indignantly, every family is charged the slaughter tax once a year
even if it has no pigs. A fee is collected for production of
``special products'' like nuts, even when none are grown, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are fees for animal inoculations, for school, for permits
to get married or to have a baby. Then, the farmers said, there are
special levies for projects like power plants and schools.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a result, instead of paying the legal total taxes of $8 a
person per year, local farmers ended up paying $15 a person, plus
special levies. This may not seem like much to outsiders, but the
farmers described the extra amount as a real burden on their meager
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists in China and abroad have suggested that the
official limit on rural taxes of 5 percent of income is too low,
making it impossible for local governments to carry out needed
development projects and putting local officials in an impossible
bind.
</P>
<P>
   Those who took part in the protest here said they could stomach
the extra fees if they yielded benefits, but instead they just felt
exploited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special fund raising should be used for special projects, but
the money has been wasted by the wining and dining of township
officials,'' one farmer said. ``They raised the money for this, for
that, but they didn't start any projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the man involved in the farmer organization said,
they held a large, peaceful demonstration in Daolin that prompted
officials to reduce school fees.
</P>
<P>
   Before the next rally, the one that ended in violence a few
weeks ago, the organization put up posters all over the township.
One, reflecting the strategy of appealing to the higher
authorities, said, ``Resolutely Unite Around the Center of the
Communist Party headed by President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister
Zhu Rongji.'' Another called on residents to rally at the township
headquarters on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, thousands of farmers gathered in Daolin town to
find themselves facing hundreds of armed policemen and a special
riot squad from the provincial capital of Changsha, some 30 miles
away, with masks and shields, batons and tear gas. Before the farm
leaders had given their speeches, as the crowd surged and jostled
near the headquarters entrance, police told people to leave and
then lobbed several tear gas canisters, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   One exploded against the leg of Zhang Huangli, said his widow,
Wen Xiuqing, who recalled the event in her house of mud bricks as
dozens of agitated relatives crowded around. She insisted that her
husband had been an innocent bystander.
</P>
<P>
   Badly wounded, Zhang lay without help for half an hour in a
spreading pool of blood, Ms. Wen said. She saw him only as the
crowd cleared, and then, she recalled, ``I knelt by him, crying for
help.'' When a nephew tried to move him, he was clubbed and
detained for the day, she charged.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang was finally taken to a local hospital, then transferred
twice to larger ones. But later that day, in shock from losing so
much blood, he died, the only fatality in the confrontation. Ms.
Wen was given $7,260 in compensation by the authorities, she said,
but she had to spend two-thirds of that on the kind of elaborate
funeral that is expected in their clan.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers cling to the hope that the higher authorities will
side with them if only they learn the truth. Yang and two other
leaders slipped away to Beijing, the man said, and are believed to
be there now, trying to petition the State Council and other
offices, and to attract the interest of a nationally known
investigative television program. The fourth wanted leader remains
sheltered by fellow farmers in the township.
</P>
<P>
   In the villages of Daolin, farmers said they hoped that the
central or provincial governments would send a task force to
examine the policies and behavior of successive Communist Party
secretaries and township directors.
</P>
<P>
   Daolin farmers have taken part in the new-style elections for
village leaders that China touts as bringing democracy to the
countryside, but to little effect, the farmers said, because the
elections are controlled by the Communist Party and because the
real power over their lives comes from the next levels up, at the
township and the county.
</P>
<P>
   Even for the village posts, farmers said, the candidates are
selected by the Communist Party, and then the votes are counted
secretly ``in a very small room,'' as one put it. It was
inconceivable, they said, that an activist with the farmer
organization could run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be much better if we could directly elect the
township and county leaders, in a really democratic manner,'' a
farmer said. ``But this seems impossible.''

ANALYSIS: CRIMINAL CHARGE MIGHT RESOLVE AN ELUSIVE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LEWINSKY, IMPEACH-REPUBS) 
(lb) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, will be
moving into uncharted waters if he decides to bring a criminal case
against President Clinton before the president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of whether a sitting president can be subject to
criminal prosecution, the Constitution's text is ambiguous, the
evidence of the framers' original intent is equivocal and the
Supreme Court, in inviting briefs but then not deciding the issue
in the case of the Nixon tapes 25 years ago, has remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   So if Starr does decide to charge the president with perjury or
obstruction of justice, charges that are the foundation of the two
articles of impeachment now before the Senate, he may not get a
conviction but he could very well bring about the definitive
resolution of this elusive issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr's advisers have reportedly told him there are no
constitutional barriers in the way, this is not the majority view.
Most legal scholars and historians believe that the president,
alone among all the ``civil officers'' subject to impeachment,
cannot be prosecuted until he is no longer in office, either
through the expiration of his term or following automatic removal
after conviction by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This view, expressed during the Watergate era by such scholars
as Philip Kurland and Alexander Bickel, among the leading
conservative legal thinkers of their day, is based on the structure
of the government, including the constitutional separation of
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since prosecution is an executive-branch function and the
president not only heads but in a sense embodies the executive
branch, ``it is hardly reasonable or sensible to consider the
president subject to such prosecutions,'' as James St. Clair told
the Supreme Court in a brief for President Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   It is something of a historical irony, in fact, that this theory
of the ``unitary executive,'' which Starr and his allies have
evidently discarded as a basis for thinking about the question, has
always held much more appeal for conservatives than for liberals.
It was the theoretical basis for the Reagan administration's
unsuccessful attack on the independent-counsel law in a 1988
Supreme Court case, Morrison vs. Olson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our central objection is that this statute strips the
president of a purely executive function _ criminal prosecution,
and criminal prosecution in an important class of cases _ and
lodges that function in one almost wholly untethered to the
president,'' Charles Fried, the Reagan administration's solicitor
general, told the justices in arguing that the independent-counsel
law was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   He also told the court that the proper mechanism for checking
abuse by the executive branch was the ``long, deep shadow of
Congress' power of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Robert Bork, as the Nixon administration's solicitor
general, had concluded that while a sitting vice president _ Spiro
Agnew, who pleaded no contest to tax-evasion charges _ could be
prosecuted, the president could not be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   And though Leon Jaworski, the Watergate special prosecutor
during the Nixon tapes case, was advised by lawyers on his staff
that he could seek an indictment of Nixon, he rejected the advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fellows are still law clerks,'' he said of the young
lawyers on his staff, according to a 1977 account by James Doyle,
one of Jaworski's assistants. ``All they know is casebooks. This is
the real world,'' Doyle quoted the prosecutor as having said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think that a trial of a sitting president would be
unconstitutional do not necessarily raise the same objection to
another option that confronts Starr, namely indicting Clinton now
but not attempting to put him on trial before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   A sealed indictment, the existence of which would not be
disclosed until then, does not pose the same threat of disruption
and, in a practical sense, puts the president in little more peril
than if the indictment were not returned until he left office, some
constitutional experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Michael McConnell, a professor of constitutional
law at the University of Utah, believes that the constitutional
text and structure both argue against prosecuting a sitting
president. But ``I don't see anything wrong'' with obtaining an
indictment for a later prosecution, he said in an interview. He
added, however, that ``the bottom line is, nobody knows'' about the
constitutionality of either course of action.
</P>
<P>
   The relevant constitutional language is found in Article I,
section 3: ``Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend
further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold
and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United
States; but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and
subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Read one way, those words appear to indicate that impeachment
must come first, with criminal prosecution following conviction and
removal from office through the impeachment process. Read another
way, the text imposes no such requirement but simply makes clear
that conviction on impeachment charges would not be a bar, on
grounds of double jeopardy, to a subsequent prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eric Freedman of Hofstra University School of Law,
who published an extensive study in 1992 on the history of the
impeachment clause, the Constitution's framers and their
contemporaries reached no agreement on whether impeachment was the
exclusive means of acting against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many delegates to the state ratifying conventions believed
that the president could be indicted while in office, while
numerous others held the contrary view,'' Freedman wrote in a
68-page article laden with footnoted quotations from members of the
``founding generation'' who held opposite views.
</P>
<P>
   However, Freedman concluded that historical practice has in fact
ratified the view that officials subject to impeachment may also be
prosecuted while in office.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution of sitting judges has never been seriously
challenged, he noted, and many of the judges who have been
impeached and removed were convicted first of criminal offenses
(although one, Alcee Hastings, now a member of Congress from
Florida, was tried and acquitted while he was a sitting federal
judge, and was impeached and removed from the bench anyway).
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's answer to the question before it in the
Paula Jones case _ whether an incumbent president must stand trial
in a private, civil lawsuit based on allegations of misconduct
before he took office _ bears only a superficial relevance to the
question now before Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting Clinton's claim of temporary immunity, the court
analyzed the Paula Jones case as raising the question of whether
the federal courts could exercise their ``core'' jurisdiction to
hear a dispute in which one party happened to be the president.
</P>
<P>
   The decision did not disturb a 1982 precedent, Nixon vs.
Fitzgerald, in which the court gave presidents, both incumbent and
former, complete immunity from civil liability for official actions
while in office.
</P>
<P>
   And because the Paula Jones lawsuit was not a criminal case, the
court had no occasion to address the profound separation-of-powers
question that has hovered for many months around Starr's activities
and which may now be rising, inevitably and inexorably, to the
surface.

 &HT;    Clinton Budget Will Challenge GOP
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All but drowned out by Monday's impeachment din
will be the thud of President Clinton's $1.8 trillion budget
proposal landing on the Capitol's back doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The echoes from the budget document, however, will likely
resonate much further across the political landscape than whatever
Monica Lewinsky is ready to tell her Senate inquisitors.
</P>
<P>
   For, at its base, Clinton's year-2000 budget is a brash act of
defiance, the impeached yet emboldened Democrat challenging the
majority but momentum-starved Republicans to abandon any hope of
broad-based tax cuts for much of what's left of their political
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton proposes to usher in the politics of plenty by
bottling up some $4.4 trillion in anticipated budget surpluses over
the next 15 years, and dedicating nearly every penny of it to
shoring up Social Security and Medicare and creating subsidized
savings accounts that target low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have already said they're not buying the full
blueprint. Party leaders have called for across-the-board cuts in
individual income taxes, the single largest source of all federal
revenues ranging from 10 percent to 14 percent over the coming
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget, though, contains a shrewd counter-parry that
promises to be tough for fiscal conservatives to combat.
</P>
<P>
   His plan would transfer more than $2 trillion of the $5.5
trillion federal debt from publicly held obligations _ those the
government owes to banks and private investors _ to government
accounts, money the government essentially pays back to itself. By
reducing publicly held debt, taxpayers could save hundreds of
billions of dollars in interest payments over time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in other words, has laid out a plan to address, in a
single blow, two of the most fearsome economic and social dragons
of the era: the aging of the country's workforce and the massive
debt hangover from a generation of fiscal gluttony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will pay down the debt, and lift the burden of much of the
long-term retirement deficit of the next generation,'' White House
economic adviser Gene Sperling said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Clinton's scheme actually solves neither problem, as, when
pressed, Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not saving Social Security,'' said Robert Bixby, policy
director for the Concord Coalition, a Washington think tank that
specializes on budget issues.
</P>
<P>
   And, while Clinton's plan would reduce the publicly held portion
of the federal debt, it would do little to reduce the overall gross
federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're sort of shifting it from one hand to the other,'' said
Bixby. ``We'll still have to pay it at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan could, however, head off a raid on the surplus by
instituting a mechanism that Sperling calls ``a debt-reduction lock
box.'' It would protect future surpluses as much from liberal
spending as from conservative tax-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, by proposing to at least confront both the debt
and the Social Security ills, Clinton has clearly tantalized the
public. Americans have watched him perform so much political
alchemy over the past 13 months, who could blame them from standing
back from the budget debate he's so cleverly framed and simply
waiting for the magic to unfold?
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee is
not to make drastic cuts in benefits, not to raise payroll tax
rates,'' Clinton assured the public two weeks ago, dismissing with
a rhetorical flourish what is actually one of the thorniest
political trade-offs the current generation faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead,'' Clinton said during his Jan. 19 State of the Union
address, ``I propose that we make an historic decision to invest
the surplus to save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The details behind that vision will be unveiled today, when
Clinton sends his annual budget recommendations to Capitol Hill,
this time for fiscal 2000, the year beginning Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   This year's proposals are expected to amount to nearly $1.8
trillion in taxing and spending, a record high. At first blush,
it's a blow to those who embraced Clinton's 1996 campaign promise
that ``the era of big government is over.''
</P>
<P>
   As a percentage of the national economy, however, the federal
government has been shrinking dramatically under Clinton's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Government spending last year accounted for one out of every
five dollars of American economic activity, the lowest level since
1974. This year the figure will be even lower.
</P>
<P>
   Federal budgets keep rising, naturally, but not as fast as the
economy, which has been expanding for nearly eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The dazzling economic growth has combined with a modicum of
bipartisan budget discipline to end nearly 30 years of federal
budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the government took in $70 billion more than it
spent, the first time Washington has balanced its books since 1969.
This year's surplus is expected to top $127 billion, the
Congressional Budget Office estimates.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy continues to grow by an inflation-adjusted 2
percent, its averaged 3.7 percent growth for the past three years'
budget surpluses should total some $4.4 trillion over the next 15
years, according to Clinton's Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   One man's surplus, however, is another's overcharge. Many
Republicans contend that the money should be returned to American
workers and corporations in the form of a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   At least as popular as tax cuts, though _ especially among aging
baby boomers _ is Social Security, the massive government
retirement insurance program that provides monthly benefit checks
to one in six Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is on track to begin losing money in 2013 and to
run out completely by 2032 unless Congress votes to trim benefits
or hike premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget proposes another alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicating $2.7 trillion of the surplus over the next 15 years
to Social Security would make the program solvent until 2055,
Clinton contends.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's plan, roughly $500 billion of the set-aside
money would be invested in stocks, an attempt to secure the
blessings, and the risks, of Wall Street's performance.
</P>
<P>
   The other $2.2 trillion would go into the Social Security trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the trust fund must hold federal debt _ U.S. Treasury
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, under Clinton's plan, the Social Security trust
fund would buy $2.2 trillion of Treasury bonds, the Treasury would
use that money to pay off government debt now owed to banks and
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Years down the road, as the government paid back the trust fund,
those payments would help fund beneficiary checks to Social
Security recipients.
</P>
<P>
   And interest on the debt, which last year amounted to $243
billion _ one-third of it paid to overseas banks _ would shift from
a taxpayer burden to an accounting exercise for government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the government out of the borrowing business, moreover,
would exert downward pressure on interest rates, making it easier
for consumers and businesses to borrow money and pay back their
loans, adding even more impetus to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even if nothing were done to the budget and Clinton's bold plans
were dashed, all of these benefits would accrue naturally to the
budget picture as the result of economic expansion, the
Congressional Budget Office projects.

   TEEN-DRIVE _ ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ Wanda Coates, the registrar at
the 1,225-student high school in this western N.C. mountain
community, has one tough duty ahead of her this week. She must sort
through the grades of all ninth- and 10th-graders, siphoning off
those who failed two or more courses, to send letters telling them
they've lost their driver's license. Last year, the N.C.
Legislature tied driving privileges to school performance. The
first grading period since then has just ended, with some 30,000
students expected to lose their license this month, according to
Artie Kamiya, who is overseeing the project for the N.C. Department
of Instruction. In all, 17 states tie school attendance to driving
privileges, but only a few add the extra provision of maintaining
good grades. In Georgia, the state can yank a license if students
are suspended from school for violence, drug or alcohol use on
school grounds or for having a weapon at school. It does not punish
dropouts or those with poor grades. (Riddle, Atlanta

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A slow-moving disturbance will cause rain to spread gradually
from the eastern Ohio Valley to the Middle Atlantic States. The
precipitation will begin as an icy mixture near the Appalachians
from western Virginia to southwestern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, heavy showers and a few potent thunderstorms will
develop from northern and central Florida to the Carolinas as
onshore winds increase. In the wake of the disturbance, patchy
light showers will linger over the western Ohio and Tennessee River
valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will be plentiful near the northeast coast as high
pressure remains strong over the region. After a very cold dawn,
afternoon temperatures will be near or a few degrees above seasonal
levels. Sunshine will yield to clouds later Monday over the
interior sections as moisture spreads northeast from the Middle
Atlantic States.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will precede a frontal system as it moves east
from the Dakotas. Patchy snow and ice will occur from the northern
Missouri Valley to the western Great Lakes. A few light rain
showers will dampen areas from the central Mississippi Valley to
the central Plains. Late Monday and Monday night, a period of snow
will develop from eastern Kansas to northern Missouri as a
jet-stream disturbance moves overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered coastal showers and mountain snow will persist over
western Oregon and Washington. Overnight, rain and mountain snow
will become heavier as a new disturbance approaches from the Gulf
of Alaska. Elsewhere in the West, patchy snow will dust the central
Rockies while the Southwest is sunny and seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Weather Folklore
</P>
<P>
   Not all weather folklore is created equal. Early Tuesday, a
famous bit of folklore will be celebrated as a groundhog named Phil
is pulled from a burrow in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Should the
animal cast a shadow, his handlers will proclaim that six more
weeks of winter will follow. While this charming folklore has
nothing to support it scientifically, much weather lore has a valid
foundation. Many of the weather rhymes that have been passed down
through generations began when careful observers of the sky related
what they saw to the typical weather patterns that followed.

   ABORTION-SPEECH (Seattle) _ Physician Suzanne Poppema's name
appeared on the list of ``baby butchers'' the week after Dr.
Barnett Slepian was shot to death in his New York home. Hours after
his death, a line was drawn through his name on the list, which is
in a web site known as the ``Nuremberg Files.'' The line signaled
that Slepian was dead. ``Now that was chilling,'' said Poppema, who
performs abortions and has never made any secret of it. Whether the
web site and other anti-abortion material constitute a hit list or
protected free speech is now the question a federal court jury in
Portland, Ore., must answer. The jury will begin its fourth day of
deliberations Monday.

<P>
   ARMENIA, Colombia _ Standing on the threshold of the tiny blue
house she calls home, Isabel Cristina Marquez, open-mouthed and
wide-eyed, looks around, surveying the damage. ``We've lost our
home,'' she quickly concludes and, softly, begins to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marquez, a 28-year-old waitress from Elmhurst, N.Y., has
been crying every day since last Monday afternoon, when a powerful
earthquake rocked this city. She was born here and lived here all
her life before migrating to New York with her daughter two and a
half years ago. Her parents and a brother had left earlier and live
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marquez left behind a sprawling family that includes her
77-year-old grandmother, her older sister, about 60 cousins, uncles
and aunts and her husband, Farid Lasso, 29, who is waiting for a
visa to follow her.
</P>
<P>
   Behind, too, remained her memories and her soul, Ms. Marquez
says. Still, as she roams the streets of her town searching for
relatives and old friends, she looks a little out of place, with
her fake long nails painted a New York black, a New York Yankees
World Series Champions T-shirt, white platform sneakers and a red
sweater tied at the waist.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the tens of thousands of Colombian immigrants who
live in the New York region, Ms. Marquez leads a split life. She
lives here and there, dividing her time evenly between the
harshness of her life in New York City _ holding down two jobs,
struggling with a foreign language and barely getting through the
winter _ and the dreamy quality of her life here _ outings to lush
mountains laced with coffee plantations, lazy afternoons at her
grandmother's house and plenty of heat and sun.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake, she sensed when she watched the first news
reports last Monday from her apartment in New York and saw the
devastation here, would forever alter the rhythm of her life. The
landscape of her memories, she feared, was forever lost. And so it
was with great trepidation and a measure of hope that she arrived
at Kennedy International Airport last Thursday at dawn, lugging a
95-pound black bag stuffed with food and medicine, and boarded a
plane home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dreading this trip and, at the same time, I can't wait to
get there,'' she said as her journey began. ``Who knows what I'll
find?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marquez's quandary resonated with many of the passengers in
her flight _ Colombians from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and
several Hudson River towns who, frantic with worry, had hastily
left their jobs and their families to head home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't slept in three days,'' said Jairo Lopez, 43, who
owns a car dealership in Flushing, N.Y., and had not heard from his
two younger brothers who live here. ``My mission is to find them.''
</P>
<P>
   The same mission guided Diego Ramirez, 34, who has lived in
Morristown, N.J., for the past 13 years and came looking for his
father and five siblings in Armenia and nearby Montenegro. About
5,000 people from Montenegro, a tiny town eight miles from here,
live in Morristown. The connection between the two towns is such
that about 20 people from Morristown have already descended in
Montenegro; six are working as volunteers, distributing food and
resettling the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew in New Jersey was that there were a lot dead and
injured and homeless people,'' said Ramirez, who is a construction
foreman but is working in Montenegro as a firefighter. ``By
Wednesday I couldn't take it anymore, so here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marquez, too, had not heard from her family until hours
before she boarded the Avianca flight for Bogota. Her sister
borrowed a cellular phone and called her Wednesday night, two days
after the earthquake, to tell her that both she and their
grandmother had lost their homes and were living with relatives in
the north side of town, an area that escaped the quake's force. By
then, Ms. Marquez already held a ticket, paid by her boss at La
Pequena Colombia, a popular restaurant, and decided to come anyway.
</P>
<P>
   During the flight from New York, Ms. Marquez hardly spoke. As
the plane began its descent into Bogota, she took a piece of paper
from her date book and began to take notes: ``No one knows that the
despair I feel in my heart and the impotency I feel make me not
want to see my city and my own family,'' she wrote. ``I only ask
God to give me strength to confront this new reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality was indeed grim. The earthquake, which measured 6.0
on the Richter scale, is the worst to hit this area in more than
100 years. It hit at 1:15 p.m., when many people were home having
lunch. The authorities have said that it killed about 1,000 people,
but even Saturday, almost a week after the quake, rescue workers
continued to search for victims. About 35,000 families, or 180,000
people, were left homeless, the Colombian Red Cross has announced.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia, known as the city of miracles because it became
prosperous shortly after it was founded just over 100 years ago,
has ceased to be the city Ms. Marquez knew. In fact it is no longer
a city. In its place, Ms. Marquez found a lawless town, where
looters terrorized homeless families, chunks of plaster hung
precariously from cracked facades and red bricks littered the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere she looked, there were men with weapons _ young
soldiers carrying powerful guns and regular people brandishing
machetes and knives. People were searching the rubble for family
pictures and important papers, children with dirty faces and no
shoes were darting in front of cars hoping for a piece of bread or
a candy bar. Entire families were seeking shelter under plastic
tents held up by sticks of guadua, the hardy bamboo-like wood of a
bush that grows wild here.
</P>
<P>
   And then, suddenly, as her taxi was about to turn a corner, Ms.
Marquez saw her sister, Dora Liliana Marquez, standing on the
street, a blue paper mask covering her mouth to protect her from
the fetid odor of the dead and the acrid smell of tear gas. Ms.
Marquez leaped from the car and hugged her sister, the two sobbing
uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ay, que pesar, que pesar,'' they both repeated. (``Oh, how
sad, how sad.'')
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Not far from where the sisters met, the scene repeated itself at
the family home of John Bukvic, a grave digger from Flushing, N.Y.,
who came to this city in the same flight as Ms. Marquez to see his
parents and younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   He found them at home, safe and happy that their house had
withstood the earthquake, but cowed by the horde of vandals
breaking into homes at random. Bukvic, who has lived in New York
for 15 years, went out and bought a gun and helped the neighbors
organize a committee of vigilantes to protect what was left of
their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what you have to do,'' Bukvic, 37, said. ``I'm thinking
of taking them to another city.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marquez could not possibly move her family away herself; it
is too large. Instead, she did the only thing she could. She went
from house to house, comforting relatives and distributing black
garbage bags she had brought from New York full of canned food and
bread and sanitary napkins and blankets.
</P>
<P>
   She was also keeping a mental log of the losses: Dora Liliana,
her 30-year-old sister, lost the apartment she and her husband were
about to finish paying for this year. They have no insurance. Her
father's brother, Hugo Marquez, lost his home, which he rented from
Ms. Marquez's father. Her mother's sister in Montenegro lost their
home, too. All were hungry, thirsty and frazzled, but thankful to
be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I did yesterday?'' Dora Liliana tells her
sister, clutching a sandwich Ms. Marquez brought for her. ``What I
never thought I would. I ran after a truck for a piece of bread.''
She blushes and smiles, embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   At her grandmother's home, Ms. Marquez lost her composure. This
is the house where Ms. Marquez was born and lived as a little girl.
The house, built by her grandmother's grandparents, is still
standing, but only barely. The back walls are separated from the
floor and the side walls remain attached only by some quirk of
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The room where Ms. Marquez slept is no longer reachable, its
entrance blocked by the heavy furniture that shifted during the
quake. Pots and pans clutter the floor. A cup of coffee still sits
on a table, exactly where the family left it before leaving the
house to go to the doctor, a few hours before the earthquake hit. A
doll rests on a mattress, headless, and a picture of the Sacred
Heart is upside down, but still hanging from a nail on the wall.
Half a dozen fish swim in a tank, undisturbed. The white curtains
in the bedroom window flow freely in the breeze; there are no glass
panes to hold them back.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marquez touches the walls tentatively; she is too stunned to
talk. She leaves the house, holding on to her husband, but finds no
respite outside.
</P>
<P>
   The school she went to as a little girl was destroyed, so were
her middle school and her high school. There was nothing but the
outer walls left of the supermarket where she used to work. The
street where she took walks with her husband during their
courtship, a wide avenue formerly cluttered with shops and
restaurants, was demolished. The theater was gone and so were her
favorite restaurant; a bar called Babalu, a neighborhood hang out;
and the Church of the Sacred Heart, where she was married.
</P>
<P>
   Across the church, where a five-story building called Andalucia
used to be, rescue workers were working around the clock to pull
bodies from the rubble. Neighbors said that 25 people had already
been found, all dead. Ms. Marquez stood there last Friday,
listening to a father tell the story of how he was waiting for the
body of his 21-year-old son, who had been working at the family's
electronics repair shop on the first floor when the building
collapsed. He was surrounded by his wife and three daughter, ages
9, 15 and 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting him at home to have lunch and he never
showed,'' Eider Echeverri, 43, said. ``They have already found the
motorcycle he used for the deliveries, so I know he is in there,
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ms. Marquez found out, the body had been found and Mr.
Echeverri had taken his boy home in a plastic bag provided by the
church's priest.
</P>
<P>
   In Plaza Bolivar, the one place that Ms. Marquez prayed had not
been destroyed, she stood next to her husband, who lives elsewhere
and was not affected by the quake, in a silent tribute to a friend
who was killed in an apartment across the street. The plaza, the
city's heart, was unharmed, but the buildings that surrounded it,
including city hall, had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marquez returned to Armenia last Saturday to help her sister
move to another town. At the sight of her sister's furniture at the
side of the road, Ms. Marquez began to cry again. She left soon
thereafter. Ms. Marquez said she was heart broken. All but a
handful of her relatives have left for other towns. Ms. Marquez
left Sunday for her husband's apartment in Cali, about three hours
from here, where she plans to stay for a few more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   She does not plan to return to her hometown for now. ``There is
nothing to go back to,'' she said. ``My city is no more.''

MARTHA STEWART WOULD GO TO BAT FOR THIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of the major league baseball fraternity were sputtering
mad when a relief pitcher named Jim Bouton published a personal
diary titled ``Ball Four,'' which revealed how some of the nation's
premier diamond heroes drank Wild Turkey, chased women and
sometimes were late for 6 o'clock Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The book centered upon the season Bouton spent in the bullpen of
the 1969 Seattle Pilots, so I asked the team's skipper, Joe
Schultz, if he would comment on the diary, which mentioned him
frequently and irreverently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't dignify Jim Bouton by reading one line of his
book,'' Schultz growled at the time, adding after a pause,
``Besides, a lot of the things he wrote weren't true.''
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded of that remark frequently these days when somebody
mentions Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   These critics suggest they wouldn't dignify her by reading her
newspaper column or her many books. But they can tell you a dozen
things she wrote that promoted their displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years before she launched her syndicated column, I
had never heard her name. Then I attended a meeting where a couple
of the top chefs in Seattle were asked about the plausibility of
staging an annual gourmet foods exposition in Emerald City.
</P>
<P>
   They both offered the same bit of advice. Such a food expo would
probably be successful if Stewart were signed as celebrity guest.
If she were not, chances are the show would be pronounced a flop.
</P>
<P>
   Wow, I thought. To have that much power.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, of course, Stewart has turned up the voltage. She
writes for the top newspapers in the country, she has her own
television show and a variety of endorsements, and stores devote a
whole shelf to the books she has written.
</P>
<P>
   And people can't stand her. At least that's what I am told.
You'd think she had written a kiss-and-tell book on hot-house
radishes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what she writes is advice like you should dust all your
Christmas ornaments before you put them away. And lines of
Christmas lights should be sealed individually in plastic sacks
from the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   My wife dismissed this advice with a laugh, the day the column
appeared in the Post-Intelligencer. Four days later she wanted to
know where the plastic sacks were. And she was asking me why I
wasn't dusting the ornaments when I took them off the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Recently a contributing columnist to a weekly newspaper north of
Seattle offered her opinion of Stewart. Admitting that her home is
sometimes a bit messy, the homemaker wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible tells us that God created the world out of chaos,
not out of neatness and order. Like splattered paint in an artist's
studio, messiness is a sign of creativity and life.'' With a
reference to her own home she concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha Stewart might not want to stay here. But I bet that
Jesus would.''
</P>
<P>
   Good grief. Stewart is now the Antichrist!
</P>
<P>
   Tweet! Stop the game. That's 15 yards and loss of down, for
unnecessary roughness.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I've got to cook dinner. Here is a recipe Stewart might
recommend, followed by one for people who cook messy.
</P>
<P>
   Clucker en Croute
</P>
<P>
   6 chicken breast halves, skinned and boned
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   { cup sherry wine
</P>
<P>
   6 thin slices ham
</P>
<P>
   Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon snipped rosemary
</P>
<P>
   6 thin slices Swiss cheese
</P>
<P>
   Frozen puff pastry sheets
</P>
<P>
   You can find frozen puff pastry in better supermarkets. A
Pepperidge Farm package weighs a pound and contains two large
sheets. They must be thawed 30 minutes before the sheets are
unrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Poach the breasts in a simmering broth made by combining the
chicken broth and sherry. Remove but save and refrigerate the broth
for tomorrow's soup. (That's known as a Homemaker Hint.)
</P>
<P>
   Wrap each breast portion in a slice of ham. Spread with mustard
and sprinkle with rosemary. Wrap with cheese. On a lightly floured
board cut out pastry circles big enough to completely seal each
breast. You might want to increase the size of the pastry sheet
with a rolling pin.
</P>
<P>
   When you have wrapped each breast with pastry, wet the edges
with water, then crimp and seal.
</P>
<P>
   Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet for 20 minutes in an oven
preheated to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic Junction Beef
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds top round steak, thin cut
</P>
<P>
   \ cup flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Italian herbs
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons onion powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon garlic salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   \ cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup beef bouillon
</P>
<P>
   17-ounce can sliced mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   If the meat is too thick, whack each fillet a few times with an
Edgar Martinez-autographed baseball bat. Cut the meat into
serving-size portions.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the flour, paprika, herbs, onion powder, garlic
salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Coat the beef on both sides
in the seasoned flour. No, no, don't throw away the excess flour.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large skillet. Brown the meat on both sides
over medium-high heat, then remove to a plate.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the onions into the pan, adding more oil if needed.
Stir-fry 3 minutes, add the garlic and the remainder of the
seasoned flour. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, then add the bouillon, plus
the liquid drained from the can of mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Stir to incorporate, then return the meat to the pan. Cover and
simmer on low for 90 minutes, or until beef is tender. The liquid
should barely be bubbling while the meat is cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the mushrooms, reheat and serve with mashed potatoes.

 By   DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a new world order that is melding Wall Street and Silicon
Valley, the business of buying and selling stocks for smaller
investors is being shaped as much by lesser-known online brokerage
firms as it is by the big brand-name firms.
</P>
<P>
   While Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and E(STAR)Trade have established
themselves as the most recognizable online names, the
fastest-growing firms are Waterhouse Securities, a discount broker
turned online provider that does relatively little advertising, and
Datek Online, a broker that caters to what some in the business
call ``hyperactive traders.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, analysts say, is another hint that when it comes to
the retail market _ that is, smaller investors _ the shape of
things to come may be trickling up from below.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the big Wall Street firms are looking at how these
companies are shaping online trading,'' said Bernard L. Madoff, a
member of the Securities Industry Association, which represents
many of the big investment houses. ``Nobody at this point can or
should ignore it; it's not a passing fancy.''
</P>
<P>
   So while online trading grew by a record 34 percent in the
fourth quarter, according to a study by Credit Suisse First Boston,
a number of large banks and Wall Street firms have been trying to
find ways to buy into that success.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is tapping into the market through
its online subsidiary, Discover Brokerage; Merrill Lynch is
planning its own online operation, though not so geared toward
active trading, and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and E(STAR)Trade recently
joined forces to invest $50 million in Archipelago, a computerized
system that electronically matches stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   The system is not unlike Island ECN, an electronic communication
network developed by Datek. Trading volume in Island _ which some
call an electronic stock exchange _ has been explosive in the last
year. It is many times larger than Archipelago, analysts say, and
according to the Nasdaq stock market, it is the leading trader in
such stocks as Yahoo and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this Internet technology has been developed on the edge of
the market, and now it's moving to the core,'' said Bill Burnham,
an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, officials at Datek say that Island, which gets much of
its business from active day-traders, or speculators, now accounts
for about 10 percent of all Nasdaq volume. Datek says it is gaining
on Instinet, the electronic system owned by Reuters, which matches
institutional trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not really ahead of them, we're in striking
distance,'' said Robert Bethge, a spokesman for Datek.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet officials, however, say that there are numerous
complications in counting stock trades. A spokesman, Terry Mulry,
also says that Instinet's market share in Nasdaq has remained
consistent over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   But no one doubts that Island has become a force in the
industry, one big enough to attract the interest of E(STAR)Trade,
which officials close to the company say was at one time in talks
to either shuttle its trades through Datek's system or acquire the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the tremendous success of online brokerage firms,
shares of Schwab, E(STAR)Trade and Ameritrade have been soaring in
recent months. And last week, the Toronto-Dominion Bank, which owns
Waterhouse Securities, said that it would consider spinning off a
portion of the brokerage firm to the public.
</P>
<P>
   A sticking point with the smaller online brokerage firms,
though, is that many on Wall Street are wary of linking up with a
firm whose fortunes are tied too heavily to speculative, volatile
trading in Internet stocks, in which companies like Datek
specialize. Even online brokers like E(STAR)Trade are moving toward
more mainstream customers whose trading activity may be more steady
and less volatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon for day-traders to trade 60 times a day,''
said Madoff, who also operates Bernard L. Madoff Securities, a
market-making firm. ``This is not investing; it's a casino
mentality. Very few Wall Street firms want to be involved in online
day-trading. There's a lot of risk involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Datek has another problem. Last May, the Manhattan district
attorney's office said it was investigating whether Datek had taken
part in a money-laundering operation as well as other possibly
fraudulent activity related to a day-trading subsidiary that had
been spun off a little earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Datek officials have denied any wrongdoing and called such
accusations ``baseless and defamatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that smaller companies like Datek have been leading
the push toward faster, more efficient trading technologies. Datek
is now considering registering Island as an independent stock
exchange with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the SEC
approves this, some analysts say, Island could further reduce
transaction costs and possibly even generate stock-quotation
revenue that now goes to the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ricketts, president of Ameritrade, which is one of the
largest online brokers, says his firm is also considering linking
up with an electronic communication network, or ECN
</P>
<P>
   ``If you register as a stock exchange, you can charge for
quotes,'' Ricketts said. ``The Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange make hundreds of millions of dollars selling quotes. That
money doesn't belong to the exchanges; it belongs to the customers.
One way we can get it back is through an ECN.''

   Decision Expected Monday On Anti-Pornography Law
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Philadelphia is expected to decide Monday
whether to issue a preliminary injunction that would block a
federal law meant to shield children from commercial pornography on
the Web. Supporters of the Child Online Protection Act say the law
is aimed at free samples offered by pornography sites and assert
that it seeks not to purge the Web of adult entertainment but to
place it behind childproof electronic gates.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the law say it could force a variety of Web site
operators to choose between self-censorship or prison. For example,
Mitchell Tepper, who runs the Sexual Health Network, a site with
sex information for the disabled, said he feared his candid
material could put his site in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   A Question of Credibility
</P>
<P>
   Because much of the antitrust case against Microsoft revolves
around what happened at private meetings between the software giant
and other companies, the decision by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
at the U.S. District Court level will lean heavily on whose
testimony he finds most credible.

Los Angeles Times. Some say the expansion may hinder The Times from
pursuing growth in the suburbs.

THIEVES GET $2 MILLION IN MEXICO MASTER'S ART 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Slipping into a fashionable private art gallery
here late last week, thieves threatened onlookers with firearms,
packed up 12 paintings by Rufino Tamayo, one of the country's great
masters, and fled. It was the largest single robbery of
contemporary Mexican art in memory.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the stolen works, which had been on loan from
American and Mexican collectors for an exposition celebrating the
100th anniversary of Tamayo's birth, was estimated at $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The robbery on Thursday evening came moments before the
prestigious Lopez Quiroga gallery in the Polanco neighborhood
closed, and one day before the exposition was to be dismantled and
the works returned to their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Art experts said they believed that the methodical manner in
which the thieves gathered and packed the canvases, leaving behind
dozens of other Tamayo works, suggested that they might have been
hired by a criminal organization to carry out the heist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have obviously been many art robberies here, but I can't
recall any occasion on which 12 major works have been stolen at
once,'' Raquel Tibol, one of Mexico's most prominent art critics,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Tamayo, who was born in the southern state of Oaxaca and died in
1991, is considered one of Mexico's 20th-century artistic giants.
</P>
<P>
   Because he outlived Diego Rivera and other major Mexican artists
of the century, he achieved special renown during his lifetime. He
had close friendships with a succession of presidents and other
members of the Mexican elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Tamayo believed in universality,'' said his 1991 obituary
in The New York Times. ``Many of his paintings have a generic
quality. Their slightly schematic, gestural, figurative style,
shaped by modernist developments like cubism, surrealism and
expressionism, can seem so familiar that they could have been
painted almost anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   That description applies clearly to all the 12 works stolen last
week.
</P>
<P>
   They were all small oil paintings, each measuring less than 2
feet in either dimension, painted between 1929 and 1988. They
included ``Sandias,'' or Watermelons, a 1965 still life; ``El
Payaso,'' or The Clown, a 1988 portrait with cubist overtones, and
``Abejas Agresivas,'' or Angry Bees, a 1953 abstract.
</P>
<P>
   Tamayo's paintings have fetched above $2 million in New York
auctions, usually selling for less than comparable works by Diego
Rivera and his wife Frida Kahlo, but often for far more than canvas
paintings by the classic muralists Jose Clemente Orozco and David
Alfaro Siqueiros, Ms. Tibol said.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 paintings were part of an exposition of about 50 Tamayo
oils, lithographs and etchings that had been on display here since
December.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico City newspaper La Jornada reported that the missing
paintings had all been insured by an American company, New Northern
Fine Art. Efforts to reach the company, or to confirm its name,
proved fruitless.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday's robbery was carried out by five men, dressed casually
but well in order to mingle with other members of the public at the
Tamayo exposition, the gallery owners told local journalists. After
brandishing their weapons to threaten the gallery staff and a
handful of onlookers, the thieves lifted the 12 paintings from the
walls, wrapped them carefully in plastic bags and packed them in
the van in which they escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who entered the gallery to steal the paintings knew
very well what they were doing,'' Mauricio Tornero, the director of
Mexico City's detectives, who is in charge of the investigation,
told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of the 12 paintings were printed in several Mexican
papers, partly at the request of the Lopez Quiroga gallery, whose
directors said they hoped that publication of the images would help
reduce their marketability.
</P>
<P>
   The most costly art thefts in Mexico have been of pre-Colombian
works, several experts said. In 1985, thieves working on Christmas
Eve stole 140 of the nation's most prized archaeological artifacts,
including precious jars and figures fashioned of gold, jade and
obsidian, from the National Museum of Anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   Another notorious robbery was the October 1976 theft of 10 works
by Mexico's 19th-century landscape master Jose Maria Velasco, from
the private collection of the Mexican poet and museum organizer,
Carlos Pellicer Camara. Those paintings, two of which the thieves
sliced from their frames with a knife, have never been recovered.
But Pellicer's nephew said he believed that last week's robbery was
more sweeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of such an important robbery,'' the nephew,
Carlos Pellicer Lopez, said in an interview.

WATCH THE TUBE OR WATCH THE COMPUTER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Mark Cuban, whose company sends radio and
television broadcasts over the Internet to personal computers, told
a ballroom full of television executives here that any day now
people will use their computers to watch television, buy
merchandise from their favorite shows and even send feedback to
producers or advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow panelist interrupted. ``People don't watch technology,
they watch channels,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, a prominent
media-industry analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``Who wants to watch a
PC?''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, the co-founder and president of Broadcast.com Inc. shot
back, referring to a typical cable box: ``What's a set-top box?
It's just a stupid computer. Why not watch a smart computer?'' And
Lowell Paxson, the founder and chairman of the fledgling broadcast
network Paxnet, drew applause by telling Cuban, ``I want you to
turn every PC in the world into a conduit for my television
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Will that ever really happen? Such questions arose with new
urgency last week at the largest television trade show in the
world, called NATPE and sponsored by the National Association of
Television Executives.
</P>
<P>
   Normally at NATPE, producers and syndicators of non-network
programs meet and glad-hand their customers, the United States'
television-station executives _ people far more familiar with
``Home Improvement'' than home pages.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the Internet entrepreneurs were horning in on the
party. Both as exhibitors and as experts on NATPE's informational
panels, they clamored to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, no computer company had a booth at NATPE, and
only Microsoft made a presentation. This year, more than two dozen
new-media companies bought booths, and Microsoft's
3,200-square-foot display entwined wavy glass, sleek stainless
steel and computers with big screens featuring live video and
CD-like sound.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the convention center was still dominated by
old-fashioned NATPE pursuits. Sprawling, gaudy booths stood ready
to woo customers with free food, open bars, plush carpets and
billboard-sized blowups of the studio's stars. Conventioneers could
gawk at starlets zipped into shiny dresses, queue up to shake hands
with Pamela Anderson Lee or William Shatner, or share a cocktail
with the latest exceedingly bronzed game-show host.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the world of new media began to intrude on the
old. ``It's still a big unknown, the question of how do we make
money with it,'' said Nick Trigony, NATPE's chairman and the
president of Cox Broadcasting. ``Most guys' stations now have their
own Web sites, but frankly, they aren't too exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   New-media concepts still baffle many of the 17,000 who attended
NATPE. Many think digital television means high-definition
television, and dismiss it as a gimmick. Others understand that
digital TV simply means a digitally compressed signal that can
carry voluminous amounts of extra information with the traditional
sound and picture _ but even those people have no clue what extra
information their viewers will want.
</P>
<P>
   And so the computer mavens _ distinguishable by the sporty polo
shirts they wore instead of jackets and ties _ swooped in,
preaching the gospel of digital bits and video streaming. Steve
Klein, director of new-business development for Intervu Inc., a
company that helps people expand the reach and speed of their Web
sites, said Internet knowledge among television executives was
rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, it would have been `Streaming _ what?''' he
said. ``Last year it was `Streaming _ how?' And this year it's
`Streaming _ when?' Can you do it live? Can you do video on
demand?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, three panels during the four-day convention addressed
new-media issues. This year, 11 did, out of 31 altogether. Last
year, a seminar on how to sell ads on a Web site drew 10 people who
sat around a table together; this year, it attracted almost 100,
and aides had to drag more chairs into the room.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Molly Glover, the director of interactive marketing at Granite
Broadcasting Corp., which owns 10 television stations, helped
conduct that seminar.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 Granite stations have Web sites, and three _ in San Jose,
Calif.; Buffalo, N.Y.; and Austin, Texas _ are ``streaming'' their
news broadcasts now.
</P>
<P>
   This means people with personal computers, no matter where they
are, can watch the station's local news live, or tune in to catch
the traffic report. They do so through Cuban's company,
Broadcast.com, which announced during NATPE that it had just signed
contracts with two ABC stations _ WABC, Channel 7 in New York, and
WPVI in Philadelphia _ to stream their news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had quite a few e-mails from servicemen or other people
overseas who have watched their local news,'' Ms. Glover said.
``And snowbirds in Florida like to watch the Buffalo weather.''
</P>
<P>
   In corporate offices, Cuban likes to point out, almost everyone
has a personal computer, or PC, but few have radios or television
sets. He sees that as a huge market to be exploited by television
and radio stations, and by corporations wishing to stream speeches,
seminars or announcements.
</P>
<P>
   To get good-quality sound and video, though, requires an
expensive computer with a high-speed connection to the Internet.
And television traditionalists insist that people will never use a
computer to watch ``E.R.'' or ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' or any
other hit show, movie or sports event, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   But some day people may well use the computer for some
televisionlike functions, and the television set for some
computerlike functions. As NATPE demonstrated, the two are
beginning to mingle, if not to meld.

BUSINESS CHANGES ANGER PHOTOGRAPHERS AT NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC  
</HEADLINE>

 By   ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The image of the National Geographic photographer is one of an
intrepid, rakish adventurer, a man or woman with a time-worn face,
a tilted khaki hat and interesting-looking scars. The image is not
far from reality: in the last year, one Geographic photographer
contracted flesh-eating bacteria on a shoot for the magazine,
another was seriously injured in a car crash in Peru, another
weathered a summer in Pakistan in brutal 117-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   A Geographic photographer may spend three months shooting a
story for the magazine, and expenses have run as high as $250,000
in photographers' and assistants' fees for feature stories. The
team of approximately 80 independently contracted photographers _
whether they work in the silently steaming Brazilian jungle or
underneath Antarctic ice _ produces the most exquisite and
sought-after natural and cultural photography in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But now the rugged adventurers are steaming mad over a contract
dispute that they feel allows the Geographic's taxable divisions to
take advantage of the not-for-profit mother ship, the vaunted
111-year-old National Geographic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is a symbol of the changing times at the National
Geographic Society. Long used to the less hard-charging manner of
an entirely tax-exempt organization, it has recently spun off
several new, taxable arms that are as aggressive as any commercial
network or magazine publisher.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: this week, the magazine, which faces a slowly
but steadily declining circulation, will put 400,000 issues of the
magazine on newsstands across the country. It is the first time in
the Geographic's 111-year history that it has resorted to use of
newsstands, which it has long scoffed at as downscale but now sees
as the means for attracting the diverse and younger readers it so
desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute with photographers also goes to the heart of
creative ownership in an era when the issue of ownership of
creative work can be easily muddied: If a photographic image is
transported over the Internet, who owns it? If an image is
displayed fleetingly on television, how much should a program pay
to display it for 5 seconds? What about 35 seconds? If a giant
publishing company owns magazines, Internet suppliers and book
publishers, does it have the right to reproduce images throughout
its various media without payment to the author of that work?
</P>
<P>
   The current dispute centers on a fundamental problem. The
photographers feel that many of the Geographic's new divisions,
like the four-year-old National Geographic Ventures and the
one-month-old National Geographic Enterprises Group, are robbing
them of their fair money-making ability. Photographers who once
expected that their work would appear only in the prestigious
non-profit magazine now say their photographs will be used _ either
for free, or at extremely low cost _ in the other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed contract specifically would limit the amount of
money that photographers will earn if their photos are published in
foreign language editions, capping the final figure at a
significantly lower payment than their present rate, photographers
said. The problem is especially relevant this year, when the
National Geographic wants to increase the number of its
foreign-language editions to 11, from five, by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The photographers also complain that images could be used
without payment in television programming, for merchandise, on
T-shirts and on calendars. Some of the most nettlesome points
involve book-publishing: previously, if one photographer's work
made up more than 50 percent of a National Geographic book, the
Society had to inform the photographer. The new contract would
raise that limit to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with three dozen National Geographic photographers _
all conducted on the condition of anonymity _ revealed a deep love
for the magazine. All said that there is no better place in the
world to publish photography than in the pages of the National
Geographic. Most added that the National Geographic is staffed and
managed by editors who care about the art of photography. But they
place the blame for the ongoing contract scuffle on the for-profit
divisions of the Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got this formerly not for profit company,'' said one.
``Now it's acting like a for-profit company, and negotiating with
these independent contractors with the aggressiveness of a
for-profit company.'' Another talked of a new ``bean-counter
mentality'' and several photographers described the other divisions
of National Geographic as ``predatory.''
</P>
<P>
   But John M. Fahey, Jr., president and chief executive of the
National Geographic Society, said that he saw the new contract as
an opportunity for photographers to reach a worldwide audience.
``We cherish our photographers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence B. Adamson, a senior vice president, emphasized that
the trend among many media organizations is simply to buy all
rights with one fee. And he said that the photographers were
already paid well for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey added: ``Each photographer is in a different situation
personally. Some care more about secondary use rights, some care
more about foreign-language syndication, so it's not a monolith.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the challenges of the Internet, multimedia products
and television, the National Geographic has no choice but to extend
its valuable brand name beyond the magazine. And circulation, long
a stalwart, is slowly but steadily sinking. In 1989, the National
Geographic magazine's circulation reached a peak of 10.9 million
subscribers. Circulation for 1996, the last year for which figures
are available from the Audit Bureau of Circulation, was 9 million.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Society will lend its name to a a new magazine,
National Geographic Adventure, which will compete with for-profit
titles like Mariah Media, Inc.'s Outside magazine and Wenner
Media's Men's Journal. The National Geographic Enterprises Group,
founded in December 1998, will license the National Geographic name
to a wide variety of consumer products, like games and children's
toys.
</P>
<P>
   But 1995 marked the biggest shift. The Society introduced
National Geographic Ventures, the for-profit division that oversees
television and film operations, interactive services and map
publishing, among other products. Over the last 18 months, the
Ventures group has introduced National Geographic television
channels in 44 countries, and in the coming year plans to introduce
either an independent cable channel in the United States, with its
television partner, NBC, which is owned by the General Electric
Co., or rent time on an existing cable channel for National
Geographic programming.
</P>
<P>
   But the photographers, who have hired a lawyer to advise them on
their case, see all the expansion as a financial disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   One wrote an impassioned letter: ``NGS is no more the patrician,
inward-looking institution it once was. It is now headed and
increasingly run by professional corporate people who are looking
to expand the empire globally and increase the number of its
for-profit ventures. I personally have no problem with this and
wish them total success. At the same time, and this goes for all
free-lance people including writers, the rights publishers expect
are increasing without commensurate pay increases for the use of
our work they so dearly depend on to create their products.''

SCIENTISTS TRACE AIDS VIRUS TO SUBSPECIES OF CHIMPANZEE

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The riddle of the origin of the AIDS virus has
apparently been solved, according to an international team of
scientists who reported Sunday that they had traced its roots to a
related virus in a subspecies of chimpanzee in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Because the chimpanzee is able to live with the virus without
falling ill, the scientists expressed hope that their discovery
would eventually help improve therapies and develop an effective
vaccine against the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who reported their findings at the opening
session of a scientific meeting here, said the simian virus was
closely related to HIV-1, the type of AIDS virus that has caused
the overwhelming majority of cases in the world. Since the virus
jumped to humans, perhaps through exposure to blood in hunting or
handling the meat of chimpanzees, it has been transmitted among
humans to infect an estimated 30 million people in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chimpanzee, which has served as the source of HIV-1, also
quite possibly holds the clues to its successful control,'' the
head of the team, Dr. Beatrice Hahn of the University of Alabama at
Birmingham, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists have long suspected that HIV-1 came from the
chimpanzee, they have not been able to identify the precise
subspecies until now.
</P>
<P>
   The subspecies is known as Pan troglodytes troglodytes, and the
chimpanzee virus is known as SIVcpz, for simian immunodeficiency
virus chimpanzee.
</P>
<P>
   Future research needs to focus on why HIV-1 is lethal for humans
while SIVcpz seems to cause no illness in the chimpanzee, even
though humans and chimpanzees are 98 percent genetically similar,
Hahn and other scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have long been clues that HIV-1 came from
chimpanzees, how to document the link had been one of the biggest
mysteries in AIDS. But, as exciting as the discovery is to the
scientists, their enthusiasm has been dampened by another
discovery: The subspecies is being slaughtered to ``the brink of
extinction'' in its natural habitat in west and central Africa,
Hahn said. The researcher is now leading efforts to publicize the
scientific dangers that she believes will result from the
chimpanzee's extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, said Hahn's study was ``important and
quite an interesting advance'' and opened a new avenue of research.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci said in an interview that his federal institute would
finance meritorious research on the simian virus. One aim will be
to determine whether the different outcomes of infection in humans
and chimpanzees result from tiny changes in the genetic makeup of
the virus or the host. Another aim will be to understand why the
chimpanzee's immune system appears to resist the damaging effects
of the AIDS virus while the human's is susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Jaffe and Dr. Thomas Folks, two leading AIDS
researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said
in interviews in Atlanta that determining the source of the AIDS
virus might also help scientists learn how to identify novel
microbes earlier and thus prevent similar diseases from becoming
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Since the recognition of AIDS in 1981, Jaffe said, scientists
have asked, ``If this kind of transmission happened in the past, is
it continuing to go on?''
</P>
<P>
   The latest findings might lead to new tests to discover viruses
in nature that could cause human disease. As people disturb more
and more animal habitats around the world, scientists say, there is
a growing risk that they will be exposed to previously unknown
disease agents. Transplanting animal organs into humans, should it
come into wider use, would also be an avenue for infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is everyone's nightmare, that there is another virus out
there that either could be or has been transmitted to humans that
we cannot detect with current methods,'' Jaffe said. ``No one wants
to miss detecting the next HIV epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn, whose paper is due to be published in this week's issue of
the journal Nature, said, ``My research interest for the last 10
years has been the origin and evolution of this entire class of
viruses, not just the human viruses but also the primate cousins.''
Hahn, a virologist, works with her husband, George Shaw, who has
gone to Africa twice in the last 10 years for such studies.
</P>
<P>
   The two SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees that have been in captivity
longest, for 26 and 15 years, did not develop AIDS, but much more
needs to be learned about the infection in chimpanzees in the wild,
Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   Folks said the work being reported Sunday was ``provocative and
gives us lots of ideas about the evolution of the viruses, but it
does not give us the final piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks said ``it should be a priority to look systematically''
for the AIDS-like viruses in animals because scientists were now
``forced to draw conclusions based on very small numbers of
isolates.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting under way here, the sixth annual Conference on
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, is an event at which
scientists discuss viruses like HIV. At this meeting last year,
scientists reported that analysis of a blood sample preserved since
1959 from the oldest documented case of HIV-1 infection showed that
the first such infection probably occurred about 50 years ago.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Hahn and other scientists have traced a related
human AIDS virus, HIV-2, to the sooty mangabey monkey (Cercocebus
atys). Its native habitat is in the areas of West Africa where
HIV-2 is most common. For unknown reasons, HIV-2 is transmitted
less easily than is HIV-1, and infections have been limited to
Africa in far smaller numbers than those recorded in the HIV-1
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The latest findings of Hahn's team reflect a combination of
diligence, planned research and luck. In an extensive interview,
Hahn recalled how her team of American, British and French
scientists made the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal finding came from the remains of one chimpanzee,
Marilyn, that was infected with SIVcpz for at least 26 years
without showing signs of AIDS. Federal scientists kept Marilyn's
tissues frozen for 10 years to await the day when new and improved
tests could more precisely identify the infecting virus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Marilyn was taken as an infant from somewhere in Africa
to a U.S. Air Force colony in New Mexico. There, Marilyn served as
a breeder in research projects.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, when some chimpanzees were about to be used in AIDS
vaccine research, scientists tested all primates in the colony to
determine if any were infected with HIV-1. Marilyn was the only one
infected with the simian virus.
</P>
<P>
   But just as scientists learned that Marilyn was infected, she
was found dead in her cage after having delivered two stillborn
chimpanzees. An autopsy found no evidence of disease. Marilyn's
remains were then sent to scientists at a National Cancer Institute
laboratory at Fort Detrick, Md., where efforts to grow the
AIDS-like virus failed.
</P>
<P>
   So the tissues were stored in a freezer for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Dr. Larry Arthur, a scientist at Fort Detrick and a
co-author of the study, was trying to clean out a crowded freezer
and found Marilyn's tissues. He called Hahn because of her
well-known interest in the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he decided to throw them away, he called me because he
thought there was a remote, but real, possibility that the chimp
was naturally infected,'' Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   When the scientists asked if she wanted to test the tissues,
Hahn said she responded, ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn knew that tests had detected SIVcpz infections in only
three other chimpanzees among about 400 in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the viruses from the three chimpanzees was so
different from HIV-1 in sophisticated laboratory tests that many
scientists doubted a direct link between the chimpanzee and human
AIDS viruses. Also, the natural range of the chimpanzee did not
coincide with the region where the AIDS epidemic was first seen in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn's team used a technique known as polymerase chain reaction,
or PCR, to recover virus from Marilyn's tissues and to identify it
as a chimpanzee virus.
</P>
<P>
   Additional tests provided a full map of the genetic makeup of
the four virus isolates and the subspecies of the known infected
chimpanzees. From that work, the team learned that three of the
four virus isolates came from one subspecies, Pan troglodytes
troglodytes, and that the fourth came from a different subspecies,
Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the findings were puzzling. Two different subspecies of
chimpanzees harbored SIV in the wild. But why had only one of the
two apparently transmitted virus to humans?
</P>
<P>
   With further work, the researchers found that the new chimpanzee
virus from Marilyn, and two others previously identified from
Gabon, formed a distinct cluster in charts that scientists call
phylogenetic trees. They are the diagrams that scientists make by
comparing the chemical letters of genetic material from different
viruses. The cluster showed that the three viruses were more
closely related to each other than they were to the fourth
chimpanzee virus. The fourth was the genetically distinctive one
that had created skepticism about the link between HIV-1 and the
chimpanzee virus.
</P>
<P>
   The team then studied viral diversity according to species of
chimpanzees. Additional tests showed that all known strains of
HIV-1 were closely related only to SIVcpz strains infecting Pan
troglodytes troglodytes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Hahn said, testing the fourth infected chimpanzee ``made
all the difference in the world'' because it allowed the team to
``make the link to the subspecies, one that people had not thought
of,'' Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The final step was learning that the natural habitat for Pan
troglodytes troglodytes fits the areas of west and central Africa
where HIV-1 was first identified.
</P>
<P>
   That geographic pattern ``led us to investigate hunting
practices,'' Hahn said. Two months ago, Hahn's team learned about
the incursion of roads into remote areas, mainly for logging
trucks. People who once hunted to feed themselves are now
slaughtering chimpanzees and other primates for sale in the ``bush
meat'' trade that is conducted over the new roads. The practice may
be putting people at risk of continuing cross-species transmission
of known and unknown viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Modern laboratory techniques make it possible to draw
conclusions from genetic maps developed from a small number of
chimpanzees. Nevertheless, the number of naturally infected
chimpanzees in captivity is too small and does not permit studies
of how many chimpanzees are infected in the wild and how the virus
is transmitted. Presumably, transmission occurs through sexual
intercourse, as in humans. Proof will require studies in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drawback is that the numbers now are small, and we need to
expand the studies to get more virus isolates,'' Folks, the federal
researcher, said.
</P>
<P>
   But just when this type of research is most needed, the
endangered species is even nearer extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely why the AIDS epidemic came when it did is not known.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn is among a number of scientists who speculate that humans
have long hunted chimpanzees for food and that some individuals
became infected with the simian strain through exposure to blood in
hunting and dressing meat. Presumably, such infections were
confined to remote areas. But as traditional tribal life gave way
to migration to cities, families were broken up, and commercial sex
became more common. This led to greater opportunity to transmit the
virus to more people.
</P>
<P>
   Solution of one scientific riddle often gives birth to another.
In the case of AIDS, it is: Where did the SIVcpz come from?

CAN A DIP IN THE BACKYARD POOL REACH MYTHIC DEPTHS? 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It might seem somewhat perverse, publishing a book
about the history of swimming pools timed to land in wintry
Northeastern regions when those Hockney-blue, Hollywood-inspired
basins of water seem impossibly alien. But maybe MIT Press knew
what it was doing with ``The Springboard in the Pond,'' a study of
these ``monumental and allegorical'' objects by a Dutch
architectural historian, Thomas A.P. van Leeuwen.
</P>
<P>
   This alien sense is, after all, one of the goals of the newer
forms of cultural history now being written. Consider an object,
these studies proclaim, any object, preferably something we take
for granted, something we might consider to be almost natural. Then
watch as its origins are disclosed, its mutations put on display,
its life articulated, its death foretold. Can we ever look on this
world the same way again?
</P>
<P>
   Such cultural explorations aim to make culture itself seem
strange, pushing cultural premises to the surface. They often have
other aims as well, which can verge on the polemical: showing that
bourgeois culture's claims for its hallowed objects are
illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   As for this study of swimming pools, the polemic is refreshingly
absent. Instead the author seems content with sympathetically
teasing the pool's meanings out of its strangeness. Even the images
astonish: the seemingly sculptured water surfaces of Hearst's San
Simeon pools, Red Skelton clowning around in a sailor's suit and
canoe in his backyard pool, the half-mad 19th-century Bavarian
king, Ludwig II, floating in his personal grotto, the whirling
contemporary pools for exercising horses.
</P>
<P>
   The pool does not just provide cooling recreation. These are
places for play and display, discipline and eroticism, dream and
danger.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest forms of swimming, for example, was
military. The first swimming school was in ancient Rome. The
fifth-century military historian Vegetius warned that ``during
periods of abundant precipitation rivers will overflow their banks
and those who cannot swim will either perish by drowning or by the
hands of the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 18th century, the French fascination with swimming, van
Leeuwen suggests, may have led to hegemony on the battlefield,
inspiring other nations to establish swimming schools. Much of the
training may have been on dry land. One engraving shows
19th-century French soldiers learning the breast stroke while
suspended in air on a twirling carousel. It wasn't until public
swimming instruction was barely out of its infancy in 1914 that the
founder of the Red Cross Water Safety Program suggested that people
``learned to swim more quickly in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The military origins of swimming helped inspire the rectangular
pool and the regular swimming of laps, but the public interest in
swimming had more casual, leisurely origins off massive barges
anchored in Europe's rivers. One 18th-century floating barge on the
Seine contained a cafe, a barber shop and a ``dry'' instruction
room. These barges, some of which survive in modern form,
partitioned off portions of the river with hanging nets to filter
out water-borne garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The private pool evolved, in van Leeuwen's telling, in another
way, by echoing the kinds of mythic images and associations that
were tapped into by two water-obsessed, megalomaniacs: King Ludwig
II and William Randolph Hearst. Ludwig, who actually drowned in
1886, built one of the first indoor pools modeled on Wagner's set
for ``Tannhaeuser,'' an elaborate grotto with mossy cliffs, oval
openings, fauns, nymphs and colored lighting, the first watery love
tunnel. Ludwig would ride its surface, floating in a boat shaped
like a cockleshell.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst also left a trail of ``hydrophilic architecture'' in his
wake, creating, as van Leeuwen puts it, ``the largest and most
conspicuous pools of the modern age,'' marbled invocations of
ancient cultures. The magisterial climax, unbuilt at the time of
Hearst's death, was to have been an enormous pool taking up the
entire nave of a reconstructed church, the diving board at the
altar.
</P>
<P>
   Madness? Sure, but this otherworldly devotion was part of the
growing culture of the private pool. Here, in this excavated pit,
nature would be tamed, smoothed, polished and possessed. Earthly
law would be suspended in the languid medium where sound and motion
were slowed. The pool is a tribute to its owner, a sign of gracious
power over unruly elements. The water itself is treated, filtered,
heated, circulated, shaped to human desire.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the pool's appeal is this: That otherworldly power
is never fully tamed. In the rippled lapping of the surface, there
is the voice of the irrational, the erotic and mythic. The swan may
be a swimmer's ideal, coasting freely in a foreign element, both
succumbing to its currents and elegantly mastering its dangers.
Pools, van Leeuwen points out, have long been decorated with beings
that magically move between two worlds: Loreleis, mermaids, nymphs,
Ondines. They also have invoked the shadowy realm of death,
dissolution and drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Think here of Hollywood pools, recalled by van Leeuwen, created
during the pool's American prime. They range from the playland
fantasy of Busby Berkeley in films like ``Gold Diggers of 1933,''
to the dank symbol of decay in which the scriptwriter in ``Sunset
Boulevard'' drowns.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years most cinematic pools have become period symbols
of decadence or signs of ostentatious wealth. When water does
appear in film it is not chlorinated but oceanic, untamable,
unstable: erupting in ``Jaws,'' sweeping away the ambitions of
``Waterworld'' or, in frozen form, sinking that hubristic ocean
liner, the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   So has the pool lost its mythic edge? Have we come to the end of
an era? van Leeuwen hints as much. Some wealthy landowners are
priding themselves not on the artifice of a pool, but on the
seeming naturalness of a man-made pond; some are even stocked with
koi, a fish that can sell for more than $10,000 apiece. The pool,
which may have been inspired by the natural pond, is now, van
Leeuwen suggests, returning to its origins.
</P>
<P>
   So the pool becomes strange. It loses its innocence and becomes
a historical, cultural construction. It is a declaration of
upper-middle-class independence, paying homage to greater forces
while demonstrating mastery over them, celebrating the lure of
desire in the well-ordered light of the sun, showing how even
watery depths can be girdled by poured concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The pool is a modern icon, seeming to balance opposing forces in
the realm of carefree play. That balance may now be gone, but who
knows what mutations are yet to come? Maybe in the future our pools
will be virtual pools, grounded in cyberspace, offering plenty of
chances to master uncharted waters, risk submersion in alien
elements and surf to promised mastery. Maybe they already are.

GROUP WON'T PUBLICIZE YEAR 2000 RATINGS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Switzerland )  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An international group of banks, securities firms and insurers
has dropped its controversial plan to publicly rate the year 2000
computer readiness of the world's major trading nations.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the organization, which is known as the Global 2000
Coordinating Group, had feared that the rating plan would ignite a
flight of capital from low-rated nations that could make it harder
to head off year 2000 computer problems. The group dropped its plan
on Friday, after a three-day meeting in London.
</P>
<P>
   The influential 250-member group, which meets every six weeks,
first announced its intention to rate more than 30 nations at a
U.N. meeting in December. The criticism came from federal
regulators, some developing nations and some of the group's own
members.
</P>
<P>
   The group had gathered information about the year 2000 readiness
of various nations. On Friday, it said it now planned to share that
information with the United Nations and the Joint Year 2000
Council, an international coordinating committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that the focus should be kept on efforts to
stimulate self-assessment and disclosure by every country,'' said
Tim Sheapard-Walwyn, Global 2000's chairman, who works for UBS A.G.
in Zurich.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The focus of attention before Sunday's Super Bowl was
the so-called war of words between Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe
and Falcons defensive back Ray Buchanan. Sharpe predicted a Denver
victory; Buchanan predicted an Atlanta victory. Maybe the Super
Bowls atmosphere tempted them to act out of character.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, for all the attention he received, is a quiet
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, Ray is not a trash-talker,'' said his
teammate, Tony Martin, who was amused at the way Buchanan had been
cast. ``I don't believe he'll talk trash on the field unless you
distract him or talk trash to him. At practice, he's one of the
greatest guys out there. If he makes a good play on you, he'll help
you up. He's not a trash talker.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were deeper rivalries _ and friendships, even if the
friendships didn't get the publicity that the rivalries received.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the moment these teams knew they would face each other in
Super Bowl XXXIII, a slow, persistent flame began to burn in public
because of the rivalry between the head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Those men became the focal point of the discussion after Falcons
Coach Dan Reeves stunned a lot of people by admitting that, yes, he
had been hurt by his dismissal in Denver after the 1992 season,
and, yes, he had fired Mike Shanahan as his assistant after the
1991 season because he thought he had tried to undermine him,
particularly in his relationship with Broncos quarterback John
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   With Shanahan now the head coach of the Broncos and Elway still
the quarterback, that rivalry has deep roots. Although the
Reeves-Shanahan-Elway triangle seemed ground up and exhausted by
the end of last week, to the three people involved, the scar was as
fresh at game time as if it had just been inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it is so personal is that Dan Reeves was the coach
of the Broncos for so long, some of the guys are still on this
team,'' said Rod Smith, the fourth-year wide receiver who joined
the Broncos after Reeves had left. ``Our head coach was on Reeves'
staff, so it is personal, because you have ties.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ties go beyond Reeves-Shanahan. Some of Smith's closest
friends play for Atlanta. For one, Ronnie Bradford, the Falcon's
sixth-year defensive back. Bradford spent three seasons with the
Broncos, he and Smith were teammates in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a personal friend; when he comes to Denver, he stays in
my house,'' Smith said. ``Now here I am playing him.''
</P>
<P>
   After Atlanta defeated Minnesota in the National Football
Conference championship game, Smith called Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulated him and I told him, `I'm going to cut you, on
Sunday,''' Smith said. `` `I'm going to cut you, I'm going to knock
you down, I'm going to push you. I'm going to do everything.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith admitted he was just having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of respect for each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Smith received a call from Atlanta's Randy Fuller,
a fifth-year cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Fuller played with me my first year in the league,''
said Smith of the player who was with the Broncos in training camp
in 1995 when Smith was a rookie. ``I answered my phone and someone
was screaming: `We're going to kill ya'll in the Super Bowl.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said who the heck is this? He said `It's Fuller.' I just
laughed because he's one of my best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it is personal in that respect because you know they're
your friends and they're going to be your friends after the game
regardless of who wins or loses. I just don't want them to have
that feeling of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for all the criticism aimed at professional athletes,
among younger players there seems to be a sense of fraternity and,
oddly enough, history, even though that doesn't get the kind of
attention that trash talking does.
</P>
<P>
   If their interaction here was any indication, the NFL's younger
players seem closer. Many have played with and against each other
since high school. They've heard the veterans talk about the nasty
1987 strike and have developed an appreciation of what the game has
become. More have nurtured a keener appreciation for and awareness
of the larger industry surrounding the game.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Smith, the Falcons' all-pro defensive end, said the
competition is better on the field and the younger players are
beginning to pay attention off the field as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every guy you hear about blowing his money and not
knowing, not understanding or not caring about the strike, 99
percent of the guys respect what people before us have done,''
Smith said. ``We talk about it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that earlier this year he called Reggie White, the
Packers former defensive end, to thank him for what he had done for
defensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie catches a lot of flak for a lot of things he says but
he has done more for defensive lineman that anybody ever,'' Smith
said. ``He has taken defensive lineman from just being role players
to being _ next to quarterbacks _the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have guys going out there for one or two years, become
starters and if you get 10 sacks in a season you'll get $5 or $6
million. That's because of guys like Reggie White, laying it on the
line, speaking up for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL seems to be becoming more and more like an extended
family, with factions, differences, allegiances and friendships.
Players move around, coaches move around. This year it happened
that one coach was facing his old team, the other facing his old
boss. For Reeves and Shanahan, Sharpe and Buchanan, Smith and
Fuller, this Super Bowl wasn't business; it was personal. &QL;

   AGADIR, Morocco _ The life of Rashida, a shy young Moroccan
woman, has a medieval ring to it. She sleeps on the floor of a
small, dank room inside the compound of a fish cannery in Agadir.
She may be summoned to work at any hour, depending on when the
fishing fleet comes in.
</P>
<P>
   For less than five dollars a day, she plods in a big rubber
apron surrounded by a piercing stench, scaling and gutting sardines
and anchovies. But Rashida, who is 23, considers herself lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I don't sleep enough, I have a place to stay,'' the
young woman said, her eyes downcast, but her voice rising with
pride. ``And I earn enough to feed my baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashida is an unmarried mother, which has made her life
precarious and turned her into an outcast in Morocco's conservative
Islamic society.
</P>
<P>
   In general, women are treated as inferior under Morocco's
Koranic laws: they are legal minors, inherit only half a share,
need permission from a male relative to marry and can be repudiated
by their husbands. But a woman who has a child out of wedlock is
treated with even more disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant girls, even when they are very young or have been
raped, are commonly thrown out by their families, who say they
bring dishonor. The young women's brothers sometimes threaten to
kill them. Government or religious charities provide no support to
women they consider tainted with sin.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is forbidden by law, although a rich and educated woman
can usually buy one secretly.
</P>
<P>
   Rashida, who would not give her last name, said she was raped by
the son of the family for whom she worked as a maid. They dismissed
her. She did not know where to get an abortion. Her father and her
brothers had told her not to return home. Before finding work at
the fish cannery, she often slept in the street and begged.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many Islamic countries people deal with unwanted pregnancy
by pretending it doesn't exist,'' said Wassyla Tamzali, a
specialist in women's rights at Unesco, the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization. ``It's a taboo subject.''
</P>
<P>
   In Morocco, government officials say they have no statistics
about single mothers or illegitimate children and they provide no
services for them. But social workers say that as the country is
urbanizing and more young women have come to the cities, the number
of poor single mothers has grown. They say that because the women
and their children are ostracized, some are forced to become
beggars or prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for police to find a baby on the street or in
a park. Last year, newspapers in Casablanca reported that the
police had found 364 abandoned newborn babies the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   It is also common for single mothers to leave their babies
behind when they leave the hospital. Agadir's main hospital
currently houses about 60 abandoned children, according to a local
official. Under Koranic law, adoption does not exist so unwanted
children often end up in state orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the dark sides of Islam,'' said Majouba Edbouche.
``The government preaches Islam and charity all the time, but there
is all this hypocrisy about unmarried mothers, as though they were
prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Edbouche operates a day care center in Agadir for children
of poor, single mothers, a rare institution, which is financed by a
Swiss foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The single mothers she meets, she said, often are young,
illiterate farm girls who were sent to the cities to work as maids,
often when they were as young as 8 or 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really the parents are to blame, or the men who seduced them
or raped them,'' said Mrs. Edbouche. ``But the man is never held
accountable. The woman carries all the blame and shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Nouzha Skali, a pharmacist who has helped create a legal aid
center for women, said the police rarely take an interest in rape
complaints. ``Police treat the raped woman as the guilty party,''
she said. ``They will say, `Were you dressed properly?' or, `What
were you doing on the street anyway?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fatima Zohra Toufik, who works in a bakery, has a 7-month-old
son whom she has been trying to name since he was born. Her
boyfriend, the father of the child, refuses to marry her or to give
the child his name. In order to give the child her own last name,
she needs permission from her father or her oldest brother. Both
have refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father screamed, `I never want to see you or that bastard
child again,' '' she said, sobbing as she told her tale. ``My
brother said he will kill me and the baby if I ever come home
again.'' So her son's birth certificate says: Wadia, father
unknown. There is no last name.
</P>
<P>
   In the fish cannery where Rashida works, almost 50 women live in
the squalid factory dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   Most are single, many have children. The women would not give
their last names, shrugging off the request as irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Zara, 45, shares a room with five other women and three of their
children, among them her daughter Hariba, 22, who was born here at
the cannery and also works here. ``Hariba is the daughter of a
policeman who took me by force at the cemetery,'' Zara said matter
of factly.
</P>
<P>
   Rashida herself takes great pride in Hiba, her 4-year-old
daughter. In her cheerless existence _ she was sent away to become
a maid at age 6 _ the little girl is her joy.
</P>
<P>
   One of Rashida's few possessions is a photograph of Hamedi Rogi,
the son of her employer, who raped her twice and left her with
child. One day, she said, she will show her fair-skinned daughter
the picture of the light-skinned man who is her father.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Rashida recalled, her little daughter asked:
``Mama, why am I white? Why are you so black?''

ANNAN SAYS GLOBAL ECONOMY COULD FACE THIRD-WORLD BACKLASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Warning of a backlash against the global
economy, Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, challenged
international big business Sunday to enter into an unusual and
formal ``compact'' with the United Nations to promote human rights,
labor and environmental practices in the lands where they do
business.
</P>
<P>
   In return, he offered U.N. political support for ``the open
global market.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan chose one of the world's most glittery assemblies of
corporate and political power in this upscale Alpine ski resort to
try to set a corporate agenda coupling profit with social concerns.
His appeal not only reflected the widespread worries of Third World
nations about their vulnerability to freewheeling global
capitalism, but also evoked a threat of violent protest against it.
</P>
<P>
   Until people had built confidence in ``the global economy,''
Annan said, it ``will be fragile and vulnerable _ vulnerable to
backlash from all the `isms' of our post-Cold War world:
protectionism, populism, nationalism, ethnic chauvinism, fanaticism
and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks struck a chord not just among those nations most
directly affected by the months of crisis in emerging markets, but
also among those Third World countries that have, by their own
account, set high economic standards only to feel their
achievements threatened by global capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our global village has caught fire, from where we do not
know,'' President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt told the same gathering at
the World Economic Forum. ``In the emerging world there is a bitter
sentiment of injustice, a sense that there must be something wrong
with a system that wipes out years of hard-won development because
of changes in market sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha of India, capital
flows should be regulated to prevent national economies from being
threatened by ``one person putting one finger on their computer
that makes billions of dollars move around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate response to Annan's proposal was not clear Sunday
night. But there was some indication that it had not gone totally
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initiative is in the air,'' said Goran Lindahl, head of
Switzerland-based ABB Asea Brown Boveri Corp., who introduced Annan
to the gathering. ``The ball is in the air. It is up to business to
pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's proposal foresaw multinational business leaders pressing
governments to support U.N. agencies and foster business practices
that support human rights. ``You can at least make sure that you
yourselves are not employing underage children to forced labor,
either directly or indirectly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he urged corporate leaders to introduce practices
like collective bargaining, freedom of association, and
nondiscriminatory hiring and dismissal policies in the lands where
they have investments. ``We have to choose between a global market
driven only by calculations of short-term profit and one which has
a human face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In return for such commitments, Annan said the United Nations
would ``help make the case for and maintain an environment that
favors trade and open markets.'' But, he continued, ``Unless those
values are really seen to be taking hold, I fear we may find it
increasingly difficult to make a persuasive case for the open
global market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization is a fact of life,'' Annan continued. ``But I
believe we have underestimated its fragility. The problem is this:
The spread of markets far outpaces the ability of societies and
their political systems to adjust to them, let alone guide the
course they take. History teaches us that such an imbalance between
the economic, social and political realms can never be sustained
for very long.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over ways to couple free markets with reduced risk of
economic conflagration has dominated this year's Davos meeting,
traditionally a forum that couples earnest debate with frenetic
networking and, for some participants, the lure of skiing on trails
bathed in Alpine sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion has drawn in the International Monetary Fund, the
target of criticism for its rescue packages for emerging economies
that have taken the brunt of the global financial crisis. Stanley
Fischer, the fund's first deputy managing director, took issue
tartly Sunday with those who accused the organization of ignoring
social issues. ``This is arrant nonsense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, proclaimed that
unless the international financial system was ``fundamentally
reformed'' to overcome what he termed the ``incompatibility'' of
the world's economic and political systems, future crises were
inevitable.

KAFELNIKOV WINS AUSTRALIAN OPEN AND THANKS SAMPRAS FOR STAYING
HOME
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ Yevgeny Kafelnikov, no longer a one-Grand
Slam wonder, brandished his trophy in the direction of the
television cameras and concluded his victory speech with a personal
message: ``Pete. This is really a great, wonderful feeling. Thanks
for letting me do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov was expressing his gratitude to Pete Sampras, the
world's No. 1-ranked player, for skipping the Australian Open in
order to rest his weary mind and body.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov has long admired Sampras. He met him in 1991, when he
and his coach left the Soviet Union for three weeks of training at
Nick Bollettieri's tennis academy in Bradenton, Fla. Kafelnikov's
silken footwork and polished groundstrokes quickly caught Sampras'
eye, and Sampras asked the teen-ager to train with him.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, in their first official match, Kafelnikov
almost beat Sampras in the second round of the 1994 Australian
Open, losing by 9-7 in the fifth set. But despite that near-miss,
and his convincing victory over Sampras in the semifinals of the
1996 French Open _ where Kafelnikov would win his first Grand Slam
title _ the Russian has usually struggled against Sampras. And even
if Sunday's victory speech was light-hearted, Kafelnikov remains
acutely aware that the American is one of the finest players in
history and he, for the moment, is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Pete is in the tournament, you feel like he's
definitely the man to win,'' Kafelnikov said Sunday after his 4-6,
6-0, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1) defeat of Thomas Enqvist of Sweden. ``With his
absence, it opens up the field for everybody, including myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The field did open: The 10th-seeded Kafelnikov only had to beat
one seeded player, No. 15 Todd Martin, to win the title. But
Enqvist believes Kafelnikov's victory in Melbourne was hardly an
accident of history. ``I think Yevgeny could have a good chance to
win it, even if Pete was playing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So does Larry Stefanki, Kafelnikov's new coach. ``I've never
been with him when he played Pete, but I think his viewpoint might
change. I don't think he's second in line to anybody right now,
Pete included.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be Stefanki's job to convince Kafelnikov. An American
and former touring professional, Stefanki coached John McEnroe near
the end of his career and coached Marcelo Rios when Rios reached
last year's Australian Open final and then rose to No. 1. ``Yevgeny
is more of a grinder, Jimmy Connors type,'' said Stefanki, who
split with Rios last summer. ``Marcelo and Mac were more artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he had an offer to coach one of the game's most pleasant
people, Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden, Stefanki said he chose Kafelnikov
because of his potential, and because he sensed a change in a young
man who, after being reared in a communist state, has earned a
reputation for being more interested in things like his monogrammed
Ferrari and private plane than in major titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about the cash anymore for him; I really think
he has had a look at his priorities,'' Stefanki said. ``He told me,
`I've got a window of two or three years, and if I'm not going to
do it in that window, I'm not going to do it.' That rang home for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Stefanki likes Kafelnikov's commitment, he does not like
his schedule. The Russian has played more matches than any other
man on the ATP Tour in four of the last five years (he would have a
perfect record if not for a broken hand in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   And instead of celebrating in style in Melbourne tonight,
Kafelnikov and Stefanki were boarding a plane so Kafelnikov could
accept a wild-card entry into this week's event in Marseilles,
France. Stefanki said that Kafelnikov is playing to return a favor
to the tournament director, but loyalty does not explain why he has
entered 10 events in the next 11 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't play that schedule; no human could,'' Stefanki said.
``I told him that, `Your whole goal is to get to the top, that's
why you hired me and why we kind of magnetized to each other, but
you're playing too much.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov, who will rise to No. 3 in this week's ranking, has
experienced considerable change in the past year. He was married in
July and now has an 11-year-old stepdaughter and 3-month-old
daughter. He also split with his longtime coach Anatoly Lepeshin,
the former Soviet junior coach and father figure who helped
Kafelnikov navigate the precarious period after the Soviet Union
disintegrated. For the past seven months of 1998, Kafelnikov, a man
who once said he required ``a strong hand'' to keep him on task,
was without a coach and briefly considered retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was looking for was motivation, and I needed a guy I
can really play for, because when I was on my own I had nobody
behind me,'' he said. ``But now I do feel like this could be my
year because I'm quite established in my personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefanki and Kafelnikov are complementary: Stefanki is as
gregarious as Kafelnikov can be guarded. But they have more in
common than a love of golf. Both are strong-minded, and both liked
most of what they saw on Center Court Sunday when Kafelnikov,
seeded 10th, reaped the rewards of his versatility against the
unseeded Enqvist, who was unable to sustain the backcourt
brilliance that carried him into his first Grand Slam final.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the first set, Enqvist lost nine games in a row,
making a rash of unforced errors as Kafelnikov tracked down his
shots and varied the pace and spins of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think Thomas is more one-dimensional,'' Stefanki said.
``Yevgeny has about three or four dimensions he can fall back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Enqvist's awkwardness in transition from baseline to net does
not allow him to take advantage of the weak shots he forces with
his huge groundstrokes. He swings away and serves hard, and when it
is all working, it can be overwhelming, but when the timing on his
flat, high-risk strokes goes awry, the result can be about as
inspiring as the self-contained Enqvist in an interview room.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov can be much more diverting in his imperfect English.
``I mean there's a lot of different things that happen to me to
just relieve pressure from my head,'' he said Sunday. ``I feel a
lot flexible right now, a lot happier than I was. When you combine
those things, you feel like you can jump over the China Wall
without having any difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, all he has to do is jump over Sampras. &QL;

   &UR; THE AGES OF THE MEDIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the media today, writes &UR; James Fallows &LR;  in
American Prospect magazine, is that journalists are too old.
Fallows, a former editor of U.S. News &AMP; World Report currently
working for Microsoft, says that ``people who have set the media
tone during the Monica era'' are ``a complacent establishment,''
uninterested in ``testing, improving and expanding the
possibilities of its craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallows singles out  &UR; Sam Donaldson &LR; , 65;  &UR; Cokie Roberts &LR; , 56;
 &UR; John McLaughlin &LR; , 72; and &UR; Maureen Dowd &LR; , 47. Although his theory is
somewhat related to  &UR; Calvin Trillin &LR; 's more lighthearted
description of commentator ``gasbags'' in Brill's Content, response
to Fallows' analysis has been serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need a Washington blowhard like Jim Fallows to lecture
me,'' said  &UR; Howard Fineman &LR; , 51, of Newsweek.  &UR; Howell &LR; 
 &UR; Raines &LR; , 56, of the New York Times, called Fallows a ``fount of
dangerous nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallows, 50, notes that he's ``younger than most members of the
Punditariat. But I'm older than everybody here at Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHINING STARR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alice Starr &LR; , wife of the special prosecutor who has produced
America's longest-running political sitcom, says in the March issue
of Ladies' Home Journal that she and her man have been faithful to
each other, and she's glad she's not  &UR; Hillary &LR; 
 &UR; Clinton &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   She said she is certain as to what she would do if she were in
the first lady's place: ``I'd rather not be married to someone who
doesn't love me enough to remain faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;

   - An interviewer from the national public radio station of
Hungary terminated a question-and-answer session with former chess
champ &UR; Bobby Fischer &LR;  when Fischer began ranting about ``those damn
Jews.'' Fischer, 55, who lives in Budapest, arrived at the
interview carrying a portable radio to verify that it was being
broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Tom Hanks &LR;  has signed up for a $257,500-a-year luxury suite

   &UR; THE AGES OF THE MEDIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the media today, writes &UR; James Fallows &LR;  in
American Prospect magazine, is that journalists are too old.
Fallows, a former editor of U.S. News &AMP; World Report currently
working for Microsoft, says that ``people who have set the media
tone during the Monica era'' are ``a complacent establishment,''
uninterested in ``testing, improving and expanding the
possibilities of its craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallows singles out  &UR; Sam Donaldson &LR; , 65;  &UR; Cokie Roberts &LR; , 56;
 &UR; John McLaughlin &LR; , 72; and &UR; Maureen Dowd &LR; , 47. Although his theory is
somewhat related to  &UR; Calvin Trillin &LR; 's more lighthearted
description of commentator ``gasbags'' in Brill's Content, response
to Fallows' analysis has been serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need a Washington blowhard like Jim Fallows to lecture
me,'' said  &UR; Howard Fineman &LR; , 51, of Newsweek.  &UR; Howell &LR; 
 &UR; Raines &LR; , 56, of the New York Times, called Fallows a ``fount of
dangerous nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallows, 50, notes that he's ``younger than most members of the
Punditariat. But I'm older than everybody here at Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHINING STARR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alice Starr &LR; , wife of the special prosecutor who has produced
America's longest-running political sitcom, says in the March issue
of Ladies' Home Journal that she and her man have been faithful to
each other, and she's glad she's not  &UR; Hillary &LR; 
 &UR; Clinton &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   She said she is certain as to what she would do if she were in
the first lady's place: ``I'd rather not be married to someone who
doesn't love me enough to remain faithful.''

LAST HOLDOUTS JOIN OTHER AIRLINES IN RAISING FARES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ United Airlines, Trans World Airlines and US Airways
joined the other large domestic airlines and raised their fares
over the weekend, virtually assuring the success of the first
industrywide fare increase in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Several carriers had been pushing for an increase for months,
but their efforts were thwarted by Northwest Airlines, which
refused to go along. But on Friday, Northwest followed Delta Air
Lines, raising prices 2 percent on last-minute, walk-up fares most
often paid by business travelers and 4 percent on advance-purchase
tickets aimed at vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines quickly raised prices, followed by the three
holdouts: United, TWA and US Airways. While Northwest or another
airline could still roll back prices, forcing others to follow
suit, industry analysts say that is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is safe to say that it will stick,'' Samuel
Buttrick, an airline analyst with Paine Webber in New York, said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While there has not been an across-the-board increase since
1997, fares have regularly risen on individual routes. Buttrick
said the latest increase would have little effect on consumers who
shop for discounts because the airlines would still run sales
featuring ticket prices at the current levels or lower. Indeed,
United announced a sale on Friday, hours before it adjusted its
general fare structure to reflect the new increase.
</P>
<P>
   However, corporations, which have seen business fares rise 34
percent over the last three years, according to American Express
Co., will see another increase. Many companies have started buying
restricted leisure fares, preferring to pay the $75 penalty for
changing flights because the total cost is still cheaper than the
walk-up fare. Others are cutting travel or encouraging alternatives
like video conferencing to save money.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives and industry analysts said that the increase
was justified even though inflation was less than 1 percent last
year because revenue has been declining. This year, the airlines
plan to add about 5 percent more seats, putting further pressure on
their profits.
</P>
<P>
   Delta led the fare increase after it failed last week in an
attempt to add a $1 surcharge on tickets not booked through its
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, corporations and some vocal politicians have
complained that air fares are already too high and threaten to
strangle economic growth in regions not served by two or more
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to take away the expectation and the privilege
for an industry to raise prices if it can,'' said Kevin Mitchell,
chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which lobbies on behalf
of several large corporations. ``The problem is if it is in the
absence of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks soared on Friday after Northwest matched Delta's
increase. But Buttrick said the price increase was not a panacea
for the industry. He estimated that the fare increase would bolster
industry revenue by 1.5 percent this year, significantly less than
the 4 percent revenue growth he is forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to take more than this fare increase to get there,
based on recent trends,'' he said.

BET ME BEST SHOWS SPEED BUT RAISES A QUESTION ABOUT DISTANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Three months before the Kentucky Derby, seven
smart 3-year-old horses took to the Triple Crown trail Sunday. But
nobody was leaping to any conclusions, even though the undefeated
Bet Me Best won the Hutcheson Stakes at Gulfstream Park for his
sixth consecutive victory after a blistering speed duel with the
favored Texas Glitter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first appearance in the big leagues for Bet Me Best,
who had dominated his first five starts last year over lesser
opponents at lesser tracks in Louisiana and Texas. But the chestnut
gelding arrived in the big time with all of the rocketing speed
that had kept him in front of every opponent he had faced in the
minors. He won his debut by 16 lengths, won his first five by an
average of eight lengths and showed off the speed that had prompted
his trainer to call him a ``freak.''
</P>
<P>
   The freak did not blink Sunday, despite his new surroundings and
his new rivals, although for the first time in his career he was
reported second in the running as he and Texas Glitter shot to the
front of the field of seven and raced stride for stride.
</P>
<P>
   They were clocked in 21 3/5 seconds for their first quarter of a
mile. They flew half a mile in 43 3/5 seconds, three-quarters of a
mile in 1:08 1/5. Then they slowed down as they shot down the
homestretch, going the final furlong in 14 seconds and finishing in
1:22 1/5 for seven furlongs. Three-and-a-half lengths behind them
came Cat Thief, one of the stars of the class who lost the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile in November to Answer Lively by a length.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Walden, who trains Bet Me Best for Jack and Art Preston
of Houston, with whom he teamed to make a Triple Crown star of
Victory Gallop, took his latest success with a large dose of
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to try him longer,'' Walden said. ``Whether he will go
longer, I don't know. The Kentucky Derby is an extreme stretch. But
a mile race like the Gotham is not.''
</P>
<P>
   The 125th Kentucky Derby will be run at Churchill Downs in
Louisville on May 1 at a mile and a quarter, which is three-eighths
of a mile longer than the Hutcheson. For a 3-year-old, the extra
distance is often crucial. A horse with sensational speed like Bet
Me Best can run fast, but nobody knows if he can run far.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pletcher, who trains Texas Glitter, winner of the
Spectacular Bid Stakes at Gulfstream by five lengths, kept his
cool, too, saying: ``I think we want to stay sprinting, but I'll
talk it over with the owners and we'll plan it from there. At this
point, he seems to be a good sprinter.''
</P>
<P>
   Only D. Wayne Lukas, who trains Cat Thief, found some comfort in
the long view. He already knew that Cat Thief could run fast and
even long, and he found nothing to dispute either contention in the
Hutcheson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can close on 1:08 1/5, we'll be all right down the
line,'' said Lukas, a specialist in Triple Crown racing. ``He made
a strong move through the stretch, and that's what I like to see.
We'll leave him here for the Fountain of Youth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fountain of Youth Stakes, which will be run at Gulfstream on
Feb. 20 at a mile and a sixteenth, is the next milestone for Triple
Crown dreamers. The third and final Florida prep race for the
Kentucky Derby is the Florida Derby at a mile and an eighth on
March 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutcheson has traditionally shaped up as one of two things:
either a logical step on the road for 3-year-olds with Triple Crown
pretensions, or a race that favors sprinters, whatever their
expectations might be. It often raises more questions than it
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been winning in the minor leagues,'' Walden said before
saddling Bet Me Best for the Hutcheson. ``He's never even run
behind another horse. Now, he's got to do it in the major
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bet Me Best was cast as the third choice at 3-1 behind Texas
Glitter, the local favorite who had won a stakes race at Gulfstream
earlier in January, and Cat Thief, a son of the accomplished Storm
Cat. And these three dominated the action once the gate opened.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, it was almost a match race between Texas Glitter
and Bet Me Best, with the late-running Cat Thief watching them.
Running second may have been a learning experience for Bet Me Best,
but he evidently learned. After a quarter of a mile, he was half a
length behind; after half a mile, he was still racing half a length
behind.
</P>
<P>
   As they turned for home, he poked his head in front, only to see
Texas Glitter under John Velazquez recover and take a tiny lead
again. And they flew down the stretch that way, head to head, until
they crossed the line and Bet Me Best snatched it by the length of
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fast dude,'' said Jerry Bailey, who rode Bet Me Best
for the first time. ``Elliot told me to drop him behind Texas
Glitter and let some dirt get kicked in his face. It just didn't
happen.''

GRANT NURSES A SORE HAND FOR A TECHNICAL KNOCKOUT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Grant hurt his right hand in the third round of his
heavyweight bout with Ahmad Abdin Saturday night at the Atlantic
City Convention Center. No doubt the injury came from bouncing the
hand off the skull of his former sparring partner one too many
times.
</P>
<P>
   So Grant did what any prudent boxer would do: he rested the hand
for a few rounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth round Grant decided that he had rested the hand
enough, and he unleashed it. Too bad for Abdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to hurt when I threw it and it landed, but
I did what I had to do,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdin, who had absorbed a tremendous amount of punishment
throughout the fight, took the right uppercut to the midsection and
dropped to the canvas. He got up at the count of seven, but it was
the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th, Grant, his hand apparently feeling much better,
dropped Abdin with a crunching right to the side of the head. Near
the end of the round, Grant loaded up with combinations and sent
Abdin to the canvas again. Abdin got up from both knockdowns, but
it was too much.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting the start of the 11th round in his corner, Abdin
did not respond to some questions from Referee Ed Cotton. Dr.
Kenneth Remsen told Cotton to stop the fight, giving Grant (29-0) a
10th-round technical knockout of Abdin (25-2-3) and continuing
Grant's climb up the heavyweight ladder.
</P>
<P>
   It was not Grant's best-looking performance. He had been out of
the ring for nine months, with most of the time spent recovering
from hepatitis A. But it was a very smart, strategic fight.
</P>
<P>
   Though he looked like Adonis, Grant did not have much snap on
his punches in the early rounds. He knew he was not going to knock
out Abdin, who is known as a durable boxer who comes straight
ahead. So Grant set about breaking Abdin down. He used his jab,
landing 148 of 478 according to the CompuBox punch statistics, and
landed half of his power punches (111 of 224).
</P>
<P>
   Bob Spagnola, Abdin's manager, said Abdin injured a rib in
training camp and that the injury played a big part in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant took over the fight when he started going to the body,''
Spagnola said. ``The turning point in the fight was when he ripped
that uppercut to the body. That hurt Abdin.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant said he was surprised when Abdin went down from that shot.
But at that point he knew the fight was his. The other surprise for
Grant was that Cotton took away a point for a low blow in the
fourth round. Grant said he did not receive a warning before Cotton
took away the point.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, Andrew Golota cranked out a 12-round unanimous
decision over Jesse Ferguson, a last-minute replacement for Jimmy
Thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Golota also put together a heady performance. He probably failed
the audition for a bout with Mike Tyson, mainly because he was
accurate with his punches and was able to sting Ferguson, a tough,
wily veteran, with some well-placed left hands. Golota will have to
look elsewhere for a major payday. His victory sets up a possible
match with Grant for later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to make a Grant-Golota fight,'' said Lou DiBella,
senior vice president of HBO/TVKO, who recently signed Grant to a
long-term deal. ``Mike needs an early signature fight in terms of
saying to the world: `I've arrived. My time is here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Grant, 26, said it did not matter to him whom he fought. He said
he is leaving that decision up to his trainer, Don Turner.

MICROSOFT FATE HANGS ON ISSUE OF CREDIBILITY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The legal standard of proof in the Microsoft antitrust case, as
a civil action, is the court's judgment of which side is favored by
a ``preponderance of the evidence.'' The mere phrasing suggests a
carefully calibrated balancing _ 51 to 49 is all it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   But since so much of the case revolves around what happened at
private meetings between Microsoft Corp. and other companies, the
judicial balancing will lean heavily on a wholly subjective
criterion: credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for the high ground on the credibility issue started
on the first day of the trial, back in October, with the
government's showing parts of the videotaped deposition testimony
of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. He came off as combative, evasive
and forgetful. Put simply, he did not act or sound like Bill Gates.
The government's clear message from the start: What Microsoft says
is not believable.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until last week that Microsoft's defense of its
actions and its credibility began in earnest, when the first of
nine Microsoft executives took the stand. Starting with Paul
Maritz, the most senior company executive to testify in person,
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has begun hearing the
Microsoft side of things.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who alone will decide the outcome of the case at the
district court level (subsequent appeals are certain), must weigh
the atmospherics and particulars surrounding each of the episodes
in dispute as he decides.
</P>
<P>
   So the question becomes: Whose revisionist history is more
credible?
</P>
<P>
   To give a flavor of the task facing Jackson, it is useful to
take a closer look at two of the allegations in the case _ that
Microsoft tried to persuade Netscape Communications Corp. illegally
to divvy up the Internet browser market; and that Microsoft
strong-armed Apple Computer Inc. into favoring Microsoft's browser
over Netscape's.
</P>
<P>
   Both episodes came up last week in court, and surely will again.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, 1995, a group of Microsoft executives met with
Netscape and, according to the government, offered a collusion
deal, a violation of antitrust laws. The government has some
incriminating evidence that includes meeting notes typed by Marc
Andreessen of Netscape suggesting a ``threat'' that Microsoft would
take the browser market for its Windows 95 operating system and
``that Netscape should stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   Most facts about the meeting were known before the government
filed suit last year, including Microsoft's proposal to buy a stake
in Netscape, take a board seat and share information and plans.
Netscape rejected the proposal, shunning what it regarded as a bear
hug by a rival.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's interpretation of the June 1995 meeting
as an invitation to collude was a new and damaging wrinkle. Still,
there is some wiggle room on this for Microsoft. A four-page letter
by Netscape's outside counsel in response to a subpoena from the
Justice Department _ a subpoena issued, intriguingly, a day after
the meeting _ details the Microsoft proposals, including a threat
to withhold technical information. But it does not mention an
invitation to divide the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, James Barksdale, the president of Netscape, has
said that the ``singular act'' prompting him to complain personally
to the Justice Department was Microsoft's threat to terminate the
Windows license of the Compaq Computer Corp., if it did not bundle
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser with the operating system.
That threat did not come until June 1996, a year after the
Microsoft-Netscape meeting. Barksdale, a star witness for the
government, is not an antitrust expert, but his comment does raise
questions about how incriminating the June 1995 meeting really was.
</P>
<P>
   In the Apple deal, the government alleged that Microsoft
threatened to stop developing its Office Suite (word processing,
spreadsheet and database software) for the Macintosh unless Apple
made Internet Explorer the preferred browser on Macintosh
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replied that the browser was a modest element in its
August 1997 deal with Apple, which included an investment of $150
million in Apple and an undisclosed payment (estimated at $100
million) to settle a patent dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the trial, Microsoft claimed that a faltering Apple
was then threatening to file a $1.2 billion patent suit. The patent
issue, Microsoft insists now, was the primary focus of the 1997
deal.
</P>
<P>
   When the Apple deal was announced, the patent issue was not
featured, so many people have viewed that defense with considerable
skepticism. But Microsoft executives, including Maritz, have tried
to strengthen the patent argument. First, from a public relations
standpoint, Microsoft said it wanted to emphasize positive elements
of the deal instead of declaring that there was money to be made
threatening Microsoft with patent infringement.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft said that the Apple deal had to be seen in the
context of its patent disputes throughout the 1990s, after a jury
ordered Microsoft to pay $120 million to Stac Electronics Inc. in a
patent case. Microsoft then settled by investing more than $40
million in Stac, taking a 15 percent stake in the company _ and
later reached patent agreements with and made investments in
several companies including Wang and Digital Equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, has negotiated
most of those deals, and the Apple deal. The $250 million price
tag, Maffei insists, was too rich for a browser-driven deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be fired if I gave Apple $250 million to get Internet
Explorer on the Mac,'' Maffei said in an e-mail exchange on the
subject with a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, David Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer,
raised questions in court about Microsoft's account. Repeatedly,
Maritz emphasized that the patent matter was the ``primary'' or
``overriding'' issue in dealing with Apple. But Boies noted that
Microsoft's lawyers had scoured the company for documents to
support its case, but had not been able to find ``a single one that
characterized the patent issue as the `primary' or `overriding'
concern.''

SEARCH TOOLS MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds. See also INTERNET-MUSIC-SALES) 
(DW) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the recording industry struggles to cope with online
music distribution, the public is finding it increasingly easy to
search for digitally retrievable songs, both licensed and
unlicensed.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos Inc., one of the most-used Internet search services, plans
to announce Monday a vast new data base of a half-million files
available for downloading in the MP3 format _ a technical standard
that makes it easy to transmit music files.
</P>
<P>
   This new data base, at mp3.lycos.com, is a highly focused search
engine that will scour the World Wide Web for sites with MP3 files,
said Robert Frasca, general manager at Lycos, which is based in
Waltham, Mass. He said a searcher need only enter a song or a band
name to get a list of links at which the music can be downloaded.
Numerous sites provide data bases of MP3 music, but Frasca said
that none of them were major search engines and that the Lycos data
base would be ``10 times'' the size of any existing MP3-specific
search tool.
</P>
<P>
   Frasca said Lycos would not initially try to distinguish pirated
MP3 files from licensed recordings. He said Lycos was no more able
to police MP3 piracy than it could the distribution of
adult-oriented material on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a search engine; all we're doing is showing people where
the material is on the Net,'' he said. ``We're not playing cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Frasca said the company decided to create the search engine
because the fastest-growing number of queries on Lycos was for MP3
files. He said that MP3 searches were ``nonexistent'' last summer
but were now among the top five types of queries on Lycos. The new
data base will be intended specifically to support comprehensive
MP3 searches.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc., the San Jose,
Calif., company that makes the Rio, a portable device for playing
MP3 files, introduced its own MP3 file data base, called Rioport,
at www.rioport.com. The company's vice president, Ken Wirt, said
the site did not search the Internet, but instead provided links to
sites that did not contain pirated music.
</P>
<P>
   Wirt took issue with the Lycos policy on MP3 searches. ``Helping
find pirated files is not a good thing,'' Wirt, whose company has
helped stir the MP3 debate, said.
</P>
<P>
   Record industry officials have expressed fears that the Rio
would increase the demand for MP3 files, whether pirated or
copyrighted. But last October, a federal judge in Los Angeles
refused a request from the recording industry to block production
of the Rio.

GENERAL CHALLENGE COULD BE SPECIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ When San Diego's John and Betty Mabee sold Del Mar
Futurity winner Worldly Manner to Dubai's Godolphin Stables for $5
million last fall, they said they were still confident of their
Kentucky Derby chances.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know why.
</P>
<P>
   The Mabees' General Challenge, who didn't even start racing
until Worldly Manner was overseas, is 3 for 3 after he and jockey
Gary Stevens won the 1 1/16-mile Santa Catalina Stakes at Santa
Anita on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And the California-bred gelding by General Meeting, out of
Excellent Lady, looks like a threat for longer distances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's kind of a special horse,'' said John Mabee, who
also has 3-year-old prospects in Finder's Gold and Excellent
Meeting, the latter a full sister to General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   From good striking range, Stevens challenged front-running Buck
Trout and Eddie Delahoussaye on the turn for home and pulled away
to win by three lengths in 1:42.93 on a track labeled ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck Trout saved second from Brilliantly, who, like the winner,
is trained by Bob Baffert. Mr. Broad Blade and Charismatic
completed the order. Two horses were scratched after overnight
rain.
</P>
<P>
   This was General Challenge's first two-turn race and his first
against non-Cal-breds after wins in a 6-furlong maiden race Nov. 28
and the 7-furlong California Breeders' Champion Stakes Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a very, very special horse to run with him
the last quarter-mile,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge paid $3.60. Recent winners of the $106,500
Santa Catalina include Derby winner Ferdinand (1986) and Larry the
Legend ('95).
</P>
<P>
   Next on his schedule: the one-mile San Rafael on Feb. 28. The
1[-mile Santa Anita Derby on April 3 is the local prep for the
1\-mile Kentucky Derby on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Mabees sell?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a tremendous amount of money to buy him,'' John
Mabee said. ``He's not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a busy weekend for fans who scout Derby hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, at Gulfstream Park near Miami, Louisiana product
Bet Me Best and jockey Jerry Bailey prevailed after a :21 3/5-:43
3/5 duel with Texas Glitter and John Velazquez in the 7-furlong
Hutcheson Stakes. Favored Cat Thief finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Bet Me Best, a stablemate of Belmont winner Victory Gallop, is 6
for 6 but paid a healthy $7 because he was stepping up to a graded
stakes.
</P>
<P>
   He was clocked in 1:22 1/5. Only Holy Bull (1:21 1/5, 1994) ran
a faster Hutcheson in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans, Breeders' Cup
Juvenile winner Answer Lively took a wide trip to seventh in the
Lecomte Handicap as Some Actor ($86.80) and Desert Demon (21-1) ran
1-2. It was Answer Lively's first start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Eddie Delahoussaye pulled within two of 6,000 with a cool
win aboard Point Proven.... The Mandella barn said Bright Valour
was scratched from the Santa Catalina with swelling in his right
foreleg.... Late bloomer? Three-year-old Apremont ran away with his
debut in 1:08.76 for 6 furlongs on the fast Santa Anita mud. The
Ron McAnally-trained son of Silver Deputy left odds-on Treasure
Hunt a poor third.... Chris Antley plans a comeback with two mounts
Wednesday.... Next weekend: the Strub (Event of the Year, Run Man
Run, Dr. Fong) and the San Vicente (Exploit) on Saturday; the San
Antonio (Free House, Malek, Lord Grillo) and La Canada on Sunday.

EWING STRUGGLES WITH A KNEE INJURY TO GET BACK IN SHAPE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The electrodes dangling from Patrick Ewing's
right knee Sunday might as well have been tethers holding back the
progress he has to make just to catch up to his former self.
</P>
<P>
   Out of sync and shape after a 14-month layoff that included just
four games, Ewing cannot find that half-step of quickness, lateral
movement or feel for the Knicks' updated system and personnel
without time on the floor. Sunday, he spent practice riding a bike,
receiving treatment and trying to reduce the swelling on a right
knee he mildly sprained against the Nets last Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worrisome that a guy so important to our bottom line of
winning or losing is missing practice _ particularly when he needs
as much as he can get,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said after practice
at Island Garden here. ``Just like every game has more value this
year, it's the same as practice. This is not just one practice, but
one of maybe 24 we have left in the season. We'd like to know what
Patrick has left and how healthy he is. Until you see it, you can't
be sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick's mistakes right now are all game reaction things,
like fumbling the ball, forgetting to block out and being a
half-step late.''
</P>
<P>
   His comeback has been marked by mistakes and missteps. In the
two exhibition games, he played 32 minutes, shot four of 10,
grabbed 11 rebounds and committed seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With so much ground to make up, Ewing is hoping to return to
practice Monday. But no one knows for sure. Once swelling and pain
crept into his knee last Saturday morning, Ewing said he requested
magnetic resonance imaging to reassure himself that no further
damage had been done. The tests were negative, but with swelling
still visible Sunday, he is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like everyone else, I need practice time,'' Ewing said.
``So it's unfortunate that I'm injured. I'm not going to rush
myself to come back, though.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, everything is rushed in this compact season. The Knicks
open on Friday in Orlando, Fla. But for a team that is developing a
new style less dependent on Ewing in the post, the prospect of not
having their superstar center on the floor then is not as
devastating as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team played without Patrick last year, and they managed
to get some wins,'' said Latrell Sprewell, who will take some of
the burden off Ewing. ``We're going to do what we have to do if
he's not there, but we're counting on him to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ewing's absence would have been insurmountable.
He was always the first option. Now, there are alternatives. So
many that Van Gundy stood before his team in a meeting last
Saturday night and harped on a theme of unselfishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is going to get theirs,'' Van Gundy said. ``I just
don't want that to be the focus. Everyone has people around them
saying, `Get yours, get yours.' You have to fight to be unselfish
in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair or not, Ewing has been perceived as a player who needed the
ball and craved the gratification of being the superstar. But now,
perhaps understanding the limitations his layoff have caused and
seeing the talent around him, Ewing appears more willing than ever
to step back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted the ball, and I always will want the ball,
but if I get double-teamed, I'll try to find the open people,''
Ewing said. ``That's what I've been doing since I've been here. I
just never get credit for it.''
</P>
<P>
   To pull off such unselfish plays, Ewing has to pass well. And
that skill has dogged him throughout his career. He has had to work
overtime in practice in an effort to perfect that area of his game,
just as he has in almost every other aspect of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick's not a talent guy who can just sit out,'' Van Gundy
said. ``I saw where Charles Barkley sat out, came off the golf
course and scored 22. Patrick can't do that. He needs practice and
repetition. Other than his size, he's had very few God-given
abilities. Everything he's worked for, he's had to work for. You'd
never call him The Natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Van Gundy continued to pound home the importance of having
Ewing on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's doing different things now and has different people
around him, but as I was just telling him, his importance to our
overall success remains the same,'' Van Gundy said. ``There's a
reason why he's the one here after all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is still a main draw. He still affects how defenses play
the Knicks and can still attract a double team. Not having him
healthy and active hurts his progress and the team's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Patrick realizes and we realize that he needs to be
very effective for us to be successful,'' Van Gundy said. ``Last
year, I thought we did a great job when he didn't play, and we had
so many injuries. But when you're talking about a key piece, and
you're thinking big thoughts, you need everybody.''

A JAZZ FUNERAL SENDS CHICKEN MAN OUT IN NEW ORLEANS STYLE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By RICK BRAGG  
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ People laughed as the dead man went by.
</P>
<P>
   First, before the funeral procession had even started, his
friends sprinkled a drop or two of gin on his wood casket in the
Charbonnet-Labat Funeral Home, because everyone who knew Chicken
Man knew he always liked to sip a little gin.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, mourners who never cried stood with tall, sweating cans
of Budweiser in their fists, grinning even as pallbearers carried
him from the chapel and slipped his casket into a black hearse
drawn by two white horses. Freddie Thomas, who had known Chicken
Man for years, lifted a black umbrella over his head and twirled it
around and around, laughing, joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a beautiful brother, man,'' he said, but before he
could explain why he seemed so happy, a brass band washed away his
words with ``A Closer Walk With Thee.''
</P>
<P>
   As the hearse and a processional of hundreds moved slowly toward
the French Quarter, the swaying brass band suddenly riffed from its
dirge into rich, hot Dixieland jazz, and the dignified march
changed into a quick, sweaty strut. On Bourbon Street, a bone-pale
stripper dressed in black underwear stood watching from a doorway,
clapping, laughing out loud. On Dumaine Street, a man picked up a
gin bottle and tapped it with a stick, keeping time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know the man,'' said 58-year-old Clementine
Louding, who shimmied and skipped with the procession down North
Rampart Street. ``I came for the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Man, whose real name was Fred Staten, was a self-taught
voodoo priest who got his name because he used to bite the heads
off live chickens in voodoo ceremonies. He was a shaman and a
showman who took home stray dogs and people. He was one of the
best-known faces in this city where being a little different has
never been quite different enough, so he rated a funeral of a kind
that is done only in New Orleans, where death has its own dance
steps, and the grave is just a place to rest your feet.
</P>
<P>
   It is called a jazz funeral, a true celebration of life that
makes the wakes and eulogies of other cultures seem deadly dull in
comparison. They have been going on here for as long as even the
older New Orleanians can remember, usually reserved for jazz
musicians, members of secret societies _ like the Masons _ or just
anyone who is beloved enough to draw a crowd, said Gregg Stafford,
a veteran trumpet player and leader of the Young Tuxedo Brass Band,
who has marched in jazz funerals for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with the jazz musicians, but in the 1980s other
people started wanting them for their own people, lay people,''
Stafford said, using the term that jazz musicians and other
entertainers use for anyone outside the city's culture of music and
magic.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz funerals have changed over the years, he said, from the
early days when the bands inched along the narrow streets of the
oldest parts of this city, breaking into their upbeat music only
when the march neared its end. Today, the party starts much
earlier, and people dance for miles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Man, who was 61 when he died of natural causes, ``was
voodoo in New Orleans,'' said Stafford, who sat in with the Treme
Brass Band for the funeral on Saturday. Chicken Man took tourists
on tours of the French Quarter, selling them candles labeled
``Blessed by Chicken Man.'' He strolled the Quarter in a black top
hat, carrying a long staff crowned with a plastic human hand and a
monkey skull. Tourists loved him.
</P>
<P>
   He was a survivor of the days ``when voodoo really existed in
the neighborhoods,'' Stafford said, when on almost every block
there was an old woman with a kitchen filled with potions and
petrified chicken's feet, who had learned this blend of African
religions and Catholicism from Haitian ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't exist that way now,'' he said. ``It's a dying
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Man, who made his living making voodoo dolls and potions
but died penniless, his friends said, because he gave almost all
his meager proceeds away, was almost laid to rest in obscurity. His
fame never translated into money, and in the past two years he had
been less a presence, fading from the public's memory. People here
knew he was dead but did not know that his body had been held for
more than a month at the coroner's office, because there was no
money to bury him.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a New Orleans businessman who had been out of the city
when Chicken Man died came home from a lengthy trip and paid for
the burial and hired the brass band and horse-drawn hearse to send
him out in style.
</P>
<P>
   The businessman, Earl Barnhardt, was a struggling bar owner here
in 1984, ``about to go under,'' he said. As a last resort, he asked
the tall, skinny Chicken Man to bless his bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the sign of the cross on all four walls,'' Barnhardt
said. ``Overnight, we became the bar of choice for the Tulane
college crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Barnhardt owns several businesses, and a few years ago he
flew Chicken Man to a bar opening in Houston, to bless that one.
``It's hard to buy a plane ticket for someone under the name of
Chicken Man.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, friends packed the tiny chapel. As drums pounded,
his mourners watched as two voodoo priestesses, Ava Kay Jones and
Miriam Chamani, sang and danced. They blew smoke from a cigar on
his casket, and then came the sprinkling of gin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I better give him a few more drops,'' Ms. Jones said. ``I
don't want him coming back to see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time to dance. Chicken Man's daughter, Anna Marie
Conzales, walked carrying his picture as the jazz funeral rambled
through the French Quarter, led by anybody who wanted to march
quicker, step higher. For the first block that was the man with the
black umbrella, Freddie Thomas, who was still grinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's such a beautiful way to go out, man,'' said
Thomas, a 43-year-old maintenance man.
</P>
<P>
   The band played ``This Little Light of Mine'' and ``Will the
Circle Be Unbroken,'' but at a tempo that coaxed even strangers to
step off the sidewalks and join in the dance. Puzzled tourists
thought it was just Mardi Gras come early. ``Heeeeeyyyyyyy,''
yelled a drunken man, until he saw the hearse wheel into view on
Bourbon, and then he took off his hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A proper funeral,'' Barnhardt called it.

STANFORD GRAD GOLDSTEIN WINS FORT WORTH TOURNEY

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Winning an invitational tournament in Fort
Worth doesn't hold the prestige of, say, upsetting a seeded player
in a Grand Slam event.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it had been awhile since Paul Goldstein, who
graduated from Stanford last year, accepted the winner's trophy and
first-place check in any event.
</P>
<P>
   So, while beating Greg Rusedski in the second round of this
year's Australian Open remains the biggest victory of his budding
professional career, Goldstein was happy to beat Michael Joyce,
6-3, 7-6 (7-5), to win the Colonial Jackson Walker yesterday at
Colonial Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played real well in Australia, and came here with a lot of
confidence,'' said Goldstein, who earned $5,000 in winning his
first tournament since a challenger event in Lexington, Ky., last
August.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein liked winning so much, he did it again in the doubles,
teaming with former TCU all-American David Roditi to beat Devin
Bowen and Brandon Coupe, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Roditi, who accomplished his goal of finishing in time to watch
the Super Bowl, has won the doubles all three years of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein won the singles with the all-around game that got him
into the final. He served consistently, hit solid ground strokes,
attacked occasionally to vary his game, and used his speed to cover
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very quick,'' Joyce said. ``That's his strength. He gets
a lot of balls back.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein handily won the first set, breaking Joyce's serve
three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a great first set, played aggressive and loose,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce, who didn't drop a set in winning his two matches to get
into the final, said he got off to a slow start because of a sore
knee. He was nailed by an Esteban Carril serve in doubles on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first set, I wasn't moving as well as I had been because I
was stiff,'' Joyce said. ``As the match went on, it loosened up a
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce picked up his game in the second set, and Goldstein
suffered a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second set, I tightened up a little bit,'' Goldstein
said. ``I started thinking about winning instead of just playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce had a couple of chances to prolong the match.
</P>
<P>
   The first came when he was serving for the set at 5-4, but was
broken on a backhand winner by Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   The second came when he had a 5-4 lead in the tie-breaker and
the serve for the next two points. But Goldstein won the first when
Joyce hit a forehand over the baseline, and the second when he
ripped a service return.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 5-5, I hit a good serve, and he came up with an
unbelievable return,'' Joyce said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein won the match with a volley after pulling Joyce wide
with his serve.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the chance to win his first tournament in five
months, Goldstein was motivated in the tie-breaker by the desire to
avoid a third consecutive three-set match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want that to happen,'' he said. ``I've had enough
three-set matches this week.''

LEWINSKY DEPOSITION TO FOCUS ON AFFIDAVIT, JOB, GIFTS BUT NOT SEX
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Monica Lewinsky is formally deposed before the
video cameras on Monday, she is expected to be questioned
intensively about three subjects, but not the one that started the
events that led to the impeachment trial: her sexual relationship
with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers who are acting as prosecutors in the case say
the three areas they will explore in their questioning of the
onetime White House intern are aimed at helping them build their
obstruction of justice case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to ask Ms. Lewinsky about her affidavit in the
Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit, in which Ms. Lewinsky denied
a sexual relationship with the president; the help the president
provided her in her New York job search in the midst of that
lawsuit, and her account of how Betty Currie, the president's
secretary, came to retrieve several gifts Ms. Lewinsky had received
from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The stark discrepancies between her account and that of the
president as to what happened between them bear directly on the
first article of impeachment, one that charges that Clinton
perjured himself by giving a false account of the sexual contacts
he had with her on 11 occasions. In essence, they have accused
Clinton of lying under oath when he told the grand jury that he was
only a passive recipient of her sexual favors.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the impeachment managers say they will not ask
explicit sex questions, in part because senators are squeamish
about it and because some senators believe there is more substance
in the second impeachment article, the one that charges Clinton
with a wide-ranging scheme to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   In that area, too, there are contradictory accounts, most
importantly about the gifts from Clinton to Ms. Lewinsky that were
under subpoena in the Jones case. Clinton has testified that he did
not tell Ms. Lewinsky to hide the gifts but rather that she would
have to comply with the Jones lawyers' subpoena, turning over any
gifts she had.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lewinsky told the grand jury that Mrs. Currie called her
to collect the gifts, which would suggest the retrieval was at the
behest of the president. Mrs. Currie, on the other hand, testified
that she went to Ms. Lewinsky's Watergate apartment to collect a
cardboard box of trinkets and apparel only after Ms. Lewinsky
summoned her to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The managers are expected to focus on records of telephone
conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and Mrs. Currie.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Dec. 28, 1997, Clinton met with Ms. Lewinsky
in the Oval Office and, according to her, they discussed what to do
about the gifts, which had drawn the interest of the Jones lawyers.
Ms. Lewinsky told the grand jury that the secretary came to get the
gifts later that day, about 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Both the managers and the White House have seized on a record of
a one-minute cellular call from Mrs. Currie to Ms. Lewinsky at 3:22
p.m. White House lawyers contend that the phone record demonstrates
that Mrs. Currie was telling the truth: She would not have been
calling to say she was coming over if she had already picked up the
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But the House managers questioned Ms. Lewinsky about this matter
last Sunday in her Washington hotel room and, an associate of hers
said, she stuck to her story, contending that there had been
several calls from Mrs. Currie that day.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors chose not to depose Mrs. Currie, both because of
pressure from the Senate to keep the witness list short and because
White House officials indicated that she would be too helpful to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The other two issues, Ms. Lewinsky's job search and her
affidavit, do not involve contradictory sworn statements as much as
complicated interpretations of events.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers say that the efforts of Clinton and his
confidante Vernon Jordan to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job she would
like in New York ``intensified'' after her name showed up on a list
of potential witnesses in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Their emphasis is on the idea that the help in getting a job
``intensified'' because the White House has produced evidence that
the job search actually began in the summer and Ms. Lewinsky even
contacted Jordan seeking his help more than a month before her name
showed up on the witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has said that the job was never a quid pro quo for
her cooperation in the Jones case. And she said that no one told
her to lie, a point repeatedly emphasized by White House lawyers.
The managers will take testimony from Jordan about the job search
later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation that the president encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to
submit a false affidavit, denying that they had had sexual
relations, has turned on the managers' insistence that Clinton knew
that any affidavit from her could be useful only if it were false.
The managers will most likely try to explore the conversations Ms.
Lewinsky had with the president in which he spoke about how an
affidavit could be useful to him.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers have noted in the president's defense that
Ms. Lewinsky believed without any prompting from Clinton that the
acts she had engaged in did not really involve sex. The evidence
for that is the conversation she had with Linda R. Tripp, who
tape-recorded Ms. Lewinsky telling her that performing oral sex on
the president did not amount to sex because it was not intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   In one conversation, Ms. Lewinsky tells Mrs. Tripp that she does
not believe she engaged in sex with Clinton. ``We didn't have sex,
Linda,'' Ms. Lewinsky says on one of the tapes. Mrs. Tripp replies,
``Well, what do you call it?'' _ to which Ms. Lewinsky responds,
``We fooled around.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky then says that ``having sex is intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Under that reasoning, the White House has argued, Ms. Lewinsky
could indeed provide an affidavit that would be both helpful to the
president and one she believed was truthful.

<P>
   RICHMOND, South Africa _ This small rural town in the
politically troubled KwaZulu-Natal province buried nine people this
weekend, including the local leader of an opposition political
party, Sifiso Nkabinde, who died in a hail of bullets on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Nkabinde was laid to rest in a golden coffin and his family
bumped over the dirt roads to the service and the burial in a
stretch limousine, in a country where few can afford such opulence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hundreds of patrolling soldiers and police officers
deployed to keep peace, Nkabinde's supporters showed that they
still had weapons and would fire them at will, filling the air with
the crackle of gunfire just as the gravediggers began shoveling
dirt into his grave.
</P>
<P>
   Nkabinde, 38, was a charismatic figure that many experts say was
embroiled in a struggle for power in the area, after he was thrown
out of President Nelson Mandela's political party, the National
African Congress, on suspicion of spying for the former apartheid
government. He then joined the United Democratic Movement.
</P>
<P>
   But since his departure from the ANC more than 100 people have
died in Richmond in what appears to be a tit-for-tat exchange that
has left this region starkly divided along party lines, with
members of the United Democratic Movement living in an area called
Magoda and members of the ANC living in Ndaleni.
</P>
<P>
   With South Africa's second post-apartheid national elections
expected sometime between May and July, the situation in Richmond
is being carefully watched as a measure of how much violence might
be expected and how well the government can handle such
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1994 elections, thousands died in this province as
the ANC struggled for dominance against the Inkhata Freedom Party,
which received arms and other support from the white government.
</P>
<P>
   In this election year, many experts are wondering whether there
will again be interference by whites. Some believe that a loose
network of racist white farmers and police officials still exists
as a ``third force'' working to destabilize the province. The ANC
and the Inkhata Freedom Party have been engaged in peace talks, but
whether such an agreement will take hold at the lower echelons of
the party remains a question. And what role the fledgling United
Democratic Movement will play is also unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Untangling the violence here has always been hard because
political affiliations, family feuds, business interests and
personalities intermingle with an abundance of weapons and a
familiarity with killing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, monitors say they have recorded a slight
increase in political violence.
</P>
<P>
   Nkabinde's funeral was by far the showiest this weekend with top
United Democratic Movement officials, including the party's
president, Bantu Holomisa and his deputy, Roelf Meyer, taking part.
</P>
<P>
   But the day before was a far more subdued affair as seven ANC
supporters were buried, all members of the Ndabezitha family who
died within hours of Nkabinde's assassination in what is widely
believed to have been a revenge attack.
</P>
<P>
   Four gunmen opened up on the family as they were about to go to
bed in their mud-brick house, killing 11 family members. Four of
those killed were from out of town, and will be buried elsewhere
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many political funerals, however, this one was a lesson
in restraint. In the past, Mandela has attended such funerals and
blamed the ``third force'' for much of the violence. But this
weekend's event was short on high-level officials and even on
mourners, as ANC officials decided not to bus supporters to the
event as is usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to keep it as low-profile as possible,'' said Andrew
Ragavaloo, the mayor of Richmond and an ANC member. ``We did not
want to stir up emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13th funeral was for Mbongeleni Mtolo, who was shot by the
army shortly after the attack on the Ndabezitha family. Police
officials have refused to say whether ballistic tests link the
weapon Mtolo was carrying to the massacre at the Ndabezitha house,
though experts say that such tests should take about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond has been gripped by periods of political violence since
Nkabinde was ejected from the ANC and accused of working for the
former government. At one point, he was charged with 16 murders,
but was acquitted on all charges. Shortly after his release from
jail, gunmen sprayed the inside of a local tavern with machine-gun
fire killing several local ANC officials.
</P>
<P>
   While their leaders publicly called for peace, there was
noticeable tension on the road that divides Magoda and Ndaleni.
</P>
<P>
   When mourners waited at the edge of Magoda for Nkabinde's coffin
to arrive Saturday night, ANC supporters stood on a hill
overlooking the intersection singing taunts. On Sunday when
mourners drove out of the area through Ndaleni territory, dozens of
young men made obscene gestures at the buses.

LESSONS OF BALKANS APPLIED TO KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Clinton administration rallies diplomatic
and military measures to get talks going on a peace settlement in
Serbia's Kosovo Province, lessons appear to have been learned from
the long delay in moving to end the 3 1/2-year war in Bosnia. The
question is: Has enough been absorbed to avert another long Balkan
tragedy?
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months after the conflict in Kosovo erupted, Washington
has pushed the Europeans and Russia into calling the warring
parties in Kosovo to a peace conference.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was the driving force behind getting NATO to
agree Saturday, under certain conditions, to the use of air
strikes. Along with Britain, France and Germany, which have already
declared willingness to commit ground troops to monitor an eventual
peace settlement, the administration is also contemplating
deploying ground troops, albeit a much smaller contingent than in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But doubts still loom about how serious the administration is
about forcing President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, whose
forces it blames for mass killings in Kosovo in the past two weeks,
to yield.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the administration note that it was only after air
strikes against the Serbs in Bosnia _ and not before _ that
Milosevic was pulled to the negotiating table at Dayton, Ohio. Once
he was there, it took the heavy lifting of big names in the
administration: Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, and the weight of President
Clinton behind them to seal an 11th-hour deal among Milosevic and
the other feuding Balkan leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The talks between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians _ being
convened at a French chateau in Rambouillet, 30 miles southwest of
Paris, on Friday _ bear some superficial resemblance to the
successful Dayton conference. A deadline _ Feb. 19 _ has been
established for agreement, and the participants will be in the
pressure cooker of an isolated setting.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, Rambouillet lacks the heft of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   First, Milosevic himself will be absent, apparently fearful of
leaving his redoubt in Belgrade. Associates of Milosevic have
suggested that the Yugoslav leader fears that he has been secretly
indicted by the U.N. tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, and that
he risks arrest if he goes to France. Instead, the Serbian
delegation will be headed by Milosevic's longtime ally, Milan
Milutinovic, president of Serbia, who is unlikely to be able to do
anything without Milosevic's long distance assent.
</P>
<P>
   Second, even from Belgrade, will Milosevic listen to the two
co-chairmen of the conference, Robin Cook and Hubert Vedrine, the
foreign ministers of Britain and France? ``Cook is a good guy, but
can Cook deliver Milosevic? I doubt it,'' said a Clinton
administration official. The Americans are planning only a
mid-level delegation at Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   Third, if it is difficult to foresee Milosevic's agreeing to
grant even more autonomy to Kosovo than that he stripped away a
decade ago, what is the credible leverage against the rebels of the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army?
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by a faster supply of better weapons than they have
had before, the rebels may have little incentive to settle for less
than the independence of Kosovo that they seek.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that NATO can establish a blockade, as it has
suggested, against arms coming across the precipitous mountains
between Albania and Kosovo is not unlike suggesting a blockade in
Afghanistan, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has argued that the biggest stick
they have against Milosevic is the ``credible'' threat of NATO air
strikes. And with the 50th anniversary of NATO due to be celebrated
with lavish partying and platoons of heads of state in Washington
in April, the administration is anxious to solve Kosovo, rather
than its being an embarrassing blot on the alliance's credibility
as the festivities run their course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solved'' may in fact mean ``managed,'' so that Kosovo is on a
back burner, rather than supplying horrendous news of more
massacres.
</P>
<P>
   James Hooper, a retired American diplomat who is the executive
director of the Balkan Action Council, a bipartisan group of former
senior policy makers, said that even though the administration
pushed for the right of NATO to bomb the Serbs, it might choose to
back down at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper said he feared a repetition of October when Holbrooke, he
said, decided to ``trade in NATO air strikes for a phony cease-fire
with Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the administration does that,'' Hooper continued, ``then
what they are going to have is a hollow triumphal NATO
anniversary.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the skepticism, the past two weeks of diplomatic
maneuvering point to some progress in dealing with Milosevic and
the tangled web of Balkan conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The usually fractured Europeans have come together, a coalescing
of positions that Washington has long sought. The Blair government
in Britain is politically stronger, and more proactive, than the
administration of Prime Minister John Major. The Russians appear to
be on board, largely out of a desire not to be isolated in forums
to which they belong to _ in particular the Organization for
Cooperation and Security in Europe, which runs the mission of the
estimated 1,000 monitors in Kosovo and is the only European
organization in which Russia carries equal clout with NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   And in this crisis, the secretary of state is Madeleine
Albright, who comes from Central Europe, was forced to flee it as a
victim of terror, and appears to understand the implacability of
Milosevic. And the overall European commander of NATO is Gen.
Wesley Clark, who has argued within the administration that
Milosevic only understands force.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all positive,'' said an administration official who was
an insider critic of the policy toward Bosnia and spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``But it's not enough. If there were 100
bodies found in a massacre tomorrow and there were withering air
strikes against the Serbs and we had heavy hitters as negotiators
then you would be able to get Milosevic to the table. We're not
there yet.''

RECEPTION TO JORDANIAN UNDERSTUDY IS MIXED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Who would rule Jordan, an artificial entity of a
kingdom, friendless in a region of great turbulence, oil-less in a
region of great wealth?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: the Hashemites, who in their 76 years in power have
proved to be the Middle East's most enduring regime, thanks to
adroit balancing acts and maneuvering between fellow Arabs and the
West that began even under King Abdullah, the first ruler of the
nation Britain created by drawing lines on a map after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Can Jordan's new crown prince, Abdullah's namesake and
great-grandson, continue this tradition and guide his country
through what is still a dangerous neighborhood?
</P>
<P>
   The early, anxious answers from his worried compatriots display
a tentative optimism. ``Can it be brushed aside that Prince
Abdullah has spent most of his 37 years close to his father,
learning the intricacies of political decision-making from someone
like King Hussein, whose statesmanship has become the stuff of
legends?'' wrote Musa Keilani, a columnist, in Saturday's Jordan
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The new crown prince, who until his sudden elevation last
Tuesday was commander of Jordan's special forces, is an unknown
quantity; a brief, televised address at the weekend marked the
first time that most Jordanians had ever heard him speak.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges facing Jordan may be fewer than when his father,
King Hussein, was crowned in 1952. But they will still require an
extraordinary deftness. ``Jordan is too small and too weak to be
immune from trouble on its borders, a senior Western diplomat here
said. ``And so just like his father, the crown prince is going to
have to choose when to stand firm and when to make
accommodations.''
</P>
<P>
   After Queen Elizabeth of Britain, King Hussein is the world's
longest-serving head of state, a master of survival through a
47-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   He has dodged assassination, coup attempts, civil war, invasion
and plots from hostile neighbors _ sometimes with Western help, as
in outrunning Syrian fighter planes in 1956, and sometimes by
sticking a finger in the West's eye, as in embracing Iraq at the
time of the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Hashemites are outsiders in Jordan _ the family
is from the Hejaz, on the Arabian peninsula _ they have won
affection in this desert land. That popularity also has required
twists and turns; in large part to insulate himself from criticism,
King Hussein named a new prime minister, on average, every 11
months.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the king gravely ill with cancer in a Minnesota
clinic, the new crown prince, who turned 37 on Saturday, has
already had to take charge, receiving a string of visitors
including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and several Arab emissaries, among them three
senior envoys of the Saudi royal family and Seif al-Islam, son of
Libya's leader Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   Abroad and at home, many people are still looking for a clear
indication that the crown prince is prepared and able to navigate
around powerful neighbors _ Israel, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia _
who each demand their own particularly canny touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sign yet that he has his father's cunningness, or
his father's charisma, or his father's intuition,'' said a
Jordanian political analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``There is no question that he has a lot to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of Princess Muna, the king's British second wife, Crown
Prince Abdullah was educated from the age of 4 in Britain and the
United States, so English is his first language.
</P>
<P>
   And although he has shown warmth and poise in his few public
appearances, he has also demonstrated a poor command of classical
Arabic _ the language that protocol demands for all official
appearances. That could pose an obstacle to his efforts to forge a
bond with the Jordanian people.
</P>
<P>
   In past travels, the crown prince is said to have established
close ties over the years with his contemporaries from other royal
families in the Persian Gulf. But for decades Jordan's biggest
foreign-policy challenge has been just across the Jordan River in
Israel _ a fact underscored on Saturday, when the crown prince saw
Arafat in his first meeting with an Arab leader.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his father last week, the crown prince promised
to ``follow in your footsteps,'' and there is little doubt among
experts here, in Israel and in the United States that he intends to
hew close to his father's commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, the peace that King Hussein made with Israel in
1994 is not at all popular among most Jordanians _ 60 percent of
whom are Palestinians. They have yet to see the promised economic
gain, and that bitterness has been magnified by the breakdowns in
Israeli-Palestinian talks, which most people in Jordan see as
evidence of the Israelis' bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   The king could shrug off those domestic criticisms, but he had a
reserve of popular support that his son has not yet earned.
</P>
<P>
   Any collapse in the negotiations would ignite the kind of public
outrage hard for a novice leader to withstand.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even the establishment of a Palestinian state would raise
difficult questions for Jordan, which until 1967 governed the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A new confederation between Jordan and the Palestinians could
bring economic advantages. But uneasy Palestinians suspect that
Jordan would seek to dominate, while Jordanians harbor bitter
memories of the 1969-70 civil war in which King Hussein was nearly
toppled by Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is neighboring Iraq, where King Hussein's
cousin, King Faisal II, was overthrown in 1958, and which since has
been both enemy and partner.
</P>
<P>
   For Jordan, Iraq was a lucrative market before the Persian Gulf
war of 1991 _ one reason that King Hussein chose not to side then
against the Baghdad government. The U.N. sanctions on Iraq have cut
deep into that trade, although Iraq still supplies Jordan with
every drop of its oil under a barter arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The king has since made amends for what the West saw as betrayal
by taking tough stands against Baghdad, enough for the United
States to designate Jordan, in 1996, as a ``major non-NATO ally.''
</P>
<P>
   But that turn against Iraq, too, has bucked public opinion among
Jordanians, who yearn for the good old days of prosperous trade,
and who believe that any taunting of Saddam Hussein will only lead
him to retaliate. Anti-U.S. demonstrations in two cities last year
were quelled by Jordanian troops.
</P>
<P>
   In a possible sign of hope for warmer ties to come, Iraqi
newspapers have welcomed Crown Prince Abdullah's designation. The
Baghdad daily newspaper Babel called it ``one of the most
intelligent decisions that King Hussein has taken.''

POLITICAL MEMO: ANNOUNCING JUST ONCE NO LONGER IS ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ohio, N.H., Iowa, Ind., Tenn., Ariz., Kan., N.J.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It hardly qualifies as a political earthquake or
even a minor tremor. But in quiet, off-the-record conversations,
aides to Gary Bauer, a prominent religious conservative, telephoned
reporters last week to peddle what the aides seemed to think was a
momentous event: Bauer would appear on television on Sunday to
announce _ you can exhale now _ that he was forming an exploratory
committee as a step to seeking the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Bauer, you have an announcement?'' moderator Tim Russert
asked his guest on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do indeed, Tim,'' Bauer replied. ``I'm going to file papers
tomorrow with the Federal Election Commission to set up an
exploratory committee, and intend to run for president.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is not news. For months, Bauer has made no
secret of his quest for the White House. But in a gambit to draw as
much attention as possible to his underdog candidacy, Bauer is
trying to stretch out the obvious. In several public appearances,
he hinted that he was mulling over a decision. He kept up the faux
suspense days ago by announcing he was stepping down as head of the
Family Research Council, a fund-raising organization for social
conservative causes, to consider forming an exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the days when politicians with designs on the White House
would simply step up to the microphone and declare their
intentions. Now the calculation of presidential prospects is
obvious: Why announce only once if you can get away with doing it
five, six, seven or even a dozen times?
</P>
<P>
   This year, the trend toward multiple announcements has reached
the point of absurdity. Restless candidates are struggling to draw
press coverage and break through the omnipresent impeachment
coverage. Republicans are also trying to compete with the presumed
dominance of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has not announced
anything but commands more attention than perhaps all the
Republican contenders combined.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, politicians staged elaborately choreographed
declarations of their candidacies. Now, for the first time, they
are staging elaborately choreographed declarations that they have
formed exploratory committees, the organizations that some
candidates form before they assemble full-fledged campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, a Republican media consultant, said campaigns that
do not try to milk the most out of their intentions are foolish.
``You put out your 10-point plan to cure cancer and you get
nothing,'' he said, only half joking. ``You announce on the
Internet in Spanish that you're going to run and it's on the front
page of leading newspapers. The media is so process-oriented that
this is the kind of stuff they cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, will embark on what his
campaign is billing as its three-day ``Explora-Tour.'' It will
start in Columbus, Ohio, and wind through the early battleground
states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harris, Kasich's campaign spokesman, invited reporters to
cover the tour, and was even lining up a private jet. But he hopes
to draw more coverage weeks later when Kasich stages an even bigger
event to announce his candidacy. ``Don't come on this trip if it's
going to take away from ultimately coming on a trip when we make
our major announcement,'' Harris implored a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is the Democratic front-runner, Vice President Al
Gore sought to make the most of his pre-announcement: It was
scheduled during a lull in impeachment coverage before New Year's
Day. His aides telephoned reporters in advance to make sure they
would be around to cover it.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bauer's announcement Sunday did not mark the end of it. He
still plans, sooner or later, to stage a traditional, formal
announcement of his candidacy, red, white and blue bunting and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make some lemonade out of the lemon,'' said Jeff
Bell, an adviser to Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Some news organizations are drawing the line and telling
campaigns they will give them only one shot at a full-blown
article. There are times when a pre-pre-announcement is newsworthy:
Elizabeth Dole's decision to step down as head of the American Red
Cross to weigh a presidential bid and the announcement of an
exploratory committee by Sen. John McCain of Arizona had not been
expected by many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even networks sometimes fall for the nonevents. Sunday, CNN
was among the news organizations that covered Bauer's announcement
on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every so often, when the stars and moons align, the right
candidate with the right mini-announcement on the right day at the
right time in the news cycle can get at least some network
coverage,'' said Mark Halperin, the political director for ABC
News. ``The minimum effort involved in staging one of these _ and
the potential payoff in fund-raising and visibility _ makes it
worth it for them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The ploy worked for former Vice President Dan Quayle. For
months, he had left no doubt that he was running. And in a letter
to supporters he telegraphed that he was forming an exploratory
committee. But Quayle's staff tried to stir up still more publicity
by letting word out that he would announce his intention to form an
exploratory committee on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' That same day,
ABC News broadcast a report on Quayle that was pegged to that
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   In case no one noticed, Quayle will again announce formation of
his exploratory committee on Wednesday, in his native state of
Indiana. The next day, he will announce again in his adopted home
state, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Those events do not constitute Quayle's official declaration.
``The big one _ the actual, formal campaign kickoff _ will be in
April,'' said Jonathan Baron, a campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Ever competitive, candidates are mindful of how much attention
their competitors get. Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a
Republican who has been running _ openly _ since the day after the
1996 election, took note of coverage of a Democratic contender,
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, after he signaled his
intentions in November. ``Your paper gave Bill Bradley five days of
coverage!'' Alexander told a reporter in a slight exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Even Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate who never stopped
running for the Republican nomination after he lost in 1996 and has
assembled a huge campaign organization, seemed aware that he
sounded ludicrous the other day when he said of a possible bid, ``A
decision is coming in the next few weeks, but obviously I'm leaning
toward it.''
</P>
<P>
   The normally staid Forbes turned to reporters in Iowa and
remarked: ``I'm surprised that none of you have announced. Everyone
else seems to be doing it.''

MORE JAIL TIME MIGHT FINISH TYSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Was Mike Tyson's knockout of Francois Botha on
Jan. 16 his last fight?
</P>
<P>
   This week, either of two court decisions could send the former
world heavyweight champion back to prison, where he spent three
years for rape. And if he goes, two Nevada officials said, he won't
be welcome to fight in that state again.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday for allegedly
assaulting two motorists in Maryland in August. He pleaded no
contest in the case, which isn't an admission of guilt. A Maryland
prosecutor recommended last week that Tyson serve jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tyson is) nothing less than a time bomb buried in our own
backyard,'' Montgomery County, Md., State's Attorney Doug Gansler
said in a court memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson escapes prison time in that case, he could return to
jail for violation of parole from his rape conviction. Authorities
in Indiana, where Tyson was tried, are waiting until the Maryland
case is over before rendering their own decision.
</P>
<P>
   Any time behind bars that exceeds a few days or weeks would
certainly hinder Tyson's comeback after he lost his license for
more than a year for biting Evander Holyfield's ears.
</P>
<P>
   If he's put away for any more than, say, six months, it might be
nine months to a year before he could fight again. At 33, with
eroding skills and in a perpetually fragile emotional state, could
he resurrect his career a third time? And, even if he could fight
again, where would he do it?
</P>
<P>
   Comments made by Luther Mack and Elias Ghanem of the Nevada
Athletic Commission don't bode well for Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who voted to reinstate Tyson's license in October, told
the New York Daily News: ``If he goes to jail, we can't have him
fighting in Nevada.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghanem, the commission chairman, said even a 30-day or 60-day
term could result in a second license revocation that presumably
would never be reversed. Such a fate would mean he could fight only
in one of the few states without an athletic commission or a
foreign country, assuming other commissions would honor the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson might very well fight on the moon if millions of dollars
are at stake. And, yes, even after another layoff, he would be able
to generate enough money to ensure a big payday.
</P>
<P>
   However, he would become a pariah at that point, no longer a
legitimate force in the sport, a curiosity more than anything else.
In other words, at the very least, jail time would radically alter
Tyson's career.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't go back to jail?
</P>
<P>
   Many believe he already is little more than a sideshow. His
performance against Botha seemed to confirm that he's nothing more
than a solid heavyweight with a good punch.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Tyson who once terrorized the heavyweight
division fought his last fight a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Decent numbers: A surprising 10,221 people paid full-ticket
prices to see Tyson fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16 at the MGM
Grand in Las Vegas. That's the sixth-biggest live gate in the
history of boxing in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The fight grossed $7,051,800 for the live gate, which pales next
to the $14,277,200 earned by the second Tyson-Holyfield fight but
exceeded some predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Only four other Tyson fights and the first Oscar De La
Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez fight has brought in more money.
</P>
<P>
   Another estimated 750,000 watched the fight on pay-per-view
television. Promoters had hoped for at least a million but don't
consider those numbers a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a promoter or a fighter in the world that wouldn't
love to have those type of numbers,'' promoter Dan Goossen told the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we'll see how the next Tyson fight _ assuming he's not in
jail _ does now that the novelty of his return has worn off.
</P>
<P>
   Who's next? Cable television operators no longer consider Tyson
a guaranteed pay-per-view success. That's one reason Axel Schulz is
out as a possible opponent for Tyson on April 24. Promoters
realized after the Botha fight that Tyson needs a more marketable
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Briggs, American and better known than Schulz but
probably not as good, has emerged as a leading contender.
</P>
<P>
   No respect: Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer, isn't giving Lennox
Lewis much respect.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, whose fighter faces Lewis in a heavyweight-title
unification bout on March 13, served up the obligatory ``Holyfield
will fight the best fight of his life and will win'' to Reuters.
However, he went further. He questioned the Briton's fighting
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think he wants to fight,'' he said. ``When he
gets in there, he don't give his all. Fighters find a way to dog
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield is only a 6-5 favorite, according to Caesars Palace.
</P>
<P>
   On the rise: Heavyweight Lance Whitaker of Northridge will take
another step up in competition when he faces hard-punching Lou
Savarase on the undercard of the David Reid-Laurent Boudouani fight
March 6 in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker (18-0, with 15 knockouts) is coming off a tough
seventh-round knockout of veteran Alex Stewart on the Tyson-Botha
undercard. Whitaker was awarded the victory when Stewart couldn't
continue because of a cut, but Whitaker needed 12 stitches to close
a cut on his own left eyelid.
</P>
<P>
   Savarase (38-2, 32 KOs) is coming off a first-round knockout of
Buster Douglas on June 25. He had been a prospective opponent for
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, the Olympic champion, is getting his first world-title
shot when he faces WBA middleweight champ Boudouani.
</P>
<P>
   Boudouani, a Frenchman, is tough but not nearly as talented as
Reid. If he wins, Reid will become the third 1996 Olympian to win a
world championship. Floyd Mayweather and Fernando Vargas already
have won titles.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins defends title: Bernard Hopkins, one of boxing's most
talented champions, defends his IBF middleweight belt Saturday in a
rematch with Robert Allen in Atlantic City, N.J. on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, Hassine Cherifi defends his WBC middleweight
crown against Keith Holmes, from whom he took the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting twist: Javier Castillejo's upset victory over Keith
Mullings last week might be a boon to Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Mullings, who lost his WBC super welterweight title to the
Spaniard, was in line to face De La Hoya in a big-money fight.
However, Castillejo would be more marketable among De La Hoya's
biggest fan base: Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   The guess here is that Mexicans will strongly back De La Hoya _
a Mexican-American _ against a fighter from the mother country. And
Castillejo, while competent, would have almost no chance of beating
the WBC welterweight champ. &QL;

ANYONE HEAR ABOUT THE GREAT SOUND-OUT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It might have been a moot point to some, but to
the National Sports Fans Union, turning off the sound during
halftime of Sunday's Super Bowl was a mute decision.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to demonstrate a quiet yet clear message that ``the greed
in sports has gotten out of control and changes must be made,''
according to co-founder Steve Goldstein, the NSFU rallied its
10,000-plus membership through its Web site (http://www.nsfu.com)
to hit the mute button during halftime in defiance of the Super
Bowl sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let corporations know that we won't be watching
your commercials and we won't be buying your products,'' Goldstein
explained. ``In the big business of sports, the fan comes last. How
can the average fan afford $400 for a Super Bowl ticket? No one
cares, because it's not about fans anymore and that's why the NSFU
was created.''
</P>
<P>
   So there.
</P>
<P>
   With a $6 registration at the NSFU Web site, you're granted
votes on ``mission revolts'' and access to ``closed strategy
sessions'' _ plus a club window decal and ``power to the sports
fan'' stickers.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a warning that these people mean business. The site
explicitly states: ``If you're just going to wear our NSFU baseball
cap for `fashion'... don't join.'' Also: ``If you are not going to
call radio sports talk shows and communicate our cause, keep your
six dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-based organization was launched in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   More convergence: The Football Network
(http://www.footballnetwork.com) has merged resources with the
Internet's most extensive Web site run by the fans
(http://www.NFLfans.com) to cross-promote in hopes of helping each
other's cause.
</P>
<P>
   TFN is the Los Angeles-based cable TV network totally dedicated
to football. It launched last September but only as a channel with
minimum weekend programming available on satellite dishes. Plans
are for a more extensive launch in July.
</P>
<P>
   Golf stuff: According to a number of industry sources who report
their information to GolfWeb's equipment site
(http://golfweb.com/equipment/proreport), these are the clubs David
Duval used to shoot his record-tying round of 59 last week at the
Bob Hope Classic: a Titleist 975D driver, a Callaway S2H2 3-wood,
Titleist DCI 962 irons, a Cobra Trusty Rusty sand wedge and a
Scotty Cameron putter.
</P>
<P>
   And he was hitting Titleist Professional 90 balls. &QL;

THE MAN WHO PROTECTS AMERICA FROM TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard Clarke is the White House terrorism czar.
His stock in trade is the stuff of techno-thrillers _ biological
bombs in the Wall Street subway, chemical clouds of death in the
Pentagon parking lot, cyberwar attacks crippling the nation's
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Pale as skim milk, his once-red hair gone white at 48, he works
long days and nights in Oliver North's old office at the National
Security Council, keeping a profile so low that almost no one
outside his top-secret world knows he exists.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the government's chief counterterrorism group for
the past seven years, he has become what John le Carre calls an
``intellocrat'' _ a gray baron who seems to command nothing more
than his desk, yet waves a wand and sends soldiers, guns, money and
spies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke inspires ferocious loyalty from friends and fierce enmity
from foes inside the government. He wins praise for getting things
done in secret _ and criticism for exactly the same. At the
National Security Council, where he landed in 1992 after losing his
State Department job in a bitter battle over Israel's misuse of
American military technology, he can operate without outside
oversight so long as he has President Clinton's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   He has it. The president recently named him the nation's
counterterrorism coordinator, a new and powerful post. He has to
try to coordinate everything from the Pentagon and its evolving
plans to defend the United States against terrorists down to local
police and fire departments. Despite years of effort to pull it all
together, this has never been accomplished. There is no 911 number
for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of protecting Americans from attack, whether by
states or rogue groups, is ``almost the primary responsibility of
the government,'' Clarke says. He is trying to raise the fear of
terrorism in the United States to the right level _ higher, not too
high _ as he girds the nation against the possibility of an assault
from nerve gas, bacteria and viruses, and from what he calls ``an
electronic Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   He has to walk a fine line. ``You want people to understand the
peril without panicking,'' said Anthony Lake, his boss at the
National Security Council from 1993 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke has a reserved seat when Cabinet officers gather at the
White House on national security issues. ``My name is on the table
next to Madeleine Albright and Bill Cohen,'' the secretaries of
state and defense, Clarke said. His vote carries the weight of
those cast by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   He helped drive the decision to fire cruise missiles at
Afghanistan and Sudan in August, trying to strike at Osama bin
Laden, overpowering dissenters at the State Department and the CIA.
Now he is helping to steer secret operations aimed at capturing the
Saudi exile, who is accused of bombing two American embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke also has written at least four classified presidential
directives on terrorism. They helped expand the government's
counterterrorism cadres into the $11 billion-a-year enterprise he
now coordinates, stifling some protests at the Justice Department
and the Pentagon, which saw him as a competitor for money and
power.
</P>
<P>
   In his office, where a small sign reads ``Think Globally/Act
Globally,'' he spoke passionately about the threat of cyberwar,
invisible attacks on the nation's computers, a terror so insidious,
so arcane he has trouble convincing corporate chieftains and
political commissars it is real. But it is out there, somewhere, he
says, even if he can't prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a problem convincing people that there is a threat,''
he said. ``There is disbelief and resistance. Most people don't
understand. CEOs of big corporations don't even know what I'm
talking about. They think I'm talking about a 14-year-old hacking
into their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about people shutting down a city's electricity,''
he said, ``shutting down 911 systems, shutting down telephone
networks and transportation systems. You black out a city, people
die. Black out lots of cities, lots of people die. It's as bad as
being attacked by bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``An attack on American cyberspace is an attack on the United
States, just as much as a landing on New Jersey,'' he said. ``The
notion that we could respond with military force against a
cyber-attack has to be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone want to mount such an attack? ``To extort us,''
he said. ``To intimidate us. To get us to abandon our foreign
policy _ `Abandon Israel or else!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a few years from now: A president goes forth and
orders troops to move. The lights go out, the phones don't ring,
the trains don't move. That's what we mean by an electronic Pearl
Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Enemies and allies alike say Clarke wins battles by working
longer hours and twisting more arms. ``I like Dick so much for the
same reason that some people have not liked him: He has a passion
for getting things done,'' said Lake. ``That can be abrasive.''
</P>
<P>
   When thorny questions entangle political, military, diplomatic
and intelligence issues, Clarke cuts the knot. Are there human
rights concerns over sending helicopters to Colombia's army? Send
the choppers. Does the State Department want to reopen its embassy
in the Sudan, after reports of terrorist threats proved empty? Keep
it shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hammer,'' said Leslie Gelb, who gave him his first job
at the State Department 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is something to slam through, that's his task _ to
get people to do things they don't want to do,'' said Gelb, now
president of the Council on Foreign Relations, and formerly a
reporter and columnist for The New York Times. ``You don't expect
the highest quotient of political sensibility from Dick. They
didn't hire him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under President Reagan, Clarke was the second-ranking
intelligence officer at the State Department. His boss was Morton
Abramowitz. ``Dick is aggressive,'' Abramowitz said, ``a man with
strong views, with a great ability to tell people what the issues
are without spending 10 years doing it. He's a low-profile guy. He
has mixed feelings about having a profile at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke's profile first surfaced in 1986. He was an intellectual
author of a plan to use psychological warfare against the Libyan
leader, Moammar Gadhafi. Under his plan, flights of SR-71 spy
planes set off ``sonic booms over his head, to tell him his air
defenses couldn't stop us,'' and mysterious American rafts floated
up on the shores of Tripoli, Clarke said. The operation backfired
when the Reagan White House was caught planting a false report in
The Wall Street Journal about Libya's support of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Under President Bush, Clarke served as assistant secretary of
state for political and military affairs. In 1992, he was accused
by the State Department's inspector general of looking the other
way as Israel transferred American military technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an allegation that we hadn't investigated a huge
body of evidence that the Israelis were involved in technology
transfers,'' Clarke said. ``In fact, we had investigated it. I knew
more about it than anyone. We found one instance where it was true.
The Israelis had taken aerial refueling technology we sold them and
sold it to a Latin American country. We caught them, and they
admitted they had done it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The administration wanted to put heat on the Israeli
government to create an atmosphere in which the incumbent
government might lose an election. The bottom line was I wasn't
going to lie. I wasn't going to go along with an administration
strategy to pressure the Israeli government.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Funk, the inspector general who accused Clarke,
remembered the case differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's wrong,'' said Funk, the State Department's inspector
general from 1987 to 1994. ``He's being very disingenuous. Dick
Clarke was unilaterally adopting a policy that was counter to the
law and counter to the avowed policy of the government. It was not
up to him to make that determination. Almost all the people in his
own office disagreed with him. In the end, he had to leave the
State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke joined the National Security Council staff under Bush. He
was one of the only holdovers embraced by the Clinton
administration. After seven years, he has placed proteges in key
diplomatic and intelligence positions, creating a network of
loyalty and solidifying his power.

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: Chimps linked to start of AIDS
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The mystery of the origin of AIDS at last has been
solved.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the University of Alabama at Birmingham say they
have conclusively identified a subspecies of chimpanzee that is
native to west-central Africa as the original source of HIV-1, the
virus that causes AIDS in humans. The virus probably crossed over
into humans in the early part of this century when people began
hunting these chimps, named Pan troglodytes troglodytes, for food.
People likely were exposed to infected chimp blood when bitten by
them or while field-dressing killed chimps, said Dr. Beatrice Hahn,
professor of medicine and microbiology. Hahn presented her team's
findings Sunday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic
Infections here, an annual meeting of 3,400 AIDS doctors and
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery could have major implications for the development
of HIV therapies and vaccines, Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing aspects of the study, which involved
three Pan troglodytes troglodytes chimps, is that the infected apes
remained healthy; apparently the virus did not cause AIDS-related
disease in them. Because chimpanzees share 98 percent of their
genes with humans, the relatively small genetic difference between
chimps and people could hold the secret to how chimps are able to
withstand the virus while humans cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``By studying the biological reasons for this difference, we may
be able to obtain important clues concerning the pathogenic basis
of HIV-1 in humans and possibly new strategies for treating the
disease more effectively,'' said Dr. George Shaw, a UAB
investigator and study co-author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's wait five years,'' Hahn said. ``If we find within five
years the secret to HIV's pathogenesis, then I think our results
can be considered very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Further study of these chimps must be conducted to understand
the mechanics of how they usually become infected, whether through
sexual contact, bite wounds or mother-to-child transmission. In
seeking the source of the original virus, researchers analyzed all
known strains of HIV-1, including the primary strain responsible
for the global AIDS epidemic and other strains only found in
west-central Africa. They found these strains were closely related
only to strains of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV, the primate
equivalent of HIV) that infect Pan troglodytes troglodytes. The
conclusive factor was that this particular chimp subspecies is
known to inhabit the precise region of west-central Africa where
the HIV strains first were recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear is when the crossover from chimps to humans
occurred, but researchers know it must predate the 1940s, when HIV
first began spreading among humans. The earliest known human
infected with HIV was identified a year ago, fr0om a sample that
had resided for decades in a freezer at Emory University. A similar
bit of luck was involved in the UAB study. A female chimp who died
more than a decade ago turned out to be a crucial piece of the
puzzle. Blood samples from her autopsy had lain forgotten in a
freezer until a researcher found them and mentioned them to Hahn.

CLINTON'S BUDGET INCLUDES NEW DOMESTIC PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will release a $1.766 trillion
federal budget blueprint for 2000 on Monday that proposes billions
of dollars in new spending while preaching fiscal conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget plan will ask Congress for substantial new
money for scores of domestic programs popular with liberal and
middle-class constituencies, from urban housing vouchers to new
classroom construction.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, taking advantage of surging federal tax receipts,
will also propose large spending increases for cherished Republican
priorities: the military, local police and small business.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan envisions a budget surplus of at least $76
billion for the current fiscal year and much larger surpluses
stretching as far into the future as government forecasters can
see.
</P>
<P>
   The health of the U.S. economy and overflowing federal coffers
allow Clinton the luxury of indulging in large new ``investments''
in politically popular labor, education, health care and
environmental projects while cloaking himself in fiscal prudence by
proposing to use budget surpluses to pay down the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   But as has happened so often in the past 12 months of scandal
and impeachment, Clinton will dominate only half of the attention
of official Washington and the media on Monday. At the very moment
Clinton is unveiling his budget in an East Room ceremony, Monica
Lewinsky will be sitting down with a roomful of lawyers, senators
and House prosecutors in a hotel suite five blocks away to be
deposed in the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospects for Clinton's ambitious programs are uncertain
given Republican majorities in both houses of Congress and the ill
will on both sides as a result of the impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal for increased defense spending is likely to
win Republican support and in fact it may be increased. His plan to
provide tax credits for long-term medical care also has bipartisan
support. But many of the other spending programs are unlikely to
win Republican backing at a time when limits on federal spending
imposed as a result of the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997 remain
in effect.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton proposes to increase overall government spending
by $39 billion over this year's level, federal outlays as a
proportion of the U.S. economy will be at the lowest level since
1973, 19.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plan raises, but does not definitively answer, the
overriding economic question now before the Congress and the White
House _ how to adjust to a time of surplus after a generation of
seemingly intractable federal budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, all of which is subject to congressional approval, is
in effect a holding action until a long-term plan is negotiated to
shore up Social Security and Medicare, the crown jewels of
Democratic progressivism that are projected to run out of money
early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's budget is truly a historic document,'' Jack Lew,
director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said.
``The transition from an era of deficits to an era of surpluses has
changed so many of the issues and poses basic, fundamental choices.
What do you do in a time of fiscal well-being to ensure that you'll
have fiscal well-being far into the future?''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Clinton has announced a plan to ensure the solvency
of Social Security and Medicare well into the next century by
reserving 77 percent of any budget surpluses to shore up the
universal retirement and health-care entitlements. An additional 12
percent of the projected surpluses is being set aside under the
administration's plan for a new form of retirement account designed
to increase the nation's paltry personal savings rate.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union message, and now with his budget,
Clinton has seized the fiscal and political high ground, moving
into a policy vacuum created by a year of scandal and a Republican
failure so far to offer a coherent and compelling blueprint for
addressing the long-term problems of the nation's costliest
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget _ bound in volumes with black covers
symbolizing the ocean of black ink that the administration foresees
_ attempts to do large things in relatively small steps. Social
Security and Medicare will be rescued from future insolvency
without pain to current taxpayers or future beneficiaries in the
form of tax increases or reductions in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration economic policy-maker said that Clinton
would have preferred much larger increases in programs to help the
United States adapt to the high-technology future. But the fact of
a Republican-controlled Congress hungry for tax cuts has limited
the president's budgetary freedom of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a second-best world,'' said Gene Sperling, the president's
chief economic adviser, ``the reality of divided government is that
Clinton is able through a combination of hard negotiating and
fiscal discipline to achieve targeted increases in these areas
while proposing a fiscally disciplined budget.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sperling continued, ``We've learned there are two ways to score
a touchdown _ by throwing the Hail Mary or by throwing six 15-yard
passes to move the ball down the field. We've been successful in
putting forward an investing-in-people agenda by going in and
fighting for these programs one year at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools, cities, displaced workers, the environment and the
Pentagon will all receive sizable infusions of new money without
any broad tax increases. The single largest proposal to raise
revenue in the budget takes aim at Washington's favorite pair of
deep pockets: cigarette smokers and tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is proposing a 55-cents-a-pack increase on cigarettes to
raise $8 billion a year for the next five years. The tax increase
will be described as an effort to reduce smoking by teen-agers by
raising the price of cigarettes to almost $4 a pack, but the
revenues are not specifically earmarked for anti-smoking programs
or for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   That projected revenue will cover only a fraction of the $25.6
billion in new spending in the 2000 budget that Clinton has already
announced _ from $12 billion for the Pentagon to $10 million to
train American Indian teachers to serve in predominantly Indian
regions of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also proposing $20.6 billion in limited tax cuts over
the next five years to subsidize long-term care for the elderly and
disabled, build schoolrooms, develop fuel-efficient cars and
promote adult literacy.
</P>
<P>
   The public expresses broad support for such initiatives in White
House and public polls, but there is no assurance that any of them
will survive the Republican Congress, which is more interested in
cutting tax rates across the board than embarking on a New
Deal-style spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has tried to satisfy every special-interest
group except the middle-income taxpayer,'' said Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, who serves on the Senate Budget Committee. ``When
taxes are as high as they have ever been, it's time to let the
taxpayers keep some more of their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said that initial reaction to the president's State of
the Union message on Jan. 19 was favorable, even from many
Republicans. But as more details of Clinton's spending plans have
trickled out, a different picture emerges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gave that speech on Jan. 19, it looked like a pretty
middle-of-the-road position,'' Grassley said. ``But upon
reflection, what he's basically doing is just reverting to the
classic Democratic policy. Three or four years ago he declared the
era of big government is over. Well, the era of big government is
back.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, this space takes a
look back at some of the most important dates in Los Angeles sports
history:
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 3, 1990: At Santa Anita, jockey Bill Shoemaker rides in his
40,350th and final race, finishing fourth on a horse named Patchy
Groundfog. In his 40-year career, Shoemaker had a record 8,833 wins
and more than $120 million in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 3, 1979: The Angels acquire future Hall of Famer Rod Carew
from the Minnesota Twins for outfielders Ken Landreaux and Dave
Engle and pitchers Paul Hartzell and Brad Havens.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 4, 1976: Andy Messersmith's free-agency decision is upheld
by a federal judge, meaning the Dodgers pitcher can sign with any
major-league team _ it'll eventually be NL West rival Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 7, 1941: UCLA forward Jackie Robinson scores nearly half
his team's points _ 20 _ but the Bruins come out on the short end
to USC 43-41. This marked the 34th straight loss that UCLA had
suffered in basketball to USC since 1932. The win streak would run
for two more years.

HOUSE MANAGERS SET OUT QUESTIONS FOR THREE WITNESSES also By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Heading into three critical days of questioning,
House prosecutors Sunday spelled out some lines of inquiry they
will pursue with Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses, even as
senators stepped up their search for some bipartisan way to bring
the trial of President Clinton to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The preparations came as the Senate enters what could well be
the last phase of the impeachment proceedings against Clinton, who
was charged by the House in December on two articles, perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has set Feb. 12 as the target date to end the trial,
and one Republican, Sen. Richard C. Shelby, of Alabama, suggested
Sunday that there might not be a majority of senators voting to
convict the president on perjury, let along the 67 needed to
convict him.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Shelby said that
``perhaps'' fewer than 50 senators would support the perjury
article. He said he had heard colleagues call obstruction of
justice ``a stronger count.'' Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said he knew
of ``12 or so'' Republicans who would vote against conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Senate meets its Feb. 12 timetable for a final vote
could well hinge on what emerges from this week's closed-door,
video-taped questioning of three witnesses: Ms. Lewinsky; Vernon
Jordan, a friend and confidant to Clinton, and Sidney Blumenthal, a
White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   Another question hanging over the proceedings is whether Kenneth
W. Starr, the independent counsel, will seek to prosecute the
president separately from his impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported on Sunday that Starr has concluded
that he has the constitutional authority to seek an indictment of
Clinton before he leaves office, but has not decided if or when to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   One House prosecutor expressed dismay that any associates of
Starr were discussing his thinking at this critical time in the
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not helpful at all because many people in the Senate or
some defenders of the president say, `there's no sense impeaching
him because he can be held accountable when he leaves office,'''
Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who is one of the House prosecutors,
said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   House managers sought to tamp down expectations that they would
draw out dramatic new testimony across the three days of taking
depositions, but said they thought they could bolster their charges
that Clinton obstructed justice in his effort to cover up his
affair with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you expect there's going to be some new bombshell outside
the general parameters of this scheme, that's not what it's all
about,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., in an appearance on ``Fox
News Sunday.`` ``But if you believe you need new evidence to prove
this, I think there will be some new evidence that will nail this
stuff down better.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., will be the House prosecutor to
question Ms. Lewinsky on Monday, while the White House legal team
will turn to its two women, Nicole K. Seligman and Cheryl D. Mills,
to take the lead in questioning her. Ms. Lewinsky returned to
Washington on Saturday for the second time in recent weeks, once
again prompting a media stakeout outside the Rennaissance Mayflower
Hotel a few blocks from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum said Ms. Lewinsky would be asked to speak more
precisely about the sequence of telephone calls that took place
when Betty Currie, Clinton's secretary, retrieved his gifts to Ms.
Lewinsky. White House lawyers have pointed to the timing of a
cellular phone call Mrs. Currie made to Ms. Lewinsky to cast doubt
on the idea that Mrs. Currie could have picked up the gifts at
Clinton's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, Republican aides say, will also explore with her why,
though she has said ``no one ever asked me to lie, and I was never
promised a job for my silence,'' she filed a false affidavit about
her relationship with the president in the sexual harassment suit
brought by Paula Jones against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after the witnesses are all deposed, the Senate is
to decide whether to allow the video-taped testimony to be played
publicly in the Senate chamber. As the trial proceeds, it also will
consider whether any of those witnesses should testify before the
full Senate. The majority and minority leaders can also weigh
whether anything the three witnesses say requires the House to call
more witnesses. The White House also has its own opportunity to
submit a witness list to the Senate for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Senators sought to promote competing ideas for how to end the
trial. Some Republicans called for a ``finding of facts'' on the
president's actions separate from the actual vote on whether to
convict him and remove him from office. Democrats called for
censuring the president. A few members of both parties were looking
at an option of adjourning the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is a proponent of the ``finding
of fact'' idea, sought to allay Democrats' concerns that such a
vote could have legal ramifications after Clinton left office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of senators who believe that the president
lied under oath but that his wrongdoing in this area does not
constitute perjury,'' she said in an appearance on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.'' ``A finding of fact in this area would say that the
president lied under oath. It would not say that he committed
perjury in the legal sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the fluidity of the final negotiations, a Democrat,
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said he was prepared to
keep his mind open on the proposal, while a Republican, Shelby,
said he opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a bad idea,'' Shelby said. ``We ought to either
convict the president and kick him out of office or we ought to
acquit him. That's the precedent we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., dismissed the idea as ``impeachment
lite'' not envisioned in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   A few Republicans as well as Democrats expressed dismay that
deliberations inside the Office of the Independent Counsel had
become public at a time when the Senate itself faces a decision on
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said on ABC's ``This Week,'' ``I think
its very unfortunate that this story broke today,'' but said the
possibility that Clinton might be prosecuted should not affect the
Senate impeachchment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'm not a big fan of the independent prosecutor
statute,'' he added. ``I voted against it when I was in the House
of Representatives. I think it's the one case where you give a
prosecutor _ and I use to be a prosecutor, as you know. It's the
one case where you give a prosecutor unlimited money and unlimited
ability to access the FBI and one target. So, that's a topic and a
debate for another day.''
nn
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders accused Starr of overreaching. Sen.
Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said on CBS, ``Ken Starr is once again
running amok.'' James E. Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said in
an interview, ``The strong bipartisan criticism of Starr speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman called the deliberations in Starr's office a
reminder that Clinton ``will be subject to the rule of law,'' if
the Senate, as is expected, fails to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, House and White House legal teams will move on to
question Jordan, and on Wednesday Blumenthal. Hutchinson said the
prosecutors would ask Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky's account that at a
meeting last December he had suggested she destroy notes she had
written to Clinton. ``Vernon Jordan has never been asked about
that,'' Hutchinson said, ``so I think that's an area that needs to
be explored with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., said Blumenthal would be
questioned again about the presidents' tale to him that he was
being stalked by Ms. Lewinsky. He said Blumenthal would be asked,
``Did you do anything about it? Did you ever at any time discuss
this matter with the White House? Did the White House, as an
institution, start suggesting to the American public that you
better watch this lady?''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal has said he did not engage in a smear campaign.

BRITISH AND IRISH LEADERS EXPRESS OPTIMISM FOR PEACE IN ULSTER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ The Irish and British leadership and the
highest-ranking officials in Northern Ireland are trying to allay
fears that the peace effort in the British province of Ulster is
crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The peace effort has been locked in a dispute between Roman
Catholic and Protestant leaders on the issue of disarming the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Seamus Mallon, the deputy first minister of the Northern
Ireland Assembly, a new body created as part of the peace effort,
called for a compromise retreat from ``brinkmanship'' that could
collapse the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to David Trimble, the Protestant who is first minister
under the new cooperative political arrangement, and Gerry Adams,
the president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, Mallon, a
mainstream Catholic, said a solution to the dispute could be found
``if they both blink somewhat at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the difficulties of Northern Irish politics is that
people always see the ball in the other fellow's court,'' he
continued.
</P>
<P>
   There was no blinking Sunday, though. Trimble was holding to his
position that Sinn Fein would not be allowed to participate fully
in the Assembly until the IRA begins to disarm. The IRA and Sinn
Fein gave no sign they would change their position that there would
be no disarmament in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Trimble and Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland
acknowledged that the disarmament issue was threatening to disrupt,
if not collapse, the Northern Ireland peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting in Ahern's office here for 40 minutes, the two
leaders agreed that, with a crucial deadline on Feb. 15 for a vote
on new government structures for home rule, disarmament was still a
``significant hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came after a week in which Trimble, the leader of
the Ulster Unionist Party, and Mo Mowlam, the British Northern
Ireland secretary, sought to keep the effort alive. Both have
sought to assure colleagues and the public that the peace effort
will survive the vote in February on structures that are to be put
into effect by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   The new structures are intended to give the Roman Catholic
minority more power and increase the influence of the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic in the northern
province of Ulster. The vote is to pave the way for Britain's
return of home rule powers to the province through the Assembly in
Belfast, the northern capital.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Trimble and Ms. Mowlam have addressed
indications that the province was edging back into sectarian
warfare. Ms. Mowlam called for an end to ``punishment beatings'' by
Catholic and Protestant paramilitary groups, calling the beatings
``atrocious, barbarous behavior.'' The number of such beatings of
civilians by paramilitary groups has been accelerating in recent
weeks, involving more than 20 attacks. There has been a series of
other attacks and episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the British Parliament have called for a halt to
the early release of Northern Irish paramilitary prisoners from
British jails, being carried out under the peace effort, until the
violence in the North subsides. Ms. Mowlam, with the support
of &UR;  &LR; British Prime Minister Tony Blair, said there was no reason to
curtail the early releases, and some experts say doing so would
increase the potential for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has vowed to keep Sinn Fein from ministers' posts in the
new Northern Ireland provisional government until the IRA begins to
disarm. The IRA has refused repeatedly, and Sinn Fein notes,
accurately, that there is no requirement in the peace agreement
approved last spring for disarmament before May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse has threatened the establishment of an Assembly
executive that is to be given home rule powers by the British
government. Without Sinn Fein in the executive, officials and
experts say, the new body would be futile, and the IRA might end
its 17-month cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's authority in the Assembly is also threatened by
dissident Protestant unionists who fear he will make a last-minute
deal with Sinn Fein that would give it significant influence.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble contends, though, that members of Sinn Fein ``are trying
to sabotage the process'' by failing to persuade the IRA to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say whether he would accept a statement by the
IRA or Sinn Fein that the campaign of violence was permanently
ended, in lieu of actual disarming.

SEC HALTS TRADING IN 6 INTERNET-RELATED COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Securities and Exchange Commission halted trading
Friday in six companies whose shares have soared recently as they
have been swept up in the investment frenzy over anything related
to the Internet. Five of the companies have ties to a stock
promoter who was banned from the brokerage industry last year
because of violations of securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   The shares of each of the six companies, whose trading was
halted for two weeks, are listed on the relatively obscure OTC
Bulletin Board, a small-capitalization market whose listing
requirements are far less stringent than those of the Nasdaq
national and small-capitalization markets. But the stocks'
skyrocketing prices have attracted the attention of some supposedly
sophisticated investors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies, USA Talks.com, whose shares have climbed
nearly 300 percent so far this year, is among the largest holdings
of the WWW Internet Fund, a $16 million mutual fund that invests in
Internet-related stocks. The fund has gained more than 38 percent
this year, in large part because of USA Talks.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said it had halted trading in USA Talks.com ``because of
questions that have been raised about the accuracy and adequacy of
publicly disseminated information concerning, among other things,
the status and extent of USA Talks' business operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission cited similar reasons in an unrelated action in
which it halted trading in five companies with ties to Peter Tosto,
a stock promoter who also goes by the name of Peter Lybrand; he was
barred from the brokerage industry last year. Shares of those
companies _ Citron Inc., Electronic Transfer Associates Inc.,
Invest Holdings Group Inc., Polus Inc. and Smartek Inc. _ have
climbed at least 57 percent and as much as 382 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   An SEC official said the halt in trading of USA Talks was not
related to that of the other companies. Allen Portnoy, chief
executive of USA Talks, said in an interview that the company
``absolutely is for real'' and had no relationship with Tosto.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, USA Talks plans to sell long-distance
telephone service using Internet technologies. The service, which
is available only to residents of California, has been offered for
several months at no charge in a special promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC is questioning the existence of our long-distance
network, so we'll let them try it as proof our network exists,''
Portnoy said. Despite having no revenue, the stock of USA Talks has
climbed from less than $4 last fall to more than $63 last month.
The stock last traded for $52.25, which gave the company's 19.2
million shares a total value of more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the five other companies whose trading was halted Friday
also have been promoted as having some connection to the Internet,
and each of them has a connection to Tosto, a former stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Kaplan, a Manhattan lawyer who said he represents Tosto,
declined to comment Friday on his client's connections to those
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Tosto and his public relations company, Investor
Relations Inc., were ordered by the SEC to pay $1.1 million in
restitution for securities law violations related to their
promotion of the stock of San Diego Bancorp. Tosto, in a settlement
with the SEC, neither admitted to nor denied the allegations.

   My husband and I were offered a friend's apartment in Manhattan
for the weekend and drove in, bicycles on our car. We pulled into
one space that was too close to a hydrant. We then biked two blocks

<P>
   How to secure it in the face of the aggressive New York parker?
Inspiration struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call a cab,'' I said to my husband. He did and directed the
cabbie to park in our spot, meter running. Then he biked back to
the car, secured the bike and drove back to replace the cab.

angels in Baltimore and heard there were even better angels at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. He called and asked if Ms. Fultz would
find out how long the exhibition would be in New York.

<P>
   ``There are no angels at the Met,'' said the young man who
answered the information line. ``But there are fairies at the

the back just level it off at the neckline.''

don't I just give you a note to say that you have been here?''

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I am in eighth grade and I was sent home from school because I
had a stomach virus. I walked outside into a blizzard and raised my
arm to hail a cab. A couple stepped in front of me and when a cab
pulled up they pushed to get in. I said, ``Excuse me,'' very loudly
but the woman turned and said, ``We're taking this cab.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked to see if there were any other cabs, when a woman hit
me in the back with her umbrella. She kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   I stood on the corner, arm raised, when a meat-delivery truck
pulled up. One of the men came over and said, ``Hey babydoll, I
could give you a ride.'' I refused and raised my arm again.
</P>
<P>
   This time a white town car with a palm tree painted on the back
pulled up and the driver said: ``I don't have a passenger. Do you
want a ride?'' I refused just as a police car pulled up alongside
me. I was expecting an offer of a ride but instead one of the
officers said, ``Why aren't you in school?'' I told him I was going
home because I was sick and the officer said, ``Sure. Get home NOW.
Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a cab pulled up and I jumped in. The driver said, ``I
don't have any change, that OK?'' I had enough singles, so I
agreed. After a long ride, I paid, went into my house, put on my
pajamas, got into bed and went to sleep. _ SARAH CROW

MIRRA KOMAROVSKY, 93, AUTHORITY ON WOMEN'S STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mirra Komarovsky, a sociologist who was an innovative
authority on gender, family and education, died on Saturday at her
home in Manhattan. She was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Komarovsky retired in 1970 after 32 years on the faculty of
Barnard College. But she returned to Barnard in 1978 and became the
chairwoman of its women's studies program for a time.
</P>
<P>
   She was an advocate for women who has been credited with having
initiated the contemporary analysis of gender roles with her book
``Women in the Modern World: Their Education and Their Dilemmas''
(1953, Irvington).
</P>
<P>
   In that work she wrote that by making the the purposes of
women's education clearer, barriers to the attainment of a good
life could be removed.
</P>
<P>
   As to the respective merits of training for a career and of
education meant only for a homemaker, she wrote: ``To disagree with
the anti-feminist does not necessarily make one a feminist. We can
reject the anti-feminist program without having to embrace the
old-fashioned feminism with its militant hostility towards, and its
disparagement of, the homemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Ellen Futter, who was Barnard's president at the time,
said Ms. Komarovsky's research ``has been crucial to our
understanding of today's women and the choices they make.''
</P>
<P>
   In that year Ms. Komarovsky received the Distinguished Career
Award of the American Sociological Association. Earlier, in 1973
and 1974, she was the second female president of the association,
which was founded in 1905.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Women in College: Shaping New Feminine
Identities'' (1985) she described changing views of work, family
and men that were held by students in the class of 1983 at Barnard,
a women's college.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing that book in The New York Times Book Review, Adele
Simmons, then president of Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass.,
wrote: ``The impact of the women's movement on higher education
becomes apparent to even the most skeptical reader.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Ms. Komarovsky observed bleakly that, as Dr.
Simmons put it, ``while attitudes have changed, institutions have
not. The gains of the last decade, she warns, will only be secure
when society develops permanent measures to support women in the
workplace as well as in the home.''
</P>
<P>
   In researching the book, Ms. Komarovsky used interviews,
questionnaires and surveys to study the attitudes of more than 200
students in the Barnard class of 1983. Fully two-thirds of those
young women were afflicted with what she called ``culture shock''
that differed from student to student.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Simmons put it, ``Ideas about virginity, femininity,
sexual preferences and study habits all came under scrutiny as
students' friendships evolved and intellectual challenges arose.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Komarovsky found that 76 percent of the female students
planned, at the time they entered Barnard, on combining career,
marriage and children in the coming years. And by the time the
class graduated, fully 85 percent of its members had come to have
that threefold ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Two observations of Ms. Komarovsky's that Dr. Simmons found
intriguing were her finding that the most highly career-minded
students had mothers who had not worked and who regretted that _ or
mothers who worked and enjoyed it; and her suggestion that the
young women sought a mixture of sensitivity, self-awareness and
masculinity in men.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Komarovsky also said that most of the women she surveyed
found it hard to attain relationships that they considered
satisfactory with men, although those women had had chances to
interact with men from a variety of backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rather similarly, Ms. Komarovsky wrote, on The New York Times
Op-Ed page in 1981: ``Young women are becoming aware that the call
to equal opportunities for women outside the home is an empty
slogan as long as the society insists on traditional role
segregation within the family. Some women react to this discovery
with equanimity, others with frustration, resignation or
indignation. But the real touchstone of their aspirations is the
longing for a society in which the rhetoric of equality will be
realized as fact. There is no denying that this would require major
institutional changes.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do? ``We have much to learn from Sweden,'' Ms.
Komarovsky wrote. ``Modified work patterns for both sexes, housing
patterns permitting more-cooperative ties among child-rearing
families, accessible child-care centers of high quality for all
economic classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, she also wrote about various aspects of
sociology, including theory and methodology.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Baku, on the Caspian Sea, in what was then
Russia, to Mendel Komarovsky and the former Anna Steinberg, and she
was raised largely in Baku.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 17, she and her family emigrated to the United
States. She attended a high school for a year in Wichita, Kan.,
where some members of her family lived, and went on to receive a
bachelor's degree in 1926 from Barnard, where she was elected to
Phi Beta Kappa and was taught by the anthropologists Ruth Benedict
and Franz Boas.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as the book ``Women in Sociology'' (1991,
Greenwood), edited by Mary Jo Deegan, reports: ``Komarovsky was
puzzled'' by Barnard's ``extolling intellectual excellence while
discouraging women from pursuing careers.''
</P>
<P>
   She received a master's degree in 1927 and a doctorate in 1940,
both in sociology, and both from Columbia. Her doctoral thesis was
published as a book, ``The Unemployed Man and His Family'' (1940).
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she was a co-author of the book ``Leisure: A Suburban
Study'' (1934). In addition, before joining the Barnard faculty as
an instructor in 1938, she taught at Skidmore College in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., and was a research assistant at the Yale University
Institute of Human Relations, at Columbia, and at the International
Institute of Social Research in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She was chairman of the sociology department at Barnard from
1949 to 1968 and was president of the Eastern Sociological Society
in 1955 and 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But she recalled years later that in the 1940s and even later,
choosing women's issues to do research on was costly to her. The
field lacked academic glamor and was not likely to further a
career.
</P>
<P>
   An early marriage, in 1926, ended in divorce in 1928. In 1940,
she married Marcus Heyman, who died in 1970.

   Her survivors include a sister, Dolly Cheser of Rockville
Centre, five nieces and one nephew.

CLINTON'S BUDGET INCLUDES NEW DOMESTIC PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing) (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will release a $1.766 trillion
federal budget blueprint for 2000 on Monday that proposes billions
of dollars in new spending while preaching fiscal conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget plan will ask Congress for substantial new
money for scores of domestic programs popular with liberal and
middle-class constituencies, from urban housing vouchers to new
classroom construction.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, taking advantage of surging federal tax receipts,
will also propose large spending increases for cherished Republican
priorities: the military, local police and small business.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan envisions a budget surplus of at least $76
billion for the current fiscal year and much larger surpluses
stretching as far into the future as government forecasters can
see.
</P>
<P>
   The health of the U.S. economy and overflowing federal coffers
allow Clinton the luxury of indulging in large new ``investments''
in politically popular labor, education, health care and
environmental projects while cloaking himself in fiscal prudence by
proposing to use budget surpluses to pay down the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   But as has happened so often in the past 12 months of scandal
and impeachment, Clinton will dominate only half of the attention
of official Washington and the media on Monday. At the very moment
Clinton is unveiling his budget in an East Room ceremony, Monica
Lewinsky will be sitting down with a roomful of lawyers, senators
and House prosecutors in a hotel suite five blocks away to be
deposed in the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospects for Clinton's ambitious programs are uncertain
given Republican majorities in both houses of Congress and the ill
will on both sides as a result of the impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal for increased defense spending is likely to
win Republican support and in fact it may be increased. His plan to
provide tax credits for long-term medical care also has bipartisan
support. But many of the other spending programs are unlikely to
win Republican backing at a time when limits on federal spending
imposed as a result of the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997 remain
in effect.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton proposes to increase overall government spending
by $39 billion over this year's level, federal outlays as a
proportion of the U.S. economy will be at the lowest level since
1973, 19.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plan raises, but does not definitively answer, the
overriding economic question now before the Congress and the White
House _ how to adjust to a time of surplus after a generation of
seemingly intractable federal budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, all of which is subject to congressional approval, is
in effect a holding action until a long-term plan is negotiated to
shore up Social Security and Medicare, the crown jewels of
Democratic progressivism that are projected to run out of money
early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's budget is truly a historic document,'' Jack Lew,
director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said.
``The transition from an era of deficits to an era of surpluses has
changed so many of the issues and poses basic, fundamental choices.
What do you do in a time of fiscal well-being to ensure that you'll
have fiscal well-being far into the future?''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Clinton has announced a plan to ensure the solvency
of Social Security and Medicare well into the next century by
reserving 77 percent of any budget surpluses to shore up the
universal retirement and health-care entitlements. An additional 12
percent of the projected surpluses is being set aside under the
administration's plan for a new form of retirement account designed
to increase the nation's paltry personal savings rate.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union message, and now with his budget,
Clinton has seized the fiscal and political high ground, moving
into a policy vacuum created by a year of scandal and a Republican
failure so far to offer a coherent and compelling blueprint for
addressing the long-term problems of the nation's costliest
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget _ bound in volumes with black covers
symbolizing the ocean of black ink that the administration foresees
_ attempts to do large things in relatively small steps. Social
Security and Medicare will be rescued from future insolvency
without pain to current taxpayers or future beneficiaries in the
form of tax increases or reductions in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration economic policy-maker said that Clinton
would have preferred much larger increases in programs to help the
United States adapt to the high-technology future. But the fact of
a Republican-controlled Congress hungry for tax cuts has limited
the president's budgetary freedom of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a second-best world,'' said Gene Sperling, the president's
chief economic adviser, ``the reality of divided government is that
Clinton is able through a combination of hard negotiating and
fiscal discipline to achieve targeted increases in these areas
while proposing a fiscally disciplined budget.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sperling continued, ``We've learned there are two ways to score
a touchdown _ by throwing the Hail Mary or by throwing six 15-yard
passes to move the ball down the field. We've been successful in
putting forward an investing-in-people agenda by going in and
fighting for these programs one year at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools, cities, displaced workers, the environment and the
Pentagon will all receive sizable infusions of new money without
any broad tax increases. The single largest proposal to raise
revenue in the budget takes aim at Washington's favorite pair of
deep pockets: cigarette smokers and tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is proposing a 55-cents-a-pack increase on cigarettes to
raise $8 billion a year for the next five years. The tax increase
will be described as an effort to reduce smoking by teen-agers by
raising the price of cigarettes to almost $4 a pack, but the
revenues are not specifically earmarked for anti-smoking programs
or for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   That projected revenue will cover only a fraction of the $25.6
billion in new spending in the 2000 budget that Clinton has already
announced _ from $12 billion for the Pentagon to $10 million to
train American Indian teachers to serve in predominantly Indian
regions of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also proposing $20.6 billion in limited tax cuts over
the next five years to subsidize long-term care for the elderly and
disabled, build schoolrooms, develop fuel-efficient cars and
promote adult literacy.
</P>
<P>
   The public expresses broad support for such initiatives in White
House and public polls, but there is no assurance that any of them
will survive the Republican Congress, which is more interested in
cutting tax rates across the board than embarking on a New
Deal-style spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has tried to satisfy every special-interest
group except the middle-income taxpayer,'' said Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, who serves on the Senate Budget Committee. ``When
taxes are as high as they have ever been, it's time to let the
taxpayers keep some more of their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said that initial reaction to the president's State of
the Union message on Jan. 19 was favorable, even from many
Republicans. But as more details of Clinton's spending plans have
trickled out, a different picture emerges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gave that speech on Jan. 19, it looked like a pretty
middle-of-the-road position,'' Grassley said. ``But upon
reflection, what he's basically doing is just reverting to the
classic Democratic policy. Three or four years ago he declared the
era of big government is over. Well, the era of big government is
back.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The sickest of the mentally ill, the men, women and
children battling the worst demons, end up at the Arizona State
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's 113-year history has been checkered with pride
and pain. But the last few years have been some of the hardest for
the place that people in Arizona refer to by its initials, ASH.
</P>
<P>
   It failed a federal inspection last year and has lost millions
of dollars in government aid. Its buildings, most of which were
built or rebuilt in the 1950s and early 1960s, are poorly designed,
dingy and in disrepair. Budget cuts and staff reductions have left
the hospital scrambling to find enough nurses and technicians to
care for the 318 patients who have been sent here by civil and
criminal courts across the state.
</P>
<P>
   There are 130 staff vacancies and the hospital is using
employees from expensive temporary agencies to fill the gaps.
Treatment has suffered. Morale and pay are low. The turnover rate
among employees is high.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, four of ASH's 12 psychiatrists reluctantly quit after
two years of trying to get more staff and money for the hospital
from the state government. When they resigned, some of the doctors
said it was just too dangerous to continue working there. Patients
were assaulting the staff and one another more and more frequently.
``In my opinion,'' said Dr. David Coons, one of the psychiatrists
who left, ``it's a miracle that no one was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, the governor, Jane Hull, toured the
hospital and told The Arizona Republic: ``We can't let this go on.
We can't treat people this way.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Hull wants to see a new ASH built out of old ashes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has proposed using $76 million from Arizona's share
of the national tobacco settlement to build a new state hospital. A
portion of the money will go to build a new state health laboratory
and another $12 million is earmarked for a psychiatric program on
the hospital grounds for convicted sex offenders who have served
their prison sentences but are still considered too dangerous to be
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a multitude of problems at the hospital,'' Hull said
in a recent interview. ``It's not a snake pit, but it's overcrowded
and you see a lot of patients just basically sitting around, with
very few opportunities to do something productive. I don't think we
can afford to go much longer without doing something out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor and other officials say that an increase in
operating budgets is needed as well; an emergency $4.3 million
appropriation to increase pay and hire more staff is working its
way through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Arizona could not or would not pay for a new
hospital. But over the next 25 years, all 50 states and some cities
will receive almost $246 billion from cigarette producers as a
result of lawsuits brought against the tobacco industry to recover
Medicaid money spent treating smoking-related illnesses. Arizona's
share will be $2.8 billion over 25 years, with an initial payment
of about $177 million.
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear pattern of how states around the country plan
to spend their first round of tobacco dollars. In New York, for
example, Gov. George Pataki has proposed using 75 percent of its
initial settlement money to help reduce state debt. A political
fight over that proposal is already heating up.
</P>
<P>
   But in this Republican dominated state of red canyons and green
fairways in the desert, Hull's plan appears to have strong support.
Her fellow Republicans, Sen. Sue Grace, chairwoman of the state
Senate's health committee, and Rep. Susan Gerard, chairwoman of the
House's health committee, said the proposal was the best news in
years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We've needed a new hospital for a long time and now we've
finally got a way to pay for it,'' Ms. Gerard said. ``Assuming
everyone keeps smoking, and I will, we should have some money for
indigent health care programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Ronan, an advocate for the mentally ill and a lawyer with
the Arizona Center for Disability Law, said she was concerned that
spending so much on bricks and mortar would take away desperately
needed money from community mental health care programs where the
vast majority of patients go for treatment and to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't live in institutions anymore,'' Ms. Ronan said.
``They live in the community.'' She said there were about 50,000
adults and children enrolled in various community programs in the
state, compared with 318 at the hospital. ``There's no balance
here,'' Ms. Ronan said, adding that affordable housing and access
to expensive medications are major problems confronting the
mentally ill, as they struggle to live as normal a life as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are 40 to 80 patients at the hospital who are
ready to be discharged but there is no place for them to go.
</P>
<P>
   For Dr. Steven Pitt, one of the four psychiatrists who quit last
May, the governor's proposal was ``thrilling.'' But he said he
regretted that something had been done years ago to break the
hospital's fall. In 1996, despite its outdated buildings and
checkered past, the hospital had received a perfect score in one
accreditation survey.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the perfect score, however, the hospital was hit
by a wave of layoffs as the state, under a previous administration,
tried to whittle down the patient population to 250 by placing as
many patients as possible into community programs. Most of the
laid-off workers were nurses and technicians, ``the key ingredient
of any hospital,'' Pitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Walter Scott, a hospital administrator, conducted
a tour of the single-story buildings and sun-baked grounds that
make up the state hospital, situated a short drive from downtown
Phoenix. The newest building at the hospital, the administration
building, was built in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State Hospital is on 92 acres, but most of the
property has been taken over by the state prison. In the 1960s, the
hospital had 1,500 patients, but much of it was emptied as part of
the national movement to ``de-institutionalize'' the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hospital is overcrowded, officials say, and the
patients who remain are the most severely mentally ill. In the J-5
wing, 48 patients _ men and women _ share two bathrooms and one
shower room with four stalls. J-5 is licensed to house 44 people.
Recently, 58 patients lived there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to provide any kind of privacy,'' said Sarah
King, a psychiatric nurse at the state hospital for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King said that on that day, the wing had two nurses and four
technicians on duty. They should have had at least three nurses and
six technicians. A patient's medical appointment with a doctor off
the hospital grounds had to be canceled, Ms. King said, because
there was no one to escort the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can still provide a safe environment,'' Ms. King said,
``but programming suffers.''
</P>
<P>
   As Scott walked through another unit, a patient asked him if the
gossip he had heard was true. ``Are we getting a new building?''
the man asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we do someday,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling his eyes, the man said, ``Oh, sure, someday.''

COMMENTARY: A RUSSIAN FEELER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ With Russian inflation running at 100
percent a year, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told a little joke
about being forced to accept demands to be disclosed next week by
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man is handed a letter from his wife,'' he said at the World
Economic Forum. ``He opens it and the page is blank. `How can that
be?' he is asked. `It's all right,' he replies. `We don't talk.'''
</P>
<P>
   He had begged Al Gore to lean on the IMF for repayment delay and
new loans, and was turned down for good reason: The former
spymaster has no economic plan to deal with congenital corruption
beyond ``optimizing the prison population.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Russia goes under, 30,000 nuclear missiles and the
scientists and engineers behind them go on sale. The nation is not
``too big to fail'' (its population is smaller than Indonesia's,
and is slumping toward half that of the United States), but the
fallout from its collapse could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The usual cast of pompous Russian reformers and Yeltsin
bureaucrats who used to parade around this Alpine conclave is
absent. Now, a skeleton crew of Primakov's bankers wring their
hands about devaluation and default, in contrast to the single
longtime voice of opposition with the plan and self-confidence to
turn Russia around _ Grigory Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The economist and former pugilist, 47, is the last democratic
reformer left standing. That's because he ignored Boris Yeltsin's
seductive revolving door and instead built a grassroots party. In
December's parliamentary elections, his Yabloko Party will grow;
and running for president in 2000, Yavlinsky will at least be
kingmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Western Kremlinologists no longer hoot in derision when I say
that; they saw Yabloko make possible Primakov's temporary
ascension. Yavlinsky insists it was the only way to ensure free
elections after Yeltsin, but power-hungry Primakov may have other
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky preaches the need for ``tough love'' to top American
officials, to get us to assume Russia's IMF repayments without new
IMF cash infusions. To regain the confidence of investors, he seeks
new ways to reinstill Russian self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   One way is to break the mold on missile defense. President
Clinton, after six years of pooh-poohing a shield against
rogue-state missiles, suddenly reversed field lest he be blamed for
vulnerability to germ blackmail. But Russians do not want to change
the old anti-ballistic missile treaty that kept each superpower
defenseless against the other. When I asked Primakov about it, he
stayed in the old communist rut: Touch ABM and START II won't be
ratified.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky comes at it creatively: ``America has a right to
missile defense against terrorism, as does Europe, of which Russia
is a part.'' He proposes a nonstrategic missile defense in
cooperation with NATO, capable of shooting down fewer than 100
missiles, thereby providing an umbrella against terrorist attack
without destabilizing the Russian-American standoff. That would
finesse the impasse and ease ratification of START II's reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian pride would thus be salved and money saved, but I see
other motives: It would provide paying work for thousands of
talented Russian technologists now looking hungrily toward Iran and
Iraq, and would lessen the pressure for sales of missile and
nuclear plants to states already taking advantage of Russian
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Does Russia have anything to offer in missile defense? Using a
handy-dandy cell phone, I called Andrei Piontkovsky in Moscow,
director of the Academy of Science's strategic studies, to ask what
Russia had on the shelf to shoot down missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The S-300,'' he replied promptly, as if I were a customer,
``two years more advanced than your Patriots.'' That's dubious; he
could not point to a single successful test of that missile against
missiles. Besides, the S-300 is the weapon Russia peddled to Greek
Cypriots until the Turks warned they would take out any such
missiles that were delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russians have long been adept at making long-range nukes
and might bring expertise to the anti-missile table. Rather than
punish Russia for dealing with Iran, the West, Yavlinsky urges,
should cooperate with Russia to keep its scientists, know-how and
products at home.
</P>
<P>
   Worth discussing. As Clinton belatedly dumps his resistance to
missile defense, we can usefully explore with NATO and Russia ways
to stop incoming terrorist missiles.

MALAYSIA'S LEADER RATTLES MEETING OF FINANCIAL ELITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ECON-MEET) 
(lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ The world's financial commanders have had
no greater nemesis in recent years than Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad of Malaysia, who has banned the trading of his country's
currency, denounced U.S. economic imperialism and jailed his
finance minister for daring to challenge his economic prescriptions
and his iron-handed rule.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as something of a jolt for the world's most dedicated
capitalists, gathering for an annual retreat of financial elite in
this Swiss resort, to discover Mahathir in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   He has been everywhere, behind closed doors with bankers,
dropping hints that he is thinking of cutting special deals for
``responsible'' investors who want to move money in and out of his
country, declaiming on his theories about the role of Jews in
starting the crisis that spread from Asia to Russia to Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Mahathir has been by turns charming and combative
_ except on one subject, the ongoing corruption and sexual
misconduct trial of his former hand-picked successor, Anwar
Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he could unseat me through street demonstrations,
the way Suharto was overthrown by street demonstrations,'' Mahathir
said over dinner on Saturday night with a group of journalists,
referring to the fate of the former president of Indonesia, the
most prominent political casualty of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other charges against him that have not yet been
proffered,'' he warned darkly about his one-time protege. ``Whether
he is acquitted or not, he will have to face more.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Mahathir is lost in the parade of luminaries here,
from Nelson Mandela to Yevgeny Primakov to Kofi Annan to the huge
delegation of U.S. officials who sometimes can not help sounding a
bit as if they are taking a victory lap.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived here just as Washington was announcing another
spectacular quarter of growth for the U.S. economy _ 5.6 percent,
exceeding all expectations _ that only underscored the sense among
the crisis-wracked here that the global financial system is rigged
for the United States' benefit.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes Mahathir's theories sound a lot less wild to many
now than they did 18 months ago. Back then, he was still debating
George Soros _ the financier who is also here with a parcel of
aides whispering into the tiniest of cell phones _ about the
dangers of currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter debate with Soros at the 1997 meetings of the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Mahathir called for
controls on the free flow of capital around the world, and Soros
called the prime minister ``a menace to his own country.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Mahathir's favorite hobbyhorse _ controlling capitalism's
excesses, keeping small countries from being washed out to sea by
the ebb and flow of billions of dollars _ is the subtext of half
the seminars here in Davos.
</P>
<P>
   While almost no one has endorsed the Malaysian solution,
declaring a nation's currency valueless outside its borders, the
73-year-old prime minister has come to seek vindication, and to
delight in the fact that the International Monetary Fund and the
U.S. Treasury fear others could follow Mahathir's path.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. must be more tolerant of the stupidity of Malaysia,''
he said. ``Why not leave us to do the wrong things we want to do?
What is this talk about freedom and independence if you say `I have
the power to stop you and I will stop you'?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the United States has not exactly said that. But
Mahathir was directly challenged on his own turf in November by
Vice President Al Gore, who at an Asian economic summit meeting in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, took up the language of Anwar and other
enemies of Mahathir's rule, openly calling for ``reformasi,'' or
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides are happy that it played well back home, that the
vice president, in the words of one of his advisers, ``took on a
tin-pot dictator.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Here in Davos, Mahathir and Gore steered clear of each other, no
small trick in a town so small. But Mahathir spent a good deal of
time repairing relations with investors, who have cut his country
off ever since Malaysia declared that any money invested in the
country must stay there for at least one year _ a step free-traders
find abhorrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that by doing this we can regulate the country's
economy better because we have control,'' he said. In the next
breath, though, Mahathir talked about relaxing the rule to allow
some international investors back in _ except, of course, for those
nasty currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
   He said one possibility was to put together ``a selective
listing of good and bad investors,'' though it is not clear who
gets on the list _ presumably Soros need not apply. Another
possibility, he said, was to impose an ``exit tax,'' paid by
investors who want to pull money out early.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would add to the cost of investing in Malaysia,
discouraging short-term investors.
</P>
<P>
   Asked over dinner about statements he made to largely Muslim
audiences in Malaysia about the role of Jews in causing the global
financial crisis, he readily admitted that his people ``see a
Jewish hand'' in the chaos, and he did not appear prepared to
challenge that perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see Soros, and he is a Jew,'' Mahathir said. ``He will
give the impression that this is a Jewish plot. This is the
impression of ordinary people in Malaysia.''
</P>
<P>
   When a questioner asked whether Mahathir agreed with ordinary
Malays that a Jewish plot exists, he hesitated a brief second and
said, ``I do not think there is.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ For many conservatives, the failure to feel any
real satisfaction in seeing Bill Clinton humbled comes down to
this: He isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't feel impeached,'' said Norma Adams, a Republican
attending the party's state convention here during the weekend. ``I
don't consider him impeached at this point, with him being so
brazen and pretending everything's great in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Ms. Adams' friends cut in simultaneously: ``He's
impeached!'' But they, too, said the president's refusal to cry
after his whipping was eating at them as much as any other aspect
of the events of the last year _ as much, even, as the fact that he
is likely to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could be impeached and yet have their cheerleading section
going within minutes?'' wondered Lou Howard, 72, of Cocoa Beach.
Ray Marino, a 62-year-old from Brevard County, just shook his head.
``It's the arrogance factor,'' Marino said. Ms. Adams, who is 70
and also from Cocoa Beach, added, ``And he deserves to be punished,
I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   They want to feel his pain, for a change. And they do not.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, on conservative talk radio and in Congress, where
the House managers seem increasingly testy even when they get their
way, the Republican faithful come across, above all, as frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Their team scored in ways almost no one expected this last year;
the president was impeached and made to apologize repeatedly. And
his wife had to dip into her blind trust to help settle the Paula
Jones sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   But for many here, the most enduring images of the last year
include Clinton's walking around with a drum in his hand and a
cigar in his mouth after Ms. Jones' suit was dismissed in April,
before the appeal and the recent settlement. And they see him
still, in their mind's eye, shaking hands at a party after his
impeachment when a number of congressional Democrats joined him at
the White House to provide moral support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being ashamed and embarrassed, he threw a party on
the White House lawn!'' said Chance Irvine, 58, a former state
representative from Orange Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was disgusting,'' agreed Pat Bailey, a 57-year-old state
committee member from Ponte Vedra Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thrives on creating chaos and comes through it personally
unscathed,'' put in Peggy Simone, 63, of Bradenton. ``He revels in
it! He enjoys it!''
</P>
<P>
   Do conservatives find no measure of gratification, no moment of
catharsis, in the fact that he was impeached _ or that this sex
scandal will be in the first paragraph of his obituary? When asked,
20 of 22 Republicans interviewed at the Florida event said, well,
as a matter of fact, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the party's base, and there's a lot of frustration
here,'' Rep. Joe Scarborough said in an interview at the meeting,
where the group had just given a hero's welcome to a fellow Florida
Republican, Rep. Bill McCollum, a manager of the impeachment case
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough said of the president: ``The fact that the man is
incapable of exhibiting any shame is very irritating. Perjury,
obstruction of justice _ and he says he's feeling `not bad.' That's
the most maddening for Republicans. What I've told people is
they've got two more years of Bill Clinton and they need to stop
obsessing about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Among conservative intellectuals, certainly, there are signs
that is happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm less struck by anger than concern and despondency at the
American people, and resignation, at this stage, and pride in the
Republicans and Henry Hyde,'' Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly
Standard, said, referring to the House Judiciary Committee chairman
and a leader in the impeachment effort. ``For generations the
romantic loser, the noble defeat, has resonated with conservatives,
and that's what this has become in conservative mythology: an
honorable man, Henry Hyde, bested by the clever and dishonorable
Bill Clinton _ one day, we hope, to be vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike prominent conservative thinkers who wonder and worry
about why so many Americans are unmoved by the scandal, many
rank-and-file Republicans do not feel particularly out-of-step with
the rest of the country. And over and over in interviews here, they
said that was because they believed the polls were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polls are targeted to get a certain answer,'' said Carlos
Muhletaler, 30, of Boca Raton. ``There are even T-shirts in South
Florida that say, `I haven't been polled.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is little indication that the
conservative base is ready to move on.
</P>
<P>
   On conservative talk radio, callers frequently express respect
for the House managers _ but also suspicion that the Senate
Republicans could go soft at any second. When the Senate held some
debate behind closed doors last week, the Republican base objected
more stridently than the Democrats, said G. Gordon Liddy, the
Watergate conspirator, now a radio host in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They view the secret sessions as cover for yet another
surrender by Trent Lott to the Democratic minority,'' Liddy said.
``They find it perverse that Republicans are dancing with Democrats
and they hate all this twaddle about the dignity of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it became clear after a 56-to-44 vote against
dismissing the case that the Republicans do not have the 67 votes
needed to convict.
</P>
<P>
   But on Rush Limbaugh's radio show last week, Limbaugh said:
``When you hear it's all over but the shoutin', don't believe it.
It's time for the Republicans to set the rules, lead and let the
Democrats get out of the way. Use the 55 votes, Sen. Lott! Sen.
Lott, you're the majority leader! Act like it! Be confident!''
</P>
<P>
   And last week in Congress, Hyde failed to conceal his own
hostility at his Republican colleagues in the Senate, saying, ``I'm
glad those people weren't at the Alamo or Valley Forge.''
</P>
<P>
   David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, said a
certain amount of rage at Clinton appeared to be a permanent
condition for the Republican core voter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is their Nixon, and every time he opens his mouth they
have a sense he's lying,'' Keene said. ``They may believe that 30
years from now.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was any doubt that American art museums were
experiencing a boom, it is no longer in question. The annual survey
of visitors to art exhibitions in North America, Europe and
Australia by The Art Newspaper, a widely read London-based
international monthly, concludes that ``the keenest exhibition
visitors'' in 1998 were ``the Americans by far.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the same verdict The Art Newspaper reached after its
1997 survey, and Anna Somers Cocks, the editor, said that the gap
between U.S. museumgoers and their counterparts in other countries
seemed to be widening.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular exhibition last year was ``Monet in the 20th
Century'' at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which counted
565,992 visitors during a three-month run that ended on Dec. 27.
Even the reclusive author J.D. Salinger made the trip from his New
Hampshire home to the museum, if the museum guards who say they
spotted him can be believed. (Robert Redford was definitely there;
he called ahead and got a museum escort.)
</P>
<P>
   Right behind ``Monet'' came ``The Private Collection of Edgar
Degas,'' a trove of works by Ingres, Cezanne, Manet and others that
the Metropolitan Museum of Art said drew 528,267 people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, ``Van Gogh's van Goghs'' at the National
Gallery of Art in Washington came in third, even though admission
was free, as it is to all shows at the federally financed National
Gallery. A ticket to the Monet show in Boston cost $17.50 on
weekends and $15 during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Gogh's van Goghs,'' with an official count of 480,496
visitors, was on view for two fewer weeks than the Monet show,
however. It did draw the highest average number of daily visitors:
pulling 5,339 a day versus 5,290 for Monet.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 21 exhibitions in the United States lured more than
200,000 visitors each into museums, including those in Minneapolis,
Brooklyn, St. Louis and Philadelphia, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Atlantic, only seven 1998 shows in Europe had more
than 200,000 viewers each, in addition to ``Treasures of Mount
Athos,'' a display of religious artifacts that was on view for
nearly a year at the Museum of Byzantine Culture in Salonika,
Greece, and that also topped the survey for Europe, for 1997, when
the city was designated the European cultural capital. All told, it
had 675,208 visitors, including 189,108 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Mount Athos exhibit, the biggest draw in Europe
was a Gauguin show at the Foundation Pierre Gianadda in Matigny,
Switzerland; it counted 379,260 visitors. A Magritte exhibition at
the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Brussels was next with 302,204.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum plays an incredible role in American cities: it's a
focal point, a place for entertainment, for shopping,'' Ms. Cocks
said, explaining the attendance gap. ``I don't think any European
museum has that same presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul DiMaggio, chairman of the sociology department at Princeton
University and an expert on public participation in the arts,
agreed. ``Art museums in the United States have really made it in
the last 15 to 20 years,'' he said. ``It is the only art form that
has dramatically increased attendance of people of every kind, not
just the intellectual elite. It is the great arts institution
success story of the last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Art Newspaper's museum attendance survey is the best that
exists, but it is not perfect. Museums report their own attendance
numbers and counting methods vary. Some use individual ticket sales
as a measure; others, like the Metropolitan, station people with
clickers at the door of a show to count. Museums that miss
deadlines or submit estimates are not on the list, Ms. Cocks said.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of
Chicago and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, for example, are
noticeably absent from the 1998 report, but they had shows that
would have ranked high. At the Art Institute, ``Mary Cassatt:
Modern Woman'' attracted 341,651 visitors, museum figures show. The
Modern counted 337,000 viewers of its Pierre Bonnard retrospective.
Two exhibits at the Hirshhorn, of works by Kiki Smith and by Carlos
Alfonzo, had official counts of more than 200,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Museum directors also complain that comparisons are somewhat
unfair because some exhibits are up for longer periods than others.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the newspaper's report reflects trends, and museums in
the United States are surely getting more and more crowded. The
number of exhibits claiming more than 200,000 viewers in the United
States has jumped to 21 in 1998 (or 25, if the four missing from
The Art Newspaper are counted) from 14 in 1996 and 18 in 1997.
General attendance in this country is climbing, too, far faster
than it is in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Population differences notwithstanding, nearly everyone credits
the success of American museums to marketing. ``American museums
are better at getting their message out,'' said Malcolm Rogers, a
Briton who became director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston
four years ago. Ms. Cocks, of The Art Newspaper, agreed. ``It's the
marketing that can bring another 100,000 people to a show,'' she
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotally, museum advertising seems to be up, though no
industry statistics exist and museums refuse to disclose their ad
spending. ``No question, almost every museum across the board is
doing more advertising than five years ago,'' said Elizabeth
Addison, the deputy director for marketing and communications at
the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising is not even half the story, though. It is now de
rigueur for museums to promote their big exhibitions by arranging
discount packages at hotels, planning related musical and other
performing arts events, offering special meals at their own or
nearby restaurants and, of course, selling related items in their
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they do more. For its Bonnard show the Modern offered
promotional packages that in addition to admission to the exhibit
included tickets to a Broadway show, a tour of Lincoln Center or a
French wine tasting, sometimes in combination with a meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston wrapped three buses in a
blowup of Monet's ``Waterlilies, 1907'' and offered free shuttle
service to the museum from downtown and the Back Bay section. More
than 100,000 people took advantage, the museum reported. As
exhibitions become events, news media coverage grows, adding to the
hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about reaching people, and it was the biggest marketing
effort in our history,'' Rogers of the Boston museum said, ``and we
believe it pays off.'' For the museum, the bonus comes from sales
revenues, 16,000 new members (up 20 percent, to a record 96,000)
and what Rogers called ``building momentum,'' so people will return
for its next show and for the permanent collection, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, reality doesn't quite match the hope. Last
summer the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum installed ``The Art of the
Motorcycle'' in its Frank Lloyd Wright spiral, and for a while so
many bikers, and even nonbikers, showed up that the museum said it
expected more than 500,000 people. Not quite: the final total was
301,037. A spokesman now says the half-million mark was ``a
miscalculation, not an actual projection of the museum,'' but an
estimate based on ``a few daily averages'' and the heat of the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The purists who denounced the Guggenheim for pandering to crowds
can no doubt take heart from the fact that, according to reported
figures, traditional exhibitions like the Metropolitan's Degas
collection and ``Delacroix: The Late Works'' at the Philadelphia
Museum of Art outdrew the motorcycles. The blockbuster phenomenon
has always prompted worries that museums would cater too much to
popular taste, producing show after show of Picasso, the
Impressionists or subjects that are the equivalent of
easy-listening radio.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in 1998 other shows, like ``China: 5,000 Years'' at the
Guggenheim and Mughal carpets at the Metropolitan, did well. Ms.
Cocks said that ``the odd Old Master is beginning to pull
forward,'' too. But as the numbers show, there was no denying the
widespread appeal of artists like van Gogh and especially Monet,
who after several record blockbusters in different cities and in
different years, is now considered the museum world's box-office
champion. At the Royal Academy in London, where ``Monet in the 20th

MEDIATE HOLDS OFF LEONARD FOR FIRST TITLE IN SIX YEARS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ The pack gained on Rocco Mediate on Sunday,
but nobody caught him.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing the most satisfying victory of his career, and
withstanding a furious charge by Justin Leonard, Mediate won the
Phoenix Open by two strokes over Leonard and three strokes over
Tiger Woods. Starting the day with a six-stroke lead on Woods,
Mediate hung on by shooting a 71 to finish 11 under par for the
tournament (273).
</P>
<P>
   Leonard shot a sizzling 66 to finish at 275, and Woods shot a
68. David Duval, who entered the tournament having won nine of his
last 28 starts, finished tied for 18th at one-over 285 after
shooting 74 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph, and the $540,000 first-place check, ended a
six-year victory drought for Mediate, a 36-year-old veteran who had
not won on the PGA Tour since the 1993 Kmart Greater Greensboro
Open. And conquering a difficult course, keeping his composure in
front of a huge and raucous gallery, and holding off players like
Leonard and Woods made this victory even more special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't believe I'm here, to tell you the truth,''
Mediate said. ``I didn't feel that good starting off. I was kind of
jumpy. But a guy made a stupid comment on the 12th green. He said:
`Knock that putt in, Tiger. If you do, Rocco will fold like a cheap
suit.' It was a stupid thing to say, but it got me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, one of golf's best comeback artists, made Mediate
sweat. Starting the day seven stokes back, Leonard closed to within
a stroke by making a birdie at No. 17, reaching the par-five green
in two shots and two-putting from 50 feet. But Mediate, playing one
group behind Leonard, responded to the pressure. He made a
par-saving putt at No. 16 from 8 feet, then virtually clinched the
tournament with a birdie at the par-4, 332-yard No. 17. Mediate hit
a great drive to the front of the 17th green, then two-putted from
25 feet to take a two-stroke lead. As Mediate walked down the 18th
fairway, he knew victory belonged to him. And Leonard knew his
valiant comeback effort had fallen short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to get into the middle of the tournament and keep
the pressure on,'' said Leonard, who has won three tournaments by
overcoming five-stroke deficits in the final round, the 1997
British Open, the 1997 Kemper Open and last year's Players
Championship. ``You can never give up. It just wasn't in the
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also not in the cards for Woods, who has 15 top-10
finishes in his last 22 tour events but no victories in that span.
Sunday it was his putter that failed him. He missed a 15-foot
birdie attempts at No. 1 and No. 3, an 8-foot birdie attempt at No.
12 and a 15-foot birdie attempt at No. 14. ``I had a few chances in
the middle of the round to get something going, but I wasn't able
to make putts,'' said Woods. ``I did hang in there, but I'm
disappointed to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was also involved in a strange scene at No. 13, when his
tee shot missed the fairway and landed behind a wide, waist-high
boulder. After Woods asked for a ruling, it was determined that the
boulder could be moved, and it took about 10 spectators to push the
large rock out of Woods' way. According to the rules, stones of any
size, not solidly embedded, may be removed, provided it does not
unduly delay play, and spectators are allowed to help move the
object. Woods shook the hand of everyone who helped move the
boulder, then he went on to birdie the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the gallery if they would be willing to help me, and
they were more than willing,'' said Woods, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   As for Duval, he admitted he was tired, still feeling the
hangover from shooting a record-tying 59 during the final round at
the Hope last Sunday. ``Other than Saturday, I really didn't play
that well,'' said Duval, who will play this week's AT&AMP;T National
Pro-am at Pebble Beach. ``I'm just going to take it easy and get
ready for next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mediate hoped it would not take another six years for
his next victory. ``I woke up at 5 a.m. and couldn't go back to
sleep,'' said Mediate. ``The demons started to come. But I hung in
there pretty good.'' &UR;  &LR; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A troubling scene occurred near the tee box on No. 6, when a
spectator carrying a gun was wrestled to the ground and arrested by
police officers on charges of disorderly conduct and aggravated
assault. The incident occurred just after the day's final group of
Tiger Woods, Harrison Frazar and Rocco Mediate had teed off.
</P>
<P>
   As the three golfers started walking down the fairway, the
spectator said something to an officer, then pushed the officer.
The spectator was immediately wrestled to the ground and handcuffed
by three officers. According to police, the man had a permit for
the gun. Several witnesses said the man had been heckling other
golfers who had previously played the sixth hole. ``I saw it and
just kept walking,'' said Woods.

UCLA LOSES ITS COOL IN DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Before UCLA lost the game, Steve Lavin lost control.
</P>
<P>
   Complete control.
</P>
<P>
   And he offered no apologies for the greatest rage of his young
coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, you always want to set a better example for your
players, and that was the first thing I told them,'' Lavin said.
``But there comes a time when you have to dig in and take a
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin did more than that Sunday afternoon in the late stages of
UCLA's 93-83 loss to the Huskies, before 7,900 fans in Hec
Edmundson Pavilion. With 4:34 remaining and UCLA trailing 77-70,
referee Terry Christman whistled Baron Davis for his fifth foul and
then called a technical on Davis for throwing his mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by Christman's whistle, Lavin erupted. He charged
onto the court. He ranted and raged and was restrained not once but
twice. He pointed and screamed at Christman as assistant coach Jim
Saia and forward Jerome Moiso tried to hold him back. He looked
like he wanted to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin was assessed two technicals fouls, the first of his
career, and ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Washington guard Deon Luton made 5 of 8 free throws _ two for
the foul, six for technicals _ which increased Washington's lead to
82-70. The Bruins rallied, closing to 87-81 with one minute left,
before the Huskies secured a victory crucial to their NCAA
Tournament chances.
</P>
<P>
   After the buzzer, Davis exchanged words with Washington forward
Greg Clark at midcourt and was pulled away by assistant Michael
Holton, the only Bruins player or coach who did not lose his cool.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin spent the final minutes in the locker room and chose his
words carefully upon emerging. Public criticism of officials is a
serious offense, not to mention a no-win situation for any coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the culmination of a four-game pattern of some of the
most unusual statistics I've seen since second grade,'' Lavin said.
``There are four particular games where, if you connect the dots,
it's one of the most unusual patterns I've seen in the history of
the game. It's bordering on a `Twilight Zone' thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't the most angry I've been, but it was the most
animated. I was at the end of my rope with this particular
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who cried in the locker room, was not afraid to name a
name: Christman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we were cheated and I'm tired of not saying anything,''
Davis said. ``It's that same man _ that Christman dude.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, the communists, the anti-Castro communists, and now
Terry Christman.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Bruin Attitude rule No.5: Play through officials'
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that man,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, UCLA has some evidence to support its conspiracy
theory. Whether that evidence justifies Lavin's actions or Davis'
criticism is for the Pac-10 to determine, but here goes:
</P>
<P>
   _Christman worked the four games to which Lavin referred: Oregon
State, Stanford, USC and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _In each, UCLA's opponent shot at least 40 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   _The combined free-throw attempts: opponents 178, UCLA 82.
</P>
<P>
   _Davis has been assessed three technical fouls this season _
Stanford, USC and now Washington _ and he said Christman called
them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he's got it out for us,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The whistle is now on Booker Turner's desk, so to speak. As the
Pac-10's coordinator of officials, he might avoid mixing UCLA and
Christman for fear of a riot. Or perhaps he'll send the Bruins a
message by sending Christman to work Thursday's home game against
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, there is one way for the Bruins to end the
controversy: STOP FOULING.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Christman blew the Davis call; the only contact
appeared to be an insignificant brush of the knees. But as they did
against Oregon State and Stanford, the Bruins lapsed into their
fouling mode, moving their arms instead of their feet.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive game, the Bruins (15-5, 6-3) allowed
their opponent to execute its offense at will. Washington State
doesn't have the talent to make UCLA pay, but the Huskies do _ and
they did.
</P>
<P>
   Center Todd MacCulloch had 26 points and 20 rebounds. Washington
shot 56.3 percent from the field in the second half and 54.5
percent for the game, the highest total by a UCLA opponent this
season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Huskies outrebounded UCLA 43-28 and outscored
the Bruins 57-39 in the second half _ turning a 10-point deficit
into a 74-65 lead moments before Lavin's outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outcompeted us,'' Lavin said. ``They beat us to the punch
on the boards and in transition. They were sharper and more
efficient, and they beat us soundly and squarely.''
</P>
<P>
   And quietly.

 &HT;    Fox flirts with disaster, saved by Summerall
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Just because it's the Super Bowl and a network uses a
super amount of equipment doesn't necessarily mean it cannot flirt
with super disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In Fox's coverage of Super Bowl XXXIII Sunday, which was solid
overall, there was the uncharacteristic miss of a snap, thanks to
that underworld called glitches.
</P>
<P>
   There was a typical 30-second commercial break on the change of
possession, but when the button was hit to go to the commercial,
nothing happened. It was hit again, and for no apparent reason it
worked that time. But just those few seconds made a world of
difference, and producer Bob Stenner barely averted a major
embarrassment because the late return happened to fall on the
80-yard touchdown catch by Denver's Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But in stressful times like that, it helped immensely to have
the veteran savvy of play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall, who
adroitly smoothed over the snafu by saying, ``We almost didn't get
back in time. Atlanta didn't get back in time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was a telecast where Summerall seemed more inclined
than usual to sprinkle his call with clever one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst John Madden's best moment also might have come in a
humorous vein, when he said after a second-quarter shot of Fox
``Ally McBeal'' star Calista Flockhart, ``Ally thinks this would be
a good time for Chris Chandler to start passing and passing on
first down. Right here. Right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Next play, Chandler throws to Terence Mathis for a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's amazing,'' Madden said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a lot more amazing than the performance of the
Falcons, whose second-half display needed all the humor Madden and
Summerall could muster to keep the game interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Director Sandy Grossman remained true to his vow not to show off
with the 31 cameras at his disposal. But while the coverage of the
plays were done superbly, he could have been more aggresive at
capturing the emotional side of the story on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The race to Robinson
</P>
<P>
   When word leaked of the arrest of Falcons safety Eugene
Robinson, those aggressive upstarts at Fox Sports News initially
believed they had an exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   And it seemed at the time the technical wizardry that was
supposed to make Keith Olberman's report on Robinson appear
throughout the entire Fox Sports Net chain went poof, with only 50
percent of its affiliates getting it by midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically we had the wherewithal to put it on all the
affiliates, but it's a complicated process,'' said Fox executive
producer John Terenzio.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it came to Fox's attention that Miami ABC
affiliate WPLG actually got the first break with a report at 11:30
p.m. So the goal went from exclusive to beating rival ESPN,
eventually claiming a victory that senior VP Vince Vladika said was
due in part to ``half of ESPN's anchors sitting up at the piano
singing in the hotel lobbby.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, responded ESPN, which noted ESPNews, its 24-hour
sports news channel, went on the air with the story at 11:50 p.m.
Though the report did not appear on ESPN until 12:55 a.m. because
of the live coverage of the Australian Open, the cable network was
not accepting being a step behind on this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Fox was working their sources with the women of the
evening more this week, but we beat them on the story,'' said ESPN
publicist Mike Soltys.
</P>
<P>
   However, ESPN's decision not to break into the tennis, at least
via split screen, could be second-guessed.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent sun-splashed afternoon, Rep. Jerrold
Nadler, D-N.Y., was standing outside an auditorium at the Fashion
Institute of Technology in Manhattan when a lanky woman with frizzy
brown hair strode out of the crowd and gushed, ``Can I just give
you a hug?
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have been doing is just magnificent,'' she continued.
``You're the only one out there fighting this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing,'' pronounced like a curse, referred to the
impeachment trial of President Clinton, whose tribulations have
become a war cry to many Democrats in the unabashedly liberal
precincts of Manhattan's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler, himself an unabashedly liberal Democrat who has
represented the area in Albany and Washington for 22 years, nodded
silently, soaking in her praise and doing nothing to dispel the
heroic images she had woven. He is, it seems, getting used to this
sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to all-impeachment-all-the-time television, Nadler has
won national prominence for his ardent _ critics say strident _
defense of the president in the House Judiciary Committee last
year. And while his performance, which included calling impeachment
a ``partisan coup d'etat,'' unleashed a flurry of catcalls from
conservatives, it also endeared him to scads of New York voters.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Nadler received a standing ovation at a meeting of
Democrats at the New York Historical Society. Ditto in January from
2,000 people gathered at Avery Fisher Hall for the ceremonial
second inauguration of Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. On the streets
and in restaurants, strangers seek Nadler out for congratulatory
handshakes and back slaps.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly rock-star status, but heady stuff for this
51-year-old son of a former chicken farmer, a garrulously
intelligent, wonkish politician whose previous claims to fame had
been fighting against Donald Trump projects on the West Side and
for a rail freight tunnel to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighborhood is kvelling about Nadler more than ever
before,'' said an old friend, state Assemblyman Richard Gottfried,
using a Yiddish word that means to beam with pride. ``His role in
the impeachment hearings has given him the status of a local
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler may be positioned to maintain his elevated stature after
the impeachment trial ends.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his fourth term, Nadler, whose serpentine 8th District
extends from West 125th Street along the waterfront to Coney
Island, is the ranking Democrat on the House subcommittee that will
debate whether to renew the independent counsel statute this year.
Nadler, who wants either to change or abolish the law, says he
plans to use hearings to review Kenneth Starr's five-year
investigation, perhaps calling Starr as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen some really nasty conduct'' from the independent
counsel's office, Nadler said. ``To what degree was that nasty
conduct because Starr is a jerk, to what extent is it because there
was a failure of supervision by the attorney general, and to what
extent was it because of the inherent failure of the law?''
</P>
<P>
   His congressional colleagues also say that Nadler's close
relationship with Schumer, who served with him in the House before
this year, will substantially increase the congressman's influence
within the New York delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a hidden gem for New York,'' Schumer said. ``He is
in many ways a model legislator.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and other Democrats say the Judiciary Committee's
impeachment proceedings provided the ideal stage for Nadler to
display his particular skills: He has an incisive mind and a memory
for details.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a tendency for members to get lost in the crowd of
liberals,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``Jerry broke through
that very clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said he was not convinced that Clinton committed perjury
or obstructed justice, but that even if the president did, the
offenses would not be impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``An impeachable offense is an abuse of presidential power
designed to or with the effect of undermining the structure or
function of government, or undermining constitutional liberties,''
he told several hundred people at the recent town hall meeting at
the Fashion Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Nadler won praise from Democrats for
obtaining federal audits that detailed the independent counsel's
expenditures on advisers and equipment, which he mocked as
extravagant. He was also among the first to criticize the wording
of the first article of impeachment as vague, an argument Clinton's
lawyers used during the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the House debate, Nadler's wise-cracking,
fast-talking New York style was on display. For instance, when
Republicans theorized that Clinton gave Monica Lewinsky a teddy
bear to signal her to stay quiet about their affair, Nadler said,
``I think the bear was a warning from the president that the stock
market was going to tank and she should put her money in bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were not amused. Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.,
R-Wis., said Nadler was one of a group of Democrats guilty of
``shrill partisanship.'' And Republican Judiciary Committee aides
said Nadler had lost respect among Republicans for his ``strident''
defense of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler particularly seemed to annoy Rep. Henry Hyde, the
courtly, white-maned Republican from Illinois who is chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, Democrats on the committee say. During a
session on Nov. 9, when a Democratic member complained that Hyde
seemed to have trouble seeing him, Hyde replied, ``When you are
behind Nadler, it is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's aides denied that the comment was intended to mock
Nadler's considerable girth, noting that Hyde is sensitive about
such jokes since he is himself battling an expanding waistline. And
Nadler said he was not convinced that Hyde intended to insult him.
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats on the committee said they considered the
remark a cruel dig at Nadler. They also viewed it as a moral
victory of sorts. ``It was an indication that Jerry was getting
under his skin,'' Frank said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks before Hyde made his comment, former Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., referred to Nadler as ``Jerry Waddler'' in
a private meeting of reporters and politicians, a remark that later
was made public. The crack proved embarrassing for D'Amato's
re-election campaign, and he quickly apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler's friends say he is rarely upset by such incidents. But
the congressman acknowledged in an interview that he felt a deep
revulsion toward weight jokes, which he called one of the last
forms of socially acceptable bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of people who are prejudiced on religious or
ethnic or racial bases, but they hide it,'' he said. ``I don't
think Sen. D'Amato would have made that comment if it were about
someone being Jewish or black or even gay.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not think his colleagues took him less seriously
because of his weight. ``But I think it probably hurts me as a
candidate,'' he continued. ``I'm sure there are people who voted
against me or wouldn't consider voting for me simply because of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerrold Lewis Nadler was born in Bensonhurst, N.Y., but he moved
about the region several times as his father tried his hand at a
series of businesses, including a chicken farm in New Jersey, a gas
station on Long Island and a traveling auto-parts store.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from a Brooklyn yeshiva, Nadler attended
Stuyvesant High School, where he became fast friends with
Gottfried, the future assemblyman, and Dick Morris, the future
political consultant to Clinton. The two men helped Nadler get
elected president of the student government. Later, Morris shared
an apartment with Nadler when the two attended Columbia together.
(Nadler and Morris had a falling out in the mid-1970s and have not
spoken since).
</P>
<P>
   During college, the three men became core members of a group of
brash young Democrats who were active in Eugene McCarthy's
presidential campaign, the antiwar movement and West Side reform
politics. In 1976, while still attending Fordham Law School at
night, Nadler was narrowly elected to the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, Nadler latched on to many of the issues that have
come to define his public career. He became an expert on
transportation issues, wrote the state law authorizing the
government to withhold wages to pay for child support and advocated
civil rights for gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 1992 primary, Rep. Ted Weiss, who had
represented the district for 18 years, died. Nadler leapt into the
race and won with surprising ease over a crowded field that
included Gottfried. He has won re-election by large margins since.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Nadler has been a frequent critic of Clinton,
strongly opposing the 1996 welfare law, the North American Free
Trade Agreement and several administration measures he contends
would violate civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``What fired him up about impeachment was more passion about the
substance of the case than affection for Bill Clinton,'' Gottfried
said. ``Like me and others, he was lukewarm about Clinton at best
when this began. Now we're ready to storm the barricades.''

   NEW YORK _ They vowed they'd never do a club act again, but two
of New York's hottest cabaret performers (of the early 1940s) are
back.
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible Betty Comden and Adolph Green, once two-fifths
of a witty act called the Revuers, recently dropped in on the new
Joe's Pub at the Joseph Papp Public Theater and decided to hold
``An Intimate Party With Betty and Adolph.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in the pub's Monday Songbook Series at 8:30 p.m. on
Feb. 1 and Feb. 8, they'll sing numbers from their musicals and
cabaret classics like ``The Baroness Bazooka.'' Information: (212)

   Masters and rivals, Matisse and Picasso engaged in an artistic
dialogue that began when they met in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Much scholarship has been focused on the years until 1917, when
Matisse left Paris for Nice. But an exhibition that opened Sunday
at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, deals with the
renewed dialogue that extended from 1930 until Matisse's death in
1954 and even beyond, when Picasso paid posthumous homage to his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle Rivalry,'' through May 2,
some 100 works from around the world juxtapose their art to
illuminate their keen but respectful rivalry. Information: (817)

   NEW YORK _ It's Weill at the Weill for two nights this week. One
Weill is Kurt Weill. The other is the Weill Recital Hall at
Carnegie Hall, the site of ``Kurt Weill's American Theater Music,''
at 8 Monday night and Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Besides stealing a march on the Weill (1900-1950) centenary, the
celebration of this German-born emigre composer includes songs from
his Broadway shows, including ``Knickerbocker Holiday,'' ``Lady in
the Dark'' ``One Touch of Venus'' and ``Lost in the Stars,'' sung
by the soprano Angelina Reaux, the mezzo-soprano Joanna Simon, the
tenor Michael DeVries and the baritone Kurt Ollmann. Information:

   As gifted as he was controversial, Paul Robeson led a life that
brought him All-American honors on the football field at Rutgers
University, Phi Beta Kappa status in the classroom, stardom as an
actor and singer, and condemnation and ostracism as a communist
sympathizer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, through some 150 photographs, prints, paintings and pieces
of memorabilia and audio clips, Robeson (1898-1976) is the subject
of a new exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution's National
Portrait Gallery in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items in ``Paul Robeson: Artist and Citizen,'' through
April 18, are a program from his first formal concert, in Boston in
1924; his costume from the 1933 production of ``The Emperor
Jones,'' and photographs documenting his efforts to end racial
discrimination and other social injustice. Information: (202)

OFF-ROADERS ANGRY AT FINDING ENDANGERED AMPHIBIAN HABITAT
OFF-LIMITS

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. -- Scott Moser would brake for
endangered toads, but the off-road vehicle enthusiast staged an
angry protest because he says the federal government won't give him
a break when it comes to enjoying his favorite four-wheel-drive
trails.
</P>
<P>
   At issue: The U.S. Forest Service's decision to close 3,000
acres of off-road trails, fishing streams and a campground to
protect the endangered arroyo southwestern toad.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials say human encroachment on mountain streams
roughly 30 miles north of Los Angeles threatens to push the 3-inch,
greenish-gray toad into extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand about the toad, but they're taking all the
recreation out of the area,'' said Moser, an electronics technician
who has driven the now-closed trails for two decades. ``They're
making humans endangered on public land. They're locking us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser and about 40 fellow off-road enthusiasts gathered outside
the newly locked gate to the Littlerock Reservoir on Sunday for a
pre-Super Bowl XXXIII protest of the Jan. 25 decision to close 17
miles of their favorite trails.
</P>
<P>
   The closure was particularly galling because it came only days
after most of them had renewed their $30 forest recreation
Adventure Passes.
</P>
<P>
   The government said, ``Hey, buy the annual pass,'' Moser said.
``They told us our money would be spent here to take care of it,
but instead they're shutting us out. If we can't use the area, we
don't want the pass.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter explaining the decision to close the area, Angeles
National Forest Supervisor Michael J. Rogers said he could be held
personally responsible if a single toad is killed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say off-road drivers crush the small toads on trails
and hikers may accidentally squash them in shallow streambeds.
Noise from the Little Rock Creek campground also drowns out the
toad's mating calls, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The new ban was drafted after less restrictive measures were
ignored by people who use the recreation area, forestry officials
said. The land is closed until 2003 so scientists can monitor the
toad population's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The off-roaders suspect the closure is more personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about the toads, it's about us,'' said Jack Rosema,
a Lancaster, Calif., business owner. ``The Forest Service has been
trying to get rid of off-roaders for the past five or six years.
They blame us for the trash and all the damage here, but it's not
us doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We follow trails that are already there,'' Rosema said. ``We
don't leave our trash around and we respect the land and the other
people that use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Sweet, an expert on amphibians at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, said the toads are threatened by more
than just off-road drivers.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sweet who petitioned to have the toad listed under the
Endangered Species Act in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arroyo toads are seriously in trouble as a species,'' Sweet
said. ``It's not due to any one particular thing, other than the
fact they need to live in stream beds. If Southern Californians
have done one thing, they've messed up stream beds.''
</P>
<P>
   While campers and off-road drivers may smash some toads, it's
the region's insatiable thirst for water that is the main
threat,Sweet said. Most streams in Southern California have been
dammed to provide water for Los Angeles and other urban areas. He
said managing dams so that water comes in a more natural trickle _
instead of drought or whitewater _ would help the toads
tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like that is going to do much more good than
throwing people out of off-road vehicle parks,'' Sweet said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the Endangered Species Act is written so
specifically that forest managers had no choice but to close the
land to protect the toad.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Forest Ranger Perry Bauman stopped by Sunday's protest to
talk with the off-road drivers. He suggested the enthusiasts write
their elected officials and work with wildlife officials to develop
ways to steer clear of the toads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll leave the frog alone,'' Moser said. ``I understand the
problem. We respect their reasons, but they need to respect ours.
They can have 2,999 acres. Give us one little spot where we can
play and we'll take care of it.''

DISPATCHER AND COMPUTER LINKED TO COMMUTER JET'S ROLL NEAR CHICAGO
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A commuter jet approaching O'Hare International
Airport in Chicago last week was abruptly tossed around and rolled
45 degrees, apparently after it flew into the swirling wake of a
Boeing 757, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   An initial inquiry found that an error by an airline dispatcher
in Mexico City, combined with a glitch in one of the federal
agency's computers, led a controller to tell the pilot of the small
jet to follow the larger one too closely. The incident happened
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-seat commuter jet, a United Express flight from
Wilkes-Barre-Scranton, Pa., to Chicago, broke off its approach, but
no one was injured. It landed safely, the aviation agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 757 generates an unusually powerful wake for a plane
of its size, and controllers are supposed to keep other planes at
least four miles behind it instead of the standard three. To aid
controllers, the computers that run the radar screens are supposed
to add a letter to the text block that appears next to the blip
representing the plane.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexicana Airlines was said to have entered an incomplete
designation when it filed a flight plan for its Flight 802 from
Mexico City to O'Hare. The computer system does not generate the
extra letter itself and is not set up to flag the omission.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the controllers union said they had complained
about the glitch for a long time. ``They've known about it for
several months, and now we've almost had a disaster, and in typical
fashion they finally react,'' said Michael E. Egan, vice president
of the controllers local at the federal aviation office involved in
the incident. He said that the day after the incident, aviation
administration managers told him their priority was a change in the
computer program to prevent a repetition.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony T. Molinaro, a spokesman for the aviation agency,
confirmed that the reminder was missing from the computer screen.
But, he added, ``If this is a political way for some controllers to
say something is wrong with the computer system, that isn't
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinaro said investigators would be listening to tapes of
conversations between the Mexicana pilot and the controller, and
between the controller and another controller who had handled the
plane earlier, to see whether any of them had mentioned that it was
a 757.
</P>
<P>
   The controller is being charged with an ``operational error''
and will be retrained before being allowed to handle traffic again.
Controllers who accumulate too many errors can be barred from
handling traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, the aviation agency has been changing
the rules on how types of aircraft are designated, in preparation
for the introduction of a new technique designed to squeeze more
traffic through airports. The new rules categorize planes in part
by their ability to stop on a runway.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, airlines are supposed to specify not only
the type of plane, in this case a Boeing 757, but also the series,
in this case 200. The Federal Aviation Administration computer
would have recognized that as a plane with a big wake and would
have added the letter ``L'' to the controller's screen. But
Molinaro said preliminary information indicated the Mexicana flight
plan said only ``757.'' Mexicana has made the same error before, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Egan of the controller's union said that while the distinction
between a 757-200 and a 757 might be important to the computer, it
was meaningless to controllers in his office, who handle all 757s
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   At O'Hare, a Mexicana employee said the airline's station
manager was in a meeting and unavailable.

SPORTS COLUMN: JOHN ELWAY'S LAST ROUNDUP
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ John Elway would not say it in so many words, but for
the Denver Broncos' quarterback, their 34-19 victory in Super Bowl
XXXIII on Sunday night was his last roundup.
</P>
<P>
   And his best.
</P>
<P>
   As the oldest quarterback, at 38, to start a Super Bowl game, he
completed 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards, including an 80-yard
touchdown to wide receiver Rod Smith that broke the Atlanta
Falcons' wings.
</P>
<P>
   Elway also scored a clinching touchdown on a 1-yard keeper as
the Broncos joined the Packers, the Dolphins, the Steelers (twice),
the 49ers and the Cowboys as the only teams to win two consecutive
Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, Denver and the Broncos will never be quite the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Few athletes have ever defined their city or their area the way
Elway has. Until he arrived, Denver was just a mile-high cow town
with low esteem in sports. The 1977 Broncos had been to the Super
Bowl with their Orange Crush defense, but were crushed. The
basketball Nuggets were never much. The baseball Rockies and the
hockey Avalanche weren't even there yet.
</P>
<P>
   But almost as soon as Elway started throwing passes in 1983, he
usurped Denver's identity. He was bigger than the city itself,
bigger than the Rocky Mountains in the distance. Other players
didn't talk about playing Denver, they talked about playing Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrated quarterbacks never overshadowed their cities.
Joe Montana wasn't San Francisco; the Golden Gate Bridge was. Terry
Bradshaw wasn't Pittsburgh; steel was. Bart Starr wasn't Green Bay;
bratwurst was. Joe Namath wasn't New York; Broadway and Fifth
Avenue were. Johnny Unitas wasn't Baltimore; crab cakes were.
</P>
<P>
   But for 16 seasons, John Elway has been Denver, and Denver was
happy to have him, even when the Broncos lost three Super Bowls
with him.
</P>
<P>
   He even looked like he belonged there: big shoulders, with a
lariat for an arm. And he walked like a cowboy who just got off his
horse.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was even part of the Denver economy. His auto dealerships
were so successful, they were sold for a reported $82.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Elway played his last game in Mile High Stadium.
After he rallied the Broncos over the Jets, 23-10, for the American
Football Conference title, he stayed on the field and waved
goodbye. He told the fans, ``I love you.'' He took a victory lap to
``look into'' their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   What Elway saw in those eyes was their affection for a
quarterback whose numbers as a passer, as dazzling as they were,
never were as important to him as the numbers on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the appreciations of Elway through the years, the
Broncos' backup, Bubby Brister, perhaps explained better than
anybody else what has made Elway tick since he arrived in Denver
after telling the Baltimore Colts, who had drafted him, that he
wouldn't play there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All John ever wants to know,'' Brister was saying during the
week, ``is what he needs to win, whether it's Ping-Pong, fishing,
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Brister remembered a fishing trip during the off-season when
Elway asked him the weight of the biggest fish he had ever caught.
Brister told him 8 pounds 8 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day,'' Brister recalled, laughing, ``John caught a
9-pounder.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time they were playing a video game. Brister put up 52
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``John made 54,'' Brister said. ``He's the most competitive guy
I've ever known. And that same attitude made him such a great
quarterback. When he was behind in the fourth quarter, all he
wanted to know was what he needed to win _ a touchdown or a field
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Elway generated that winning touchdown or
that winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In his career as the National Football League's career
winningest quarterback, Elway produced a record 47 game-saving
drives, including six in the post-season. And when he was asked the
other day to rate his best moments other than the Super Bowl upset
of the Packers a year ago, he mentioned two drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `the Drive' in Cleveland is the first thing that pops
into my mind,'' he said, referring to winning the 1986 AFC title
game. ``That kind of put me on the map. And I went 98 yards to kick
a field goal to beat Houston in the first round of the playoffs.
`The Drive' in Cleveland was 98 yards, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Elway and anybody else remembers those drives is
because the Broncos won those games _ the barometer he used in
rating his top three quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparing quarterbacks is like comparing apples and oranges,''
he said, ``because the circumstances that each quarterback has are
so different. But I think the bottom line is the guys who can
figure out ways to win, no matter what the circumstances or what
position they are in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at Dan Marino as being up there with his
numbers and what he has done; unfortunately, he never has had a
good enough team to go all the way. I think Johnny Unitas kicked
everything off, a guy that won championships, and Roger Staubach
because he was my idol when I was young.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, surely, John Elway is an idol for so many others _ the
young who wish they could do what he does and the old who wish they
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything that sums up John's career,'' Mike
Shanahan, the Broncos' coach, said, ``it's that he puts the team
first _ one of the reasons he's not talking about retirement right
now. He doesn't want to lose focus of this football game, that the
game is more important than him and his retirement. He's an
unselfish guy that has meant everything to Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Just rename it Elway, Colorado.

 &HT;    Denver adds to its history as an early score team
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ By spotting the Falcons a 3-0 lead early in the first
quarter, Denver started Super Bowl XXXIII atypically behind, but
its 7-3 lead after the first 15 minutes only added to the Broncos
impressive first-quarter history.
</P>
<P>
   Denver outscored its opponents 144-54 in the first quarter
during the 1998 season, the third best point differential in an
opening quarter in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Denver had outscored its opponents 14-0 in its two previous
postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   The 1966 Kansas City Chiefs hold the record in first-quarter
differential (128 points), outscoring opponents in 14 games,
158-30, in the opening quarter. The 1986 Minnesota Vikings are
second with a 91-point first quarter differential.
</P>
<P>
   In 18 games this season, only four Denver opponents scored first
on the Broncos in the opening quarter. The Broncos had outscored
opponents 54-9 on opening drives in all games in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes the grudge
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always a theme to a game,'' Jack Elway said before the
kickoff. He's Denver's director of pro scouting and father of the
Broncos quarterback, John. ''You have Dan Reeves and Mike Shanahan
and John, so you have another theme that makes the game extremely
important. John'll be motivated for this game, I can tell you that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Falcons) want to win the game in regards to Dan
Reeves because I think there's something extra special there with
everything that's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway record
</P>
<P>
   Denver quarterback John Elway achieved an NFL record by starting
his fifth Super Bowl Sunday and it didn't take him long to get in
the Super Bowl record book again.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first quarter, an Elway pass intended for tight end
Shannon Sharpe, glanced off Sharpe's fingertips and was intercepted
by Atlanta cornerback Ronnie Bradford. It was Elway's eighth
interception thrown in a Super Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Elway had been tied with Jim Kelly (Buffalo Bills), who threw
seven interceptions in four Super Bowls, and Craig Morton
(Broncos), who threw seven in two Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, again
</P>
<P>
   If this was to be Elway's last game, he would go out in style.
With less than five minutes before halftime, he threw deep to wide
receiver Rod Smith. The 80-yard touchdown connection became the
second-longest Super Bowl TD play ever. It's right behind the
81-yard pass from Doug Williams to Ricky Sanders in the Washington
Redskins victory over Denver in Super Bowl XXII. It is, however, a
Denver postseason record.
</P>
<P>
   And again
</P>
<P>
   With his 23rd pass attempt of the game in the third quarter,
Elway set a Super Bowl record with 146 pass attempts, surpassing
Kelly's 145 pass attempts in four Super Bowls. But Elway had a
quarter to extend his record.
</P>
<P>
   Fans warned
</P>
<P>
   Denver fans were put on notice that, if the Broncos were to win
the game, celebrating in that city's streets will be considered
breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to throw a bunch of jaywalkers in jail,'' said
Denver police Chief Tom Sanchez. Instead, he said police have been
ordered to try to keep revelers on the sidewalks and out of the
streets.

 &HT;    Falcons chances for win intercepted
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler put himself among the
NFL's best when he drove the Falcons to a pair of late scoring
drives in the overtime win at Minnesota in the NFC Championship
Game.
</P>
<P>
   Against Denver in Super Bowl XXXIII at Joe Robbie Stadium,
however, Chandler's three interceptions in the second half led to
the Falcons' complete undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta trailed the Broncos 17-6 at halftime, but appeared to
catch a break when Denver kicker Jason Elam missed a 38-yard field
goal wide right on the opening drive of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons took over and drove to the Denver 41, but Chandler
was sacked for a six-yard loss by linebacker John Mobley. On
second-and-16, Chandler threw an ill-advised pass to Terance
Mathis, which was intercepted by cornerback Darrius Johnson and
returned 28 yards to the Atlanta 42.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons got another break, though, when Elam missed a
48-yard field goal wide left with 3:49 remaining in the third. But
after Atlanta drove to the Denver 21, Chandler's pass was tipped by
defensive tackle Keith Traylor at the line. Cornerback Darien
Gordon intercepted the pass intended for tight end O.J. Santiago
and returned it 58 yards to the Atlanta 24.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos fullback Howard Griffith scored his second touchdown
five plays later for a 24-6 lead with 14:56 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was intercepted a third time when Gordon picked off his
pass intended for Mathis at the goal line. Gordon returned it 50
yards to the Falcons' 48.
</P>
<P>
   Versatile Dwight
</P>
<P>
   Falcons rookie Tim Dwight scored on a 94-yard kickoff return
early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The former Iowa star ranked third in the NFC this season in
kickoff returns. He returned one 31 yards down the right sideline
on the game's opening play.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dwight lined up at tailback and gained five yards around
right end, after briefly showing that he was going to pass.
</P>
<P>
   After Denver took a 17-3 lead on John Elway's 80-yard bomb to
Rod Smith, Dwight returned the ensuing kickoff 42 yards down the
left sideline to the Broncos 49. Atlanta got a 28-yard field goal
from Morten Andersen to pull within 17-6.
</P>
<P>
   Rare miss for Morten
</P>
<P>
   Andersen missed a 26-yard field goal in the second quarter, when
his attempt was wide right. The miss snapped Andersen's string of
12 straight field goals made in the playoffs. Andersen was 6-for-6
in this year's playoff games before the miscue, and he hadn't
missed since missing two for New Orleans in a 1990 NFC Wildcard
Game.
</P>
<P>
   Early Birds
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons scored on their opening possession for the eighth
time this season on Andersen's 35-yard field goal with 9:35 left.
Atlanta scored five touchdowns and kicked three field goals (44
points) on those drives. That doesn't include Dwight's 93-yard
touchdown return against Carolina on Oct. 4, but the Falcons did
score the first time they touched the ball against the Panthers.

FOX ALMOST MISSES THE GAME'S LONGEST PASS PLAY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In big-time sports coverage, you never want to miss a play, let
alone an 80-yard touchdown during the Super Bowl. Fox came close to
the precipice Sunday night as mechanical failure caused the network
to stay three seconds too long with a commercial for the film ``The
Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a shock coming out of the commercial to see no
huddle, no snap, just Denver's John Elway passing the ball to Rod
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost didn't get back in time,'' said Fox's Pat Summerall.
``And Atlanta didn't get back in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the first half, Summerall sounded stronger than in
recent times, especially compared with his languid performance two
weeks ago during the National Football Conference championship
game. Sunday night, he was more engaged, more attuned to what John
Madden said and more likely to identify a player before describing
what he did rather than calling it in the reverse order. He was
especially quick in identifying Atlanta's Ronnie Bradford as the
interceptor of a ball that tipped off the hands of Denver's Shannon
Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   Madden was his characteristic manic self, with rapid-fire
Telestrations and play analyses, noting Denver's penchant for its
empty backfield formation, without running back Terrell Davis, and
how Elway had not passed to Ed McCaffrey in the first two quarters.
But Madden never offered anything as witty during the half as he
did during the pregame show, when he was asked about the feud
between Denver coach Mike Shanahan and Atlanta coach Denver Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they kick off,'' he said, ``no one will remember it. No
one's saying, `My coach hates his coach, my coach hates his coach,'
and drops the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But, commenting on Summerall's note that the Atlanta defense was
not ready on a particular second-quarter play, Madden said: ``They
had the old 15-man defense. You can't play the old
five-five-five.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the Super Bowl _ or any NFL game _ is that
a network cannot elongate the game beyond the standard three hours.
Not so the pregame. To stage seven hours of pregame activities, as
Fox did Sunday, is to invite the inevitable creative question: why?
Is it possible to produce programming that is delicious and
nutritious that's twice as long as the game?
</P>
<P>
   No. Each time a network has fattened the pregame formula by
stretching to three, four, five, and seven hours, it has added
little but tedium.
</P>
<P>
   There were two sections to Fox's Pregame Epoch: from 11 a.m.-2
p.m. and from 2-6 p.m., Eastern time. The cream of Section 1 was
the All-Madden, All-Millennium Team, a 90-minute nostalgia buff's
smorgasbord that was terrific but would have benefited from axing
the re-creation of the launch of the NFL and a faux match-up
between Madden's millennium group and his 1998 team.
</P>
<P>
   A more credible (and more humorous) match-up was last Saturday
night's Tweety-Sylvester face-off on The Cartoon Network, which was
narrated, analyzed and diagrammed to a perfect pitch by Madden and
Summerall.
</P>
<P>
   Fox would have had a finer, shorter Section 2 had it been
confined to the best chatter from the pregame voices and
confrontations between (1) Fox's Cris Collinsworth and his former
Cincinnati teammate Stanley Wilson and (2) Fox's Terry Bradshaw and
the former Cowboy, Thomas (Hollywood) Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Each segment packed emotional resonance. Collinsworth has hated
Wilson since the running back was found in a cocaine stupor on the
eve of Super Bowl XXIII. Collinsworth was filled with anger and the
right questions: How could Wilson do it? How did he find the drugs?
How could he fail the team? ``I felt like an insect, so small, so
useless, so humiliated,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Super Bowl XIII, Henderson riled Bradshaw by saying the
Pittsburgh quarterback couldn't spell cat even if he spotted him
the first and last letters. In Austin, Texas, Bradshaw found a
changed Henderson, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who has
abandoned all the flash of his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was laying in jail watching a 13-inch TV when you were
inducted into the Hall of Fame,'' Henderson said. ``I said I wanted
to make amends.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest was insubstantial: a tour of Miami by the Fox
star Jason Priestley, trivia questions by other Fox stars
(including one in her black scanties), a whip-around to five cities
that showed how fans worldwide can shamelessly mug for cameras (we
export far too much culture) and a joint interview with the running
backs Davis and Jamal Anderson that ran too short.
</P>
<P>
   And there were the three-part ``Super Bowl Diaries,'' which
purported to present a backstage view of the Broncos and Falcons'
preparations. ``See all the things you weren't supposed to see,''
bleated one promotion. Were scandals and taboos to be revealed for
our pleasure? Bah! Tim Dwight shopped for luggage, Terance Mathis
kissed his baby daughter, the Denver owner Pat Bowlen lifted
weights, Ray Buchanan and Eugene Robinson sang and players packed
for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   To Fox's credit, it never shrank from reporting about the
Saturday night arrest of the Falcons' Eugene Robinson, on a charge
of solicitation for prostitution. Nor did the pregame crew fail to
connect how Wilson's drug involvement hurt the Bengals a decade ago
with how Robinson's arrest would affect Atlanta.

DISPATCHER AND COMPUTER CITED IN JET MISHAP
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(ms) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A commuter jet approaching O'Hare International
Airport in Chicago last week was abruptly tossed around and rolled
45 degrees, apparently after it flew into the swirling wake of a
Boeing 757, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   An initial inquiry found that an error by an airline dispatcher
in Mexico City, combined with a glitch in one of the federal
agency's computers, led a controller to tell the pilot of the small
jet to follow the larger one too closely. The incident happened
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-seat commuter jet, a United Express flight from
Wilkes-Barre-Scranton, Pa., to Chicago, broke off its approach, but
no one was injured. It landed safely, the aviation agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 757 generates an unusually powerful wake for a plane
of its size, and controllers are supposed to keep other planes at
least four miles behind it instead of the standard three. To aid
controllers, the computers that run the radar screens are supposed
to add a letter to the text block that appears next to the blip
representing the plane.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexicana Airlines was said to have entered an incomplete
designation when it filed a flight plan for its Flight 802 from
Mexico City to O'Hare. The computer system does not generate the
extra letter itself and is not set up to flag the omission.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the controllers union said they had complained
about the glitch for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony T. Molinaro, a spokesman for the aviation agency,
confirmed that the reminder was missing from the computer screen.
But, he added, ``If this is a political way for some controllers to
say something is wrong with the computer system, that isn't
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The controller is being charged with an ``operational error''
and will be retrained before being allowed to handle traffic again.
Controllers who accumulate too many errors can be barred from
handling traffic.

 &HT;    Falcons' debut ruined by Broncos' encore, 34-19
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Atlanta Falcons' dream season came to a screeching
halt Sunday night, as the ''Dirty Birds'' crash-landed in a 34-19
loss to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (16-3) made it to the Super Bowl for the first time in
33 years by running the ball well, defending the run, taking care
of the ball, and converting opportunities better than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   One out of four was not enough to get it done against the
Broncos (17-2), who dominated in nearly every phase save special
teams en route to winning their second straight world title.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Jamal Anderson rushed for more than 100 yards, but
Broncos quarterback John Elway was named MVP, throwing for 336
yards on 18-of-29 passing in what may or may not be the final game
of his 16-year career. Elway passed for one touchdown and ran for
another.
</P>
<P>
   His showdown with Falcons coach Dan Reeves, with whom he had
such a strained argument for the first 10 years of his career, was
one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 74,803 at Pro Player watched as, at various times,
Atlanta reached the Denver 8 (resulting in a field goal), the 26
(ran out of downs), the 8 (missed field goal), the 11 (field goal)
and the 21 (interception).
</P>
<P>
   In the regular season, Atlanta finished sixth in the NFL in red
zone scoring percentage, with touchdowns on 58.7 percent of such
possessions, and scores on 89.1 percent of those possessns.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler threw
interceptions on three straight possessions in the second half. Two
of the picks set up Denver touchdowns, streching a 17-6 halftime
lead to 31-6.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta coach Dan Reeves is now 0-4 in Super Bowls as a head
coach, the first three losses coming in the 1980s as coach of the
Broncos. The losses were by scores of 39-20, 42-10, and 55-10.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Falcons moved the ball fairly well, but
they kept bogging down inside the Broncos' 20-yard line. They also
couldn't slow the Denver offense.
</P>
<P>
   Each team scored on its first drive, but a theme was apparent
quickly: Denver was making its drives count more than Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons drove 55 yards on nine plays to start the game,
helped by a 25-yard interference penalty on Denver cornerback Ray
Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   But on third-and-8 from the Denver 8, Chris Chandler was sacked
by blitzing linebacker Bill Romanowski. Atlanta finished the half
converting just one-of-six third downs into first downs.
</P>
<P>
   After settling for a 32-yard field goal by Morten Andersen,
Atlanta allowed a 10-play, 80-yard drive by Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons Pro Bowl cornerback Ray Buchanan did a nice job covering
Denver Pro Bowl wide receiver Ed McCaffrey in the first half, but
Atlanta couldn't cover Rod Smith. He had four receptions for 144
yards in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   His 41-yard reception on the Broncos' next drive _ with nickel
back Randy Fuller covering _ was the key play in a drive that ended
with fullback Howard Griffith's 1-yard fun. That gave Denver a 7-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of first quarter, Atlanta appeared to get a break.
</P>
<P>
   Falcon cornerback Ronnie Bradford intercepted a pass that should
have been caught by Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe, and Atlanta
took over at the Denver 36.
</P>
<P>
   The end result, though, was no points. Jamal Anderson was
stuffed for no gain on 3-and-1, and lost 2 yards on fourth-and-1 to
give the ball to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   A 26-yard field goal by Jason Elam extended Denver's lead to
10-3 with 9:17 left in the first half, but soon momentum turned
completely against the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Pass plays of 16 and 30 yards to Terance Mathis helped Atlanta
get to the Denver 8, but after an incomplete pass from Chandler to
Tim Dwight on third-and-3, Andersen came on.
</P>
<P>
   He missed wide left.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play from scrimmage, Bradford was in a short zone to
the Falcons' left, and correctly let Smith go past.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl free safety Eugene Robinson, however, had penetrated
too much toward the line of scrimmage, and the speedy Smith raced
past him to catch an 80-yard touchdown pass that tied two others
for second-longest in Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's 28-yard field goal with 2:25 left in the half cut
Denver's lead to 17-6.
</P>
<P>
   Elam missed field goal tries of 37 and 48 yards in the third
quarter, and the Falcons moved the ball better in the period than
all game.
</P>
<P>
   But Chandler threw interceptions on the drives following each
miss.
</P>
<P>
   The first resulted in no Denver points, setting up Elam's second
miss.
</P>
<P>
   But the second, batted up in the air at the line by defensive
tackle Keith Traylor, was returned 58 yards to the Atlanta 20 by
cornerback Darrien Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Griffith scored his second touchdown, giving the Broncos a
24-6 lead on the first play of the fourth quarter.

 PATH TO NEXT CENSUS FAR FROM ROUTINE  (jw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a battle over appropriations last fall, House
Democrats worried that the White House would cut a deal with
congressional Republicans and reduce financing for the 2000 census,
while waiting for a Supreme Court ruling on statistical sampling in
the next head count.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, eager to have the full
appropriations bill passed, was willing to accept the Republican
proposal to finance the 2000 census for six months. But White House
officials promised the House Democrats, who wanted the census
financed for a full year, that unless the court ruled sampling
unconstitutional, it would stand firm on the use of sampling when
the six months expired. The Democrats wanted it in writing.
</P>
<P>
   So on Oct. 15, Clinton sent a letter to House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., saying, ``I am committed to vetoing any
legislation from the 106th Congress that restricts the ability of
the Census Bureau to conduct its plans using modern statistical
methods.''
</P>
<P>
   That Clinton had to issue a written pledge to his own party
indicates the strong emotions surrounding what most of the public
views as routine: the decennial head count. The battle has been
replete with intense partisanship, administration missteps and
gross misstatements by combatants.
</P>
<P>
   And it threatens to make the 2000 census the nation's most
expensive and one that might produce two counts of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Supreme Court added its voice, ruling 5-4 that
federal law forbids the use of sampling to determine the number of
seats each state will have in the House. But the majority opinion
left open the possibility that sampling be used to determine the
distribution of some federal money and draw congressional and state
legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Experts say sampling will increase the
number of blacks and Hispanics who are counted. Republicans, with a
slim House majority, fear that adding more minorities, who tend to
live in traditionally Democratic areas, will put their party at a
disadvantage when congressional districts are redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The raw partisanship surrounding the census was displayed on
Friday when Republican and Democratic members of a board that
monitors preparations for the 2000 census issued separate reports,
in which they agreed on little.
</P>
<P>
   The statistical sampling issue is not new. Following the 1990
census, the Census Bureau used sampling to determine that more than
8 million people, mainly minorities, had not been counted and that
more than 4 million people, mostly whites, had been counted twice.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau wanted to use sampling to adjust the 1990 census, but
the Bush administration rejected the plan, prompting a lawsuit by
several cities.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1992 election, the Clinton administration had to
decide whether to continue to defend the Bush administration's
decision in court.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 White House meeting, Leon Panetta, then Clinton's
chief of staff, and Harold Ickes, then a presidential aide, opposed
a reversal of the Bush decision, fearing that an adjustment of the
1990 count might alienate white voters in states where population
counts might drop. In 1996, the Supreme Court upheld the validity
of the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   As the Census Bureau planned for a 2000 census that would
include sampling, Republicans once again voiced their concerns. In
1997, Clark Bensen, a former staffer at the Republican National
Committee who now owns his own demographics company, sent a
memorandum to his former colleagues at the committee stating that a
census using sampling ``could affect'' 24 House seats, 113 seats in
state senates and 297 seats in state assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   The key words in the memorandum were ``could affect'' because
Bensen said no one could be certain of how election boundaries
would be drawn and who would win races in those districts.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National
Committee, said in a May 1997 memorandum sent to all Republican
state chairmen that the party ``would suffer a negative effect'' in
all of those races.
</P>
<P>
   Bensen said in an interview that ``if I had said two or three
seats, nobody would have cared. It wasn't designed just to get
their attention. But the results sure got their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been joined ever since. And in it, the
administration has made a number of missteps.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 12, Martha Farnsworth Riche, who supported sampling,
resigned as head of the Census Bureau, talking privately to friends
of interference from the Commerce Department, which oversees her
agency.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats and civil rights groups wanted the
administration to name as her replacement Barbara Everitt Bryant, a
pro-sampling Republican who directed the Census Bureau in the Bush
administration. Ms. Bryant's supporters figured that having a
Republican as head of the bureau would deflect charges of political
manipulation of the census.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House and the Commerce Department named Kenneth
Prewitt, a New York academic. A supporter of sampling who insisted
on anonymity said administration officials had quietly passed the
word to pro-sampling groups that Prewitt would never be confirmed.
That was expected to leave the job to James Holmes, the acting
director.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, however, did approve Prewitt, who then voiced his
desire for the bureau to be more free of interference from both
Congress and the administration.  &QL;

HIV ORIGIN IS TRACED TO WEST AFRICAN CHIMP SPECIES

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Virus detectives announced Sunday that they have
traced the elusive origin of the AIDS virus to a western Africa
chimpanzee subspecies that has harbored the precursor for 100,000
years or more.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery upsets previous theories that the human
immunodeficiency virus first evolved in other primate species or
arose in humans. Scientists said it may also yield clues for
designing vaccines or better drugs against HIV-1, as the
predominant AIDS virus is known.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, tracing the virus to chimpanzees, which are still
hunted as food in Africa, provides an apparently conclusive answer
to the riddle of how one of humankind's most devastating epidemics
began. It also heightens the importance of the chimpanzee, whose
numbers are rapidly dwindling toward extinction, in understanding
HIV better.
</P>
<P>
   Beatrice Hahn of the University of Alabama, who reported the
discovery at a national conference, said further studies will
determine the discoveries' significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find in the next five years why chimps get infected and
don't get sick while humans do, these findings will be considered
very important,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new results suggest that the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic
is a region of coastal West Africa in the nations of Cameroon and
Gabon. Only in this small area do humans harbor all three main
groups of HIV-1, called M, N, and O, along with all 10 subtypes of
the predominant virus, group M.
</P>
<P>
   This region corresponds to the historic range of Pan troglodytes
troglodytes, the chimp subspecies now shown through gene analysis
to have given rise to HIV's ancestor before the ape subspecies
diverged from others 100,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real nice piece of detective work,'' said Ronald S.
DesRosiers, a Harvard University expert on HIV and its primate
cousin, the simian immunodeficiency virus. ``It's like
understanding where the stars came from, or the origins of man.
Here we have a clear picture of where this horrible disease came
from, and there's something satisfying about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn and her colleagues have shown that the ancestral virus's
jump from chimps to humans occurred at least three different times,
giving rise to the three distinct subtypes of HIV-1 known today.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the likelihood that another chimp-to-human
transmission could launch another epidemic, scientists said at the
Sixth Conference on Retroviruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the virus has been in chimps for a long time and humans
have been hunting and eating the animals for a long time,
transmission has been taking place for a long time,'' said Feng Gao
of the University of Alabama team.
</P>
<P>
   If a chimp virus strain does jump to humans again, it would
probably occur the same way it did before, Gao said: through
hunting and slaughtering of chimpanzees, a practice that is still
big business in many parts of Africa despite efforts of
conservationists to preserve the species.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost certain now, the Alabama scientists said, that the
chimp virus crossed the species barrier to humans many thousands of
years ago, but human-to-human transmission occurred only
sporadically and undetected until the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The human HIV-1 epidemic, Gao said, was sparked ``after World
War II, with changes in transportation, urbanization, behaviors
such as prostitution, and medical practice,'' such as vaccination
with unsterilized needles.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest known case of AIDS, reported at this conference a
year ago, was a Bantu man who died in what was then Leopoldville in
the Belgian Congo in 1959. Other cases surely were occurring for
more than a decade before then, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn's group was set on its successful search by the recent
discovery of a new strain of the chimpanzee retrovirus, only the
third discovered, in a captive animal named Marilyn who resided in
a New Mexico primate colony. Marilyn died in 1985, at the age of
26, of causes not related to her retroviral infection. Hahn only
recently obtained her tissue for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   As far as anyone knows, chimps do not suffer any disease from
SIV. Hahn thinks this is because the chimp subspecies and the
retrovirus have adapted to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have screened about 430 chimps for evidence of SIV
infection and have found only six infected animals so far. Hahn's
group examined four of these, and determined that three, from the
troglodyte subspecies, were clearly related to the three HIV-1
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth SIV strain, isolated from a different subspecies, Pan
troglodyte schweinfurthii, is not a precursor to the human virus.
That chimp subspecies inhabits East Africa, which the evidence now
shows could not be the birthplace of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said studies are now needed on
wild chimpanzees ``to find out why these animals don't get sick,
information that may help us better protect humans from developing
AIDS.''

THOUSANDS FLEE PARAMILITARY VIOLENCE IN EAST TIMOR
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ A sharp surge in paramilitary violence in the
troubled province of East Timor in recent weeks has caused
thousands of people to flee their homes in terror, aid workers said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 displaced people have gathered in the coastal town
of Suai, 60 miles southeast of Dili, while another 1,000 have
sought sanctuary in Dili, the provincial capital, aid workers said.
They blamed the violence on groups armed by Indonesian security
forces to oppose separatists on East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   And they said they feared that the refugee situation could
become a public-health and safety emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Carrascalao, leader of the Reconciliation and Unity
Movement for East Timor, a nonpolitical aid group, contended that
the violence was promoted by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always said there will be bloodshed and another civil
war if they leave,'' he said. ``They just want to shock people to
force them to accept integration.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, after Portugal withdrew as
the colonial power, and has faced a strong resistance movement. The
United Nations has never recognized its authority there.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government has contended in recent months that it
was withdrawing its troops, and in recent weeks it has for the
first time begun to talk about offering some measure of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Carrascalao, a former member of the regional parliament, is the
brother of a former East Timor governor, Mario Carrascalao, and a
widely respected community figure.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Carrascalao accused Indonesian security forces of
continuing to support a coalition of paramilitary forces opposed to
independence, citing reports from people he said were reliable that
in recent weeks the army had distributed more than 2,000 assault
rifles in Dili and local villages.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that the paramilitary groups had 10,000 members and
were growing and that they were the main reason for the
deteriorating security situation in East Timor during the last two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a surprise reversal of its previous policy,
Indonesia offered the possibility of independence. Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas ruled out the possibility of a referendum on
independence, though.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if East Timor rejected an offer of autonomy
currently under negotiation, the government could ask the
Parliament to be formed after national elections scheduled for June
7 to ``release'' East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   In another conciliatory gesture, Indonesian authorities
announced recently that the jailed East Timorese resistance leader,
Xanana Gusmao, serving a 20-year term for inciting rebellion, would
be released into a form of house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In previous discussions with Portugal, Indonesia has been
willing only to propose giving East Timor partial control of its
affairs in return for international recognition of its sovereignty
over the province.
</P>
<P>
   In U.N.-brokered talks in New York, Portugal has insisted that
any autonomy agreement must be supported by the people of East
Timor _ a proposal supported by the United States, Australia and
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the recent attacks by paramilitaries, more than
200 refugees, mostly men from remote rural areas, are staying at
Carrascalao's modest Dili home, he said. Some have been sleeping on
mats under plastic tarpaulins and others are crammed into a small
wing attached to the main bungalow.
</P>
<P>
   Another 200 people are living in unsanitary conditions at a
makeshift site known as Motaulong Camp a few miles outside Dili.
Others are being accommodated by local charity organizations or
staying with relatives, Carrascalao said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men said they fled their homes after been detained
and tortured by the military on suspicion of supporting the
outlawed rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolau Nunes, 24, said he was arrested in November and badly
beaten by the Indonesian military. Earlier this month, fearing for
his life, he fled to Dili. He said local police officials detained
his wife last week and tortured her by suspending her by her waist
from a ceiling beam during an interrogation session to try to find
out his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the refugees here _ we've been accused of being with
the guerrillas _ hiding them in our houses,'' he said. ``But we
don't know anything.''

 &HT;    Falcons' fire smothered by intimidation, mistakes
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Wake up, the dream is over. It didn't come out the way
you wanted it. You didn't win the lottery. Cinderella's carriage
turned into a pumpkin. Aladdin's lamp fizzled out. But settle back,
let your mind run free and think of the good times, how the Falcons
got to the Super Bowl, not how they lost it.
</P>
<P>
   There were 74,803 witnesses, so there's no saying it's just a
rumor. Nothing taken out of context. It was a pretty thorough job
by the Denver Broncos, but the Falcons had a serious hand in their
own undoing. Interceptions, a pass rush that took the night off and
a pass defense that leaked like a rusty bucket, an offense that got
several good views of the end zone, but couldn't cross the line,
and there you have the ingredients guaranteed for defeat. Morten
Andersen even missed a field goal, and that's headline news.
</P>
<P>
   It's always an ill omen when your team drives downfield with the
muscular thrust of the Prussian army, but then has to settle for a
field goal. Andersen kicked that one, the Falcons led, 3-0, and
they wouldn't lead again. Frustration was stamped all over every
other Falcon drive as long as they had a chance to bail it out.
Once a 304-pound defensive tackle named Keith Traylor, from Central
State _ that's a college, not the prison _ deflected a Chandler
pass that was intercepted by Darrien Gordon and set up the 24th
Broncos points late in the third quarter, it was done. Over.
</P>
<P>
   There was additional danger in that play, for Chandler made the
tackle in the open field, and quarterbacks don't get paid to make
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons did muster enough juice to score late in the fourth
quarter, after all the hay was in Denver's barn. The Falcons took
the kickoff after Denver's last touchdown and drove 76 yards for a
touchdown, a Chandler to Mathis pass, but that only cut the
bitterness of the taste. The final score would be, 34-19. (Note to
desk: Check that at end.)
</P>
<P>
   The first half was not a Falcons' half. They were the tourists
in town from Iowa, looking intimidated at times. This was strange
ground for them, playing the old hands from Denver, against an old
wagonmaster named Elway. For some reason or another, playing
selection made the Falcons look like they were playing not to be
embarrassed. Until nearly half the second quarter was gone, Chris
Chandler had thrown only three passes.
</P>
<P>
   Then the heavens opened up. Chandler went to the air three
times, to Terance Mathis and Jamal Anderson and delivered the ball
to the Denver 16. Once again, to settle for a field goal, but this
time the surest shot in the Falcons arsenal misfired. Morten
Andersen misfired.
</P>
<P>
   That was bad enough, but what happened next was enough to rip
out their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   First down, Elway found the annoying Rod Smith open, hit him
and, no double entendre here, blown coverage by Eugene Robinson
left the field as open as a prairie. Touchdown: 17-3.
</P>
<P>
   This was folding time, in the manner of the old Falcons. A dying
basketball coach once said, ``Never give up. Never, never give
up.'' That has been the character of the '98-'99 Falcons, and here
they came again, again to settle for a field goal and a halftime
score of 17-6.
</P>
<P>
   The old warhorse Elway was decisioning the younger warhorse
Chandler. Terrell Davis, slow to start, was decisioning Jamal
Anderson. Bronco defense was decisioning Falcon defense. Now, were
these the second-half Falcons Atlanta had come to know and love
this season? Who never, never knew how to give up? Or did they have
something left in their tank?
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, they didn't. Interceptions killed them. The
old second-half fire wasn't there, and when there was a chance to
make a statement, they self-destructed. I would say that if it were
raining horses, Denver would catch four with Secretariat attached.
That isn't to say they were lucky, but they were not without a
touch of fate here and there.

 &HT;    More options, skillful offense spur Denver to victory
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - The defensive line was barely a factor. The linebackers'
names went uncalled all night. The secondary was chasing shadows
throughout on what became another bad night for Eugene Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   An argument could be made that Atlanta's defense did enough to
keep the Falcons in the game for a while Sunday night. The first
two times Chris Chandler threw interceptions, the defense kept
Denver off the board. At one point, the Broncos converted only one
field goal from seven drives that penetrated Atlanta's 50.
</P>
<P>
   But in a final analysis, Denver exploited the Falcons where they
might. John Elway abused Jessie Tuggle when the linebacker was
stuck in pass coverage. Life for safeties Robinson and William
White was hardly better, even though tight end Shannon Sharpe sat
out the final three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Against the highest scoring offense in NFL history two weeks
ago, Atlanta had continually succeeded in thwarting the Minnesota
Vikings when it had to. But not against this team. The Broncos had
a firmer grasp of what would work schematically and Elway looked
nothing like Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the second-worst defensive effort in the
franchise's speckled playoff history. The only team to score more
against Atlanta in a postseason game was the 1995 Green Bay
Packers, who went for 37.
</P>
<P>
   A unit that prided itself on its ability to create turnovers
took away just one this night, that off a pass that struck Sharpe
on both hands. When Atlanta's only chance was to try to hold Denver
down in the forth quarter, the Broncos scored 17 points in three
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it was close, it was a statistical romp. By the half,
the Falcons had yielded nine plays covering 10 yards or more and
two of 40 yards or more. The Broncos began play intent on confusing
Atlanta with its myriad offensive options _ Denver showed five
different sets in the first seven plays _ and gradually, the
differentiation affected its sought results.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bronco touchdowns can be linked to failures by free safety
Robinson, whose weekend only got worse as the day wore on. Robinson
was covering Sharpe on a second-and-11 on the Falcons 15, when John
Elway delivered a pass on a short crossing root, Robinson playing
the ball and missing both the pass and Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tight end was brought down by Ray Buchanan at the 1
(when Sharpe sustained his knee injury), Denver took the lead a
play later on Howard Griffith's plunge.
</P>
<P>
   After Ronnie Bradford's interception produced no points near the
end of the first quarter, Elway waited three possesions before
going at Robinson again. With Elway rolling to the right on a
bootleg following Atlanta's punt, Robinson could not keep step with
wide receiver Rod Smith, who simply ran past him en route to a
80-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   By the intermission, an Atlanta defensive unit that gave up an
average 9.8 yards in the first half had given up 17. A secondary
that had been giving up 221 passing yards a game was torched for
190.

SHAQ WANTS RODMAN TO BE A LAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal worked out the kinks in his sore
left knee Sunday, but after a 2{-hour practice session, one
wondered if he had developed a kink in his brain. O'Neal, with a
straight face, announced he wants Dennis Rodman. In a Lakers
uniform. Now.
</P>
<P>
   This is a bombshell of Super Bowl proportions, considering
O'Neal's overt disdain for the eccentric former Bull. Apparently
he's willing to overlook Rodman's antics in exchange for his
13-rebounds-per-game career average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cool, but I'd still like to get that thuggish forward.
There's one thuggish forward out there, and hopefully we can pull
some strings to get him,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   ``You heard what I said. You know me, and I know you, and I know
you'll write what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   So there it is.
</P>
<P>
   And a curious change of heart, too. As recently as two weeks
ago, when asked about Rodman's reported deal with New York, O'Neal
said flatly, ``I don't care about no cross-dressers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of that comment Sunday, O'Neal said: ``I changed my
mind. I can admit when I'm _ .'' He didn't finish the thought.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Lakers' obvious need for a rebounding power forward,
management has been cool to the idea of signing Rodman. The
organization typically recruits better citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they're doing, but if we had a rebounder
like that, we'd be OK,'' O'Neal said. ``You know, our (power
forwards) are playing good, Elden is playing good, but we still
need that thuggish (forward). I need me a thug in my life. There's
one or two guys like that, partying at the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Rodman was last spotted, holding an all-night
bash and lobbying the Orlando Magic for a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could pull some strings and get him,'' O'Neal said,
``that would be nice for us.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Rodman have a mutual interest _ a championship _ but
little else in common. In October, Rodman said of O'Neal: ``I like
Shaq as a competitor. But as far as his determination, it's kind
of, `I don't know.' ''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's responded by calling Rodman ``a bum'' but didn't stop
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother told me never to talk about female dogs. (That) is
what I want to say, but I can't say the word,'' O'Neal said. ``I'll
knock Rodman's (expletive) out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: O'Neal, withheld from Saturday's exhibition game
because of tendinitis in his left knee, participated fully in
Sunday's practice. ``He played well,'' coach Del Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said the tendinitis was not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have sucked it up and played (Saturday), but Del was
gracious enough to give me time off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Revelations: A pair of exhibition games against the Clippers
provided a pair of meaningless wins but not much insight into the
Lakers' progress, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing we didn't already know, to tell you the truth,'' he
said but then reconsidered. ``I will say one thing. . . . We have
found that Derek Harper and Travis Knight are going to be awfully
nice additions to our mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper, signed as a free agent to play backup point guard, had
10 assists, seven steals and 15 points over the two games. Knight,
a former Laker reacquired in a trade with Boston, had 22 rebounds
and 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   No time to rest: Despite playing back-to-back games, the Lakers
practiced Sunday, figuring they need all the work they can get
before opening the season Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers face seven 1998 playoff teams among their first 10
opponents, beginning with Houston, Utah and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be ready from the very beginning,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Players admitted they started slowly Sunday but practiced hard
for most of the morning before heading home to watch the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have enjoyed a day off,'' Harper said, ``but I
understand (Harris') thinking.''

JURY HANDED FREE-SPEECH ISSUE IN CASE OF ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle physician Suzanne Poppema's name appeared on
the list of ``baby butchers'' the week after Dr. Barnett Slepian
was shot to death in the kitchen of his New York home.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after his death, a line was drawn through his name on the
list, which is in a Web site known as the ``Nuremberg Files.'' The
line signaled that Slepian was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that was chilling,'' said Poppema, who performs abortions
at Aurora Medical Services here and has never made any secret of
it. She has been a spokeswoman for women's reproductive rights and
written a book called ``Why I'm an Abortion Doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site features images of dripping blood and lists of
judges, doctors and nurses, as well as politicians from Bill
Clinton to Bob Dole whose views have angered anti-abortion
activists. The lists include three Washington state physicians, a
nurse and U.S. District Court Judges Barbara Rothstein and Thomas
Zilly, both based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wake of Dr. Slepian's murder,'' Poppema said, ``it
looks more like a hit list.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Web site and other anti-abortion material constitute
a hit list or protected free speech is the question a federal court
jury in Portland, Ore., must answer. The jury will begin its fourth
day of deliberations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's verdict may have broad ramifications about the nature
of protest and what can appear on fliers, signs and even the World
Wide Web. The case appears ultimately destined to be heard by the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has drastic implications for the First Amendment,'' said
David Hudson, a research attorney at the First Amendment Center at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. ``If the jury comes back
with a huge damage award, it would have a chilling effect on
anti-abortion speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are militant anti-abortion groups, including
Advocates for Life Ministries of Portland, and dozens of activists
from across the nation who regularly are involved in protests. A
Portland chapter of Planned Parenthood and four doctors, including
two from Portland, brought the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Citing federal racketeering laws meant to crack down on the mob,
and new statutes to protect abortion clinics, the lawsuit seeks
damages of as much as $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The suit focuses on a Web site, a ``deadly dozen'' list of names
and addresses of doctors accused of crimes against humanity and a
``wanted'' poster that carried the photograph as well as home and
work addresses of a St. Louis physician.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by new laws passed by Congress, the suit is part of a
growing number of actions in civil court taken against
anti-abortion activists.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a federal jury in Chicago decided that activists used
violence or threats of violence to keep women from having
abortions. And in Florida, the owner of an abortion clinic this
month sued protesters whose tactics included copying the license
plate numbers of clinic employees, then using on-line services to
trace them.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland plaintiffs say the Web site, poster and fliers are
meant to intimidate and threaten. Other doctors who had their names
on wanted posters ended up murdered, the plaintiffs say. The St.
Louis physician wore a bullet-proof vest when he testified in
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are unlawful tactics,'' plaintiff's attorney Maria Vullo
told jurors in closing arguments last week. ``These tactics must
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case about words and only words,'' defense attorney
Chris Ferrara countered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the First Amendment, even outrageous speech must be
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Web site nor the fliers nor the wanted poster call
on people to harm, much less murder. The Nuremberg Files site, for
example, contends that the information is being gathered so that
there will be evidence for prosecutors if abortion is outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less free speech than it's an incitement. They
(defendants) have stated they don't think it's wrong to shoot an
abortion provider,'' said Poppema, who is not a party to the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would we do if wanted posters were made up of prominent
African-American people or prominent Jewish people or prominent gay
people? What would we do if a hate group did that?
</P>
<P>
   ``We would say, `You can't do that.' You can't single out a
person to die because you don't like a person's color or religion.
You can't single out a person to die because of the work they do,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   To defendants, talk like that is nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one saying, `You should go shoot these guys,' ''
said Michael Bray, a Maryland minister and anti-abortion activist.
``None of the defendants has any contracts on these people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like it or not, it's free speech and legitimate speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Bray, like Poppema, makes no secret of who he is and what he
does. In the 1980s, he spent 46 months in prison for the arson
attacks and bombings of seven clinics. He, too, wrote a book. ``A
Time to Kill'' defends anti-abortionists who committed murders and
arson.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion, he said in an interview, ``is murdering other people.
If someone stops that, it's justifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the defendants in Portland don't seem to blanch much at
violence in the anti-abortion movement and the fear it has created.
``If I was an abortionist, I would be afraid,'' a defendant
testified.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the Portland jury isn't what these activists
thought, but what they meant by the lists and comments on the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has long held that the First Amendment doesn't
protect real threats. But court rulings cited in the Portland case
come from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 10 years, the appeals court has had what lawyers
call a ``reasonable person'' standard. That means that if a
reasonable person concludes that what was said or written was a
threat, then it is a threat.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the 9th Circuit has applied that standard in cases
where there was expressly threatening language, said Michael Simon,
a Portland attorney who filed a brief in the case for the American
Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on the 9th Circuit's
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU urged the judge in the Portland case to adopt a tougher
standard, incorporating not only what a reasonable person would
think but also the intent of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The judge dismissed that argument, deciding to use the
reasonable person standard. He also told the jury that the
defendants' intentions aren't the standard, and, in fact, can be
considered threatening even if they weren't meant as threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the standard is not changed on appeal,'' said David
Fidanque, executive director of the ACLU, ``political activists on
controversial issues are not going to know what they can and can't
say to avoid being sued for hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they can or can't say won't be determined by what they
intend their words to say but by what people who heard them think
they mean.''
</P>
<P>
   The Portland lawsuit may not deter anti-abortion activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had eight (court) cases against me, and I go right on,''
said Joseph Scheidler, executive director of the Pro-Life Action
League in an interview after returning from a protest at a
Chicago-area clinic. ``These people (the Portland defendants) are
going to go right on. What the juries don't understand is that this
is a spiritual battle for us. Killing babies isn't nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheidler was one of the defendants in the Chicago suit in which
the jury decided that activists conspired to keep women from having
abortions. Ten months after that decision, the judge in the case
has yet to act on the jury's recommendation of $85,000 in damages
or whether he should issue an injunction against the activists.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Scheidler has become something of a celebrity
in anti-abortion circles. His group has more members and more
money, which has allowed it to launch an $85,000 billboard campaign
in Chicago and Washington, D.C., and buy a $40,000 ultrasound
machine, which is used outside clinics to try to show pregnant
women their fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's a feather in my cap to spend seven weeks in
federal court being called a racketeer,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: A VISIONARY TOWN IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Feb. 1:
</P>
<P>
   With China's economic growth now faltering, Communist Party
leaders are worried that the millions of remaining rural and urban
poor could become a growing source of political unrest. In recent
months, there have been scattered, and occasionally violent,
protests by workers and farmers angered by unpaid wages, onerous
taxes and official corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reflexively responding with repression, the
government ought to follow the example of a brave township that has
turned to democracy to give citizens a greater sense of control
over their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Asian markets, bankruptcies of Chinese
investment companies and the problems of state-owned industries
have drastically slowed China's pace of urban job creation. That
has all but exhausted the capacity of cities to absorb unemployed
and impoverished rural residents who have poured by the millions
into urban areas over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Managing the hundreds of millions of Chinese who have not yet
seen the benefits of the economic growth may be the biggest
challenge facing the party leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, some party leaders in Sichuan province came up
with an enlightened and creative response to this challenge,
encouraging wider local democracy as a healthy outlet for popular
discontent.
</P>
<P>
   They organized China's first democratic elections for township
leader, in the Sichuan township of Buyun. This is a position with
important decision-making responsibilities. Previously, only
politically insignificant village offices had been put to
competitive votes.
</P>
<P>
   Voters chose among three candidates by secret ballot after
listening to 13 public debates. As it turned out, the candidate
backed by the Communist Party was elected. But even supporters of
his defeated opponents are pleased, noting that the government now
has more democratic legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospects for future township elections are unclear. Top
leaders in Beijing are opposed to such experimentation, though
perhaps not unanimously so. The Legal Daily, an important national
party newspaper, responded to the events in Buyun with an editorial
that praised the spirit of local democracy but noted that township
elections overstepped current Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
   China's most important leader, President Jiang Zemin, has
meanwhile been orchestrating the arrest of prominent democratic
intellectuals and their sentencing to long prison terms.
Suppressing dissent and a desire for greater democracy is a
tyrant's answer to public discontent. But it is not a viable
long-term policy in a nation with rising economic and political
expectations and increasing disparities in wealth.

LAST WORD IN RIVALRY BELONGS TO DENVER 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The focus of attention before Sunday's Super Bowl, in
which the Denver Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons by 34-19, was
the so-called war of words between Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe
and Falcons defensive back Ray Buchanan. Sharpe predicted a Denver
victory; Buchanan predicted an Atlanta victory. Maybe the Super
Bowl's atmosphere tempted them to act out of character.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, for all the attention he received, is a quiet
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, Ray is not a trash-talker,'' said his
teammate, Tony Martin, who was amused at the way Buchanan had been
cast. ``I don't believe he'll talk trash on the field unless you
distract him or talk trash to him. At practice, he's one of the
greatest guys out there. If he makes a good play on you, he'll help
you up. He's not a trash-talker.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were deeper rivalries _ and friendships, even if the
rivalries overshadowed the friendships.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment these teams knew they would face each other in
Super Bowl XXXIII, a slow, persistent flame began to burn in public
because of the rivalry between the head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Those men became the focal point of the discussion after Falcons
Coach Dan Reeves stunned a lot of people by admitting that, yes, he
had been hurt by his dismissal in Denver after the 1992 season,
and, yes, he had fired Mike Shanahan as his assistant after the
1991 season because he thought he had tried to undermine him,
particularly in his relationship with Broncos quarterback John
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   With Shanahan now the head coach of the Broncos and Elway still
the quarterback, that rivalry has deep roots. Although the
Reeves-Shanahan-Elway triangle seemed ground up and exhausted by
the end of last week, to the three people involved, the scar was as
fresh at game time as if it had just been inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it is so personal is that Dan Reeves was the coach
of the Broncos for so long, some of the guys are still on this
team,'' said Rod Smith, the fourth-year wide receiver who joined
the Broncos after Reeves had left. ``Our head coach was on Reeves'
staff, so it is personal, because you have ties.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ties go beyond Reeves-Shanahan. Some of Smith's closest
friends play for Atlanta. For one, Ronnie Bradford, the Falcons'
sixth-year defensive back who came up with an interception late in
the first quarter. Bradford spent three seasons with the Broncos,
he and Smith were teammates in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a personal friend; when he comes to Denver, he stays in
my house,'' Smith said. ``Now here I am playing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith wasn't very nice to his friend. His 41-yard reception set
up Denver's first touchdown and his 80-yard touchdown on a
second-quarter pass play gave the Broncos a 17-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Atlanta defeated Minnesota in the National Football
Conference championship game, Smith called Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulated him and I told him, `I'm going to cut you, on
Sunday,''' Smith said. `` `I'm going to cut you, I'm going to knock
you down, I'm going to push you. I'm going to do everything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith admitted he was just having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of respect for each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Smith received a call from Atlanta's Randy Fuller,
a fifth-year cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Fuller played with me my first year in the league,''
Smith said of the player who was with the Broncos in training camp
in 1995 when Smith was a rookie. ``I answered my phone and someone
was screaming: `We're going to kill ya'll in the Super Bowl.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said who the heck is this? He said `It's Fuller.' I just
laughed because he's one of my best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it is personal in that respect because you know they're
your friends and they're going to be your friends after the game,
regardless of who wins or loses. I just don't want them to have
that feeling of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for all the criticism aimed at professional athletes,
among younger players there seems to be a sense of fraternity and,
oddly enough, history, even though that doesn't get the kind of
attention that trash-talking does.
</P>
<P>
   If their interaction here was any indication, the NFL's younger
players seem closer. Many have played with and against each other
since high school. They've heard the veterans talk about the nasty
1987 strike and have developed an appreciation of what the game has
become. More players have nurtured a keener appreciation for and
awareness of the larger industry surrounding the game.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Smith, the Falcons' all-pro defensive end, said the
competition is better on the field and the younger players are
beginning to pay attention off the field as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every guy you hear about blowing his money and not
knowing, not understanding or not caring about the strike, 99
percent of the guys respect what people before us have done,''
Smith said. ``We talk about it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that earlier this year he called Reggie White, the
Packers' former defensive end, to thank him for what he had done
for defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie catches a lot of flak for a lot of things he says but
he has done more for defensive linemen that anybody ever,'' Smith
said. ``He has taken defensive linemen from just being role players
to being _ next to quarterbacks _ the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have guys going out there for one or two years, become
starters and if you get 10 sacks in a season you'll get $5 million
or $6 million. That's because of guys like Reggie White, laying it
on the line, speaking up for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL seems to be becoming more and more like an extended
family, with factions, differences, allegiances and friendships.
Players move around, coaches move around. This year it happened
that one coach was facing his old team, the other facing his old
boss. For Reeves and Shanahan, Sharpe and Buchanan, Smith and
Fuller, this Super Bowl wasn't business; it was personal. &QL;

SENATORS STEP UP PUSH FOR SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators intensified their quest Sunday for a
bipartisan sanction of President Clinton, amid fresh controversy in
the impeachment drama over a surprise finding by the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, that Clinton could face criminal charges
before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   As Monica S. Lewinsky waited to be questioned under oath Monday
for the first time in Clinton's trial, two Maine Republicans who
are pushing a plan to sanction the president short of removing him
from office achieved a possible breakthrough with a partial
endorsement from a key moderate Democrat, Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The development unfolded as senators in both parties rebuked
Starr for the timing of his decision that he has the constitutional
authority to prosecute Clinton in criminal court while the
president is still in office. Starr's finding was first reported
Sunday by The New York Times, citing unidentified Starr aides.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure was made in the final weeks of the trial, amid
broad consensus that the Senate lacks the two-thirds majority, or
67 votes, needed to convict Clinton of either article of
impeachment: lying under oath to a federal grand jury, or
obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was extremely unfortunate, and it was inappropriate
to come out while the Senate is concluding the president's trial,''
said Senator Susan M. Collins, who is promoting the alternative
sanction plan with her Republican colleague from Maine, Senator
Olympia J. Snowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly a distraction, and it's unfortunate,'' Snowe
said of the Starr disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats expressed much harsher criticism. Starr has
reportedly concluded that the Supreme Court's 1997 decision to
permit Paula Corbin Jones to pursue her sexual harassment suit
againt Clinton while he was in office left open the door for
possible criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication, however, of whether Starr anticipates
seeking a criminal indictment against Clinton before he is
scheduled to leave office in January 2001 or any time at all.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who sends his budget for the 2000 fiscal year to
Congress Monday, is scheduled to attend a luncheon fund-raiser at
the Park Plaza Hotel in Boston Tuesday, followed by a visit to the
Jackson Mann Elementary School in Allston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Starr is once again running amok,'' said Senator Charles
E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, who was among more than a dozen
senators appearing on various Sunday talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to sound like Fugitive II,'' said Senator
Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat. ``There's just no end to
what this man is willing to do to pursue the president.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, James Kennedy, told reporters:
``Besides reinforcing his own stereotype as an out-of-control
prosecutor, Ken Starr is tampering with the Senate trial. Somebody
ought to tell him he's not the 101st senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, leaving his Virginia home Sunday morning, declined to
discuss the issue with reporters. ``I don't think I should be
commenting, particularly at this time,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial enters a new phase Monday with Lewinsky's
private deposition in a Washington hotel room, conducted by White
House lawyers and one of the 13 House Republicans who are arguing
in the Senate for Clinton's removal from office: Representative Ed
Bryant of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   With the House case so shaky that the Senate may lack even a
simple majority to support either impeachment charge, the Lewinsky
deposition represents one of the last chances for the House team to
reverse the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Depositions will be taken from Clinton's friend Vernon E. Jordan
Jr. Tuesday, and a White House senior adviser, Sidney Blumenthal,
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers hope the private testimony will persuade
senators to call the witnesses to be questioned on the Senate floor
or to permit videotaped recordings of the depositions to be shown
in a public session of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   If the House team prevails in calling witnesses, said one of the
managers, Representative James F. Rogan of California, the trial
could be extended ``a few days'' beyond a tentative deadline of
Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a bombshell disclosure, however, the House case is
effectively doomed, according to several senators in both parties.
They said the charge that Clinton committed perjury before a
federal grand jury especially lacks strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't polled anybody, but I hear a lot of people say that
is the weakest'' of the two charges, said Senator Richard C.
Shelby, an Alabama Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many of his GOP colleagues would vote to convict
Clinton of perjury, Shelby said, ``Not as many as a lot of people
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins agreed. ``A number of senators believe that the
president lied under oath but that his wrongdoing in that area does
not constitute perjury because of the legal definition of
perjury,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, said he knew of ``12
or so'' Republicans who would vote against both impeachment
charges.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, public opinion polls released Sunday by Newsweek
and the Los Angeles Times each showed 65 percent opposition to
convicting Clinton and ending his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than see Clinton acquitted without an alternative
sanction, Collins and Snowe are promoting a plan to pass a
``finding of fact'' that Clinton lied under oath and impeded
justice but should not lose his office for the wrongdoing. The
``finding of fact'' vote would be taken before a final roll call on
the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Republicans and many Democrats have criticized the
plan, Lieberman gave Collins and Snowe hope Sunday by offering his
preliminary support. Lieberman, a harsh critic of Clinton's
morality, is highly influential among moderate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I for one would be hard-pressed to vote against it,'' said
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the search for an alternative, conservative Republicans
continued to exert heavy pressure on GOP senators to pursue the
case for Clinton's conviction and removal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gary Bauer, a conservative activist who announced Sunday
his intention to seek the Republican nomination for president,
warned Republican senators that they will encourage primary
challenges if they vote to acquit.

EDITORIAL: BALANCING RIGHTS IN ADOPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Feb. 1:
</P>
<P>
   In November, Oregon's voters approved Measure 58, giving adopted
individuals who are 21 or older the right to their original birth
certificates, which reveal the names of birth parents. A lawsuit
has been filed by seven birth mothers who claim the new law
unconstitutionally violates their privacy and breaks promises of
confidentiality made to them by adoption agencies at the time they
relinquished their children.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has pitted those women against adopted individuals
who believe policies of secrecy have denied them equal protection
under law and deprived them of the right to know the facts of their
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments on both sides are emotionally compelling, but a
measure that applies retroactively to adoptions decades old is
unfair to those who relied on the previous rules. It may also cause
new birth mothers and prospective adoptive parents to question
whether current policies will be altered without their consent in
the future, and perhaps make them less willing to go forward with
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   An Oregon judge has issued a preliminary injunction on the
release of the birth records until the legal issues are resolved.
Only two other states, Alaska and Kansas, allow similar open access
to birth records.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. Many states closed adoption records
around the middle of the century to protect families from the
stigma that was then associated with adoption. In Oregon, all birth
records were open until 1957, when the state changed the law.
Roughly half of all adult adoptees in Oregon today were born under
the open-record system.
</P>
<P>
   That change to confidentiality, perhaps unwise in retrospect,
has meant that for more than 40 years birth mothers in Oregon had
reason to believe that the records would remain sealed, except by
order of a court. Measure 58 fails to consider the rights of
mothers who chose adoption under that policy. If the measure is
upheld, the state should set up some way to notify birth mothers
that an adult child has sought the birth record.
</P>
<P>
   Measure 58 may make good sense when applied to new adoptions,
however. Cultural values now lean toward openness, away from the
kind of secrecy that can engender shame and prevent adoptees and
their own children from getting important medical histories. New
birth mothers will now be on notice that their biological children
may get their records after 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Oregon and other states can help adoptees by
improving voluntary adoption registries that help adoptees and
birth parents, with mutual consent, find each other. In an arena so
freighted with emotional complexity, fair notice and consent are
crucial.

EDITORIAL: TRANSPLANT SHORTAGES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Feb. 1
</P>
<P>
   Recent advances in organ transplantation plus the aging of the
population have led to a twelvefold rise in demand for donated
organs since 1994, and growing worries about the gap between supply
and demand. In New York at the moment, that gap is excruciatingly
wide.
</P>
<P>
   The wait for a donated organ in the New York region tends to be
longer than in other parts of the country, owing to the large
number of people with transmittable diseases like AIDS that
disqualify them from donating and the present system of organ
matching, in which people needing organs must draw them primarily
from their own region.
</P>
<P>
   But the shortage is now getting worse due to an unexplained drop
in organ donations. By mid-January last year, there had been 22
donors. For the same period this year, there have been only nine.
</P>
<P>
   A controversial proposal supported by Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala would replace the present system of
regional organ matching with a national system in which those who
are most needy get priority.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would correct the wide disparities in waiting times
among different states and regions, but would do nothing to
ameliorate the national shortage of organs. That problem could be
eased if more Americans said yes to becoming an organ donor, and if
medical professionals were better trained in how to approach
grieving families for consent to remove organs.

SURPRISING THREE PROPEL THE BRONCOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Mo.)  (jw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On the most high-powered offense in the American
Conference, the one that scored 501 points and has Pro Bowl players
tripping over one another, the Denver Broncos won the Super Bowl on
Sunday behind lesser-known players.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that fullback Howard Griffith _ who had carried a total
of four times all season _ scored a pair of touchdowns, as the
2,000-yard man, Terrell Davis, was used as a decoy both times. And
that Rod Smith, the other wide receiver in the Ed McCaffrey-led
corps, would generate an 80-yard touchdown on a pass from John
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   How about Byron Chamberlain, who had snared three passes all
year at tight end? He had three in the first half on Sunday,
playing for the injured Shannon Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey didn't catch a pass until the second half, while
Sharpe twisted his left knee after his second catch and didn't play
after the first quarter. It was almost as if Broncos coach Mike
Shanahan had waited all season, waited until the 19th game, to
spring surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, for example, had not run the ball since the Broncos
lost to the Giants five games ago. Indeed, he fancies himself more
at home with the offensive line. His job, quite simply, has been to
block for Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, meanwhile, had a 13-game stretch this season in
which he didn't catch a pass. The Wayne State product is barely
known outside of his team because Sharpe is the vocal, gifted,
controversial starter. Yet Chamberlain had his only two-reception
game of the season against the Jets in the conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, the Jets held Sharpe to only two receptions, and
the Broncos went to Chamberlain. Sunday night, Chamberlain capped
his Super Bowl by snaring the onside kick after Atlanta scored late
in the fourth quarter to cut its deficit to 34-19.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the best known of the surprising three, had 86 catches
for 1,222 yards during the season. It was McCaffrey, though, who
was selected to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who went to Missouri Southern, wasn't drafted in 1994
despite being one of the most prolific receivers in college. He
wound up on the Broncos' practice squad, and gradually worked his
way into the lineup.  &QL;

A MOTIVATED RUTGERS FORWARD IS PERFECT ON A 31-POINT DAY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RON DICKER  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Instead of treading cautiously around Rob
Hodgson, Rutgers' slumping forward, the team went the opposite
route during practice last week. Coach Kevin Bannon called him
``Robo Forward'' _ which he says irritates Hodgson _ and performed
``Robo Forward'' commercials. Swingman Jeff Greer said he told
Hodgson, `'If you keep playing like that, we won't win one more
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson said his teammates' ribbing loosened him up. He wore his
usual stoic expression throughout the Scarlet Knights' 87-61
victory over West Virginia on Sunday, but he must have been
grinning inside.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson made all 11 of his shots, including six 3-pointers, and
sank all three of his free throws to score a career-high 31 points,
the most by a Rutgers player in a Big East game. He tied conference
records and broke school records for field-goal percentage and
3-point percentage.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same player who had stumbled through single-digit
scoring performances in four of his last five games, culminating in
a 6-point, 25 percent shooting night against Lafayette of the
Patriot League last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson said he did not experience a special feeling in warmups
for West Virginia. Asked to explain his restored shooting touch,
Hodgson said, ``It was more wanting to play better and, more
importantly, wanting a win.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With their fourth straight triumph, the Scarlet Knights (14-6
over all, 6-4 Big East) matched their total for victories last
season and matched their most victories ever in the conference.
Rutgers takes a fourth-place standing in the Big East into
Villanova on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   `This was the kind of game we wanted to have today,'' Bannon
said. ``This time of year, we want to be sharp on our home court. I
really liked the way our guys played at both ends of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson poured in 10 consecutive points midway in the first half
to stretch Rutgers' lead to 26-12. He floated in three consecutive
3-pointers to end the half, giving the Knights a 51-22 lead _ and
the victory, in West Virginia Coach Gale Catlett's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty from where I sat,'' said Catlett, who watched
his sleepy team commit 16 turnovers and shoot 32 percent in the
first 20 minutes. The Mountaineers (9-12, 3-8) endured scoreless
droughts of six, four and four minutes before halftime, falling
behind by 8-0 and trailing by 16-8 when Hodgson got hot. Meanwhile,
Rutgers had just four turnovers against a press that West Virginia
could not sustain because of a lack of energy and depth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountaineers defeated the Knights, 65-63, in Morgantown,
W.Va., on Dec. 30 on a last-seconds shot by Jarrett Kearse. Kearse
was a nonfactor Sunday, scoring just 2 of his 14 points when the
game was in doubt. Forward Marcus Goree led West Virginia with 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't about revenge,'' Bannon said. `'It was about a
team that wants to go somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   If the streaky Hodgson remains in a groove, Rutgers' last six
games are likely to elevate the Scarlet Knights' post-season
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson, a senior, leads the Knights with a 14-point average,
after averaging 13.2 last season. Although Bannon said Hodgson has
more of a scoring mentality this season, the coach said he would
not mind if Hodgson concentrated even more on point-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get a guy that gets 30, that makes us that much
better,'' Bannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Although dwarfed by Hodgson's streaky shooting, other Scarlet
Knights turned in notable performances. Greer and Geoff Billet
handed out six assists each, many to Hodgson. ``Nobody deserves to
play like that more than Rob does,'' Billet said.
</P>
<P>
   Center Rashod Kent had 6 points and 7 rebounds, and showed less
girth around his middle as he recovers from a hip-pointer. With the
Knights ahead, 60-31, Kent broad-jumped his 6-foot-6-inch,
270-pound body over the West Virginia bench to chase a loose ball,
earning an ovation from Bannon and a few oohs from the sellout
crowd of 8,505 fans at the Louis Brown Athletic Center.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Scarlet Knight in double figures was the reserve
guard Earl Johnson, with 10 points and 3 assists in 20 minutes.
However, if there was one component the Knights did not need
Sunday, it was another scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson described his success Sunday afternoon in one succinct
understatement. ``Whatever I put up,'' he said, ``went in.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ There was plenty of Denver defense and a gracious dose
of Terrell Davis running. Big-play interceptions abounded for
Denver and cornerback Darrien Gordon had two for a Super Bowl
record 108 yards in returns. There were Rod Smith fancy catches,
surprising Howard Griffith fullback scoring runs and enough tough
football after three quarters but only a 17-6 Denver lead to
believe that maybe, just maybe, Super Bowl XXXIII could finish with
a flash. With flair. Offering drama.
</P>
<P>
   But there was too much Denver left. Too much John Elway. Too
much strength by this gripping Denver defense. The champions had
not finished. They wanted more. They took it.
</P>
<P>
   At the end the Broncos had humbled the Atlanta Falcons, 34-19,
in Super Bowl XXXIII before a crowd of 74,803 at Pro Player
Stadium, after scoring 17 points in the first half and 17 more in
the fourth quarter alone. A sprint to the finish gave the Denver
Broncos their second consecutive National Football League
championship, another sterling silver Vince Lombardi Trophy to
relish and admire.
</P>
<P>
   A memorable moment for Elway, who was a unanimous choice as the
game's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   He was expected to retire now, though he refused to say after
the game. Through his first 14 seasons he labored and longed for a
championship ring, and now in his last two seasons he has two
glowing rings. A quarterback who at age 38 can leave having saved
his best for last, enjoying the best of his sport in his best Super
Bowl of five appearances by far _ 18 of 29 for 336 yards with one
touchdown and one interception. Those numbers _ including the
third-highest passing yardage in Super Bowl history _ earned Elway
the game's most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   It helped give Denver a remarkable 17-2 season that began with
13 consecutive victories and ended with the Broncos, once again, as
kings. Denver becomes only the seventh team to win consecutive
Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   Elway soundly outplayed Chris Chandler, the Atlanta quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was 19 of 35 for 219 yards, with one touchdown and
three interceptions. It was his interceptions in the third quarter
that hurt Atlanta most, especially the second one. It came with
Atlanta at the Denver 21 and looking to turn the Denver 17-6 lead
into something smaller, better for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon swiped Chandler's pass and returned it 58 yards to
the Atlanta 24. Denver would take the ball and continue a drive
early into the fourth quarter that would result in a Griffith
1-yard touchdown run. That made it 24-6. It made the Falcons foul.
Extinct. They would not recover. Denver piled on more points _ an
Elway dive for a touchdown with 11:20 remaining that made it 31-6.
Exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   The game's final fourth-quarter scoring was an Atlanta 94-yard
kickoff return for a touchdown by the rookie Tim Dwight, with 11:01
remaining, Jason Elam's 37-yard field goal for the Broncos and the
Falcon Terance Mathis' 3-yard scoring catch with 5:04 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wondrous season for Atlanta and its coach, Dan Reeves,
which finished with a crashing thud.
</P>
<P>
   It was another spirited, focused and fulfilling season for
Denver, which finished what it had started, dominating the Falcons
in much the manner it has dominated the National Football League
for two straight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter was scoreless because both teams blew
offensive chances, especially Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter, the Denver place-kicker Jason Elam missed
attempts from 38 and 48 yards after long Denver drives. But on both
long Atlanta drives, Chris Chandler was intercepted, once by
Darrius Johnson and once by Darrien Gordon. Gordon's theft came
with 1 minute 46 seconds left in the third quarter, and Gordon
returned it 58 yards to the Atlanta 24. To Chandler's credit, he
hustled and made the tackle, preventing Gordon from returning the
ball all the way for a score. No matter, though.
</P>
<P>
   Denver would embark on a drive that would result in a 1-yard
Howard Griffith touchdown run 4 seconds into the fourth quarter.
That score put Denver ahead, 24-6. Atlanta looked to be in trouble.
It was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That was the way the Falcons' offense had played for most of the
first half. For most of the game. Denver on offense, though, was
more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Denver's first-half possessions went this way: touchdown,
interception, field goal, touchdown, punt. Add it up, and the total
was 17 Denver points. They came on a 1-yard run by Griffith with
3:55 left in the first quarter, on which the fullback bullied into
the end zone on a dive play; a 26-yard field goal by Jason Elam,
and, with 4:54 left in the first half, a dramatic Elway-to-Smith
80-yard pass on which Smith sprinted alone into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, meanwhile, advanced to the Denver 15, 26, 8 and 11
in the game's first 30 minutes but managed only two field goals.
Thus, Denver led at halftime, 17-6.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in Miami, which was playing host to its eighth
Super Bowl, was festive and colorful. The singer Cher did a slow,
methodical, serenading rendition of the national anthem, and there
were so many fireworks and flares during it and afterward that the
stadium was full of smoke for the next several minutes. Over the
next five minutes, the smoke finally cleared.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Denver offense began to light things up again.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half Denver won in total yards (266 to 148) and in
passing yards (199 to 80) and in style, execution and production.
It was an Elway half _ he was a pesky 9 of 15 for 199 yards with 1
touchdown and 1 interception. It was a Smith half _ the tall, rangy
Broncos receiver caught four balls for 144 yards and touchdown. It
was Smith's 80-yard touchdown grab that, early on, was the game's
signature play.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta kicker Morten Anderson had just missed a 26-yard
field goal that would have cut Denver's lead to 10-6. Instead,
Denver got the ball at its own 20 after the missed attempt and
instantly made Atlanta pay.
</P>
<P>
   Smith lined up wide-right and ran past cornerback Ronnie
Bradford. That was fine for Atlanta. Bradford appeared to be in
zone coverage and that was his job, to cover Smith for the first 10
to 15 yards and then to release him to help behind. That help was
Robinson, who initially looked ready to pick up the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, however, was spun silly by Smith. Smith ran at
Robinson and showed an out move; Robinson reacted to the out and
Smith then ran inside, toward the middle of the field, past
Robinson. Robinson could not recover. Smith had a two-step edge and
Elway delivered the pass in stride to Smith. Touchdown. Atlanta was
behind by 14 points rather than 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons should have realized that it was critical that they
pay attention to the second quarter. Denver was not outscored in
any quarter this season. For Atlanta, there was one such quarter _
the second. During the regular season, the Falcons were outscored
by 95-91 in the second quarter. In the playoffs, they were
outscored by 23-14. On Sunday, it was 10-3, including Smith's big
play.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis outrushed Jamal Anderson in the half, 65 yards to
51 yards. And though the Falcons did not commit a penalty or a
turnover in the half, their inability to score touchdowns when they
were deep in Denver territory haunted them.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, however, scored first. It took the opening kickoff and
enjoyed Tim Dwight's 21-yard return to the Atlanta 37. A 25-yard
pass-interference penalty on cornerback Ray Crockett, who was
holding the Atlanta receiver Tony Martin, put the ball at the
Denver 21. Atlanta drove to the Denver 8 and then went backward.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was sacked for a 7-yard loss on a double, middle blitz
by Gordon, a cornerback, and linebacker Bill Romanowski on which
Romanowski got there first. Anderson converted a 32-yard field goal
and with 9:35 left in the first quarter, Atlanta led by 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Denver took the ball on the kickoff and set the tone for the
game. Atlanta gained a field goal on its first drive. Denver would
score a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of tight end Shannon Sharpe catching passes
over the middle in the Denver drive that covered 80 yards in 10
plays and took 5:40. Smith, of course, was in the mix, too. Sharpe
made catches of 12 and 14 yards. In between, Smith made a grab of
41 yards on which Bradford missed a tackle that could have cut the
gain in half. Griffith finished the drive with his 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta ran three plays and punted on its next series, beginning
a disturbing first-half trend. On a third-and-1 play, it could not
convert a first-down run. That would happen later in the half on
another third-and-1 and even on a fourth-and-1.
</P>
<P>
   But after the first time, Atlanta got a nice break. It punted
and then Elway threw an interception. The ball bounced off the
hands of Sharpe and into Bradford's hands at the Denver 35 with
1:27 left in the first quarter. What followed? The possession on
which Atlanta failed to convert on third-and-1 and fourth-and-1,
turning the ball right back to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   By then, there was 14:15 left in the second quarter. Denver
drove 63 yards for a 26-yard field goal by Elam. Andersen then
missed his 26-yarder. Back came Smith with the big scoring play.
And then Andersen booted a 28-yard field goal with 2:25 left to end
the first-half scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' early problems became their late problems.
Unproductive offense. Interceptions that were returned by Denver
for long gains. And a swamping, vexing Denver offense that kept the
fire burning en route to its repeat championship. &QL;

NETS SURPRISED BY BIG TURNOUT FOR THEIR SCRIMMAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Nets had gathered at the Continental
Arena early Sunday morning for a closed practice, hours before
opening up the doors to the fans for a free glimpse of the team in
an intrasquad practice and a variety of fan-friendly activities.
</P>
<P>
   With the Super Bowl still hours away and the chilly air making
standing outside the gates waiting for admission no pleasure, Keith
Van Horn eyed the empty seats and figured that few fans would take
the time or trouble to show up. But when the doors opened an hour
before the start of the scrimmage, fans started flowing through the
gates, until there were 6,000 of them cheering wildly for every
dunk or any joke from Jayson Williams, who was playing master of
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nets hardly drew a full house, it was a start. This in
an arena and an organization where the team stopped playing host to
exhibition games for years after then-coach Bill Fitch turned
around during the national anthem and saw Mookie Blaylock, a rookie
at the time, counting the fans in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest surprise,'' Van Horn said. ``I told Jayson
before, we'd be lucky to get a thousand people. I was going to fake
an injury because I'd be embarrassed to play in front of a thousand
people. I was happy that all the people showed up. I think it
really speaks to where this organization is going.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way from the days when the team would be thankful
to draw this many fans to a midseason game. But the team's
performance on the court has something to do with that, as does the
perception that with the National Basketball Association begging
for forgiveness, the Nets have already tried to position themselves
as the team of the people.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets have lived in the shadow of the Knicks for years, but
have emerged as a team that could be their equal on the court and
are not opposed to jabbing at them off the court. Before the
scrimmage began, Williams took the microphone and thanked the fans
for their support, then added: ``We're the only show in town. You
remember that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Knicks had an open scrimmage of their own last Thursday at
their practice site at the State University of New York at
Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Only a limited number of tickets were distributed and the
college bleachers were only half-filled, the number totaling an
estimated 400 fans, not many more than the number of security
guards on hand in trench coats with earpieces and speaking into
their sleeves.

   The scrimmage in New York featured two halves of 10 minutes each
and by the time the second half had come, the Knicks were ready to
call it a day, keeping the clock running while the Knicks City
Dancers posed and preened for NBA Entertainment cameras.

   ``You know, it must have been all the corporate kids,'' Williams
said. ``That's what that was about. We're a community team here.
That's corporate America, the New York Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' scrimmage started out like any practice, but as the
fans grew louder, the players made a little more effort to please
them. While Coach John Calipari sat at the scorer's table, trying
in vain to bark out orders to players and his assistant coaches,
the game deteriorated into a bit of playground ball, with Van Horn
throwing down an assortment of dunks and Sam Cassell smiling widely
as he fired in one jumper after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised we had a couple of thousand people come out
because of the Super Bowl,'' Williams said afterward. ``I thought
everybody would be out running around, getting chips and beers,
getting everything ready. It just goes to show you, the New Jersey
Nets are on their way up if we can get people to come out to an
open practice like that.'' l

EDITORIAL: THE FIRST PRESIDENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Feb. 1
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the bicentennial of George Washington's death,
on Dec. 14, 1799, at age 67. If he seems older than that in the
late-life portraits, it is because he lived a long life by any
standard, when measured by the accumulation of notable events and
actions. But he also seems older than chronology suggests by virtue
of a historical illusion, which prevents every illustrious figure
depicted in an era before photography from inhabiting the moment of
his proper age.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot see the true youth in Washington at 40, painted by
Charles Willson Peale, any more than you can see the true age in
Washington at 64, painted by Gilbert Stuart. Our kinship with the
past is profound, but it can also be unimaginable. That is what
makes the exhibition called ``Treasures From Mount Vernon,'' on
display at the New York Historical Society until Feb. 22, so
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Biography is always an act of inference, and Washington requires
a little more inferring than most subjects. Apotheosis, some say,
has made him hard to know. But Americans have had a lot of
opportunity to think about what it means to know a president
recently, and that fact makes it easier to value what we do know
about his character. Most of his life, from a very young age, was
lived in public. But as far as the historical evidence shows, the
public and private man were never in conflict, except for his
frequently stated longing for his forsaken home at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is more intelligible as a man with public and private
vocations _ statesman, general, farmer _ than as a man with public
and private characters. Judging by his letters and the
recollections of his contemporaries, to know him was not to catch
him in some unguarded moment or some inherent contradiction of
character, of the kind that Jefferson might be caught in. It was to
meet him in the context of his vocations and to discover their
consistency with the man, which is something we have been wondering
how to prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has been almost amused out of her liberties,''
Washington once wrote. That is a striking sentence, and it would be
interesting to know how it sounded in his own voice. The exhibition
at the Historical Society is the next best thing _ a distinctive
gathering of Washington's possessions from Mount Vernon, some of
which, like his suits of clothing, help us grasp the very modern
size of this man.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing his surveying tools, his packbags and spurs, his swords,
you can almost feel the tendency of the Washington myth _ composed
mostly of Americans' ignorance _ to exhaust the historical reality
of the objects gathered here. But the reality of this man, elusive
as it may be, cannot be insisted upon too much.

 &HT;    Falcons errors in Denver territory cost them the win
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _
</P>
<P>
   FIRST QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to discern some early trends as the Falcons
ran the ball on six of their first eight snaps, occasionally mixing
in some ``cluster'' formations, but obviously trying to establish
running back Jamal Anderson as their offensive fulcrum.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta got the first break when Denver cornerback Ray Crockett
was flagged for a 25-yard interference penalty that moved the ball
to the Broncos 21-yard line. After gaining a first-and-goal at the
10-yard line, however, the offensive line had problems with
consecutive blitzes, both of which combined linebacker Bill
Romanowski and a defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   The first blitz forced a hurry from quarterback Chris Chandler.
The second, in combo with cornerback Darrien Gordon, resulted in a
7-yard sack by Romanowski. The Falcons settled for Morten
Andersen's 32-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Broncos showed their ``spread'' formation on
just their second offensive snap and served notice they wanted to
get the ball to tight end Shannon Sharpe while attacking the middle
of the Falcons secondary.
</P>
<P>
   The big play on Denver's first possession was a 41-yard crossing
pattern to wide receiver Rod Smith, who easily beat ``nickel''
cornerback Randy Fuller to the inside position. The play
highlighted an 80-yard drive that culminated with a 1-yard scoring
run over left guard by fullback Howard Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons got into a rut, rushing on five of six first-and-10
situations. Anderson carried on eight of Atlanta's 14 snaps. Sharpe
tore his left medial collateral knee ligament on a 14-yard gain
that set up the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   The quarter was a frustrating one for the Falcons, who ran 13 of
their 17 snaps in Broncos territory but still managed only three
points.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was inside the Denver 30-yard line on three of its four
possessions, but failure to convert some short-yardage situations
and a missed 26-yard field-goal attempt by Morten Andersen kept the
offense sputtering.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter opened with the Falcons facing a third-and-1 at the
Broncos 26, but Jamal Anderson was held to no gain over left tackle
and lost 2 yards on a fourth-down toss play.
</P>
<P>
   Denver wide receiver Rod Smith was permitted to go unchecked as
the Falcons played cornerback Ray Buchanan on wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey most of the time. Operating against cornerback Ronnie
Bradford and ``nickel'' cornerback Randy Fuller, the fleet Smith
found plenty of voids in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The missed field goal by Andersen seemed to deflate the Falcons
and Broncos coach Mike Shanahan apparently sensed that. On the
first play after the miss, he called for a deep pass to Smith. The
veteran got an easy inside release from Bradford and then burst up
the right seam to burn free safety Eugene Robinson for an 80-yard
touchdown as the lead grew to 17-3.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Terrell Davis began to find creases at the line of
scrimmage and fullback Howard Griffith three times leveled Falcons
middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle on ``iso-lead'' plays or draw
plays. A 42-yard kickoff return by Tim Dwight gave the Falcons
another scoring opportunity, but cornerbacks Tory James and Darrien
Gordon knocked away passes into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos controlled the quarter, with huge advantages in
snaps (19-8) and possession time (10:49-4:11), but they blew two
scoring opportunities when placekicker Jason Elam missed field goal
tries of 38 (wide right) and 48 (wide left) yards on their first
two series of the half.
</P>
<P>
   With quarterback John Elway starting to find wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey in the soft underside of the Atlanta secondary,
especially in the 12- to 18-yard hook zone, Denver moved the ball
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the Falcons were victimized by mistakes while in
Broncos territory. Continuing a trend he started midway through the
second quarter, quarterback Chris Chandler began to throw
successfully on first down, but he had two pickoffs in the quarter
that killed promising series. The first interception came on a poor
throw down the middle of the field when Chandler was pressured and
had little zip on a pass intercepted by ``nickel'' cornerback
Darrius Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The second was even more costly. With the Falcons at the Denver
21, Chandler's first-down pass for tight end O.J. Santiago was
tipped by Broncos defensive tackle Keith Traylor and intercepted by
cornerback Darrien Gordon. His 58-yard return to the Atlanta
24-yard line set the Broncos up to put away the game.
</P>
<P>
   A third-and-6 play on the ensuing series accentuated the
critical flaw of Atlanta's defensive game plan, as the Falcons
attempted to bracket McCaffrey with linebackers Henri Crockett and
Jessie Tuggle. McCaffrey's 15-yard catch moved the ball to the
1-yard line as the quarter ended.
</P>
<P>
   FOURTH QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   Denver fullback Howard Griffith scored on his second 1-yard
touchdown run on the first play of the quarter, culminating a
possession set up by cornerback Darrien Gordon's interception and
extending Broncos' lead to 24-6.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon struck again on the subsequent Atlanta series, picking
off his second pass of the game and returning it 50 yards to the
Falcons' 48-yard line. At that point, the Broncos were backing off
and playing zone, while rushing only four defenders. On the
interception, Gordon was simply sitting back in the deep center and
had to make only a modest break on a terrible Chandler throw.
</P>
<P>
   Able to ignore the run and simply commit to the pass-rush on
every snap, the Denver front four bounced Chandler around in the
fourth quarter, unofficially getting five hits on him.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback John Elway scored on a 3-yard quarterback draw, set
up by his 39-yard dump pass to running back Terrell Davis, to move
the Broncos to a 31-6 blowout. Return specialist Tim Dwight
provided the Falcons a thrill on the following kickoff when he
burst through a small crease on the right side and raced 94 yards
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   While the Broncos played keep-away by pounding Davis between the
tackles, Elway threw 25-yards on a comeback to wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey to set up a 37-yard field goal by Jason Elam.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons finally scored an offensive TD when Chandler hit of
8 of 14 passes for 68 yards on Atlanta's final possession of the
game. His 3-yard pass to wide receiver Terance Mathis on a sharp
inside route finished the scoring.

 &HT;    Falcons, Chandler have miserable day where it counts: Inside
Denver 20
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The balanced, effective offense that helped the Falcons
get to Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIII at Pro Players Stadium was a
shell of itself against the Denver Broncos. And so, Atlanta's dream
season came crashing down in a heap of blown opportunities and
critical interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Not once did the ``Dirty Bird'' get the expected airtime. By the
time the offense produced a touchdown _ Chris Chandler to Terance
Mathis from 3 yards with 2:04 left _ the outcome had long been
decided; the Broncos were already up 34-13.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who distinguished himself with a heroic performance in
the NFC Championship Game victory over Minnesota two weeks ago, was
far from that Sunday. At times, he was able to direct the Falcons
down field. But when they got in scoring distance, Chandler bombed,
throwing three interceptions in three critical possessions.
</P>
<P>
   His last errant throw was the dagger that squashed any hope of
another Falcons late-game rush. Trailing 24-6, Atlanta drove to
Denver's 26. But on first down, Chandler, searching for Tony Martin
in the end zone, delivered the ball directly to defensive back
Darrien Gordon, who returned the interception 50 yards to the
Atlanta 48. Three plays later, John Elway ran in from 3 yards to
make it an insurmountable 31-6 Denver lead.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third quarter _ with Denver up 17-6 _ Chandler
wanted to hit an open Terance Mathis in the end zone, but Keith
Traylor deflected the pass and Gordon picked it off and returned it
58 yards to the 24. Howard Griffith plowed in from the 1 to make it
a 24-6 Denver advantage.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Broncos 14 points off two Chandler interceptions.
Ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   It was not much better for the Falcons in the first half,
especially in the red zone and in short-yardage situations. They
managed just 148 total yards in the first two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Chandler missed an open Tim Dwight in the
end zone from 8 yards out on third down, forcing a field goal
attempt by Morten Andersen. Incredibly, the reliable Andersen
missed from just 26 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The next time with the ball _ after Chandler hit Tony Martin for
a 23-yard gain, rushed for 10 and connected with Brain Kozlowski
for 5 _ the quarterback threw short to Martin in the end zone,
allowing the pass to be broken up by Darrien Gordon. Again, Atlanta
had to settle for an Andersen field goal, making it three times
inside the Denver 20 without a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The offense wasted a prime opportunity to score when Ronnie
Bradford intercepted Elway at the Denver 35. However, on
third-and-1 Jamal Anderson was stopped for no gain running left.
Then, on fourth down, Anderson was gang-tackled for a 2-yard loss
on a pitch out to the right. The offense actually established a
ground attack on the first possession. Anderson burst for 13 yards
off left tackle on the game's initial play. He picked up half of
the Falcons' 48 yards on a five-play drive that produced a 32-yard
Andersen field goal for a 3-0 lead. But field goals were hardly
enough.

SPORTS COLUMN: A COURAGEOUS DAVIS AND AN EMBARRASSED ROBINSON
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The hard part for Denver Broncos running back Terrell
Davis on Sunday night in Super Bowl XXXIII, a game won in
convincing fashion over the Atlanta Falcons, 34-19, was making a
hard cut inside. Because that was when Davis' groin, injured last
week and kept a secret by Davis and the team, seemed to hurt most.
Still, he played on, and played hard, and ran with the kind of
passion he always does.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part for Atlanta safety Eugene Robinson was just
walking onto the field. When he did for warm-ups, his stomach was
tight, and his heart was still sick from being arrested Saturday
night on a charge of soliciting a prostitute. It was the kind of
moment that a player would not wish on his worst enemy _ an
embarrassing arrest with the world watching.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Robinson are key players for their teams. Davis is a
true big-game performer and Robinson the skilled quarterback of the
Atlanta secondary. On this night, their performances weren't up to
their superhuman standards. Yet they were major factors, though for
completely different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Though he gained 102 yards on 25 carries, Davis' rushing yards
were well below his post-season average, mainly because of his
groin injury. But he was a great decoy at times, and his injury
meant more carries for fullback Howard Griffith, who set a career
high with two touchdown runs.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had a difficult Saturday night because of his arrest,
and then in Sunday night's game he gave up an 80-yard pass play to
wide receiver Rod Smith, a play that may have assured Robinson a
place in Super Bowl infamy. That play gave Denver a 17-3 lead early
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Broncos beat Green Bay with an impressive offense.
This year they did it mostly with defense. The Falcons had gone
past midfield a total of six times after three quarters, but got
just two Morten Andersen field goals of 32 and 28 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler had a terrible night, throwing three
interceptions, the most crucial coming at the end of the third
quarter after a tipped pass landed in the hands of cornerback
Darrien Gordon, who had two picks. Griffith then scored on a 1-yard
run.
</P>
<P>
   That touchdown killed the Falcons, who then trailed, 24-6, early
in the fourth quarter. It killed the hopes of Atlanta's Dan Reeves,
who became the third coach in history to lose four Super Bowls,
joining Bud Grant of Minnesota and Marv Levy of Buffalo. This Super
Bowl loss may be more painful than Reeves' others, because it was
to the team that fired him after the 1992 season.
</P>
<P>
   For Davis and Robinson, they experienced the highs and lows of a
championship game. The world watches you perform, and fans don't
care if Davis' groin hurts so much it is sometimes painful just to
walk. They don't care if Robinson made one of the dumbest mistakes
of his life, being out the night before the Super Bowl, in a Miami
neighborhood known for its prostitution and drug sales, when he
should have been in bed sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the first time Davis had to deal with a physical
ailment during the Super Bowl. Last year in Super Bowl XXXII, Davis
forgot to take his migraine headache medication and missed almost a
quarter of the game after getting severe headaches. Davis
recovered, however, to rush for 157 yards and three touchdowns and
was named the game's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how Davis injured his groin, but he practiced in
pain for most of the week. Teammates estimated he was at 80 percent
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   His injury was so bad that on Wednesday, Davis was supposed to
appear at an award ceremony for the season's most valuable player,
given to Minnesota quarterback Randall Cunningham. Davis was a
nominee, but he couldn't make it because he needed treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In the game, the groin injury definitely slowed Davis. He was
quick, but not Davis quick. At times, the Broncos used Davis as a
decoy, lining him up at wide receiver. Rarely was the pass thrown
his way. It was a way of keeping Davis in the game and making the
Falcons account for him. It is always about chess in this sport.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the definitive sign that something was wrong. Davis is
one of the most productive post-season runners ever. He had rushed
for 148.3 yards per post-season game, a startling 5.8 yards a
carry, both numbers ranking him tops in National Football League
playoff history. Yet when the Broncos had first-and-goal at the
Atlanta 1-yard line, it was not Davis who got the call, but
Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Griffith? It's easy to understand if his name is not in
your mental Rolodex. Griffith had four carries in all of the
regular season _ none in the playoffs _ and no pass receptions all
year. Yet Sunday night he had four carries and a catch.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Davis gets that ball in that crucial goal-line
situation. No question. And a healthy Davis does not spend so much
time running pass patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Deciphering how Robinson's problems affected him is much harder
to do. There is no question that he and the entire Atlanta
organization were devastated by the arrest, since Robinson, who won
a civic award given to players of high moral character the same
night that he allegedly propositioned a police officer for oral
sex, is considered one of the best people in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson stayed up much of the night, talking to his wife, Gia,
and then teammates. At the most, Robinson got several hours of
sleep. The day of the game, Reeves made an emotional speech to the
team, emphasizing that the Falcons are a family and that what
happened to Robinson should not serve as a distraction. But just
giving that speech proves it became a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Was Robinson affected? No one will truly ever know. When
Robinson was beaten deep by Smith and later missed a tackle on
Davis, was it because Smith was simply faster and Davis great, or
because Robinson's mind was not focused on football?
</P>
<P>
   Even if Robinson is innocent, just being out at that time, in
that neighborhood, the night before the Super Bowl, was a truly
selfish act.
</P>
<P>
   This game will be remembered for John Elway's getting his second
ring, and Denver Coach Mike Shanahan's establishing himself as one
of the best coaches ever.
</P>
<P>
   Davis won't appear in many headlines, but he played with
courage. Robinson will be one of the most talked about Super Bowl
players ever, though not for the reasons he would have liked.

FREDERICK SOMMER, 93, SURREALIST PHOTOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Md.)  (rk) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick Sommer, whose distinctive images of surrealist
collages, horizonless landscapes, blurry nudes and cameraless
abstractions influenced generations of photographers, died on Jan.
23 at his home in Prescott, Ariz. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Variously described as a gadfly, an eccentric, a photographer's
photographer and the Joseph Cornell of photography, Sommer worked
in relative isolation in Arizona for more than a half-century and
until the last several years was the medium's best-kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   His obscurity stemmed in part from the 1950s, when many of the
important shapers of the public's view of photography, who clearly
favored documentary essays and aesthetically pleasing landscapes,
dismissed Sommer's work as unphotographic.
</P>
<P>
   Several decades before the term ``postmodernism'' was coined,
Sommer photographed his recreations of other artists' work. An avid
student of art and philosophy who early on displayed a gift for
drawing, he formed new images out of lithographs by tearing parts
of them off or slicing them up or recombining bits and pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer's critics in the '50s seemed particularly offended by a
photograph he had taken in 1939 of an amputated leg and foot. His
subjects in the '30s and '40s included dead animals, entrails and
other refuse in the desert near Prescott. He also carefully
arranged chicken parts to form intriguing new shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer made surrealist compositions out of doll parts and, in
the '60s, created abstract expressionist cameraless images out of
candle smoke deposits or oil paint pressed between sheets of
cellophane.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, though, critics, curators and
collectors seem to have finally discovered Sommer. His photographs
are being offered at major auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Nazraeli Press in Tucson, Ariz., published a book
of his work, ``All Children Are Ambassadors,'' and subsequently
issued two boxed reproductions of his images on cards. In 1994, the
Getty Museum acquired more than 100 of his photographs and
collages, and the same year held an exhibition of his work. An
exhibition of his photographs, drawings and collages opens at the
Baltimore Museum of Art on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Italy in 1905, Sommer had set out to be a landscape
architect. He grew up in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where his father,
Carlos, a German national, had established a landscape architecture
firm and nursery. He received a master's degree in landscape
architecture at Cornell University, where he met his wife, Frances.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s, he taught watercolor, drawing and design at
a private studio and worked on his own watercolors. It was after he
showed his work to Alfred Stieglitz in 1935 that he formed a fresh
view of photography in relation to art.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent meeting with Edward Weston led him to replace
smaller cameras with an 8-by-10-inch view camera, with which he
began to take pictures of what he found in and about Prescott. At a
party in California in 1941, Sommer met the surrealist Max Ernst
and from then on the surreal became a prominent component of his
work.
</P>

   When the fine-art photography market was in its infancy in the
early 1970s, Sommer signed on as one of the original 13 artists to
be exclusively represented by the Light Gallery, one of only two
galleries in New York devoted to photography at the time. In 1976,
the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson acquired a major
collection of his photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer, who is survived by his wife, was a surrealist in more
ways than one. ``Life,'' he once said, ``is the most durable
fiction that matter has yet to come up with, and art is the
structure of matter as life's most durable fiction.''

 &HT;    The party that fizzled: Would-be celebration becomes swan song
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a rainy night in Georgia, Atlantans gathered in
homes and bars and churches and anywhere else that had a TV, and
watched as their Super Bowl fantasy was brought down to earth. It
had been a sweet season for their Falcons _ the best ever _ but all
the chips and dip in the world couldn't change the result: The
Dirty Bird had flown.
</P>
<P>
   The chilly, gloomy weather fit the mood in Buckhead, where the
largest number of revelers gravitated to the district's many
nightspots. With three minutes left in the game, Michelle
Shackleford of Vinings was philosophical as she left the Three
Dollar Cafe and stepped into the drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, they made it to the Super Bowl,'' she said, repeating a
mantra that would have seemed unbelievable a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped on the bandwagon,'' said Angie Groom of Marietta,
``but it was a great ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The last ride of Atlanta's first Super Bowl season started hours
before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   _ 11 a.m.: Church hour for many Atlantans _ but not for the
hundreds of fans already lined up outside Buckhead bars. At the
Atlanta Beer Garden on Peachtree Road, Jai Lattimer of Marietta
wasn't making the same mistake he made two weeks before when he
couldn't get a table for the Falcons-Vikings game. He showed up
with friends at 11:25, scoring a choice booth near the TV and
settling in for 11 hours of football.
</P>
<P>
   _ 4:30 p.m.: There were no banners at the headstone of Rankin
Smith Sr., the hapless Falcons owner who died 15 months ago and is
buried in Westview Cemetery in southwest Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was joking with my friends,'' security guard Larry Lee said,
``and I told them that if we knew it would take Mr. Smith's death
for the Falcons to get to the Super Bowl, we would have killed him
a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   As a pelting rain fell, Lee sucked on a cough drop and insisted
that he meant no disrespect for Smith or his family. He was
surprised that, in the midst of the city's Falcons frenzy, no fans
had visited the grave to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Falcons beat the Vikings, I came out and patted the
monument and congratulated him,'' Lee said. ``If they win today,
I'll be out here again, thanking him. Whatever happens, this would
have been a big day for him.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 5:02 p.m.: Things were getting weird in Buckhead. Kim Morphis
and Vicki Durham of Columbus were walking down Peachtree Road
looking like a couple of dirty birds. Literally. They had feathers
glued to their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took Wal-Mart sweatshirts and some glue, and tore up my
Ralph Lauren feather pillow,'' Morphis said. It didn't bother her
that she was molting in the rain, leaving a trail of feathers.
``That way we can find our way back to the car.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 6:01 p.m.: A block away from the bars, one of the city's most
popular restaurants, the Atlanta Fish Market, sat nearly empty.
``We usually have an hour-and-a-half wait,'' said maitre d' Jessica
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   _ 6:20 p.m.: The evening service was shorter than usual at the
Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Decatur. Bishop Earl Paulk led
about 1,500 members in prayer, then turned on a big-screen TV and
several smaller monitors to let them watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't pray for a Falcons victory,'' Paulk said. ``We
prayed for their safety and for everybody to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Twana Dessasau of Norcross did pray for the Falcons, especially
Eugene Robinson, who was arrested on a soliciting charge Saturday
night. ``Maybe he shouldn't have been at that place at that time,
but he is a known Christian, so I have to pray for my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 7:01 p.m.: At Willie McGee's Sports Bar &AMP; Grill in Peachtree
Corners, the unofficial headquarters for Atlanta-area Broncos fans,
about 100 Denver partisans were packed into the prime seating area
in front of three big-screen TVs. About 150 Falcon fans filled the
rest of the bar and a covered patio. Two uniformed Gwinnett County
police officers stood by to keep order.
</P>
<P>
   The sections were easy to identify _ Denver fans in orange, the
Falcon faithful in black. The noise level was constant; no matter
which team had the ball, there was a rooting section. Among the
Bronco fans was Marty Hale, who had flown in from Denver on
Saturday to join her sister, Amy Hoots of Duluth. Hale said that if
she were in Denver, she would be at a Super Bowl party. ``But this
is a lot more fun. Last year (in Denver), we almost got
tear-gassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, the Falcons intercepted a pass. Waitress Erin Balon
whirled to celebrate and upended a tableful of drinks on two
customers _ Falcon fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' she said. ``I just get so excited. Oh, I love the
Falcons. I change to another person.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 7:15 p.m.: Forty casual fans, most of them new residents of
Atlanta, gathered at Stacy Zalowitz's one-bedroom apartment near
Emory University in DeKalb County to eat 10 pounds of kosher chili,
drink Jell-O shooters and watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are probably your average fair-weather Falcon fans,''
said Zalowitz, a 24-year-old accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mitchell Blass, a 32-year-old internist, was watching
his second football game ever. The first: the Falcons win over the
Minnesota Vikings two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The guests socialized noisily through the first quarter, as the
Falcons fell behind. The party fell silent only when the Budweiser
frogs commercial came on.
</P>
<P>
   _ 7:30 p.m.: It was a good night to see a movie. As the Broncos
went ahead by two touchdowns, just two people bought tickets to see
``At First Sight'' at the Southlake AMC 24 theaters. One was Joanne
McNeair, who said she didn't want to watch the game alone at home
because her husband was out of town. The other moviegoer: a man who
didn't want to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   _ 7:53 p.m.: Despite the 17-6 halftime score, a warm feeling
filled the fellowship hall of First Baptist Church in Marietta.
Youth ministries from First Baptist and nearby Zion Baptist
welcomed 120 homeless Cobb Countians with a wide-screen broadcast
and rib-eye steak dinners. During commercial time-outs, blankets,
clothes and toiletries were given out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I had steak? I don't remember,'' said Gary
Wright, a 42-year-old homeless man. He said he watched the NFC
championship game at the Cobb County jail. ``I thank the Lord I'm
here.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 8:30: Latasha Mitchell was tending the counter at a Wendy's
restaurant in Peachtree Corners, doing her boss a favor by working
Super Bowl night. That didn't keep her from grousing _ and trying
to keep up with the game. She was making an occasional dash to the
Hardee's next door, which had a TV, and was getting telephone
updates from friends.
</P>
<P>
   _ 8:50: At Marietta Fire Station No. 5, half a dozen
firefighters seemed to have given up on the Falcons midway through
the fourth quarter. There was barely a groan when Chris Chandler
was intercepted twice. One fireman switched to a medical show on
The Learning Channel, and two others started playing video fishing
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just sitting here waiting for the Falcons to start
playing,'' said Dale Blair.
</P>
<P>
   _ 9:01: As the second half wound down, the crowd at the Holiday
Inn in Suwanee had thinned from 150 to 35. But some fans swore they
wouldn't leave, no matter how lopsided the game became. Kirk Dryden
of Dahlonega, wearing a black Falcons shirt he had won in a Dirty
Bird dance contest earlier in the evening, said he would stay till
the bitter end. ``I won't give up no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a brave sentiment. But, for Atlanta, the party was over.
</P>

`DEATH-DEFYING' SMUGGLING ATTEMPT IS THWARTED AT THE BORDER
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An attempt to smuggle four Chinese women into the United States
from Canada was thwarted on a bridge north of Niagara Falls early
Sunday by a customs agent who spotted a piece of clothing dangling
under a fish truck and found the women wedged behind plywood under
the truck's frame, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the attempted crossing was an isolated
incident or part of a larger smuggling operation, one immigration
official said, but it occurred in an area along the New
York-Canadian border that has seen a surge in human cargo, as well
as stepped-up enforcement, in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Barrus, deputy director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Buffalo, said the confrontation occurred
on the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, six miles north of the falls, at
4:30 a.m., and he called it one of the more dangerous border
crossing attempts in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was death-defying,'' Barrus said by telephone last night,
referring to the women's precarious perch under the truck and to
their exposure to toxic exhaust fumes and the predawn 16-degree
cold. ``The women were wedged behind plywood underneath the truck.
It took the agents a half hour to get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the women were wearing coats, all were shivering and
two were ``unresponsive'' _ either from carbon monoxide fumes or
from exposure to the cold _ and were treated at St. Mary's Hospital
in nearby Lewiston before being taken into custody by immigration
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver was held on felony smuggling charges and the
women were held on charges of attempted illegal entry, said Barrus,
who said the names of the suspects were not immediately available.
All five were to be arraigned today before a United States
magistrate in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The border between New York and Canada _ particularly along the
Niagara River near Buffalo and the St. Lawrence River to the
northeast _ has long been a major crossing point for smugglers, who
have faced stepped-up enforcement efforts by customs and
immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   One recent case, involving the bribery of immigration officials,
exposed a scheme to bring 1,000 Chinese into this country. Another
case, in which 31 suspected smugglers were arrested in December,
raised allegations of a plot to bring 3,600 undocumented Chinese
and Malaysians into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Recent smuggling operations broken up at the St. Regis Mohawk
Reservation in northern New York showed that immigrants had paid up
to $47,000 each to be brought into this country.

MOYNIHAN SAYS GIULIANI IS NOT SENATORIAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who is retiring
in two years, has offered an acerbic assessment of the possibility
that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would run to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't come to the Senate for group therapy,'' Moynihan
told The New Yorker magazine in the issue that goes on sale Monday.
``You need to learn how to work in groups before you arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the mayor's office said Sunday night that they
would not comment until they had read the article.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine article, Moynihan _ who had
unsuccessfully urged state Comptroller H. Carl McCall to seek his
seat _ also offered a terse ``welcome'' to the prospect that first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton would run.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, 71, told the magazine that his feelings about the
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton were tinged both
by his concerns that impeachment would destabilize the presidency
and by his disdain for what he called Clinton's ``absence of
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan did not say how he would vote in the Senate trial, but
the magazine said it was virtually certain that he would not vote
to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitution says high crimes and misdemeanors,'' Moynihan
said, ``but this is a low crime. In some societies, people get
their throats slit over this kind of thing, but we don't remove
presidents because of it.''

PROSECUTORS OFFER GOTTI ANOTHER PLEA BARGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors have offered a new plea deal to
John A. Gotti, the accused acting boss of the Gambino crime family,
including a shorter prison sentence than the
six-and-a-half-to-eight-year term that Gotti rejected in late
December.
</P>
<P>
   Word that plea negotiations had been re-opened between the
prosecutors and Gotti's defense team came after two apparent
setbacks to the prosecution's racketeering case against Gotti, who
is the 34-year-old son of John J. Gotti, the imprisoned mafia
leader.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a special assistant U.S. attorney, Vincent Heintz,
was dismissed from the Gotti case for violating an order not to
speak with reporters, although it was unclear exactly what
information he had disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, a jury deliberating the case of two brothers
charged with two killings in 1996 at Scores, a Manhattan strip
club, returned a partial verdict that suggested they were
questioning the credibility of a prosecution witness, a mafia
turncoat who is also expected to testify against Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office,
confirmed Sunday that Heintz had been removed from the case but
said he could not discuss the status of any plea negotiations
involving Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   According to someone involved in the negotiations, the
government's most recent plea-bargain offer calls for a prison
sentence of no more than five and a half years, although the terms
of any agreement are still subject to lengthy and sensitive
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald L. Shargel, one of Gotti's lawyers, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two developments, the dismissal of Heintz, an assistant
district attorney in the Bronx who was appointed a special
assistant federal prosecutor to work on the Gotti case, was the
more dramatic and was expected to have the greatest ramifications,
lawyers involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark F. Pomerantz, the chief of the criminal division for the
U.S. attorney's office in the southern district of New York,
announced the removal in a letter to defense lawyers, a copy of
which was sent to Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. of federal
District Court in White Plains. Parker is hearing the case.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of a lead prosecutor in a high-profile case is
extremely rare, suggesting that officials in the U.S. attorney's
office felt compelled to act before the ethics violations were
uncovered and made public by Justice Department regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are generally allowed to discuss aspects of
a case that are a matter of public record, and routine procedural
issues, but are barred from disclosing confidential information,
such as grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The government's decision to reopen plea negotiations with Gotti
was first reported Sunday in the New York Post. Following the
advice of his father, who is serving a life sentence, Gotti had
broken off plea negotiations in late December.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, his lawyers rejected an offer that involved
Gotti's pleading guilty to reduced charges in exchange for a
sentence of six and a half to eight years in prison and a $1
million fine. Instead, Gotti chose to stand trial on broad
racketeering charges and possibly face a 20-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on the broader charges, Gotti, who is currently
free on $10 million bail but under house arrest in Oyster Bay, on
Long Island, also could face the confiscation of up to $10 million
in assets that prosecutors contend were obtained with profits from
criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crimes Gotti is accused of is the allegation that he
helped extort more than $1 million from Scores, where a bouncer and
a waiter were shot to death in June 1996. A jury is currently
deliberating murder charges against the two brothers accused of the
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The main prosecution witness in that case was a Mafia turncoat,
William Marshall, who is also expected to be a major witness
against Gotti if the Gotti case goes to trial. On Saturday, the
jury acquitted one of the brothers of second-degree murder in the
death of one of the men.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still considering other murder charges. Prosecutors
have defended the credibility of Marshall, whom they also used as a
witness in another federal case that resulted in the conviction in
December on extortion conspiracy charges of four defendants with
ties to the mob.

<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman broke her lower leg in two
places Sunday when she fell while skiing in Davos, Switzerland,
where she is attending the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was on an intermediate slope and took a turn and a twist
and the rest was history,'' said Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for
the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, 52, underwent surgery at a local hospital, Spital
Davos, and was expected to remain there until midweek, delaying her
return to New Jersey, originally scheduled for Wednesday, Ms.
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is expected to require a cast but not crutches,
McDonough said. Ms. O'Connor added that she did not know if the
governor would miss any of her state duties when she returns to New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Sunday night which leg the governor had broken.
</P>
<P>
   An avid skier, cyclist, horseback rider, canoeist and tennis
player, Whitman was on an outing organized by the economic forum,
an annual gathering of political, economic and cultural leaders
from many countries. This was the second year that Whitman had
attended the conference, Ms. O'Connor said.

GENERAL CHALLENGE WINS FOR BAFFERT, STEVENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; San Gabriel Valley Tribune &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- After a disappointing loss Saturday at Gulfstream
Park, trainer Bob Baffert and jockey Gary Stevens made Sunday
super, winning with General Challenge in the $100,000 Grade II
Santa Catalina Stakes at Santa Anita Park.
</P>
<P>
   The victory came on a day in which the main track didn't seem to
favor closers.
</P>
<P>
   But after stalking the early pace from the outside, General
Challenge took the lead from front-runner Buck Trout and pulled
clear to win by three lengths. General Challenge paid his
supporters $3.60, $2.40 and $2.10.
</P>
<P>
   Buck Trout, with Eddie Delahoussaye aboard, paid $2.80 and
$2.10. Third-place finisher Brilliantly, ridden by Kent Desormeaux,
returned $2.10.
</P>
<P>
   While Baffert stayed in Florida to attend the Super Bowl,
Stevens returned to California and was happy he did. He has a lot
of confidence in General Challenge, who ran the 1 1/16 mile in
1:42.93.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so talented, and I have so much confidence in him that I
didn't have any questions that he was the best horse in the race,''
Stevens said. ``The things that get you into trouble with horses
like him is immaturity. But, he's worked well on a track like
today's, and that wasn't a question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' victory denied jockey Chris McCarron his third
consecutive victory in the Santa Catalina. It also prevented
Delahoussaye, who won the seventh race on the card, from moving
within one of his 6,000 career victory.
</P>
<P>
   Delahoussaye has 5,998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were sitting good because we were going so
slow,'' he said. ``By far, that's the best this horse has ever
relaxed for me and I thought we'd just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida on Saturday for the $500,000 GradeI Donn Handicap,
Stevens and Baffert ran third with odds-on favorite Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   Both expressed disappointment after the race, which was won by
the Richard Mandella-trained and Desormeaux-ridden Puerto Madero.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Catalina, a race for 3-year-olds, is typically a good
gauge of West Coast talent in advance for the 11/4 mile Kentucky
Derby in May. Past Santa Catalina winners include Ferdinand, who
went on to win at Churchill Downs in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferdinand first ran third in the 11/8-mile Santa Anita
Derby, a race toward which owner John Mabee is pointing General
Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   `'A mile-and-a-quarter shouldn't be a problem,'' Mabee said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, ``We'll look at the (Mar.13) San Felipe
Stakes,'' he said. ``The (April3) Santa Anita Derby is our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant trainer Eoin Harty was also keen on General Challenge
as a possible Kentucky Derby entrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very forward physically, maybe not so much mentally,''
Harty said. ``He's very, very talented and he certainly has the
scope to go the Derby distance. Hopefully, he'll hold together.''
</P>
<P>
   The race was General Challenge's first around two turns and his
first against colts bred outside California. His other victories
came in a 6-furlong maiden race Nov.28 and the 7-furlong California
Breeders' Champion Stakes on Jan.1.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Mabee of San Diego sold Kentucky Derby hopeful
Worldy Manner, last year's Del Mar Futurity winner, to Godolphin
Stables in Dubai. Sunday, Mabee said there is little chance he and
his wife, Betty, will part with General Challenge.

ROBINSON'S ON-FIELD REPUTATION SUFFERS, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Atlanta Falcons safety Eugene Robinson's solid image was
tarnished Saturday night when was arrested on the eve of the Super
Bowl on a charge of solicitation of a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game started, the on-field reputation of the Pro Bowl
safety was smudged as well.
</P>
<P>
   He had trouble tackling and playing pass defense. Broncos
running back Terrell Davis confounded him a couple of times with
moves that had Robinson grasping for air. Also, receiver Rod Smith
burned him for an 80-yard touchdown reception in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   However, the biggest shock remained Robinson's arrest.
Ironically, it came on the same day he was given the 1999 Bart
Starr Award by Athletes in Action. The award is voted on by other
players and honors high moral character. MISSED OPPORTUNITIES
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons might forever lament a first half filled with missed
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   They had the ball in Denver territory four times in the first
two quarters, yet could come up with only two field goals.
Considering that the Broncos were scoring touchdowns, the field
goals could be looked upon as setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Most disheartening was a two-drive span in the second quarter
when the Falcons were stopped on a fourth-and-one play at the
Broncos' 26 four plays after cornerback Ronnie Bradford picked off
a pass from Broncos quarterback John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Denver responded with a field goal to make the score 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Kick returner Tim Dwight brought Atlanta immediately back down
the field with a 42-yard kickoff return. However, the Falcons'
offense bogged down at the 8-yard line. And then kicker Morten
Anderson missed a 26-yard field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos answered with the 80-yard pass from Elway to Smith
to break the game open at 17-3. CHANDLER HAS TOUGH DEBUT
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler's rise
from castoff to Super Bowl quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, however, looked more like the quarterback the Oilers,
Colts, Rams, Cardinals and Buccaneers gave up on than the one who
had a Pro Bowl season in 1998 and led the Falcons to the Super Bowl
for the first time in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was tentative for most of Sunday in the face of the
Broncos' blitz, threw three interceptions and was unable to make
plays on third downs in the red zone to keep the Falcons in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Darrien Gordon recorded two interceptions and set a
Super Bowl record with 108 interception-return yards. BRADFORD
STICKS OLD MATES
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Bradford seems to always come up with big plays against
his former Broncos teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford was selected the Falcons' player of the game after a
matchup last season against the Broncos when he had five tackles
and interception.
</P>
<P>
   He stung the Broncos with an interception in the first quarter.
Bradford was in the right place at the right time when a pass
bounded out of the hands of Shannon Sharpe and into his, setting up
the Falcons 35 yards from the Denver end zone.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bradford's efforts went for naught, as the Falcons
failed to capitalize on the prime scoring opportunity. The Falcons
didn't even pick up a first down and gave the ball back to the
Broncos when running back Jamal Anderson was thrown for a 2-yard
loss on fourth-and-one try.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford not only played three seasons with the Broncos but also
attended the University of Colorado and attended high school in
Commerce City, Colo., DWIGHT IS FALCONS' LONE STAR
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were embarrassed by the Broncos, but it was not the
fault of kick returner Tim Dwight, who did his best to keep Atlanta
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight returned five kickoffs for 210 yards, including a
42-yarder and 94-yarder for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The kickoff return for a touchdown was the first in a Super Bowl
since Desmond Howard took one back for the Packers in Super Bowl
XXXI. ANDERSEN UP, THEN DOWN
</P>
<P>
   It took Atlanta kicker Morten Andersen 17 years to get to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   However, finally there, Anderson made his presence felt early in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who endured some trying times with some bad teams in
New Orleans and Atlanta, scored the first points of Super Bowl
XXXIII with a 32-yard field goal on the game's opening drive to put
the Falcons up 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Super Bowl debut for the old man from Denmark was
not all super, as he missed a 26-yard field goal in the second
quarter before making one from 28 yards before the half.

SPORTS COLUMN: JOHN ELWAY'S LAST ROUNDUP?
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS to refine, ADD quotes from Elway and Shanahan; subs
overline. ) 
(ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ John Elway wouldn't say it in so many words, but for the
Broncos' quarterback, their 34-19 victory in Super Bowl XXXIII on
Sunday night was probably his last roundup.
</P>
<P>
   And his best.
</P>
<P>
   As the oldest quarterback, at age 38, to start a Super Bowl
game, he completed 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards, including a
60-yard touchdown arrow to wide receiver Rod Smith that broke the
Atlanta Falcons' wings. He also scored a clinching touchdown on a
1-yard keeper as the Broncos joined the Packers, Dolphins, Steelers
(twice), 49ers and Cowboys as the only teams to win two consecutive
Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   After being voted the game's most valuable player by a panel of
the news media, Elway sidestepped questions about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll cross that bridge later,'' he said in the interview area.
``I don't even want to talk about retirement now.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan acknowledged ``there's a good
chance'' this Super Bowl was Elway's last game, but the coach added
that the quarterback's teammates were ``talking to him about a
three-peat'' in the Super Bowl next season. No team has ever won
three straight Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It throws a kink into my thinking,'' Elway said of the
three-peat possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, the Broncos and even Denver itself would never be
quite the same.
</P>
<P>
   Few athletes have ever defined their city or their area the way
John Elway has. Until he arrived, Denver was just a mile-high
cowtown with low esteem in sports. The 1977 Broncos had been to the
Super Bowl with their Orange Crush defense, but were crushed. The
basketball Nuggets were never much. The baseball Rockies and the
hockey Avalanche weren't even there yet.
</P>
<P>
   But almost as soon as Elway started throwing passes in 1983, he
usurped Denver's identity. He was bigger than the city itself,
bigger than the Rocky Mountains in the distance. Other players
didn't talk about playing Denver, they talked about playing Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrated quarterbacks never upstaged their cities. Joe
Montana wasn't San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge was. Terry
Bradshaw wasn't Pittsburgh, steel was. Bart Starr wasn't Green Bay,
bratwurst was. Joe Namath wasn't New York, Broadway and Fifth
Avenue were. Johnny Unitas wasn't Baltimore, crab cakes were.
</P>
<P>
   But for 16 seasons, John Elway has been Denver, and Denver was
happy to have him, even when the Broncos lost three Super Bowls
with him.
</P>
<P>
   He even looked like he belonged there: big shoulders, rawboned
with a lariat for an arm. And he walked like a cowboy who just got
off his horse.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was even part of the Denver economy. His auto dealerships
were so successful, they were sold about a year ago for a reported
$82.5 million. Pat Bowlen, the Bronco owner, has indicated that
Elway might even emerge as a part owner of the franchise if he
decides not to be a quarterback anymore.
</P>
<P>
   When Elway was told Sunday night that he will be awarded his
choice of either a Ford Mustang or a Ford Expedition as the game's
MVP, he laughed and said, ``That's all I need is some more cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Elway acted as if he had played his last game in
Mile High Stadium. After he rallied the Broncos over the Jets,
23-10, for the American Football Conference title, he stayed on the
field and waved goodbye. He told the fans, ``I love you.'' He took
a victory lap to ``look into'' their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   What Elway saw in those eyes was their affection for a
quarterback whose numbers as a passer, as dazzling as they were,
never were as important to him as the numbers on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the appreciations of Elway through the years, the
Broncos' backup, Bubby Brister, perhaps explained better than
anybody else what has made Elway tick ever since he arrived in
Denver after he told the Baltimore Colts, who had drafted him, that
he wouldn't play there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All John ever wants to know,'' Brister said during the week,
``is what he needs to win, whether it's Ping-Pong, fishing,
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Brister remembered a fishing trip during the off season when
Elway asked him the weight of the biggest fish he had ever caught.
Brister told him 8 pounds, 8 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day,'' Brister recalled, laughing, ``John caught a
nine-pounder.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time they were playing a video game. Brister put up 52
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``John made 54,'' Brister said. ``He's the most competitive guy
I've ever known. And that same attitude made him such a great
quarterback. When he was behind in the fourth quarter, all he
wanted to know was what he needed to win _ a touchdown or a field
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Elway generated that winning touchdown or
that winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In his career as the National Football League's all-time
winningest quarterback, Elway produced a record 47 game-saving
drives, including six in the post-season. And when he was asked the
other day to rate his best moments other than the Super Bowl upset
of the Packers a year ago, he mentioned two drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `The Drive' in Cleveland is the first thing that pops
into my mind,'' he said, referring to winning the 1986 AFC title
game. ``That kind of put me on the map. And I went 98 yards to kick
a field goal to beat Houston in the first round of the playoffs.
`The Drive' in Cleveland was 98 yards too.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Elway and anybody else remembers those drives is
because the Broncos won those games _ the barometer he used in
rating his top three quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparing quarterbacks is like comparing apples and oranges,''
he said, ``because the circumstances that each quarterback has are
so different. But I think the bottom line is the guys who can
figure out ways to win, no matter what the circumstances or what
position they are in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at Dan Marino as being up there with his
numbers and what he has done; unfortunately he never has had a good
enough team to go all the way. I think Johnny Unitas kicked
everything off, a guy that won championships, and Roger Staubach
because he was my idol when I was young.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, surely, John Elway is an idol for so many others _ the
young who wish they could do what he does and the old who wish they
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything that sums up John's career,'' Shanahan
said Friday, ``it's that he puts the team first _ one of the
reasons he's not talking about retirement right now. He doesn't
want to lose focus of this football game _ the game is more
important than him and his retirement. He's an unselfish guy that
has meant everything to Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Just rename it Elway, Colorado.

CLINTON'S BUDGET INCLUDES NEW DOMESTIC PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 4th graf for additional information on projected budget
surpluses) (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will release a $1.766 trillion
federal budget blueprint for 2000 on Monday that proposes billions
of dollars in new spending while preaching fiscal conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget plan will ask Congress for substantial new
money for scores of domestic programs popular with liberal and
middle-class constituencies, from urban housing vouchers to new
classroom construction.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, taking advantage of surging federal tax receipts,
will also propose large spending increases for cherished Republican
priorities: the military, local police and small business.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan envisions a budget surplus of at least $76
billion for the current fiscal year, $117 billion for fiscal year
2000, and much larger surpluses stretching as far into the future
as government forecasters can see.
</P>
<P>
   The health of the U.S. economy and overflowing federal coffers
allow Clinton the luxury of indulging in large new ``investments''
in politically popular labor, education, health care and
environmental projects while cloaking himself in fiscal prudence by
proposing to use budget surpluses to pay down the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   But as has happened so often in the past 12 months of scandal
and impeachment, Clinton will dominate only half of the attention
of official Washington and the media on Monday. At the very moment
Clinton is unveiling his budget in an East Room ceremony, Monica
Lewinsky will be sitting down with a roomful of lawyers, senators
and House prosecutors in a hotel suite five blocks away to be
deposed in the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospects for Clinton's ambitious programs are uncertain
given Republican majorities in both houses of Congress and the ill
will on both sides as a result of the impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal for increased defense spending is likely to
win Republican support and in fact it may be increased. His plan to
provide tax credits for long-term medical care also has bipartisan
support. But many of the other spending programs are unlikely to
win Republican backing at a time when limits on federal spending
imposed as a result of the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997 remain
in effect.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton proposes to increase overall government spending
by $39 billion over this year's level, federal outlays as a
proportion of the U.S. economy will be at the lowest level since
1973, 19.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plan raises, but does not definitively answer, the
overriding economic question now before the Congress and the White
House _ how to adjust to a time of surplus after a generation of
seemingly intractable federal budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, all of which is subject to congressional approval, is
in effect a holding action until a long-term plan is negotiated to
shore up Social Security and Medicare, the crown jewels of
Democratic progressivism that are projected to run out of money
early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's budget is truly a historic document,'' Jack Lew,
director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said.
``The transition from an era of deficits to an era of surpluses has
changed so many of the issues and poses basic, fundamental choices.
What do you do in a time of fiscal well-being to ensure that you'll
have fiscal well-being far into the future?''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Clinton has announced a plan to ensure the solvency
of Social Security and Medicare well into the next century by
reserving 77 percent of any budget surpluses to shore up the
universal retirement and health-care entitlements. An additional 12
percent of the projected surpluses is being set aside under the
administration's plan for a new form of retirement account designed
to increase the nation's paltry personal savings rate.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union message, and now with his budget,
Clinton has seized the fiscal and political high ground, moving
into a policy vacuum created by a year of scandal and a Republican
failure so far to offer a coherent and compelling blueprint for
addressing the long-term problems of the nation's costliest
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget _ bound in volumes with black covers
symbolizing the ocean of black ink that the administration foresees
_ attempts to do large things in relatively small steps. Social
Security and Medicare will be rescued from future insolvency
without pain to current taxpayers or future beneficiaries in the
form of tax increases or reductions in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration economic policy-maker said that Clinton
would have preferred much larger increases in programs to help the
United States adapt to the high-technology future. But the fact of
a Republican-controlled Congress hungry for tax cuts has limited
the president's budgetary freedom of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a second-best world,'' said Gene Sperling, the president's
chief economic adviser, ``the reality of divided government is that
Clinton is able through a combination of hard negotiating and
fiscal discipline to achieve targeted increases in these areas
while proposing a fiscally disciplined budget.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sperling continued, ``We've learned there are two ways to score
a touchdown _ by throwing the Hail Mary or by throwing six 15-yard
passes to move the ball down the field. We've been successful in
putting forward an investing-in-people agenda by going in and
fighting for these programs one year at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools, cities, displaced workers, the environment and the
Pentagon will all receive sizable infusions of new money without
any broad tax increases. The single largest proposal to raise
revenue in the budget takes aim at Washington's favorite pair of
deep pockets: cigarette smokers and tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is proposing a 55-cents-a-pack increase on cigarettes to
raise $8 billion a year for the next five years. The tax increase
will be described as an effort to reduce smoking by teen-agers by
raising the price of cigarettes to almost $4 a pack, but the
revenues are not specifically earmarked for anti-smoking programs
or for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   That projected revenue will cover only a fraction of the $25.6
billion in new spending in the 2000 budget that Clinton has already
announced _ from $12 billion for the Pentagon to $10 million to
train American Indian teachers to serve in predominantly Indian
regions of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also proposing $20.6 billion in limited tax cuts over
the next five years to subsidize long-term care for the elderly and
disabled, build schoolrooms, develop fuel-efficient cars and
promote adult literacy.
</P>
<P>
   The public expresses broad support for such initiatives in White
House and public polls, but there is no assurance that any of them
will survive the Republican Congress, which is more interested in
cutting tax rates across the board than embarking on a New
Deal-style spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has tried to satisfy every special-interest
group except the middle-income taxpayer,'' said Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, who serves on the Senate Budget Committee. ``When
taxes are as high as they have ever been, it's time to let the
taxpayers keep some more of their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said that initial reaction to the president's State of
the Union message on Jan. 19 was favorable, even from many
Republicans. But as more details of Clinton's spending plans have
trickled out, a different picture emerges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gave that speech on Jan. 19, it looked like a pretty
middle-of-the-road position,'' Grassley said. ``But upon
reflection, what he's basically doing is just reverting to the
classic Democratic policy. Three or four years ago he declared the
era of big government is over. Well, the era of big government is
back.''

MADDEN WEAVES SELF-ANALYSIS WITH GAME-ANALYSIS
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS with new lede, fresh quotes from Summerall-Madden. ) 
(ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a life John Madden leads. The Fox football analyst revealed
these three new elements of his existence during Super Bowl XXXIII
on Sunday night:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I've never turned down a freebie in my life,'' he said, at
being offered a Denver Super Bowl champion shirt. ``Everything you
can wear or eat.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``All you can do is giggle,'' he said, as the Broncos
celebrated. ``I know the feeling. I've been there. All you can do
is walk around and giggle.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He often eats old bologna sandwiches, the kind that sit around
until he gets hungry. (As a visitor to his bus, I know this
assertion is credible.)
</P>
<P>
   These disclosures came during a game that never felt like a
Super Bowl. Still, Madden was his usual hyperkinetic self. He noted
how Denver's John Elway had to find the receiver Ed McCaffrey in
the second half; deftly described how Atlanta running back Jamal
Anderson runs to the outside, then cuts inside with power; and
showed in the first half how Atlanta's Tim Dwight uses a four-man,
hand-holding blocking wedge during kickoffs, offering fine
foresight into Dwight's 94-yard second-half kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   Madden's wittiest moment came in the pre-game show, when was
asked about the feud between Denver Coach Mike Shanahan and Atlanta
Coach Dan Reeves. ``Once they kick off, no one will remember it,''
he said. ``No one's saying, `My coach hates his coach, my coach
hates his coach,' and drops the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Summerall was stronger and more consistent in his
play-calling than in recent games. He was more engaged, more
attuned to what Madden said and more likely to identify a player
before describing what he did rather than calling it in the reverse
order. They always seemed to be on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   ``They squandered so many opportunities,'' Madden said of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missed opportunities will be one of the stories,''
Summerall said. ``The other will be Eugene Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a distraction,'' said Madden, ``but that's not why
they're losing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-game show, Fox discussed the arrest of Robinson on
Saturday night on a charge of soliciting an undercover police
officer for prostitution. Co-host James Brown reminded viewers that
Robinson was arrested, not convicted.
</P>
<P>
   While Madden and Summerall did their jobs in the manner we're
accustomed to hearing, Fox almost committed an unforgivable
technical faux pas. A first-half mechanical failure caused the
network to stay three seconds too long in a commercial for a film,
barely returning in time to see Elway throw an 80-yard touchdown to
Rod Smith. ``We almost didn't get back in time,'' said Summerall.
``And Atlanta didn't get back in time.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the Super Bowl is that a network cannot
elongate the game beyond the standard three to three and a half
hours. Not so the pre-game. To stage seven hours of pre-game
activities, as Fox did Sunday, is to invite the inevitable creative
question: Why? Is it possible to produce programming that is
delicious and nutritious that's more than twice as long as the
game? No.
</P>
<P>
   There were two eras in Fox's Pre-Game Epoch: from 11 a.m.-2 p.m.
and from 2-6 p.m., Eastern time. The cream of Section 1 was the
All-Madden, All-Millennium Team, a 90-minute nostalgia buff's
smorgasbord that was mostly terrific but would have benefited from
axing the sepia-toned re-creation of the launch of the NFL and a
faux match-up between the millennium team and the 1998
All-Maddenites.
</P>
<P>
   A more credible (and more humorous) match-up was Saturday
night's Tweety-Sylvester face-off on The Cartoon Network, called by
Madden and Summerall.
</P>
<P>
   Fox would have had a finer, shorter Section 2 had it been
confined to the best chatter from the pre-game voices and emotional
confrontations between (1) Fox's Cris Collinsworth and his former
Cincinnati teammate Stanley Wilson and (2) Fox's Terry Bradshaw and
former Cowboy Thomas (Hollywood) Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Collinsworth has hated Wilson since the running back was found
in a cocaine stupor on the eve of Super Bowl XXIII. Collinsworth
was filled with anger and the right questions: How did he find the
drugs? How could he fail the team? ``I felt like an insect, so
small, so useless, so humiliated,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Super Bowl XIII, Henderson riled Bradshaw by saying the
Pittsburgh quarterback couldn't spell cat. In Texas, Bradshaw found
a changed Henderson, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who has
shed the flash of his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was laying in jail watching a 13-inch TV when you were
inducted into the Hall of Fame,'' Henderson said. ``I said I wanted
to make amends.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest was insubstantial, including a tour of Miami by
Fox star Jason Priestley, Fox program promotions in the guise of
trivia questions from Fox stars (including one in her black
scanties) and a Howie Long-Matt Millen segment using 8- and
9-year-olds to illustrate the Denver and Atlanta defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The three-part ``Super Bowl Diaries'' purported to present a
backstage view of the Broncos and Falcons' preparations. ``See all
the things you weren't supposed to see,'' bleated one promotion.
Scandals on parade? Bosh! Dwight shopped for luggage, Terance
Mathis kissed his baby daughter, Denver owner Pat Bowlen lifted
weights, and Shanahan watched game film. Shocking.

   Jordan's King Hussein lies gravely ill in an American hospital.
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd can barely stand, and stumbles on the

SPORTS COLUMN: A COURAGEOUS DAVIS AND AN EMBARRASSED ROBINSON
</HEADLINE>
  ( Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to clarify, Robinson was charged with
soliciting an undercover officer for sex, NOT soliciting a
prostitute.)  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The hard part for Denver Broncos running back Terrell
Davis on Sunday night in Super Bowl XXXIII, a game won in
convincing fashion over the Atlanta Falcons, 34-19, was making a
hard cut inside. Because that was when Davis' groin, injured last
week and kept a secret by Davis and the team, seemed to hurt most.
Still, he played on, and played hard, and ran with the kind of
passion he always does.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part for Atlanta safety Eugene Robinson was just
walking onto the field. When he did for warm-ups, his stomach was
tight, and his heart was still sick from being arrested Saturday
night on a charge of soliciting sex from an undercover police
officer. It was the kind of moment that a player would not wish on
his worst enemy _ an embarrassing arrest with the world watching.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Robinson are key players for their teams. Davis is a
true big-game performer and Robinson the skilled quarterback of the
Atlanta secondary. On this night, their performances weren't up to
their superhuman standards. Yet they were major factors, though for
completely different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Though he gained 102 yards on 25 carries, Davis' rushing yards
were well below his post-season average, mainly because of his
groin injury. But he was a great decoy at times, and his injury
meant more carries for fullback Howard Griffith, who set a career
high with two touchdown runs.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had a difficult Saturday night because of his arrest,
and then in Sunday night's game he gave up an 80-yard pass play to
wide receiver Rod Smith, a play that may have assured Robinson a
place in Super Bowl infamy. That play gave Denver a 17-3 lead early
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Broncos beat Green Bay with an impressive offense.
This year they did it mostly with defense. The Falcons had gone
past midfield a total of six times after three quarters, but got
just two Morten Andersen field goals of 32 and 28 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler had a terrible night, throwing three
interceptions, the most crucial coming at the end of the third
quarter after a tipped pass landed in the hands of cornerback
Darrien Gordon, who had two picks. Griffith then scored on a 1-yard
run.
</P>
<P>
   That touchdown killed the Falcons, who then trailed, 24-6, early
in the fourth quarter. It killed the hopes of Atlanta's Dan Reeves,
who became the third coach in history to lose four Super Bowls,
joining Bud Grant of Minnesota and Marv Levy of Buffalo. This Super
Bowl loss may be more painful than Reeves' others, because it was
to the team that fired him after the 1992 season.
</P>
<P>
   For Davis and Robinson, they experienced the highs and lows of a
championship game. The world watches you perform, and fans don't
care if Davis' groin hurts so much it is sometimes painful just to
walk. They don't care if Robinson made one of the dumbest mistakes
of his life, being out the night before the Super Bowl, in a Miami
neighborhood known for its prostitution and drug sales, when he
should have been in bed sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the first time Davis had to deal with a physical
ailment during the Super Bowl. Last year in Super Bowl XXXII, Davis
forgot to take his migraine headache medication and missed almost a
quarter of the game after getting severe headaches. Davis
recovered, however, to rush for 157 yards and three touchdowns and
was named the game's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how Davis injured his groin, but he practiced in
pain for most of the week. Teammates estimated he was at 80 percent
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   His injury was so bad that on Wednesday, Davis was supposed to
appear at an award ceremony for the season's most valuable player,
given to Minnesota quarterback Randall Cunningham. Davis was a
nominee, but he couldn't make it because he needed treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In the game, the groin injury definitely slowed Davis. He was
quick, but not Davis quick. At times, the Broncos used Davis as a
decoy, lining him up at wide receiver. Rarely was the pass thrown
his way. It was a way of keeping Davis in the game and making the
Falcons account for him. It is always about chess in this sport.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the definitive sign that something was wrong. Davis is
one of the most productive post-season runners ever. He had rushed
for 148.3 yards per post-season game, a startling 5.8 yards a
carry, both numbers ranking him tops in National Football League
playoff history. Yet when the Broncos had first-and-goal at the
Atlanta 1-yard line, it was not Davis who got the call, but
Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Griffith? It's easy to understand if his name is not in
your mental Rolodex. Griffith had four carries in all of the
regular season _ none in the playoffs _ and no pass receptions all
year. Yet Sunday night he had four carries and a catch.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Davis gets that ball in that crucial goal-line
situation. No question. And a healthy Davis does not spend so much
time running pass patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Deciphering how Robinson's problems affected him is much harder
to do. There is no question that he and the entire Atlanta
organization were devastated by the arrest, since Robinson, who won
a civic award given to players of high moral character the same
night that he allegedly propositioned a police officer for oral
sex, is considered one of the best people in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson stayed up much of the night, talking to his wife, Gia,
and then teammates. At the most, Robinson got several hours of
sleep. The day of the game, Reeves made an emotional speech to the
team, emphasizing that the Falcons are a family and that what
happened to Robinson should not serve as a distraction. But just
giving that speech proves it became a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Was Robinson affected? No one will truly ever know. When
Robinson was beaten deep by Smith and later missed a tackle on
Davis, was it because Smith was simply faster and Davis great, or
because Robinson's mind was not focused on football?
</P>
<P>
   Even if Robinson is innocent, just being out at that time, in
that neighborhood, the night before the Super Bowl, was a truly
selfish act.
</P>
<P>
   This game will be remembered for John Elway's getting his second
ring, and Denver Coach Mike Shanahan's establishing himself as one
of the best coaches ever.
</P>
<P>
   Davis won't appear in many headlines, but he played with
courage. Robinson will be one of the most talked about Super Bowl
players ever, though not for the reasons he would have liked.

<TEXT>
<P>
   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan _ gravely ill _ is back in America
fighting his fourth, and many fear, final bout with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia _ plump to the point of obesity _ can
scarcely stand, and stumbles on the simplest sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat _ he of the shaking hand and trembling lip _
suffers ever more from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal
air crash.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad of Syria, who suffered a heart problem as
far back as 1983, has already lost his favorite son, Basil, in a
road accident.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has never _ not once in all his
18 years in power _ appointed a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Even to mention the word ``succession'' in public provokes a
familiar gesture by friends in the Middle East; their eyes move
ever so carefully over their shoulders. It is the unspoken crisis,
the great unmentionable, a subject heavy enough to poison any
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But it is real. And we in the West, of course, accept this odd,
cantankerous, dangerous system of inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Not once have we ever encouraged a democratic state in the
Middle East, one which would allow Arab citizens to choose their
own leaders. Because we like dictatorships. We know how to do
business with the kings and generals _ how to sell them our tanks
and fighter-bombers and missiles _ unless they disobey us, like
Gamal Nasser and Muammar Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bizarre feature of our present relations with the Arab
world that Saddam is the only leader whose overthrow President Bill
Clinton has called for in the name of ``democracy,'' demanding that
the Iraqis should have a government that ``represents its people
and respects them.''
</P>
<P>
   A likely tale. How many other Arab governments, for heaven's
sake _ with their secret police and their torture chambers _
``represent'' their people? And how many of them has President
Clinton sought to depose? Not one.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families.
</P>
<P>
   True, we were happy to see King Farouk booted out of Egypt and
King Idris out of Libya (we liked Qaddafi then) and to depose the
Sultan of Oman in favor of his public-school son. But we want
strong leaders who will be loyal to us. Let them have human rights,
we say. But we do not want democracy in their countries (which
means, of course, that there will be no human rights).
</P>
<P>
   And no choice for their people. At least King Hussein had the
wisdom and humility to discuss death with his people when he first
learned he had cancer. But the king _ whose kingdom falls into the
category of liberal amid the other xenophobic states of the region
_ never bothered to consult his citizens about their future leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians were given no chance to decide whom they wished to
rule them. His Majesty ordained that it would be his son Abdullah,
that power would be kept in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone expect anything else? It takes a brave Jordanian to
call for a real constitutional monarchy. Indeed, the only man who
consistently does just that, Leith Shubeilat, finds himself
frequently inside Amman's state security prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the titans of the Middle East have planned
their succession.
</P>
<P>
   President Assad _ whose energy still stuns the diplomats who sit
through his six-hour conversations _ has groomed his son Bashar, an
ophthalmologist by profession but an increasingly public
personality with an enthusiasm for computer technology, to follow
in his steps.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taken at face value, Syria's constitution provides for a
democratic system of succession, but Assad controls military,
political, and legislative power; he can dissolve governments and
assemblies; he is secretary-general of the Baath party, commander
in chief of the armed forces. Presumably, Bashar Assad will one day
do the same.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about Arafat? He has no obvious successor and no real
constitutional framework to create one. He has turned his back on
the democracy of the Palestinian assembly and survives by cronyism,
bribes and 13 different security services _ the latter in
cooperation with the CIA and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   So the Palestinians cannot choose their successor. But be sure
that the Israelis already have someone in mind to take over
``Palestine'' when Arafat leaves us.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, direct succession suggests a struggle to come
among the defense minister, Prince Sultan, Prince Naif and Crown
Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, aware of Abdullah's growing criticism and dislike of
the American presence in the Gulf _ he is said to have told U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen that not only could the United
States not use Saudi air bases to bomb Iraq, but that America might
have to leave those air bases altogether _ might favor Prince
Sultan.
</P>
<P>
   His son, it should be noted, is the influential Saudi ambassador
to the U.S., Prince Bandar, who in 1990 was reported in Washington
to be almost as powerful in President George Bush's office as the
secretary of state, James Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The result of our support for all these potentates is regularly
distorted by their Western supporters in Washington, London and,
less obviously, Paris. If we demand full democracy for these
nations, we are told, the Islamists will try to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Cannot we understand, our diplomats point out, that ``whatever
their failings'' (another of my favorite expressions in the Middle
East), these ``friends of the West'' are fighting Islamic
fundamentalism?
</P>
<P>
   So ``Islamic fundamentalism'' becomes the only real opposition
to the Arab governments. We support those undemocratic countries in
their battle against ``fundamentalist terror'' _ and shore up their
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that why we backed Saddam Hussein so generously during
his eight-year aggression against Iran? Because he was preventing
``fundamentalism?''
</P>
<P>
   So who will we put in Saddam's place? My guess is that the
Americans are still looking for a good old-fashioned Iraqi
brigadier-general, a military man who knows how to keep his tribes
in order.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it would have to be a powerful man, someone who
did not allow dissent to rock the regime, someone with a powerful
security service and a family that might provide a successor.
Someone, in fact, just like Saddam.  &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan _ gravely ill _ is back in America
fighting his fourth, and many fear, final bout with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia _ plump to the point of obesity _ can
scarcely stand, and stumbles on the simplest sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat _ he of the shaking hand and trembling lip _
suffers ever more from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal
air crash.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad of Syria, who suffered a heart problem as
far back as 1983, has already lost his favorite son, Basil, in a
road accident.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has never _ not once in all his
18 years in power _ appointed a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Even to mention the word ``succession'' in public provokes a
familiar gesture by friends in the Middle East; their eyes move
ever so carefully over their shoulders. It is the unspoken crisis,
the great unmentionable, a subject heavy enough to poison any
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But it is real. And we in the West, of course, accept this odd,
cantankerous, dangerous system of inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Not once have we ever encouraged a democratic state in the
Middle East, one which would allow Arab citizens to choose their
own leaders. Because we like dictatorships. We know how to do
business with the kings and generals _ how to sell them our tanks
and fighter-bombers and missiles _ unless they disobey us, like
Gamal Nasser and Muammar Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bizarre feature of our present relations with the Arab
world that Saddam is the only leader whose overthrow President Bill
Clinton has called for in the name of ``democracy,'' demanding that
the Iraqis should have a government that ``represents its people
and respects them.''
</P>
<P>
   A likely tale. How many other Arab governments, for heaven's
sake _ with their secret police and their torture chambers _
``represent'' their people? And how many of them has President
Clinton sought to depose? Not one.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families.
</P>
<P>
   True, we were happy to see King Farouk booted out of Egypt and
King Idris out of Libya (we liked Qaddafi then) and to depose the
Sultan of Oman in favor of his public-school son. But we want
strong leaders who will be loyal to us. Let them have human rights,
we say. But we do not want democracy in their countries (which
means, of course, that there will be no human rights).
</P>
<P>
   And no choice for their people. At least King Hussein had the
wisdom and humility to discuss death with his people when he first
learned he had cancer. But the king _ whose kingdom falls into the
category of liberal amid the other xenophobic states of the region
_ never bothered to consult his citizens about their future leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians were given no chance to decide whom they wished to
rule them. His Majesty ordained that it would be his son Abdullah,
that power would be kept in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone expect anything else? It takes a brave Jordanian to
call for a real constitutional monarchy. Indeed, the only man who
consistently does just that, Leith Shubeilat, finds himself
frequently inside Amman's state security prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the titans of the Middle East have planned
their succession.
</P>
<P>
   President Assad _ whose energy still stuns the diplomats who sit
through his six-hour conversations _ has groomed his son Bashar, an
ophthalmologist by profession but an increasingly public
personality with an enthusiasm for computer technology, to follow
in his steps.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taken at face value, Syria's constitution provides for a
democratic system of succession, but Assad controls military,
political, and legislative power; he can dissolve governments and
assemblies; he is secretary-general of the Baath party, commander
in chief of the armed forces. Presumably, Bashar Assad will one day
do the same.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about Arafat? He has no obvious successor and no real
constitutional framework to create one. He has turned his back on
the democracy of the Palestinian assembly and survives by cronyism,
bribes and 13 different security services _ the latter in
cooperation with the CIA and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   So the Palestinians cannot choose their successor. But be sure
that the Israelis already have someone in mind to take over
``Palestine'' when Arafat leaves us.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, direct succession suggests a struggle to come
among the defense minister, Prince Sultan, Prince Naif and Crown
Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, aware of Abdullah's growing criticism and dislike of
the American presence in the Gulf _ he is said to have told U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen that not only could the United
States not use Saudi air bases to bomb Iraq, but that America might
have to leave those air bases altogether _ might favor Prince
Sultan.
</P>
<P>
   His son, it should be noted, is the influential Saudi ambassador
to the U.S., Prince Bandar, who in 1990 was reported in Washington
to be almost as powerful in President George Bush's office as the
secretary of state, James Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The result of our support for all these potentates is regularly
distorted by their Western supporters in Washington, London and,
less obviously, Paris. If we demand full democracy for these
nations, we are told, the Islamists will try to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Cannot we understand, our diplomats point out, that ``whatever
their failings'' (another of my favorite expressions in the Middle
East), these ``friends of the West'' are fighting Islamic
fundamentalism?
</P>
<P>
   So ``Islamic fundamentalism'' becomes the only real opposition
to the Arab governments. We support those undemocratic countries in
their battle against ``fundamentalist terror'' _ and shore up their
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that why we backed Saddam Hussein so generously during
his eight-year aggression against Iran? Because he was preventing
``fundamentalism?''
</P>
<P>
   So who will we put in Saddam's place? My guess is that the
Americans are still looking for a good old-fashioned Iraqi
brigadier-general, a military man who knows how to keep his tribes
in order.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it would have to be a powerful man, someone who
did not allow dissent to rock the regime, someone with a powerful
security service and a family that might provide a successor.
Someone, in fact, just like Saddam.  &LR;  &QL;

HISTORY REPEATS: SHARPE TALKS, DOESN'T WALK
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ First there was Fred ``The Hammer'' Williamson. Then
there was Thomas ``Hollywood'' Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday it was Shannon ``Fill in your joke here'' Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, the Broncos' tight end, talked the talk all during Super
Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   But like Williamson and Henderson before him, Sharpe didn't walk
the walk.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe was knocked out of the game in the first quarter on a
hard hit by Atlanta Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan. The series of
events dripped with irony. It was Buchanan who had been the subject
of most of Sharpe's barbs during the week. And it was NFL Films
that had planted a wireless microphone on Sharpe, hoping the
trash-talking Sharpe would provide some sounds of the game.
</P>
<P>
   During the week leading up to Super Bowl I, Williamson, a Chiefs
defensive back, boasted that he would knock some Packers out of the
game with a forearm shiver he called ``The Hammer.'' Williamson
suffered a concussion early in the game while trying to make a
tackle and did not finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   During the week leading up to Super Bowl XIII, Henderson, a
Cowboys linebacker, questioned the smarts of Steelers quarterback
Terry Bradshaw, saying that Bradshaw couldn't spell the word
``cat'' if you spotted him the ``c'' and the ``a.'' Bradshaw's
education proved to be just fine as he ended up being the MVP.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharpe-less game didn't seem to bother Falcons fans. In
fact, Sharpe had been booed during the pregame player
introductions. Those same fans cheered when Sharpe limped off the
field with his knee injury. Sharpe, no doubt, had made many enemies
with all of the talk during last week. LOCAL BOY SHINES
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Hills graduate Byron Chamberlain was playing in his
second Super Bowl with the Broncos, but saw his first action in the
big game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, a tight end, was playing in place of the injured
Sharpe. Chamberlain began the day by catching a 13-yard pass on the
third play of the second quarter. Three plays later, Chamberlain
caught a 4-yard pass on third-and-one to keep alive a Broncos drive
that ended with a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain finished with three receptions for 29 yards, and he
also recovered two onsides kicks. ORANGE CRUSH
</P>
<P>
   The difference for the Broncos was the way their defense played
when the Falcons crossed midfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons drove inside the Broncos' 30-yard line five times
during the game's first 45 minutes. They ran 21 plays for 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' run defense stuffed Falcons running back Jamal
Anderson twice on third-and-one, and once on fourth-and-one.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, on three consecutive Falcons possessions,
the Broncos' pass defense forced turnovers. Cornerback Darrien
Gordon had two interceptions, including one in the end zone. And
cornerback Darrius Johnson had an interception. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   John Elway's 80-yard touchdown pass to Rod Smith tied for the
second-longest play from scrimmage in Super Bowl history. In Super
Bowl XXXI, Green Bay's Brett Favre completed an 81-yard touchdown
pass to Antonio Freeman. ... Elway's first-quarter interception was
the eighth of his career in Super Bowl play, a league record.
Before Sunday, Elway shared the record of seven Super Bowl
interceptions with Jim Kelly (Buffalo) and Craig Morton (Denver and
Dallas). ... The Broncos had 180 yards of interception return
yardage, a Super Bowl record. With two interceptions, Gordon
accounted for 108 of those yards, also a Super Bowl record.

ROBINSON EXPLAINS ARREST TO FAMILY, TEAMMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI &UR;  &LR; _ Atlanta Falcons safety Eugene Robinson was arrested
Saturday night on a charge that he solicited an undercover police
officer for sex, according to police. Robinson is accused of
offering the officer $40 for oral sex, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Robinson had been awarded the Bart Starr
Award, given to the player with outstanding moral character by the
religious group Athletes in Action.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons &UR;  &LR; Coach Dan Reeves cleared Robinson to play in the Super
Bowl on Sunday night, saying in a television interview: ``I love
Eugene unconditionally. As far as I'm concerned, and as far as the
league is concerned, he can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who was burned for an 80-yard touchdown with 4:54 left
in the first half, declined to comment before the game and the
Falcons said in a statement that the matter was between Robinson
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had to explain to his wife, Gia, the details of his
arrest, said his teammate Henri Crockett. Then, Crockett said,
Robinson spoke to a small group of teammates late Saturday night,
staying up talking until 4 a.m. Robinson spoke to more teammates
early Sunday morning, Crockett said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Falcons players remained supportive. ``I think there
is more to this story than meets the eye,'' Crockett said. ``Eugene
is such a good person. I don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has been involved in numerous charities, and often
talks about being a born-again Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Staying in Shape
</P>
<P>
   Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan believes the main reason his team
was able to return to the Super Bowl for the second consecutive
season was the off-season conditioning program that many players
attended.
</P>
<P>
   This past off-season's program attracted the highest number of
Broncos in club history, and it not only made them stronger,
Shanahan believes, but also helped them bond.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another factor, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay them $60 a day,'' Shanahan said, ``and you add that up
and there's $240 a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Namath's Stage Is Gone
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after the guarantee that shocked the sports world,
Joe Namath discovered that the building where he made the statement
isn't there anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A television station wanted Namath to revisit the Miami Springs
Villas hotel, where the Miami Touchdown Club had held a dinner
three nights before Super Bowl III. When Namath was on the stage
that night, a heckler began belittling the Jets, who were big
underdogs to the Baltimore Colts.

   Mathis Speaks His Mind &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta wide receiver Terance Mathis, a former Jet, said
confessing about his alcohol problems last week had a cleansing
effect on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bold enough and courageous enough to talk about my
private life,'' he said. ``The thing is, a lot of people don't get
a chance to talk about their private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He is hoping that his admission will embolden others to seek
help for their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would love to go to their jobs and say, `Well, I have a
drinking problem, or I have a drug addiction, or I have this kind
of problem.' But they don't do it because they're scared of losing
their job or of what people think. I'm not afraid of what people
think. I'm not afraid of losing my job. The reason I did it was so
I can do my job better and live my life better.''

   A Seeing-Eye Beard

<P>
   Falcons offensive tackle Bob Whitfield is legally blind in his
right eye, but he has lived with the problem much of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I close my left eye, I won't see any of you,'' he said last
week. ``But I hear you. I just turn my head, if I need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield joked that his growing a goatee recently has helped
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come within two feet of me, I can feel you,'' he said.
``It's like a little force field around me. Like little antennas
that start coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   A Real Fake Field &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl has gotten so sophisticated that Sunday's playing
field at Pro Player Stadium was brought in especially for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   In early January,100,000 square feet of grass _ something called
stabilized turf, a mix of artificial turf and Bermuda grass _ was
delivered to the playing site, then steamrolled into place.
</P>
<P>
   The turf was bought from a sod farm owned by the professional
golfer Greg Norman's company based in Jupiter, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Early in February, the turf will be ripped up and peddled to
another stadium, because the Florida Marlins, who also use the
stadium, need a larger playing field.
</P>
<P>
   What may seem like a dangerous experiment by the NFL received
the enthusiastic blessing of George Toma, the renowned
groundskeeper for the first 31 Super Bowls who is worked this year
with his son, Chip Toma, now the league's head groundskeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely and truly love the concept,'' said the elder Toma,
who noted that Pro Player Stadium needed a new surface after heavy
December rains.
</P>
<P>
   Toma worried about rain Sunday, especially since the stage for
the halftime show weighed 22 tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the new great thing in athletic fields,'' said
David Barnes, general manager of the Greg Norman Turf Co. ``The
player has the feel of natural, but the field has the strength of
artificial.''
</P>
<P>
   Coin Almost Tossed
</P>
<P>
   Jim Steeg, the NFL's vice president for special events, provides
the commemorative coins used yearly in the Super Bowl coin toss.
One year, Super Bowl XXI Steeg believes, he forgot the coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night before the game, I sit down and get everything
organized, put everything I've got to bring in a stack, get it all
put together,'' he said. ``I put the coins down on the floor. I
must have kicked them underneath my desk. So about an hour and a
half before kickoff _ NBC was doing the game _ they said: `Where is
the coin? We want to shoot it so we've got a sample of it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nowhere around. I had left it back at the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   A panicked telephone call to hotel security followed, and the
coins arrived at the game 15 minutes before kickoff.

`SHE'S ALL THAT' AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR NO. 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Romantic comedy ``She's All That'' proved a
potent antidote to Super Bowl fever as it dominated at the nation's
multiplexes with an estimated $17 million at 2,222 theaters during
the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's high school campus tale, starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
and Rachel Leigh Cook in an updated version of ``Pygmalion'' was
the only new movie released this weekend in the face of the frenzy
over the Super Bowl XXXIII telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen-age girls are the only audience that doesn't care about
the Super Bowl and their interest in this movie was through the
roof,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
tracking service.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That,'' which cost a relatively inexpensive $18
million to produce, could take in $40 million by the end of its
run, Bucksbaum predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right film at the right time,'' said film analyst
Arthur Rockwell. ``It might not have done this level of business on
an ordinary weekend. But it was perfect counterprogramming against
the Super Bowl demographics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' followed in the footsteps of ``Varsity
Blues'' in tapping into the massive audience for teen movies.
``It's become a very successful formula _ you get a film about high
school-age kids with romance, comedy and a soundtrack,'' Bucksbaum
said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's third weekend of ``Varsity Blues'' finished a
distant second with $6.3 million at 2,364 theaters, giving the $15
million project an impressive $39.4 million in 17 days. ``Studios
have figured out that teen comedies can be a very lucrative
business if they play it right,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's sixth weekend of ``Patch Adams'' came in a close
third with $6.2 million at 2,880 sites for an overall gross of
about $117 million. Bucksbaum noted that box office trackers
believe final figures for the weekend for most films could change
significantly from estimates, depending on the impact of the Denver
Broncos' 34-19 Super Bowl win over the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``A Civil Action,'' in its fourth weekend of wide
release, followed in fourth with $5 million at 2,069 theaters to go
past $47 million. Miramax's eighth weekend of ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' continuing to benefit from its growing array of critics'
awards, finished a solid fifth with $4 million at 759 sites for the
second-best per-screen average after ``She's All That'' among the
top 10 entries.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's ``The Thin Red Line'' came in sixth with $3.8
million at 1,657 theaters as the much-acclaimed war drama fell
sharply in its third weekend of wide release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Line,'' which has taken in $27 million, will need to receive
multiple Academy Award nominations Feb. 9 to keep from vanishing by
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday holdovers took the next three slots, led by Sony's sixth
weekend of ``Stepmom'' with $3.6 million at 2,358 theaters to go
past $83 million overall, followed by Warner Bros.' seventh weekend
of ``You've Got Mail'' with $3.1 million at 2,096 sites and
DreamWorks SKG's seventh weekend of ``The Prince of Egypt'' with $3
million at 1,925 locations. MGM's third weekend of ``At First
Sight'' continued to disappoint with $2.8 million at 1,838
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Overall grosses amounted to about $72 million, down 22 percent
from the same weekend a year ago when the seventh weekend of
``Titanic'' took in $25.9 million to push its total to $308.1
million _ just over half of its final take of $601 million.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's opening of ``Payback'' with Mel Gibson should lead
the box office next weekend. Disney will re-launch ``Rushmore,'' a
critically acclaimed high school comedy with Bill Murray that
played for a week in December in limited release.

A REEVES SCORECARD: MIRACLES EXCEED THE LOSSES
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS with new lead to refocus on Reeves, fresh quotes
throughout.) 
 (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a Super Bowl game that was part morality play, part
love triangle, Dan Reeves was once again the odd man out. For the
fourth time in his illustrious coaching career, Reeves took his
team to the mountaintop only to be denied. The National Football
League's Sisyphus pushed his stone to the pinnacle only to have it
roll back down.
</P>
<P>
   Now 55 years old and with a serious medical condition, Reeves
might not have a chance for another push. Indeed, when Howard
Griffith rumbled into the end zone to give Denver a 24-6
fourth-quarter lead, and ultimately a 34-19 Denver victory, Reeves
was left to face at least one defining truth of his 18-year career:
He couldn't win a Super Bowl with the Broncos and now he couldn't
beat them.
</P>
<P>
   This fourth Super Bowl defeat would have been devastating for
Reeves were it not for a pair of miracles: the organizational
miracle that made the Falcons an unlikely participant in the Super
Bowl, and a more astounding medical miracle that allowed Reeves to
coach them on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves had open heart surgery seven weeks ago, and the players
wondered if their coach would be back in time to enjoy one of the
most remarkable rebuilding jobs in NFL history. On this night of
their lopsided loss the ``no-one-expected-us-to-be- here''
reasoning was small consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, while the Falcons were enjoying the feeling of
beating the Minnesota Vikings in the National Conference
championship game, Reeves had told his team: `` `Remember that
feeling because, I tell you, if you don't beat Denver, it is going
to be the worst feeling you have ever had in your life when you end
up on the short end of the stick in the Super Bowl.'
</P>
<P>
   ``As high as it is to get to this game,'' Reeves said, ``it is
the lowest of lows as far as losing is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what this victory meant to Broncos Coach Mike
Shanahan or what the loss means to Reeves in regard to the ties
that bind them and the history that tore them apart. The
connections are deep and complex. Reeves brought quarterbacl John
Elway to Denver in 1983 when he was the head coach, then built an
empire around him. A year later, Reeves hired Shanahan as an
assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, Reeves fired Shanahan, claiming that Shanahan and
Elway had conspired behind his back to ignore his game plans by
scripting their own. A year later Reeves was fired, and he accused
Elway of having plotted a revolt. Elway called Reeves a bully, and
referred to their 10 years together as hell. Reeves called Elway a
crybaby.
</P>
<P>
   Had Reeves won Sunday night with the sort of rock-`em-sock-`em
approach for which he is known, perhaps he could have claimed a
measure of vindication. As it was, Denver crushed Atlanta with a
dose of Reeves' hard-hitting medicine then faked the Falcons out of
their shoes with a nimble mix of pass and run.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the week, the Reeves-Elway-Shanahan saga was
submerged beneath a side show performed by Shannon Sharpe, the
Broncos tight end, and Ray Buchanan, the Falcons defensive back.
The pair provided comic relief with caustic remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In an appropriate twist, each player was put in his place
Sunday. Buchanan put Sharpe out of the game with a hard hit to the
knee in the first quarter. Ed McCaffrey put Buchanan in his place
with reception after reception _ five catches for 72 yards in all _
that kept the entire Atlanta secondary on its heels.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the final most hurtful incident for Reeves this weekend
was an apparent betrayal that took place off the field and involved
his own team. Reeves had complained that his Achilles heel in
Denver and last season in Atlanta was the lack of defense. He cured
that deficiency by bringing in safety Eugene Robinson to anchor a
secondary and provide leadership for a team that was on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had challenged his team and the media throughout the
season and all week by asking: ``Why can't we win? Why not us?'' He
was so convincing that Atlanta seemed primed to pull off an upset
and finalize a tremendous season.
</P>
<P>
   Then news came early Sunday morning that Robinson had been
arrested for soliciting sex from an undercover police officer. In
the third quarter Robinson was beaten by Rod Smith on an 80-yard
touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's game Reeves, looking weary but far from
distraught, handled the Robinson questions honestly and
diplomatically. ``We talked about whether he would play or not and
I felt that as long he was mentally and physically into it, he
could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course that wasn't the issue and Reeves knew it. The issue
was commitment, judgment, trust, timing. In a game that means so
much, a game in which the outcome rests on such a fragile precipice
that the slightest upheaval can tip the balance, Robinson had
betrayed a trust.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves simply said, ``Little things make a big difference in any
game. It didn't help us.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Reeves left and headed for the locker room. Along the
way, Falcons and Broncos would meet later on, party and talk about
the battle the way friends do. Reeves would break no bread with
Shanahan and Elway. He hadn't shaken hands with Shanahan _ too much
confusion on the field. And anyway, what's a handshake. The bad
feelings may only be an inch wide on the surface but they run miles
deeper. Things have been said, feelings hurt and frankly a lopsided
defeat doesn't help. ``I feel good for some of those guys over
there,'' Reeves said referring to the Denver locker room. ``But I
feel worse for me than I feel good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth time in four tries, he had been denied. This time
though, Reeves had been given the gift of life by virtue of a
successful operation. This game used to be his life, the Super Bowl
the crowning achievement. In the last two months Reeves learned the
hard way that life is the prize. The Super Bowl pales in
comparison.

MAN FINALLY FINDS HOME IN TUNNEL OF LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For much of the past decade, whenever I heard a
heart-warming story about a program lifting people out of poverty
and homelessness, the skeptic in me would think of John Kovacs. I
had once written a story like that about him, and then he had
fallen back down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when I got to know him, John was 48 years old and had
been living for 15 years in the long railroad tunnel underneath
Riverside Park. On days when he did not have vodka for breakfast,
he did odd jobs to get food for himself and the dog and 15 cats
that lived with him in a concrete bunker.
</P>
<P>
   But a year later he signed up for a new life: a program to turn
the ``homeless into homesteaders,'' run on a farm near Syracuse by
a nonprofit group called the Earthwise Education Center. When he
walked out of the tunnel with his things, I quoted him promising to
work hard and vowing, ``I ain't coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   John and his dog were soon on local and national television.
Sally Jessy Raphael asked him questions like, ``Animals are very
important to people who live under the earth, right?'' He had
agents on two coasts fielding offers from film producers and
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   But six months later, he was back in the tunnel and angry about
life again. He couldn't stand the Earthwise program's communal
living arrangements and uplifting lectures about about the ``four
Cs'' _ communication, consideration, cooperation, contribution. As
John explained his hostility: ``I do things my way. I really wasn't
liked.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years later, in 1994, he vowed again to get out of
the tunnel. He moved in with a middle-aged woman who had come to
know him while walking her dog in Riverside Park. I met them one
day and was tempted to write another chapter of his story, but they
didn't want any publicity, and I doubted John would stay long
anyway. Wasn't there a reason he had been alone in a tunnel for a
third of his life?
</P>
<P>
   But I was wrong, as I discovered last week when I saw John for
the first time in five years. He is still involved with that same
girlfriend, and for three years he has been living in his own place
near Riverside Park. He invited me into his small studio apartment,
which he has furnished himself and pays for by doing maintenance
work in the building and another one nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a roof over my head,'' he said. ``I eat every day and
buy food for the three cats. I've stopped drinking. I don't smoke
much.'' The apartment was filled with furniture, a television and
stereo, ceramic figurines of animals, an exercise poster and stacks
of magazines like Field and Stream. There were photographs of four
Central American children being sponsored by his donations to a
charity program.
</P>
<P>
   He showed me pictures of his girlfriend and him at her country
house, and there was a flash of the old anger when he described a
dispute they were having with their neighbors in the country. But
he got over it quickly. At 56, he seemed healthier and happier than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   We took a walk down to the tunnel and peered in through the gate
near 86th Street, now sealed. He looked into the darkness and
pointed out the graffiti on the walls close to his old home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always told you I could get out of there, and I did,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we used to sit down there in the bunker,'' I said, ``I
never thought I'd be listening to you talk about the problems at
your country home. I went to work all those mornings you were
drinking down here, and now you're the only one of us with a place
in the country. How did this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   John smiled and declined to make sense of life's vicissitudes.
But he did offer a succinct explanation for what had turned him
around, and it had nothing to do with any rehabilitation program or
lecture about the four Cs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met a woman,'' he said. ``I was living like a bum, and I met
this woman in the park, and I fell in love for the first time since
I was a teen-ager. I knew I couldn't go out with her unless I got
some money and changed my life. Let's face it. You can't bring a
woman down to a tunnel.''

HISTORY REPEATS: SHARPE TALKS, DOESN'T WALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ First there was Fred ``The Hammer'' Williamson. Then
there was Thomas ``Hollywood'' Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday it was Shannon ``Fill in your joke here'' Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, the Broncos' tight end, talked the talk all during Super
Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   But like Williamson and Henderson before him, Sharpe didn't walk
the walk.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe was knocked out of the game in the first quarter on a
hard hit by Atlanta Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan. The series of
events dripped with irony. It was Buchanan who had been the subject
of most of Sharpe's barbs during the week. And it was NFL Films
that had planted a wireless microphone on Sharpe, hoping the
trash-talking Sharpe would provide some sounds of the game.
</P>
<P>
   During the week leading up to Super Bowl I, Williamson, a Chiefs
defensive back, boasted that he would knock some Packers out of the
game with a forearm shiver he called ``The Hammer.'' Williamson
suffered a concussion early in the game while trying to make a
tackle and did not finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   During the week leading up to Super Bowl XIII, Henderson, a
Cowboys linebacker, questioned the smarts of Steelers quarterback

   Eastern Hills graduate Byron Chamberlain was playing in his
second Super Bowl with the Broncos, but saw his first action in the
big game yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, a tight end, was playing in place of the injured
Sharpe. Chamberlain began the day by catching a 13-yard pass on the
third play of the second quarter. Three plays later, Chamberlain
caught a 4-yard pass on third-and-one to keep alive a Broncos drive
that ended with a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain finished with three receptions for 29 yards, and he
also recovered two onsides kicks.
ORANGE CRUSH
</P>
<P>
   The difference for the Broncos yesterday was the way their
defense played when the Falcons crossed midfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons drove inside the Broncos' 30-yard line five times
during the game's first 45 minutes. They ran 21 plays for 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' run defense stuffed Falcons running back Jamal
Anderson twice on third-and-one, and once on fourth-and-one.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, on three consecutive Falcons possessions,
the Broncos' pass defense forced turnovers. Cornerback Darrien
Gordon had two interceptions, including one in the end zone. And
cornerback Darrius Johnson had an interception.

   John Elway's 80-yard touchdown pass to Rod Smith tied for the
second-longest play from scrimmage in Super Bowl history. In Super
Bowl XXXI, Green Bay's Brett Favre completed an 81-yard touchdown
pass to Antonio Freeman. ... Elway's first-quarter interception was
the eighth of his career in Super Bowl play, a league record.
Before yesterday, Elway shared the record of seven Super Bowl
interceptions with Jim Kelly (Buffalo) and Craig Morton (Denver and
Dallas). ... The Broncos had 180 yards of interception return
yardage, a Super Bowl record. With two interceptions, Gordon
accounted for 108 of those yards, also a Super Bowl record.

BILL CROFUT, 64, FOLK SINGER, BANJO PLAYER AND CROSSOVER ARTIST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ohio, Conn.)  (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Crofut, a singer, composer and master banjo player whose
style often defied categorization, died on Jan. 25 at his home in
Sandisfield, Mass. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his wife, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   Though he surfaced during the folk-music boom in the late 1950s,
Crofut broke free of the mold through his penchant for
experimentation, setting music to the poetry of Robert Penn Warren
or transcribing for banjo the compositions of Vivaldi and Bartok.
</P>
<P>
   Crofut, who was born in Cleveland, studied the French horn as a
music and literature major at Allegheny College in the early 1950s.
``I was doing OK until I met Pete Seeger,'' he said in a 1977
interview in The New York Times. Aware of Seeger's troubles with
the House Committee on Un-American Activities, Crofut was among the
first to raise money for his defense, even though he admitted that
he did not necessarily agree with him. Crofut's $300 contribution
earned him an invitation to Seeger's home in Beacon, N.Y., and soon
he was working as Seeger's ``gofer'' in exchange for a few minutes
of banjo lessons at the end of each day.
</P>
<P>
   His other major musical influences, he said, were jazz
clarinetist Tony Scott, whom he had met while teaching music in
Japan, and pianist Peter Lang, whom he had heard performing Mozart
sonatas in Salzburg.
</P>
<P>
   Crofut recorded more than 20 albums, first as half of a folk duo
with singer and guitarist Stephen Addiss, with whom he toured as
part of the State Department's cultural exchange program, and later
with keyboard player Chris Brubeck and classical guitarist Joel
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   His love of classical repertory led to collaborations, as a
banjo player, with baritone Benjamin Luxon and harpsichordist
Kenneth Cooper in the 1970s, and with soprano Dawn Upshaw in recent
years. He also spent summers teaching a vocal master class at the
Tanglewood Music Center. Crofut had recently finished recording
``Simple Gifts for Children,'' a compilation of children's songs
with Frederica von Stade and Upshaw.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by three daughters,
Erika, of East Canaan, Conn.; Anni, of Cambridge, Mass., and
Catherine, of Lee, Mass., and three grandchildren.

JEANNE-MARIE DARRE, 93, A PIANIST OF LYRICAL POWER, DIES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Mass. )  By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeanne-Marie Darre, a French pianist whose interpretations of
Chopin and Liszt solo works and the Saint-Saens Concertos were
admired for their sophistication and interpretive inventiveness,
died on Jan. 26 in Port Marly, France, where she lived. She was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Darre was an elegant player who dazzled with the strength
and clarity of her technique but was also a provocative
interpreter. Her account of the Liszt Sonata in B minor, for
example, was unusually slow but also uncommonly rich in lyricism
and detail. Miss Darre also had considerable stamina. When she was
21 she played all five of the Saint-Saens Piano Concertos in a
single program with the Concerts Lamoureux orchestra, conducted by
Paul Paray. She repeated that feat twice and sometimes played all
the Chopin Etudes and Preludes in a single recital program.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Darre was born in 1905 in Givet, France, a town near the
Belgian border, and studied the piano with her mother until she was
10. She was then taken to the Paris Conservatory. Her principal
teachers were Isidore Philipp and Marguerite Long, through whom she
met and worked with several great French composers of the time,
among them Faure, Saint-Saens and Ravel.
</P>
<P>
   She made her debut at 14 and at first pursued her career mostly
in Europe. By the time she performed in the United States for the
first time, in February 1962, she was a revered teacher at the
Paris Conservatory, had been awarded the Legion of Honor and had
been made a Chevalier des Arts et Lettres. She also had made
several recordings that were treasured by collectors of piano
works, so her debut at Carnegie Hall with Charles Munch and the
Boston Symphony Orchestra was an eagerly anticipated event.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Darre played the Saint-Saens Concerto No. 2 on that
occasion. Harold C. Schoenberg, reviewing the performance for The
New York Times, described her as ``an exciting, formidable,
electrical virtuoso, who can do anything at the keyboard and do it
with aplomb.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is not all technique,'' he wrote. ``She has complete
tonal control, and a massive sonority.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Darre returned to give her first American recitals at the
end of 1962, and returned regularly through the early 1980s, when
she retired from the concert stage.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Miss Darre's recordings have appeared on compact disk
in recent years. Among them are her mid-1960s traversals of the
Chopin Preludes, Waltzes and Scherzos, on Vanguard Records, and a
collection of recordings she made in Paris between 1922 and 1947,
on VAI Audio.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Darre left no immediate family.

of Super Bowl XXXIII, in which the Broncos defeated the Atlanta
Falcons 34-19, enjoying a second straight Broncos' Super Bowl
victory. Elway, right, congratulates his workhorse running back
Terrell Davis, the league MVP, on another incredible season. The
38-year-old Elway hedged on whether he would retire or come back to
try to make the Broncos the first team to win three straight Super
Bowls. (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo)

Atlanta Falcons and their head coach Dan Reeves watch time fly away
along with their chances for a Super Bowl victory Sunday. Reeves'
old team, the Denver Broncos, defeated the Falcons 34-19 in Super
Bowl XXXIII. The Broncos beat an Atlanta team that was its own
worst enemy, and Elway got a measure of revenge on Reeves, who
coached him in three Super Bowl losses and left Denver in 1992 at
odds with the quarterback. (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo)

Bowl XXXIII Sunday. Super Bowl XXXIII swung on defensive stands by
the Denver Broncos and missed chances by the Atlanta Falcons.
``That's what you've got to do -- you've got to keep them from
scoring touchdowns,'' said Romanowski. ``We preach that, and we
live it.'' (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo)

yards and one touchdown and ran 3 yards for another score. The
total yardage was third best in Super Bowl history. (Jose R.

opposes a new federal law meant to shield children from commercial
pornography on the World Wide Web. Critics of the law say that if
it goes into effect, it could force a variety of Web site operators
to choose between self-censorship or prison. Backers say the law is
necessary to prevent commercial sites from making graphic sexual

Elmhurst, N.Y., and her husband Farid Losso, 29, who still lives in
Colombia, in front of the house where the family used to live

Armenia. Like many of the tens of thousands of Colombian immigrants
who live in the New York region, Ms. Marquez leads a split life.
She lives here and there, dividing her time evenly between two
countries. ``We've lost our home here in Colombia,'' she says.

Arizona State Hospital for mental health care. The hospital's
113-year history has been checkered with pride and pain, but the
last few years have been some of the hardest for the hospital.
Budget cuts and staff reductions have left ASH scrambling to find
enough nurses and technicians to care for those who have been sent
here by civil and criminal courts across the state. Treatment has
suffered, and morale and pay are low. (Monica Almeida/New York

-- In a little more than two years, William Dean Singleton has
become the No. 2 newspaper publisher in Southern California, buying
up a string of small dailies in a pincer-like move around the
dominant paper, The Los Angeles Times. Some say the expansion may
hinder The Los Angeles Times, which is owned by the Times Mirror

to revive its fortunes and halt a steadily declining circulation.
It is the first time in the Geographic's 111-year history that it
has resorted to use of newsstands, which it has long scoffed at as
downscale but now sees as the means for attracting the diverse and
younger readers it so desperately needs. (Ruby Washington/New York

MOROCCO-SINGLEMOMS-2, 1-31 -- A woman and a child in the streets of
Marrakesh, Morocco. In general, women are treated as inferior under
Morocco's Koranic laws: they are legal minors, inherit only half a
share, need permission from a male relative to marry and can be
repudiated by their husbands. But a woman who has a child out of
wedlock is treated with even more disdain. (Marlise Simons/New York

1-31 -- Young women and a baby they are looking after in a day care
center run by a Swiss foundation in Agadir, Morocco. In a country
where abortion is forbidden by law and a woman who has a child out
of wedlock is treated with even more disdain, the center is an
important service for unmarried mothers, who become social
outcasts, even rejected by their families. (Marlise Simons/New York

From left, June Watson, Pearce Quigley and Mary Macleod in Caryl
Churchill's production of ``Blue Heart,'' at the Majestic Theater
of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Directed and acted with a finesse
and wit that are far more warm than chilly, the production feels
like a love poem to the endless possibilities of theater, even as
it exposes its limitations. (Andrea Mohin/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT2) NEW YORK -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- DANCE-GISELLE-REVIEW, 1-31
-- The Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg performing ``Red Giselle''
at City Center. Boris Eifman's choreographic essay on the life and
mental illness of the Russian emigre ballerina Olga Spessivtseva is
expressed in a style with cartoonlike simplicities. One can contest
the ballet's picture of good and evil. But one also has to admire
the impact of Eifman's choreography and the sheer originality of
his theatrical vision. (Ruby Washington/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT1) BOSTON -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- U.S.-MUSEUMS-MOBS, 1-31 -- The
most popular exhibition in the United States last year, ``Monet in
the 20th Century,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which
counted 565,992 visitors during a three-month run that ended on
Dec. 27. Population differences notwithstanding, nearly everyone
credits the current success of American museums to marketing. (Evan

   NATIONAL-GEOGRAPHIC-MEDIA (Undated) _ These are changing times
at the National Geographic Society. This week, the magazine, which
faces a slowly but steadily declining circulation, will put 400,000
issues on newsstands across the country. It is the first time in
the Geographic's 111-year history that it has resorted to use of
newsstands, which it has long scoffed at as colloquial but now sees
as the means for attracting the diverse and younger readers it so
desperately needs. By Alex Kuczynski.

   INTERNET-LOBBYISTS-PROFILE (Washington) _ The Electronic Privacy
Information Center is one of several on-line civil liberties groups
that are shaping policy for the digital age. It has often focused
on the government, earning a pit-bull reputation in fights over
export controls on computer security technology or Internet privacy
laws. But it also has no hesitation about going after the
high-technology companies that are its allies on other issues. By
Jeri Clausing.

pornography on the World Wide Web. By Pamela Mendels.

<P>
   DIGICOM-COLUMN (Undated) _ Some experts worry that an increasing
number of individuals and companies are abusing patent and
copyright laws with specious claims to ownership of intellectual
property, as well as by stockpiling patents into competitive
arsenals. Experts cite various technology companies, including IBM,
Intel, and Hewlett-Packard, as using their vast holdings of patents
as competitive weaponry in seeking to disable each other with
infringement charges. By Denise Caruso.

   OFFICE-SUPPLIES-ADCOL (Undated) _ The office products business _
once the province of mom-and-pop stationery stores _ is witnessing
a high-profile consumer marketing war as the nation's three giant
superstore companies battle for more of what has become a growing
$225 billion industry. By Patricia Winters Lauro.

   CALIF-NEWSPAPERS-MEDIA (Undated) _ In a little more than two
years, William Dean Singleton has become the No. 2 newspaper
publisher in Southern California, buying up a string of small
dailies in a pincer-like move around the dominant paper, The Los
Angeles Times. By Andrea Adelson.

   INTERNET-TV-MEDIA (New Orleans) _ Normally, at the largest
television trade show in the world, the National Association of
Television Executives, producers and syndicators of non-network
programs meet and glad-hand the nation's television station
executives. But this year, the eager-beaver Internet entrepreneurs
were horning in on the party. Both as exhibitors and as experts on
informational panels, the computer mavens clamored to be heard. By
Lawrie Mifflin.

   FAT-ACTRESSES (New York) _ Camryn Manheim surprised herself a
bit at the awards ceremony last September when she raised her Emmy
in a kind of power-to-the-people salute and heard herself shout,
``This is for all the fat girls!'' But her exuberance on the Emmy
broadcast, as well as her growing popularity on ``The Practice,''
has brought her an unexpected opportunity to speak out about women
_ not just fat women _ and self-esteem. By Jane Fritsch.

<P>
   U.S.-MUSEUM-MOBS (Undated) _ If any people doubted that American
art museums were experiencing a record attendance boom, they no
longer should. The annual survey of visitors to art exhibitions in
North America, Europe and Australia by The Art Newspaper, a widely
read London-based international monthly, concludes that ``the
keenest exhibition visitors'' in 1998 were ``the Americans by
far.'' By Judith Dobrzynski.

   (NYT21) MIAMI -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- FBN-SUPER-BOWL-7, 1-31 -- The
Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway, a unanimous choice for MVP
of Super Bowl XXXIII, in which the Broncos defeated the Atlanta
Falcons 34-19, enjoying a second straight Broncos' Super Bowl
victory. Elway, right, congratulates his workhorse running back
Terrell Davis, the league MVP, on another incredible season. The
38-year-old Elway hedged on whether he would retire or come back to
try to make the Broncos the first team to win three straight Super
Bowls. (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT20) MIAMI -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- FBN-SUPER-BOWL-6, 1-31 -- The
Atlanta Falcons and their head coach Dan Reeves watch time fly away
along with their chances for a Super Bowl victory Sunday. Reeves'
old team, the Denver Broncos, defeated the Falcons 34-19 in Super
Bowl XXXIII. The Broncos beat an Atlanta team that was its own
worst enemy, and Elway got a measure of revenge on Reeves, who
coached him in three Super Bowl losses and left Denver in 1992 at
odds with the quarterback. (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT19) MIAMI -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- FBN-SUPER-BOWL-5, 1-31 -- The
Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski enjoying a moment of
glory after the Broncos defeated the Altanta Falcons 34-19 in Super
Bowl XXXIII Sunday. Super Bowl XXXIII swung on defensive stands by
the Denver Broncos and missed chances by the Atlanta Falcons.
``That's what you've got to do -- you've got to keep them from
scoring touchdowns,'' said Romanowski. ``We preach that, and we
live it.'' (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT18) MIAMI -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- FBN-SUPER-BOWL-4, 1-31 -- The
Denver Broncos 38-year-old quarterback John Elway scoring a
touchdown in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XXXIII Sunday, in
which the Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34-19. Elway, who
was the unanimous choice for MVP, completed 18 of 29 passes for 336
yards and one touchdown and ran 3 yards for another score. The
total yardage was third best in Super Bowl history. (Jose R.

   (NYT17) SHELTON, Conn. -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- INTERNET-SMUT-TRIAL,
1-31 -- Mitchell S. Tepper, head of the Sexual Health Network,
opposes a new federal law meant to shield children from commercial
pornography on the World Wide Web. Critics of the law say that if
it goes into effect, it could force a variety of Web site operators
to choose between self-censorship or prison. Backers say the law is
necessary to prevent commercial sites from making graphic sexual
images available to all visitors, including children. (Thomas

   (NYT16) NEW YORK -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- INTERNET-MUSIC-SALES, 1-31
-- Recordings by the guitarist Billy Squier can be received over
the Internet using software from A2B Music. A2B's Howard Singer, at
the keyboard, says the potential customer base is growing, but he
frets that people may get used to free music. (James Estrin/New

   (NYT15) ARMENIA, Colombia -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- COLOMBIA-QUAKE-3,
1-31 -- People setting up temporary makeshift huts in the city of
Armenia after their houses were destroyed by the earthquake that
measured 6.0 on the Richter scale, and was the worst to hit the
area in more than 100 years. About 35,000 families, or 180,000
people, have been left homeless, and over 1000 people were killed,
the Colombian Red Cross has announced. (Chang W. Lee/New York Times

   (NYT14) ARMENIA, Colombia -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- COLOMBIA-QUAKE-2,
1-31 --A child salvaging some food from a relief truck distributing
food to people in need after the earthquake which measured 6.0 on
the Richter scale, and the worst to hit the area in more than 100
years, struck the city of Armenia. About 35,000 families, or
180,000 people, have been left homeless, and over 1000 people were
killed, the Colombian Red Cross has announced. (Chang W. Lee/New

   (NYT13) ARMENIA, Colombia -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- COLOMBIA-QUAKE-1,
1-31 -- Isabel Cristina Marquez, a 28-year-old waitress from
Elmhurst, N.Y., and her husband Farid Losso, 29, who still lives in
Colombia, in front of the house where the family used to live
before it was destroyed by the earthquake that rocked the city of
Armenia. Like many of the tens of thousands of Colombian immigrants
who live in the New York region, Ms. Marquez leads a split life.
She lives here and there, dividing her time evenly between two
countries. ``We've lost our home here in Colombia,'' she says.

   (NYT9) PHOENIX -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- ARIZ-HOSPITAL, 1-31 -- A
patient watching television at the civil rehabilitation ward at the
Arizona State Hospital for mental health care. The hospital's
113-year history has been checkered with pride and pain, but the
last few years have been some of the hardest for the hospital.
Budget cuts and staff reductions have left ASH scrambling to find
enough nurses and technicians to care for those who have been sent
here by civil and criminal courts across the state. Treatment has
suffered, and morale and pay are low. (Monica Almeida/New York

   (NYT8) UNDATED -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- CALIF-NEWSPAPERS-MEDIA, 1-31
-- In a little more than two years, William Dean Singleton has
become the No. 2 newspaper publisher in Southern California, buying
up a string of small dailies in a pincer-like move around the
dominant paper, The Los Angeles Times. Some say the expansion may
hinder The Los Angeles Times, which is owned by the Times Mirror
Co., from pursuing growth in the suburbs. (Brian Brainerd/New York

   (NYT7) NEW YORK -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- NATIONAL-GEOGRAPHIC-MEDIA,
1-31 -- National Geographic is starting to use newsstands in order
to revive its fortunes and halt a steadily declining circulation.
It is the first time in the Geographic's 111-year history that it
has resorted to use of newsstands, which it has long scoffed at as
downscale but now sees as the means for attracting the diverse and
younger readers it so desperately needs. (Ruby Washington/New York

   (NYT6) WASHINGTON -- Jan. 31, 1999 --
INTERNET-LOBBYISTS-PROFILE, 1-31 -- Marc Rotenberg, from left, Dave
Banisar and David L. Sobel of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center oppose plans to include identification features in a
computer chip. Privacy advocates say the feature, intended to
enhance the security of electronic commerce and safeguard against
software piracy, would make it easy for online marketers, even
governments, to track people on the Internet. (Marty Katz/New York

   (NYT5) MARRAKESH, Morocco -- Jan. 31, 1999 --
MOROCCO-SINGLEMOMS-2, 1-31 -- A woman and a child in the streets of
Marrakesh, Morocco. In general, women are treated as inferior under
Morocco's Koranic laws: they are legal minors, inherit only half a
share, need permission from a male relative to marry and can be
repudiated by their husbands. But a woman who has a child out of
wedlock is treated with even more disdain. (Marlise Simons/New York
Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT4) AGADIR, Morocco -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- MOROCCO-SINGLEMOMS-1,
1-31 -- Young women and a baby they are looking after in a day care
center run by a Swiss foundation in Agadir, Morocco. In a country
where abortion is forbidden by law and a woman who has a child out
of wedlock is treated with even more disdain, the center is an
important service for unmarried mothers, who become social
outcasts, even rejected by their families. (Marlise Simons/New York
Times Photo)

   (NYT3) NEW YORK -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- BLUE-THEATER-REVIEW, 1-31 --
From left, June Watson, Pearce Quigley and Mary Macleod in Caryl
Churchill's production of ``Blue Heart,'' at the Majestic Theater
of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Directed and acted with a finesse
and wit that are far more warm than chilly, the production feels
like a love poem to the endless possibilities of theater, even as
it exposes its limitations. (Andrea Mohin/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT2) NEW YORK -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- DANCE-GISELLE-REVIEW, 1-31
-- The Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg performing ``Red Giselle''
at City Center. Boris Eifman's choreographic essay on the life and
mental illness of the Russian emigre ballerina Olga Spessivtseva is
expressed in a style with cartoonlike simplicities. One can contest
the ballet's picture of good and evil. But one also has to admire
the impact of Eifman's choreography and the sheer originality of
his theatrical vision. (Ruby Washington/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT1) BOSTON -- Jan. 31, 1999 -- U.S.-MUSEUMS-MOBS, 1-31 -- The
most popular exhibition in the United States last year, ``Monet in
the 20th Century,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which
counted 565,992 visitors during a three-month run that ended on
Dec. 27. Population differences notwithstanding, nearly everyone
credits the current success of American museums to marketing. (Evan
