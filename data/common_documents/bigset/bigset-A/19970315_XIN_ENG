<HEADLINE> No Plans for WEU Intervention in Albania: Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union (WEU) is
not planning a military intervention in Albania to restore order
in the Balkan state, a German government spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"This is a domestic affair ... there are no concrete plans for
a WEU role in stabilizing Albania," said Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
spokesman, Peter Hausmann.
</P>
<P>
With Albania crumbling into anarchy, political leaders in
Tirana appealed late Thursday to the European Union and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to send peacekeeping troops to
the country to help restore order.
</P>
<P>
However, German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said
Thursday that Bonn did not believe that order could be restored in
Albania by forces from outside. He added that what was happening
there was not a civil war, but "chaos, anarchy, an uprising."
</P>
<P>
The unrests, which started in southern Albania last month and
escalated into armed violence, have spread across the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
The riots were sparked by the collapse of government investment
schemes which made almost all Albanians lose their life-long
savings.
</P>
<P>
Erdmann said that the new Albanian government, which was formed
on Wednesday, should restore order in the country so that
elections could be held.

<HEADLINE> Zambia for Promoting Gender Equality: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government remains
committed to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment
of women in national development.
</P>
<P>
This was reiterated by deputy secretary to the cabinet Leslie
Mbula at a gender sensitization seminar for policy analysis and
coordination division here today.
</P>
<P>
Mbula said gender issue should be included in all policies and
laws that will be made in future because if policies that
sideline gender issues continue to be made, women will never be
fully accepted as equal partners with men in development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that gender issues should be given top priority in
all policies because both men and women are capable of making
positive contributions in development.
</P>
<P>
Women in Zambia seem to play no significant role in
development because they are denied access to the country's
resources.
</P>
<P>
They have no access to credit facilities and other productive
materials to enhance productivity, according to Mbula.

<HEADLINE> Mandela's Envoy to Attend Nairobi Summit on Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will send a representative to attend a two-day
summit on the the Zairean crisis in Nairobi, Kenya next week,
presidential aide Parks Mankahlana said today.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy of Mandela will soon be named, Mankahlana
said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi, who is to host the Nairobi summit, has invited Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko, President Paul Biya of Cameroun,
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Pascal Lissouba of
Congo and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa in addition to
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has been at the center of African mediation efforts to
solve the Great Lakes region crisis and held talks with Zairean
rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila last month in Johannesburg,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said Mandela's schedule had been changed to lighten
his workload after a hectic four-nation tour of Southeast Asia
and prior to another to Bangladesh and India from March 26 to 29.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had state visits to the Philippines, Brunei, Singapore
and Malaysia from March 1 to 10, during which business contracts
worth about 1.8 billion U.S. Dollars were signed.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana denied that Mandela's absence should be perceived
as an acknowledgement that South Africa-led mediation efforts had
failed.
</P>
<P>
It is the South African government rather than the president
who is behind the mediation efforts, Mandela's aide said.
</P>
<P>
South African and American officials met Zairean President
Mobutu's envoy and Kabila in Cape Town, the legislative capital
of South Africa, last month in an attempt to broker a cease-fire
and peace talks.

<P>
HARARE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Mozambican Foreign
Minister Leonardo Simao said today the peace process in his
country is progressing well and that the political situation is
stable.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters here after a meeting with President Robert
Mugabe at Zimbabwe House during which he briefed the Zimbabwean
leader on the current political situation in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Simao said the Mozambique National Assembly is currently
discussing a package of proposals drawn up for municipal
elections scheduled for November.
</P>
<P>
''There have been different opinions and views expressed by
the opposition Renamo about the municipal elections and the
proposals, but we hope to reach an agreement and decision soon,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
''However, the overall political situation in Mozambique is
stable and everything is progressing well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Simao expressed gratitude for the support and assistance his
country received from Zimbabwe in dealing with flood victims in
central Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''we had too much rain in December last year and
January this year. We lost 78 lives and as much as 100,000
hectares of crops. They were the most severe floods we have had
in years. We last had such severe floods some 30 to 50 years
back.''

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Albanian authorities opened weapons warehouses in the
capital to arm civilians who they hoped would help defend the
government. Residents barricaded themselves inside their homes,
gunfire rattled across the capital, and people bid up the prices
of the last food supplies, awaiting chaos.
</P>
<P>
-- The White House and Congressional Republicans deadlocked
again over the Federal budget. Senate Republican leader Trent Lott
declared President Clinton lacked the courage and leadership to
deal with one of the principal issues, saving billions of dollars
by reducing cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other
benefit programs. Clinton has decided not to look into
recalculating how inflation is measured, which would reduce the
increase.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The House voted largely along party lines Thursday to
approve a compromise measure that would give Mexico 90 days to
make progress toward improving its anti-drug efforts or risk U.S.
sanctions for not cooperating with the United States in the war
against drugs.
</P>
<P>
-- The General Assembly of the United Nations added its voice
Thursday to international criticism of Israel's intention to build
more Jewish homes in East Jerusalem, voting 130 to 2 to condemn
the Israeli plan as "illegal" and "a major obstacle to peace."
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States began evacuating Americans from
Albania. Other countries were taking similar steps as lawlessness
became general, with competing mobs armed with looted army weapons
clashing in the capital and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> German Workers End Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- German construction workers
concluded their weeklong demonstrations in Berlin today with a
mass rally to press their demands on the government.
</P>
<P>
About 15,000 workers from all over the country attended the
final rally at which they called on German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
to take seriously their anger over job losses, cheap imported
labor and broken contracts, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The protests turned violent briefly when a few hundred
demonstrators stormed the Reichstag parliament building
construction site, hurling firecrackers and beer cans. Police said
they had detained one person for vandalism.
</P>
<P>
The protests were staged amid so far fruitless wage
negotiations between the construction workers' union IG Bau and
two employers' groups. The next round of talks was scheduled for
March 25.
</P>
<P>
The employers want a more flexible structure for measuring
annual working hours whereby time lost in the winter months can be
compensated by longer working hours in the summer.
</P>
<P>
While agreeing in principle for a more flexible arrangement,
the union is insisting on "clearly defined maximum and minimum
working time."

<HEADLINE> British National Science Week Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The fourth British National Week
of Science, Engineering and Technology, SET97, was launched by
Minister for Science and Technology Ian Taylor here today.
</P>
<P>
"Science week plays a major role in the campaign to improve the
nation's ability at appreciation of and interest in what will
continue to be the driving forces of economic and social change
for years to come," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
Science week has been designed to promote a positive image of
science, engineering and technology and help show their value to
society.
</P>
<P>
It has also been designed to raise public awareness of science
and technology as a part of daily life.
</P>
<P>
"Engineers in particular have long been undervalued in this
country. For this reason, 1997 has been designated the Year of
Engineering Success (YES)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the YES campaign is to raise the profile of
engineering and encourage more young people to enter the
profession.
</P>
<P>
SET97 is organized by the British Association for the
Advancement of Science with near 6,000 events and runs from today
to March 23.
</P>
<P>
The first science week took place in 1994 with over 1,000
events across Britain.

<HEADLINE> US Producer Prices Show Biggest Drop in Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Producer Price Index
(PPI) in February registered the biggest drop in more than two
years, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent
decrease in the PPI was the sharpest since an identical decline in
October 1994.
</P>
<P>
The PPI measures the cost of goods before they reach consumers.
Its movement offers important clues for the future behavior of the
Consumer Price Index, which tracks the prices of services and
retail goods.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. producer price drop in February followed a 0.3 percent
decline in January.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected decline was another piece of evidence that
sustained robust economic growth hasn't yet translated into
accelerating inflation. Nevertheless, many economists are looking
for the Federal Reserve to nudge interest rates higher as a
preventive measure in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The drop of the PPI resulted from the declines in items ranging
from gasoline to beef and computers, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
February's price decline was helped by a 0.3 percent decrease
in food prices.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices, after a sustained increase in the last half of
1996, fell by 1.2 percent in February, the sharpest drop since
November 1995 and the second consecutive decline.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices edged
0.1 percent lower after no change the month before. That included
a record 5.2 percent drop in computer prices. Tobacco fell 0.2
percent.

BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
today it had accepted the invitation from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to attend Saturday's meeting in Gaza on the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that the EU will be represented at the

</P>
<P>
The peace process is "the only path" to security and peace for
the Palestinians as well as for Israel, the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
While expressing concern over the lastest developments in the
peace process since the signing of Hebron agreement, the EU
pledged to help promote a just and lasting peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
It said the EU will present "a number of European ideas and
options" to overcome the present difficulties and explore ways to

<HEADLINE> Residency Visa Required for Immigrant Workers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Children of immigrant workers living
in Germany will be required to have a residency visa under a new
law approved today by the upper house of the German parliament.
</P>
<P>
There are estimately 600,000 to 800,000 children of immigrant
workers from Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia and the former Yugoslavia
now living in Germany. They were previously exempted from
residency permit requirements from the German authorities.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, those children aged up to 16 will receive
the residency permit automatically if they were born in Germany or
are already registered with state authorities. Otherwise, they are
obliged to apply for the permit.
</P>
<P>
The new law approved today represented a watered-down version
of a decree issued in January by the German Interior Ministry
which demanded even tougher regulations.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people took to the streets across Germany last
month in protest against the planned regulations, with opponents
saying that those regulations would work against efforts to
integrate immigrant workers' children born in the country into the
German society.
</P>
<P>
Defending the new law, Gerhard Glogowski, premier of the Lower
Saxony state, said today that the new visa requirement is useful
because it could protect immigrant workers' children from being
abused by refugee smugglers.

<HEADLINE> EU Keeps Door Ajar to Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 14 (Xinhua)-- A two-year formal linkage to the
Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) is not necessary for a country's
currency to qualify for participation in the European Monetary
Union, said Patrick Child, spokesman for the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Child made the remarks to the Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri
before EU finance commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy leaves for
Sweden on a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Sweden, Yves-Thibault is scheduled to meet
with Swedish Finance Minister Erik Asbrink, central bank governor
Urban Backstrom and Peter Wallenberg, the kingpin of Swedish
industry.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission has previously insisted that linkage to the
ERM be essential for participation in the monetary union. But
Child argued that the stability of a currency was the central
issue.
</P>
<P>
If a two-year membership in the ERM was laid down as a
precondition for joining the monetary union, Sweden would miss out
in the first stage of the monetary union which was set to be
launched in 1999, the Swedish newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Companies Recommended for Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Union Bank of Switzerland
(UBS), one of the world top banks, showed confidence in Jordan's
economy by identifying eight Jordanian companies as potential
firms for foreign investments, Jordan's news agency Petra reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
The UBS will hold a conference in London on May 15 in an effort
to promote the eight companies among 60 of UBS clients.
</P>
<P>
The eight state-holding companies, in which the government
holds large stakes, are from the industries of phosphate, potash,
cement, electricity and telecommunications as well as the bank and
investment sector, said Amman Financial Market (AFM) Director
General Wahib Shair.
</P>
<P>
A UBS delegation arrived in Amman last Wednesday for a two-day
visit to prepare for the conference, said Shair, adding that the
delegation also met with several Jordanian ministers and officials.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in 1993, Jordan missed many investment
opportunities as foreign investors were required to obtain a prior
approval for investment from the Prime Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"But, with changes in the law brought about by the (Cairo)
Middle East and North Africa economic summit (last November), the
need for prior approval from the Prime Ministry was canceled," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Shair stressed the importance of reversing "the traditional
way" of attracting foreign investments, to a new approach
of "meeting investors, showing them we are interested, listening
to their views and communicating their ideas to the government."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Putting S. Leonean Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today denies having put
visiting Sierra Leoneang rebel leader Foday Sanko under house arrest
in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
A piece of Reuter news, to this effect, could not be confirmed
at this moment, as neither the Nigerian Defense Headquarters nor
the Sierra Leonean High Commission here are available for comment
at this moment.
</P>
<P>
"He's not in detention and he's not a threat to our security,"
a defense spokesman of Nigeria's Defense Headquarters told Xinhua
in a telephone interview. He noted that Sanko is at the federal
government guest house.
</P>
<P>
The same Reuter report also quoted a senior member of Sanko's
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) as saying in a statement today that
the high command of RUF has declared with immediate effect to
sack Sanko as its leader for blocking the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Defense Headquarters on Tuesday confirmed the presence
Sanko in Nigeria for a private visit, but denied holding him for
anything incriminating.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Headquarters also dismissed reports that he came in with
any ammunition as widely reported, adding that he was free to enter
into the country as a West African national.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been in good relations with Sierra Leone. It was only
on last Friday that the two countries recently signed a military
agreement, under which Nigeria will help train Sierra Leone's security
agencies, including that country's Army, Navy, Air Force and Police.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Prime Minister
Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan said today that the economy of his country
has improved as a result of the measures taken by his government
since it took power last July.
</P>
<P>
In an article carried in "Government News" today, Enkhsaikhan
said his government has raised energy prices since last September,
which has boosted the power sectors of the country. As a result,
coal output, electricity and heat production have all grown, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In response to workers' demand for higher pay, Enkhsaikhan
pointed out that wage increases may result in further growth in
inflation rate, which must be avoided. He said his government is
looking for a way which can increase workers' payment without
causing price rises.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in January and February was 2.3 percent and
3.2 percent respectively, lower than that of the same period of
last year, indicating that Mongolia's economy is moving towards
stabilization, the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> North Sea Countries Ban "Hoover" Trawlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain's proposal of banning
"industrial" fishing and other damaging trawling methods from
ecologically sensitive areas was adopted at a joint ministerial
conference in Norway, said the newspaper Daily Telegraph here
today.
</P>
<P>
The plan to restrict or prohibit ecologically-damaging fishing
methods took fishermen's representatives by surprise, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
It promises to limit the activities of Danish "hoover" trawlers
that catch sand eels within sight of the salmon rivers and bird
colonies of the British coast.
</P>
<P>
The measure, proposed by John Gummer, the British environment
secretary, represented a major strengthening of the conclusions on
integrating North Sea fisheries and environment policy and saving
endangered fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
The areas regarded as ecologically sensitive now have to be
drawn up by the European Commission, sources attending the
conference said.
</P>
<P>
These are likely to include Wee Bankie, near the Isle of May in
the Firth of Forth, where conservationists believe that the
catching of more than 100,000 tons a year of sand eels has led to
breeding failure in seabird colonies.
</P>
<P>
Anglers, who believe that industrial fishing deprives salmon
and sea trout of food, will take heart from the proposals as will
fishermen who believe that catching small fish is preventing
endangered cod stocks from recovering.
</P>
<P>
But the major fishermen's federations of England and Scotland
were wary of the plans because of the restrictions they could
impose on other forms of fishing.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) is facing a heavy workload with only some 100 days
away from the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) on July 1 this year, PLC President
Rita Fan said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering organized by Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch, Ms Fan noted that the PLC has no intention of
challenging the governing authority of the British Hong Kong
government, nor will it affect the normal operation of the
existing Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
What the PLC is doing and will do is simply aimed at the smooth
transition of the territory, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan summarized the PLC's tasks as "enacting laws and
ordinances indispensable to the establishment of the HKSAR and
handling those (laws and ordinances) that have to be handled
before the first Legislative Council of the HKSAR is formed."
</P>
<P>
Two working groups under the PLC, one on administrative matters
and the other on the rules of procedure, are working hard and
progress has been made, she said.
</P>
<P>
A draft on the rules of procedure will be submitted to the
plenary session of the PLC next Saturday, she said.
</P>
<P>
Once the draft is adopted, she added, the PLC will start with
its legislative work.
</P>
<P>
In the process of making laws, the PLC will employ every
appropriate means to seek opinions of Hong Kong residents, she
continued, hoping that local people would air their views
actively.
</P>
<P>
Around 100 Hong Kong deputies from women and youth
organizations on the Chinese mainland attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei: Iran to Continue Anti-U.S. Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei said today that Iran is determined to continue its
anti-U.S. struggle without any hesitation.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that Iran can not have any relations with the
United States because it is against Iran and its policy is based
on "oppression and tyranny."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader made the remarks in a big gathering of the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) forces and volunteer
forces in the last day of his trip to Khuzestan province, where
an eight-year war from 1980 to 1988 between Iran and Iraq took
place.
</P>
<P>
"The United States would be the enemy of any country that
would stand in front of U.S. pursuit of illegitimate interests,"
he was quoted by the state-run Tehran Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the military forces in western Iran, Khamenei
called on them to have better understanding of their enemy and
follow the Islamic path with firmness and without "any fear."
</P>
<P>
He said "the U.S. support for Israel is not because of its
support for Jews but to meet its own interests."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said last Sunday that Iran has struggled against the
United States for 18 years and it would continue this struggle
for 180 years.
</P>
<P>
However, President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said recently that
Iran is pursuing a policy of no dialogue and no war toward the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the United States have been hostile to each other
for the past 18 years since they broke diplomatic relations in
1979 after the hostage crisis.

<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A local television station
conducted on-the-spot interviews today to collect complaints from
consumers in the capital city, as part of a series of activities
nationwide to mark the World Consumers' Day.
</P>
<P>
To further raise awareness of consumers' legal rights, the
Diandian Studio of Beijing Television Station organized the
activity at a department store here, offering free consulting
services on consumer rights, services for filing complaints and
free quality checks on goods.
</P>
<P>
This morning alone, the studio received as many as 5,000
visitors and 200 complaints, 68 of which have been channeled to
relevant departments.
</P>
<P>
The visitors accused retailers of selling fake brandnames,
using false advertising, and selling defective goods at a discount.
</P>
<P>
The problem of poor quality accounted for 69 percent of all the
complaints the studio received today. The other top five gripes
deal with weight and measurement errors by vendors, fake goods,
irrational pricing and false advertising.
</P>
<P>
Joining the TV station in the activity were two local
government bodies, the Beijing Industrial and Commercial
Administration and the Bureau of Technical Supervision.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Appeals For International Help to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat today appealed to international diplomats for help to
rescue the Palestinian-Israeli peace process which is facing deep
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference of foreign diplomats in Gaza,
Arafat condemned the Israeli government for having put the peace
process on hold with its recent hardline decisions to build a
settlement in East Jerusalem and redeploy troops from only 9
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Envoys from the United States, Russia, Japan, Europan Union
and several Arab countries attended today's meeting, which was
called by Arafat to voice his grievances over the current
situation in an attempt to exert more international pressure on
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which has not been invited to this meeting, accused
the conference of violating the peace agreements with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has recently decided unilaterally to
pull out troops from 9 percent of the West Bank in the first of
three-stage pullbacks, which has fallen short of the Palestinian
expectation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians had expected Israel to return at least 30
percent of the West Bank to Palestinian rule. The Israel offer was
rejected outright by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Israel vowed Friday to carry out its decision to
build the Har Homa neighborhood in southeastern Jerusalem next
week.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Israel of dictating the terms of negotiations, Arafat
said that Israel's recent actions had left the Palestinian side
with no partner in the peace dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"Save the peace process," Arafat repeated three times in his
speech, urging the international community to take actions to
defuse the current crisis and salvage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also called for establishing an
independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,
a formula that has been flatly ruled out by Israel's hardline
Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Israel has declared Jerusalem as its united, eternal and
indivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also called for creating a new mechanism to ensure full
and comprehensive implementation of the peace agreements. But he
did not elaborate what such mechanism would be.
</P>
<P>
Despite Israel's strong opposition, the U.S. sent its
Consul-General in Jerusalem Edward Abington to take part in
today's meeting. This is regarded as Washington' balancing act to
allay the Palestinian frustration over the U.S. veto of the
United Nations Security Council resolution which demanded Israel
abandon the Har Homa project.
</P>
<P>
The real test of the troubled peace process is expected to
come next week as the Israeli cabinet decided Friday to begin the
construction in Har Homa next week.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has repeatedly warned that this could lead to renewed
bloodshed between Israeli troops and Palestinian protesters like
the late September conflicts which killed over 70 people.

Kuwait currently imposes 50 percent of custom tariffs on
imported cigarettes and it is a major consumer country of
cigarettes in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ghanim also said the GCC states including Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain would

<HEADLINE> Dalian Launches Silt Cleaning Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Dalian, a coastal city in
northeastern China's Liaoning Province, today switched on a huge
drainage pump to began sucking out industrial pollution in Dalian
Bay.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, an estimated ten million cubic
meters of industrial waste has silted up over past decades in the
western part of the bay, seriously deteriorating the area. A
300,000-tonnage shipyard adjacent to the water was also affected,
as each new ship had to be thoroughly cleaned before it is put
into use.
</P>
<P>
The local government, working jointly with two local firms,
last year drafted an anti-pollution program to clean the water.
</P>
<P>
The project, due to conclude in July, will pump the industrial
silt and spray to three allocated areas, each with a waste-holding
capacity of one million cubic meters. Construction of a
1,524-meter-long dike designed to hold the waste was completed in
February.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that a new harbor which can accommodate
the stopover of 300,000-tonnage ships could be built after the
project is finished.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Murder Casts New Shadows Over Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Irish republicans today accused
Protestant guerrillas loyal to Britain of killing a Catholic man
on Friday night in his house in Belfast, capital of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The murder, which revived old sectarian fears, cast new shadows
over the province's peace efforts, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), said the victim was a Catholic and blamed
pro-British Protestant guerrillas for his death.
</P>
<P>
"All the indications are at this stage that this was an attack
by a Loyalist death squad. It is additional evidence that confirms
that the Loyalist cessation of violence ended some time ago," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The murder came at a time of heightened tension and a
deteriorating security climate in the province, where rival
factions are in conflict over the future of British rule.
</P>
<P>
One day ago, suspected IRA guerrillas wounded a policeman and a
soldier in the latest Northern Ireland attacks.
</P>
<P>
The IRA is fighting to end British rule and merge Northern
Ireland with largely Catholic Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Loyalist guerrillas have launched four attacks on Catholics
since December, apparently in reprisal for IRA ambushes on British
troops and police.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dalian New Shipyard, a leading
shipbuilding enterprise in northeast China's Liaoning Province,
today released into water a 150,000-ton oil tanker, a
Chinese-built vessel with the country's largest-ever carrying
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The tanker was built for a Norwegian company, the third of its
kind for the company. In spite of the sluggish shipbuilding
situation overseas, the Dalian shipyard still has stable market
shares in Hong Kong and Norway, and has expanded its business to
Greece and Denmark, shipyard authorities say.
</P>
<P>
Products of the shipyard include 150,000-ton bulk vessels,
150,000- and 110,000-ton oil tankers, and 52,000-ton big-hatch
ships, they said.
</P>
<P>
The shipyard is accepting orders for overseas vessels with
total weight of 1.57 million tons. Construction will continue
through 1999, they said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO made a new concession to Russian concerns about its
eastward expansion. The Western military alliance said it had no
intention of stationing permanent foreign forces for ground combat
in countries that did not have them. NATO officials hoped the
concession would serve as an olive branch in advance of next
week's Russian-American summit in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
-- Zairian rebels launched an attack on Zaire's third-largest
city, Kisangani, creating panic among Government troops and
civilians. Western diplomats said the assault began with a mortar
barrage, followed by shooting inside the city. Kisangani, the
unofficial capital of northeast Zaire, is the biggest strategic
target so far of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Hundreds of Americans and other foreigners fled Albania
Friday as gunman terrorized the capital for a second day. At least
23 people were reported killed across the country and scores were
wounded as the chaos that has gripped southern Albania for a week
spread to the rural north. European governments rejected President
Sali Berisha's call for outside help to restore order in the
country.
</P>
<P>
-- The White House is working with a bipartisan group of
senators to find a face-saving compromise on the dispute over
Mexico's anti-narcotics efforts that would allow Congress to
express its frustration with the drug trade without exacerbating
diplomatic relations.

<HEADLINE> Shop Declares to Stop Selling Sony TV Sets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A local shop in Haikou, capital
city of South China's Hainan Province, announced beginning from
today -- International Consumers' Day -- that it stops selling all
products manufactured by the Japanese electronics giant Sony.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following a dispute between the shop,
Lepusheng Shopping Building, and Sony's Guangzhou Office, over
whether the Japanese company should replace an allegedly deficient
part for a Sony 2565 color TV.
</P>
<P>
A local consumer named Xu Zhifei discovered the color tube in
his television set wasn't working properly, just two years after
buying it from the shop.
</P>
<P>
Sony's Guangzhou Office refused to replace the bad part free of
charge, thus violating a state-mandated customer service
regulation which states this type of tube should be replaced by
the manufacturer if any quality defect is found within three years
of the date of purchase.
</P>
<P>
The shop has upheld its ban, in spite of a letter of apology
sent by the Sony Office. "Such a letter is not enough to solve the
problem," a Lepusheng source said.

<HEADLINE> EU Foreign Ministers to Discuss Crisis in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
APELDOORN, the Netherlands, March 15 (Xinhua) -- European Union
foreign ministers are gathering in the Dutch town of Apeldoorn to
hold urgent talks on the crisis in Albania.
</P>
<P>
After days of tension and chaos, the Balkan state were relative
calm in the last few hours. This added to the EU's belief that
military intervention will be "highly inappropriate".
</P>
<P>
As long as the Albanian interim government remains in position,
technically at least, under President Sali Berisha, the EU is
committed to backing their efforts to restore order, an EU
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the call of Organization for Security and Co-operation
in Europe mediator Franz Vranitzky to bring in some sort of
international policing force, the EU foreign ministers do not seem
to share the view, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, whose country is holding the EU
presidency, has given a cautious response to Vranitzky's call,
saying that there should be a UN mandate for possible
international military intervention.
</P>
<P>
"The UN Security Council should formulate a mandate for the
troops, and the soldiers should know precisely what they are going to
do there," he told a Dutch television on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Danish foreign minister Niels Helveg Petersen, whose
country currently holds the presidency of the OSCE, said on Friday
night that a decision on what to do must be made in the next two
days.

<HEADLINE> PLC Working Group Drafts Rules of Procedure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The rules of procedure working
group under the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) has finished
the drafting of the rules of procedure for the legislative arm of
the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese version of the draft will be submitted to the PLC
plenary session, scheduled for next Saturday, for approval, said
Selina Chow, convenor of the sub-group, following a closed-door
meeting of her team in Shenzhen this morning.
</P>
<P>
Chow told a press briefing here that in accordance with the
relevant articles of the Basic Law and two related documents
endorsed by the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR, the team
discussed the terms of reference of the PLC and its rules of
procedure.
</P>
<P>
The PLC will enact the laws indispensable to the HKSAR, as
empowered by the Preparatory Committee, and the laws will not go
into effect until July 1.
</P>
<P>
"Three Readings", a practice which is adopted by the current
Legislative Council, was included in the draft, as it has been
proved efficient in the normal operation of a legislature, Chow
noted.
</P>
<P>
She continued to point out that the draft was finished in a
very short time. "We must have the rules of procedure ready to be
used as soon as possible," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Two working groups were set up at the PLC's plenary session in
February, one on administrative matters and the other on rules of
procedure, each having 12 members.
</P>
<P>
Then the panels had closed-door meetings respectively in
Shenzhen on weekends.

<HEADLINE> Charter Change Advocates Take to Streets in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Constitutional
amendment supporters took to the streets here today to press their
demand for a second term for President Fidel Ramos whose term will
expire in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The paraders were supporters of the People's Initiative for
Reform, Modernization and Action (PIRMA), an organization which
has undertaken a signature-collecting campaign in the past few
months to press for a plebiscite on charter changes.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators carried banners with slogans reading "Let the
People Decide" and "Sign for PIRMA" while marching on a street
leading to the Senate this afternoon. Organizers said earlier that
the marchers will also proceed to the Supreme Court and the
Commission on Elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press, at lease one million supporters
of Ramos were to stage nationwide rallies today to counter some
anti-charter change groups which have started rallies in key
cities.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA failed to submit some six million signatures it
claimed it had collected on March 12 after a water leak in its
office reportedly destroyed some 300,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Hector Villanueva recently disclosed that
Malacanang (the Presidential Palace) was behind the PIRMA.
However, President Ramos has flatly denied that he would stay in
power beyond 1998.

<HEADLINE> Opening-up Is Key to Development for Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Opening to the outside world is
of major importance for the future development of Chongqing,
China's largest municipality directly under the central
government, and now the largest city in the world, according to
the city's Acting Mayor Pu Haiqing.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Pu said he believes
that Chongqing, as the largest industrial and commercial city in
southwest China, is one of the most ideal spots in the country for
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has just been separated from Sichuan Province to
become China's fourth municipality, after Beijing, Tianjin, and
Shanghai. The decision is seen as a major move to promote economic
growth in the country's less-developed central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
The new municipality has a population of 30.02 million and
covers an area of over 80,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
As the first Chinese inland foreign trade port city, which
leads the western region in all foreign trade indicators,
Chongqing has laid a solid foundation for opening up to the
outside world, noted 55-year-old Pu.
</P>
<P>
The city has already set up two State-level economic and
hi-tech development zones, which is rare even in large Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
As a heavy industry base, Chongqing boasts strong auto,
machinery, metallurgical, and chemical industries, providing
numerous investment opportunities for large overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Its favorable location along the banks of the Yangtze River,
China's longest, makes it the the leading water transportation hub
of western China, which also offers convenience to overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing construction of the Three Gorges Project at the
Yangtze is a plus for attracting overseas funds, and will tempt
more overseas financial institutions to open business in
Chongqing, Pu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He believes Chongqing's municipality status plus the
preferential policies enjoyed by the Three Gorges Project will
enable the city to have more autonomy in the opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
"As an investment boom is expected, it is urgently necessary to
further simplify procedures for overseas investors, to set up a
center where overseas business people can file complaints, and to
launch a project data bank, so as to further improve the
investment environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pu became acting mayor of Chongqing in April, 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
Economists share the view that that Chongqing has the country's
greatest potential for economic growth, Lin said, pointing out
that the city is similar to the large eastern cities in terms of
economic foundation and its degree of openness to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
And Chongqing will be a springboard for bringing foreign
investment to west China, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Chongqing's special function as a municipality is
closely related to its location: as the largest port on the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River, Chongqing is an important gateway
for the shipment of goods from Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces to the east.
</P>
<P>
In terms of economic strength and structure, Chongqing is the
largest industrial and commercial center in southwest China and is
situated at the rear of the Yangtze Economic Belt, Lin noted.
</P>
<P>
As a municipality, the city will able to use its powerful
administrative authority to adjust industrial structure and
intensify economic cooperation with province-level areas in
southwest China, and to help distribute the abundant natural and
human resources in the southwest, he added.
</P>
<P>
The areas surrounding Chongqing have pinned high hopes on the
city's chance of becoming a municipality. "Through Chongqing, it
will be convenient for us to arrive at the Yangtze River to the
north, and reach Shanghai to the east," said Liu Fangren,
secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Guizhou started a transportation project to reach the
Yangtze and other waters several years ago. Lu Wanli, director of
the Guizhou Provincial Transportation Department, said that in the
next five years, Chongqing and Guizhou will jointly invest several
 billion yuan in building a super-highway from Chongqing to the
coastal areas in the coastal Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region via
Guiyang, capital of Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Delin, secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party
Committee, said that the municipality of Chongqing will promote
the urbanization process and better serve the resettlement of over
one million people for the construction of the Three Gorges
Project on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"The 30 million people of Chongqing now have taken up a
glorious and arduous task," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Major Move to Speed up Development of Central, West China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The upgrading of Chongqing's
status from a city in Sichuan Province to a municipality directly
under the central government is a significant move to speed up the
development of the country's central and western areas, economics
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
"The upgrading of Chongqing's status is not a result of the
city's need to seek greater administrative authority along with
its increased economic strength," senior economist Lin Ling
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"It is a result of the country's need to readjust the country's
economic structure, to achieve the sustained, stable and healthy
development of the national economy, and to coordinate the
development of east and west China," said Lin, director-general of
the China Comprehensive Development Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing became China's fourth municipality, following formal
approval by the just-concluded Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress. The other three municipalities are
Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The central and west areas, which include 18 provinces and
autonomous regions, account for 86 percent of the China's
territory and 58 percent of the country's population. Historical
legacies and restrictive natural conditions have caused the
economic development of central and west China to lag behind the
coastal areas in the east.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the widening gap between the east and west in
economic growth has attracted widespread attention; some of the
wealthiest areas in the country are located along the lower
reaches of the Yangtze River, while the country's largest
poverty-stricken region can be found along the upper reaches,
where nearly 20 million people live below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the most developed area and the most
underdeveloped area along Yangtze in terms of the per-capita GDP
has widened from 2:1 in 1990 to 4:1.
</P>
<P>
The disproportionate economic growth of the upper and lower
reaches of the Yangtze is most illustrative of the imbalanced
development of west, central and east China, analysts said.

MAPUTO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- President Joaquim Chissano
endorsed a new anti-drug act today to replace the old one in the
colonial era, which deals stricter with drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
During debate at sessions of the Republican Assembly before

<P>
But most of the mps favored treating cannabis as other drugs.

The new act stipulates that those who plant, produce, sell and

imprisonment. And those who illegally distribute or smuggle drugs
will be sent to the prison for as long as 30 years.

<P>
SINGAPORE, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government today
urged the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) of the country
to do more to upgrade themselves to take advantage of the economic
opportunities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a function of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (SCCCI), Trade and Industry Minister Lee
Yock Suan said that the government will continue to help the SMEs,
but they must also do their part to venture out.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the SMEs take part in overseas trade
delegations, access new information networks, and make use of the
government's assistance schemes.
</P>
<P>
To stay competitive, the SMEs must also improve their
management methods and tighten their cost control to meet the
demands of shorter product life cycles.
</P>
<P>
In the retail sector, which had been struggling with continued
sluggishness of the market, the minister said, the SMEs need to
seek new product lines or diversify into new businesses.
</P>
<P>
Some of the potential fields for the SMEs in the retail sector
were property, tourism, trade and industrial areas like
electronics, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Go out to Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Quite a lot of Nigerians today
have gone out of their houses to vote in the local government
council elections on party basis, a major step under the military
government's transition to civil rule.
</P>
<P>
In Lagos, Nigeria's largest city and commercial center, the
situation is calm and orderly. As the government has imposed a
traffic restriction, there are few vehicles except those of
patrolling police and election officials.
</P>
<P>
At a polling station on the Victoria Island, voters have kept
coming since 8:00 in the morning, when the polling started
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
By the time of the press, the presiding election official said
some 300 people have cast their ballots. About 800 voters are
registered at the station and are expected to come by 4:00 in the
afternoon, when the polling will end.
</P>
<P>
Voters produce their registration cards to the officials at
the station. They are then given two ballots, one for local
government councillors and one for chairmen.
</P>
<P>
On each ballot are the names of the five political parties
contesting for the elections. The voters thumbprint the party of
their choice on the ballots and drop them into the ballot boxes
of the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON).
</P>
<P>
A councillor contestant of the Democratic Party of Nigeria
said his party has a high chance to win both in the Lagos State
and nationwide.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence in the ongoing elections, saying
that unlike the aborted elections in 1993, none of the political
parties this time are government parties.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are some 56 million people, or slightly more
than half of the whole population that are registered as voters,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figure is quite high as official census says about 45
percent of the population are children under 15 and three percent
elders above 64.
</P>
<P>
A young man who came to the polling station for a look said he
was not registered because he is busy in finding a job. Besides,
he said, he does not know who is who of those parties.
</P>
<P>
The result of the elections is expected to be known later
today, according to election officials.

<P>
MACAO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Macao today staged a contest of
dramas among nine middle schools in a bid to enhance the awareness
 of students and local residents on protecting the legitimate
rights of consumers.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the activities to mark the "March 15 --
World Consumers' Rights Day" in Macao, said a spokesman for the
Macao Consumers' Commission, a non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that his commission stages various kinds
of events every year to increase consumers' awareness of the
importance of protecting their own rights.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commission has suggested that the authorities
make laws on the safety of products and establish a "consumers'
voluntary arbitration center."
</P>
<P>
Disputes concerning consumers' rights were rarely reported in
the territory. But the commission did warn consumers sometimes of
possible danger of some products.
</P>
<P>
The Macao government has also stepped up protection of the
rights of tourists. In a latest move, the Government Tourism
Office has established a "Tourist Aid Center", which accepts
complaints from tourists during their stay in Macao. So far, it
has helped the rebate of over 1.16 million patacas (about 146,800
US dollars) from shop owners who cheated tourists.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Hailed in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's newspapers today
devoted pages to reporting the Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) which closed in Beijing Friday.
</P>
<P>
The NPC meeting, which passed two laws, eight resolutions and
three legal decisions, was described by many local newspapers as
very "successful and fruitful".
</P>
<P>
An editorial carried on today's Ta Kung Pao said the session
was very "democratic and practical".
</P>
<P>
It said the conference paid great attention to Hong Kong's
smooth transition, prosperity and stability. The Draft on how to
elect deputies from the HKSAR to the Ninth NPC and the HKSAR
Preparatory Committee Work Report were both passed with strong
support from NPC members, which showed that the efforts to form
the HKSAR government have been highly praised and fully
acknowledged by the whole people.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily said that since China initiated
its opening and reform policy, great progress has been scored in
the introduction of a complete legal system. In the past year
alone, the NPC has passed over 20 laws and regulations, and many
more are being discussed.
</P>
<P>
"There is still much work to do for China to institute a united
and complete legal system, but the fundamental laws have been
gradually completed, and laws concerning certain areas have
already been framed," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po used pages of pictures and reports to brief
Chongqing City to Hong Kong people. Chongqing, previously
governed by Sichuan province, won approval Friday from the NPC to
become China's fourth municipality directly under the central
government.
</P>
<P>
One of its reports said this is a wise decision and that the
new status would enable Chongqing to accelerate the development in
China's central west regions, and to speed up the undertaking of
the great Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Most Hong Kong newspapers agreed that the session showed the
Chinese leadership headed by Jiang Zemin will continue to abide by
the policies of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the view that China will surely be able to
maintain its economic growth momentum and that its overall
situation will become even better.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Supreme Defense
Committee has decided to close the border between Yugoslavia and
Albania and ordered its border-keeping forces to be on the red
alert, a military spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Novinska Agencija Tanjug, the spokesman of the
office of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army said the Yugoslav
government is taking precautionary measures to avoid possible
negative impacts from the deteriorating situation in Albania on
the national security of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Though the chaos in Albania has not posed direct threat to
Yugoslavia so far and the situation at the border areas remains
calm, there exist possibilities of border conflicts if the
situation in Albania worsens, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the government feared that a large number of Albanian
refugees might swarm into Yugoslavia with arms and ammunitions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the government feared that some Albanian extremists
living in Kosovo bordering Albania might be encouraged to snatch
weapons from local army and police for terrorist attacks, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to avoid any possible bad results, the Yugoslav
border-keeping forces and the navy have coordinated with each
other in patrolling, he said, adding that a security zone has been
set up in the districts bordering Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav special forces and the Air Force were also on a
alert, he said.

LUMUT, Malaysia, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Vice Admiral
Yang Yushu, commander of East China Sea Fleet of the Chinese PLA
Navy, met here today with Rear Admiral Mohd Hussain Bin Tamby,
fleet operations commander of the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN).
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both stressed the need for promoting mutual
understanding and strengthening friendship between the two navies
through exchange of visits to make contributions to the
development of friendship between the armed forces of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Hussain told the Chinese commander that "you have not only
brought in beautiful naval ships, but also brought in the deep
friendship of the Chinese people to Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
Yang Yushu said that with the further development of relations
between China and Malaysia, the friendship between the two armed
forces is also strengthening.
</P>
<P>
"We are here as peace promoters and I believe that the exchange
of visits is conducive to further cementing the relationship
between our two navies and will write a new page in the history of
contacts between our two navies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two commanders also briefed each other on the general facts
of the respective navy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese commander came here earlier today at the invitation
of the RMN with two Chinese naval ships -- missile destroyer
"Qingdao" and missile frigate "Tongling" -- which called at the
Lumut port for a three-day friendly visit to Malaysia. This is the
first visit of Chinese naval ships to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Lumut, located in Malaysia's northwest state of Perak, about
288 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur, is the largest navy base in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Malaysia, Commander Yang Yushu is also
scheduled to meet RMN Chief Ahmad Ramli Mohamed Noor while the
Chinese sailors will have friendly football and basketball
matches with their Malaysian counterparts.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The army command in northern
Uganda has had a ''minor change''in a bid to cope with the rebels
there better, The New Vision paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Army sources in the fourth division in the north were quoted
as saying the aim of the reorganization is to uproot the
rebellion in the north.
</P>

of the fourth division, ''has been away for some days now from

Many other officers have joined the combing operations in the
areas suspected to be the hideouts of the rebels, and many rebels
have either been killed or were forced to surrender to the
Ugandan army in the operations, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
The change in the army command in the north also involved

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Economic Growth Expected to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- After up and down years, the Asian
economic growth is expected to stabilize this year though the
current export performance has showed no sign of a quick recovery.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the economic growth of the developing Asia slowed down
its pace after export in the region was hard hit by cyclical
downturns in electronics. From 8.3 percent in 1994, the growth
rate declined to 7.9 percent in 1995 and 7.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The marginal decline in the growth rate is also due partly to
steps taken by governments like China and Malaysia to prevent
overheating of their economies.
</P>
<P>
However, Asia's growth rate last year was still at least twice
as high as those in the West.
</P>
<P>
"I think '94 and '95 were kind of excessive years and '96 was a
period of adjustment; '97 should be a much stable year," said Neil
Saker, senior regional economist at Crosby Securities Pte. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
A recovery in exports and increased foreign investment should
see the economy emerge from its "adjustment period" and continue
to grow at an average of 7.3 percent to 7.8 percent in 1997,
economists predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank predicted last November that the
export growth slide will give way to a recovery by the first
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the current export performance in the region is proving a
slow slog, and in some countries drops in exports have been
reported since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade deficit widened to 3.48 billion U.S.
dollars in January from a shortfall of 2.13 billion a year earlier
due to the country's sharp drop in exports of semi-conductors.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports of semi-conductors fell 44 percent
year-to-year in the month, to 1.22 billion dollars, affected by
weak prices on international markets.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, non-oil domestic exports in January dropped 3.1
percent to 5.16 billion dollars from a year earlier. The weak
performance of the electronics sector was underlined by a 8.3
percent drop in exports of semi-conductor components compared with
the corresponding period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But economists remain optimistic about the recovery, because
indicators such as the U.S. semi-conductor book-to-bill ratio and
industrial growth rate in member countries of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development suggested the export growth
will speed up in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
They generally agree that last year's poor export performance
was largely cyclical and not structural in nature, that is why a
rebound is widely anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Yet they stressed that any recovery in exports will be uneven
-- China's rebound is evident while some of its neighbors,
including Thailand and South Korea, will remain in the doldrums,
and may not become fully apparent until the second quarter of the
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the expected upturn in exports, analysts cited
lower inflation in Asian countries as good signs of stable growth.
In most Asian economies, there are few alarm bells sounding over
inflation now, economists said.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, the inflation rate is projected at 4.7 percent
this year, 0.2 percent higher than last year's figure. Analysts
surveyed by research institutions expect China's consumer price
inflation to rise slightly from 8.3 percent last year to 9.1
percent in 1997 thanks to higher utility and commodity prices.
That is far better than the double-digit levels of a few years
back, they said.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, inflation in February rose only 4.4 percent
from the same month of 1996, and the date is making the
government's target of 6-7 percent inflation for the year "more
achievable."
</P>
<P>
Another good sign for stable growth is the decline of the
Japanese yen against other Asian currencies, because it will
reduce deficit in the current account, a broad measure of trade in
goods and services. The weaker yen helped lower the cost of the
flood of Japanese machines and components that are imported by
manufacturers across the region.
</P>
<P>
As large deficits are often a sign of overheated economies, the
reduction in deficits would attract more foreign investors and
mean stable growth, economists said.
</P>
<P>
If the favorable trends continue to develop, the Asian economy
will achieve steady and smooth growth this year, they said.

<HEADLINE> Donors to Give Big Sum for Ethiopia's Social </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral and multilateral
donors have agreed to give 655 million U.S. Dollars to projects
in Ethiopia's sectors of health and education, resident
representative of the World Bank here Fayez Omar has said.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Herald reported today that the representative
made the announcement Friday at the end of a three-day workshop
organized by the government on Ethiopia's social sector
investment programs and indicative budgetary support of donors at
Debre Zeit, 40 kms east of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Omar said out of the 655 million Dollars, 323 million was
meant for the health sector which was the very amount the sector
needed.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the sum of 332 million for the
education sector accounts for just 70 percent of the expected
amount and that it was short by a hefty 148 million Dollars,
elevating the total required funds to not less than 480 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
But, he said that there is a room for optimism as there are
many donors, who did not participate in the workshop and hence
could not propose their pledges and that this gap in the
financing of the education sector could be filled when they show
up with their pledges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the report, the World Bank has pledged
to allocate 340 million Dollars at the workshop, out of which 150
million Dollars will be disbursed for the health and the
remaining 190 million Dollars for the education sector.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebel Leader Meets UN Envoy in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebel leader Laurent
Kabila refused to effect a cease-fire while meeting the U. N.
special envoy to the Great Lakes region Mohammed Sahnoun in
Uganda's northern town of Gulu on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mass media here reported today that Kabila entered Uganda
through Entebbe airport, 40 km south of here on Wednesday and was
immediately flown to Gulu town where he met the Ugandan President
Y. Museveni before meeting Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
Kabila reportedly rejected pleas y Sahnoun for a cease-fire
in the five month offensive against Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko, saying it could only be considered if Mobutu declared his
willingness to hold direct talks with the Democratic Forces of
Alliance for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) led by him.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela last month failed to
broker direct talks between Mobutu's envoy and Kabila and a mini
African summit will be held in Nairobi on March 19 in a bid to
solve the Zaire crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tusis-led ADFL rebel forces took up arms to fight Mobutu last
October and they are marching toward Kisangani, the third largest
city in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, a regional power broker, accused by Zaire of backing
Kabila who facilitated the face to face meeting, has refused to
take sides, diplomats here were quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> S. African Govt Plans to Wipe Out Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is planning to launch an extensive campaign to wipe
out smuggling in a bid to improve trade revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
A local daily The Citizen today quoted Deputy Finance Minister
Gill Marcus as saying that the restructuring of the customs and
excise department was possibly the government's toughest
challenge in the reformation of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a budget workshop in Midrand, north of
Johannesburg, Marcus said measures, among others, targeted to
stop smuggling of goods in and out of the country included
slashing the number of international airports and restructuring
border posts.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the government had to regain control of
traffic through the country's border posts and eliminate the lack
of control at the numerous international airports, she said.
</P>
<P>
Marcus said the number of international airports would be cut
from 36 at preset to about eight, while the border posts would be
reduced from 118 to 16.
</P>
<P>
In his Budget speech on Wednesday, Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel said high tariffs had led to a greater incentive for tax
evasion by way of illicit trade.
</P>
<P>
Manuel announced a 20 percent tariffs cut on a range of goods,
including video recording and audio equipment, motorcycles,
beauty and hair care preparations, clothing and furs, spectacles
and watches.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, the revenue loss resulted from tariffs cut
would be partially offset by improved collections because of a
reduction in smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Naval Ships Call at Lumut Base in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUMUT, Malaysia, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese naval ships
under the command of Vice Admiral Yang Yushu, Commander of East
China Sea Fleet of the Chinese PLA Navy arrived at the Lumut port
here today for a three-day friendly visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Lumut, located in Malaysia's northwest state of Perak, about
288 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur, is the largest navy base in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, commander Yang Yushu said in a written
statement that "This is the first visit of Chinese naval ships to
Malaysia. We come for friendship, we come for promoting mutual
understanding and exchanges, and we come for strengthening the
friendly relations between the two armed forces and especially
between the two navies."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that this visit would surely further
enhance the continuous development of the friendly relations
between the two peoples, two armed forces and two navies of China
and Malaysia and write a new page in the history of contacts
between the two navies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese naval ships were welcomed at the berth 4 of the
base by Assistant Chief of Staff of the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN)
and other senior RMN officers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ships came in after visiting Sattahip, Thailand.

and Missile Frigate Tongling -- will meet the Malaysian fleet
operations commander, Rear Admiral Mohd Hussain Bin Tamby, and the

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Urged to Reform Rural Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank, one of the largest
donors to Bangladesh, has underlined in a study the importance of
carrying out reforms in the country's rural financing in order to
achieve the desired growth of the economy.
</P>
<P>
With the reform, the bank hoped, financial services would be
available to poor sections of the rural population who currently
have no access to such service, especially small and marginal
farmers and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The future of Bangladesh's economy, which is still rural based,
lies in the development of farming and farm-related activities,
said the study published here today.
</P>
<P>
The reform in rural financing is necessary since the current
operating environment "threatens to constrain further
development," said the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Three types of lending institutions now exist in Bangladesh:
public-sector institutions (agriculture banks and nationalized
commercial banks), member-based institutions like Grameen Bank and
 informal financial intermediaries like money lenders, traders and
dealers.
</P>
<P>
The rural financial market is fragmented, inefficient and
inadequate, said the World Bank, which suggested that policy and
institutional reforms should be carried out soon.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that when efficient and cost-effective financial
services are made available, Bangladesh will have created an
environment for entrepreneurship, innovation and production of the
rural population, thereby helping the growth of the entire
economy.

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion in Indonesia Causes Heavy Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is losing 315 million
U.S. dollars each year as a result of soil erosion in river basins
in Java, an expert said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop on a system to monitor changes in the
soil of East Java's Brantas River held Friday in Malang, East
Java, Cahyaningtas, expert of the Indonesian Institute of
Sciences, said soil erosion is one of the impacts of an imbalanced
hydrological system.
</P>
<P>
The imbalanced hydrological system has also led to
sedimentation, reports reaching here today quoted the expert as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The loss caused by sedimentation reached an average of 91
million dollars a year, she said.
</P>
<P>
The erosion and sedimentation would worsen the surface water
supply situation in Java, where more than 60 percent of the
Indonesians are living, she added.
</P>
<P>
Demand for surface water in Java reached 721 million cubic
meters in 1990 and will increase to 998 million cubic meters in
1997, she said.

BELGRADE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Most Yugoslav diplomats in the
Albanian capital Tirana were evacuated on Friday, leaving only two

The helicopters were fired on as they took off from the Tirana

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Faces Shortage of Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Lack of medical workers,
especially doctors, is one of the problems facing skilled
labor-thirsty Thailand today after its economic success and the
government is taking measures to correct the situation.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently has about 13,400 doctors practicing
nationwide, but it needs at least 15,000 more to take care of its
60 million population, in particular in the rural areas, according
to the Thai Public Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The most serious situation is seen in the country's remote
northeastern region, where one doctor has to serve 10,740 people.
</P>
<P>
Bangkokians are lucky to have the highest doctor-population
ratio of 1 to 909 in the country, as nearly half of the country's
doctors are working in the capital for better medical facilities
and good salaries.
</P>
<P>
The draining of doctors from the public sector to the private
sector, or from rural areas to cities, further undermines the
country's public health care.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only about 6,400 doctors work at hospitals under the
Public Health Ministry. Many doctors or medical students go to
private hospitals for better earnings or to government health
administrative agencies.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the doctor shortage, the Chavalit government
recently set up a special national commission, together with the
introduction of incentives and compulsory measures to retain
doctors.
</P>
<P>
At its first meeting chaired by Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh on Friday, the commission approved significant
increases in wages for doctors working in hospitals' high-risk
areas, ranging from 2,700 to 20,000 baht (108 to 800 U.S. dollars)
per month, to boost their morale.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Public Health Ministry is considering hiking
salaries to 4 million or 5 million baht (160,000 or 200,000
dollars) for those doctors who received their education under
government scholarships and want to quit working in the government
hospitals before completing their term.
</P>
<P>
Doctors who do not complete a three-year term in government-run
hospitals currently are liable to a fine of 400,000 baht (16,000
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Athasit Vejjajiva, rector of Thailand's well-known Mahidol
University, also suggested that the Public Health Ministry should
encourage more doctors to work at hospitals while employing
administrative officials from other sectors like the economic
sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Thai government is urging public and private
universities to bring up more medical students each year to help
ease the country's doctor shortage.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 12 government universities and one private
university produce 850 to 900 doctors each year. The Thai Public
Health and University Affairs Ministries have worked out two
special programs to produce 640 more each year.
</P>
<P>
The government is also considering attracting Thai doctors
working aboard to return to Thailand but requiring them to undergo
additional training.
</P>
<P>
On the average, one doctor now has to take care of about 4,300
people in Thailand. Thai health officials said it would take at
least 20 years for their country to get enough doctors, or one
doctor for every 1,800 people.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Government to Seek Confidence Vote Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali coalition
government, which took office last Wednesday, will seek a vote of
confidence in the parliament before March 23, the official news
agency RSS today quoted a minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Supplies Minister Gajendra Narayan Singh said Friday in a
southern Nepali town that the present eight-member cabinet led by
Lokendra Bahadur Chand will be expanded after the government wins
the confidence vote in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Singh, also president of the Nepal Goodwill Party (NSP), a
ruling partner of the newly-formed coalition led by Chand's
National Democratic Party (RPP), said the three-party government
will make its policies and programs public soon.
</P>
<P>
Another partner of the ruling coalition is the Communist Party
of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), the largest party in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Chand's RPP and Singh's NSP were ruling partners of the former
three-party government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali
Congress (NC) party, which resigned last week after losing a
confidence vote in the house partly due to the two ruling
partners' withdrawal from the coalition.

prefectures to check afforestation efforts. Besides, local
governments also provided tree seedlings, chemical fertilizers and
techniques to guide the tree planting drive.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the afforestation project using World Bank
loans for planting 13,000 ha of trees in the province is going on
with speed with 80 percent having been completed.

MOSCOW, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan's President
Saparmurad Niyazov said today he did not feel uneasy over the
enlargement plans of the NATO military alliance.

participation are a decisive factor in NATO's eastward expansion
and the establishment of a future security system.

<HEADLINE> India's Foreign Exchange Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The foreign exchange assets of
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are estimated to have surged by a
massive 600 million U.S. dollars during the past seven days to
reach 20.6 billion dollars on Friday, RBI sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The surge witnessed last week is 200 million more than the 400
million mopped up by the RBI in the week after the union budget
tabled before the parliament on February 28.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said the figure is expected to go up further on account
of the increased inflows of foreign institutional investors (FII)
as well as the continuous RBI buying in the foreign exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
RBI Governor C. Rangarajan has indicated that the central bank
would continue to intervene in the foreign exchange market to mop
up U.S. dollars in order to stop the rupee from appreciating
further.
</P>
<P>
The net FII inflows totaled 98.6 million dollars in the first
11 days of this month. The total investment inflow since the
beginning of the current calendar year is 276.9 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of foreign direct investment in 1996 was 2.4 billion
dollars, 300 million more than the inflow in 1995, but 1.6 billion
less than the United Front government's target for the year.

<HEADLINE> Yangpu Development Zone Sees Large Investment Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Yangpu Economic Development
Zone in south China's Hainan Province has become a base for large
investment projects.
</P>
<P>
On March 7, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC)
announced that it will invest 5.5 billion yuan (about 1.87 billion
US dollars) to build China's largest fertilizer production base in
the Yangpu Economic Development Zone on the northwest tip of
Hainan island and about 140 km from the capital of Haikou.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the project will start in the latter half of
this year and is expected to be completed by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Three other major investment projects involving paper pulp,
glass and grain processing, with a combined investment exceeding
24.5 billion yuan, have also chosen Yangpu for their site and will
soon start construction.
</P>
<P>
Discussion on eight similar large projects, including an oil
refinery, polyethylene plant, and automobile assembly plant has
entered substantial stage, according to an official of the
development zone.
</P>
<P>
Yangpu, located in northwest Hainan, China's youngest province,
and facing the Beibu Gulf, was approved to be an economic
development zone by the State Council in 1992. It covers an area
of 31 sq km, 27.353 sq km of which was set aside for foreign
investment for 70 years in a package.
</P>
<P>
The developers, headed by Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) Limited,
have planned to invest 18 billion Hong Kong dollars in basic
construction within 15 years and build the area into an
export-oriented industrial port city with a population of 400,000
and 60 billion yuan worth of industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Since overall construction started in March 1993, 5.3 billion
yuan have been put into basic construction. Among the major
facilities which have been completed are a 315,500-kw power plant,
a supporting oil wharf and electricity grid, infrastructural
facilities in the central district, and a modernized posts and
telecommunications project.

<HEADLINE> Duma Tells Yeltsin to be Tough on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma (the lower
house of parliament) today sent a letter to President Boris
Yeltsin demanding he take a hard line with U.S. President Bill
Clinton on NATO's eastward expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
The letter won support from 268 of the 450 representatives of
of the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The letter said NATO's eastward expansion will change the
present European geo-political situation, damaging European
security and interests, and create a new division in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The representatives asked Yeltsin to safeguard the principles
of mutual respect, equal rights, and a pan-European security
system in his Helsinki talk with Clinton scheduled next week.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded Yeltsin safeguard and consolidate Russia's
stand in talks over reductions in strategic weapons.
</P>
<P>
This is the second document the State Duma has passed this week
to express its objection to NATO expansion. The first document was
issued Tuesday, which stressed that Russia and NATO should observe
all agreements regulating bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE>   Violence Forces Thousands of Families to Flee Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 180,000
people, mainly women and children, fled their homes in Colombia
last year because of violence.
</P>
<P>
Threats, assassinations, disappearances, attacks and torture,
often directed against men, were the main reasons forcing families
to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Human Rights and Displaced Persons office
said the problem affected 36,202 households last year, and said four
households were displaced by violence every hour.
</P>
<P>
Paramilitary forces were responsible for causing one third of
the displacements, while guerrilla groups forced 29 percent of the
displacements.
</P>
<P>
The report also says that 27 percent of the families forced to
flee came from poor areas in the capital Bogota and neighboring
districts.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the report estimates 900,000 people have been
displaced.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Naval Ships Call at Lumut Base in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lumut (Malaysia), March 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese naval ships
under the command of Vice Admiral Yang Yushu, commander of the
East China Sea Fleet of the Chinese PLA Navy, arrived at the Lumut
port here today for a three-day friendly visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Chinese naval ships have visited
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"We come for friendship, we come for promoting mutual
understanding and exchanges and we come for strengthening the
friendly relations between the two armed forces and especially
between the two navies," Commander Yang said in a written
statement upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that this visit would surely further
enhance the continuous development of the friendly relations
between the two peoples, two armed forces and two navies of China
and Malaysia and open a new page in the history of contacts
between the two navies.
</P>
<P>
Lumut, located in Malaysia's northwestern state of Perak, about
288 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur, is the largest naval base in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese naval ships were welcomed at the base by the
assistant chief of staff of the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) and
other senior RMN officers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ships came here after visiting Sattahib, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
During the visit in Malaysia, Commander Yang and commanding
officers of the two ships -- missile destroyer Qingdao and missile
frigate Tongling -- will meet the Malaysian fleet operations
commander, Rear Admiral Mohd Hussain Bin Tamby and RMN chief Ahmad
Ramli Mohamed Noor.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sailors will also have football and basket ball
matches with their Malaysian counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Furious at Drug Censure by U.S. House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Mexican politicians and
leaders united today to strongly condemn a vote by the U.S. House
of Representatives censuring Mexico's anti-drug efforts, calling
the vote unacceptable and damaging to U.S.-Mexican relations.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government rejected the decision as an
"unacceptable" attempt to interfere in its internal affairs which
would hurt bilateral drug cooperation and only benefit drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Thursday to censure
Mexico over its anti-drug efforts. The resolution could led to the
overturning of President Bill Clinton's "certification" of Mexico
as an ally in the fight against drugs, unless Clinton reports
within 90 days that Mexico has made substantial progress in
improving its anti-drugs performance.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton certified Mexico as an ally on February 28 in
his annual review which grants or withholds certification to many
countries based on their cooperation with the U.S. in the fight
against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Jose Murat, the president of the Mexican Senate Foreign
Relations Commission, said the U.S. resolution violates
international legal principles, and demanded respect for Mexico's
national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Murat, a senator from Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI), said actions of that kind only erode the healthy,
fruitful and respectful bilateral relations between the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
Augusto Gomez, president of the Foreign Relations Commission of
the Chamber of Deputies, said Mexicans are facing a stampede of
the most reactionary forces in the United States, who want to take
advantage of the situation to promote xenophobia against Mexico
and Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Mexican government to defend its sovereignty
and urge the United Nations and the Organization of American
States to declare themselves against attitudes that offend the
sovereignty and self-determination of other nations.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator of the deputies of the Democratic Revolutionary
Party, Pedro Etienne, said his party rejects and condemns the
intervention of the U.S. Congress in Mexico's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He called on Mexican legislators take a decisive stand to
defend the national sovereignty during the Mexico-United States
Interparliamentarian Meeting scheduled for April 22.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the President of the Government Commission of the
Federal District Representatives Assembly, Manuel Jimenez, said it
is unfair that the war on drugs in Mexico should be conditioned to
a 90-day deadline, since fighting this scourge is a matter that
only Mexicans should decide.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Fernandez, the general secretary of Popular Socialist
Party, said the U.S. government does not have the moral authority
to certify the work of other countries in their fight against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House's resolution must still clear the Senate before
becoming law and even then could face a presidential veto. U.S
President Bill Clinton criticized the vote, saying it was " the
wrong way to protect the interests of the American people."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the vote "unwise
and self-defeating," saying it would diminish the chance of making
more progress.

TIRANA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The gunfire which has echoed
around the capital Tirana was muted this evening after police and
military reinforcements appeared on the streets and a dusk to dawn
curfew was imposed.
</P>
<P>
About four to five armored vehicles carrying heavily-armed men
patrolled the main streets of the city, checking private cars,
especially those without license plates.
</P>
<P>
The usual crowds of shoppers have disappeared as shops in the
capital have all closed. Only a few people were out, running up
and down the main streets, giving out leaflets to journalists and
anyone else they could find.
</P>
<P>
Some of the leaflets read, "We should unite in the hard
times. Our children should not be without a motherland."
</P>
<P>
An emergency curfew has been imposed, forbidding people to go
out onto the streets from 19:00 to 07:00.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Forests Decrease Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's forests are now
disappearing at a rate of 100,000 hectares annually, a figure
which is tipped to rise as the nation's population and development
activities continue to increase, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesians must improve their awareness of the utilization of
natural resources which have been destroyed by uncontrolled
industrial and agricultural activities, State Minister of the
Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said in Bandung, West Java, at a
meeting of farmers held on Thursday, reports reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that although some of Indonesia's unique
biodiverse areas have been destroyed, the actual level of
devastated land classified as "critical" has remained stable.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that at the beginning of the Third
Five-Year Development Plan in 1981, the area of critical land
reached 11,073,300 hectares while in 1986 it was reduced to
10,415,000 hectares. In 1991, there were 13,188,200 hectares of
critical land and in 1996 the level was down to 11,003,317
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, forest fires in the country are on the rise,
especially in Java, and they have been blamed on public
negligence.
</P>
<P>
Reports said some 10,399 hectares of forests were destroyed by
fire between January and November last year, of which 5,500
hectares were in Central and East Java.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's forests covering 144 million hectares, or about
74.6 percent of its 193 million hectares of land, were recently
declared the earth's biggest and remaining functional "lung"
(apart from those in the Amazon of Brazil).
</P>
<P>
The country has been utilizing its forest resources on a full
scale in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
At present, forests-related exports have become the country's
third largest source of foreign exchange after oil and gas and
textiles.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urges Firms to Invest Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
urged big businesses in the country to invest overseas to build
and strengthen networks to penetrate foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Investing abroad would automatically create export
opportunities for Indonesia, Minister of Industry and Trade Tungky
Ariwibowo said Friday at an Indonesian-Moroccan business forum
here, according to official sources today.
</P>
<P>
The minister cited Morocco as an example of a possible
investment place which could be used by Indonesian businesses as a
springboard to the increasingly-closed European market.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has accorded Morocco's products, with 60
percent local content, duty-free entrance into its market.
</P>
<P>
"If we invest in Morocco, it means we open up opportunities to
enter Europe duty-free," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, State Minister of Investment Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo
suggested that Indonesia form a board to coordinate local
businesses investing overseas.
</P>
<P>
Some local businessmen also supported the government's
proposal, saying big businesses should pioneer foreign investment
to help medium-sized and small companies penetrate export market.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Fujian Xingye Bank (FXB),
which is now building a 33-story office compound in the Bund area
of Shanghai, has worked hard to enter the local financial market
in China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Xingye became the first Chinese bank from outside
Shanghai to settle in the city by opening a local branch, which
has been expanding rapidly ever since.
</P>
<P>
According to Gao Jianping, director of the FXB branch, his bank
will offer a series of new services, including newly-approved
foreign exchange businesses and supplying buyer's credits to
enterprises from Shanghai and Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
The FXB Shanghai branch, which was started with a capital of
100 million yuan and five million US dollars, collected 1.32
billion yuan in deposits, two billion yuan in total assets and 33
million yuan in profits by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the branch has increased its
assets to as much as three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The FXB Shanghai Branch has boosted the exchange and
cooperation in economic and financial fields between Shanghai and
Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that the branch has been part of the city's banking
sector and plans to become a regional banking institution based in
Shanghai and serving the whole Yangtze River Delta region.

TIRANA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian parliament tonight
gave a vote of confidence in the new all-party reconciliation
government led by Prime Minister Bashkim Fino by passing an
administrative program proposed by the new premier.
</P>
<P>
Fino listed the resumption of order and social stability,

government faces.
</P>
<P>
Fino also promised to prepare for parliamentary elections by

Albania has been in the grip of unrest since January after the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The protests turned violent two weeks ago after rebels looted
weapons from army depots and started fighting. Several cities in
southern Albania are now controlled by rebels and the armed
conflict has now moved to the north of the country and the capital
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
Unrest has been growing in Tirana itself. Mobs looted a
warehouse of 650 tons of flour on Thursday and raided security
force depots in search of guns.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha Thursday decided to deploy
tanks in front of the main institutions in the country and called

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine volcanologists have
warned residents in Legazpi, Albay Province, against entering a
six-kilometer-radius danger zone around the Mayon Volcano which
has become active with increased crater glow and sulfur emissions
during the past few days.
</P>
<P>
In a report to Albay's disaster coordination council Friday, Ed
Laguert, resident volcanologist of the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology, said the unstable condition of Mayon
has prompted the institute to raise its status to Alert 1,
signifying possible magnetic disturbance.
</P>
<P>
Observatory records showed continuous crater glow of the
volcano since January 20, he said.
</P>
<P>
Laguert said the seismic sensor at the Mayon Rest House Station
in Tabaco, Albay, detected 22 relatively high-level local
earthquakes on February 28.
</P>
<P>
He said sulfur dioxide emissions have also increased from the
background level of less than 200 tons to around 1,000 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologists' recommendation prohibits entry into the
six-kilometer permanent danger zone until a decline in the
activity of Mayon.
</P>
<P>
At least 78 people were killed when the volcano erupted on
February 2, 1993.

STOCKHOLM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish Athletics
Association has been saved from bankruptcy with a 11.3 million
Swedish crowns (1.5 million U.S. dollars) financial aid from the
the Swedish government, it was announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sports minister Leif Blomberg told a press conference the money
was to cover the loss from the 1995 World championships in
Gothenburg.
</P>
<P>
Blonberg said a number of unsatisfactory deals were made for
the Gothenburg championships, "but this does not in any way affect
the government's views on the possible Olympics in Stockholm in
2004."
</P>
<P>
The government has guaranteed the Stockholm Olympics
organisation 2.5 billion crowns (333 million U.S. dollars) if they
are awarded the games.
</P>
<P>
The Athletics Association made a total loss on the Gothenburg
championships of around 25 million crowns (2 million U.S. dollars)
on a turnover of five billion crowns (666 million U.S. dollars),
and AA chairman Bengt Westerberg said on Friday that "the help
from the government will keep the largest creditors off our backs
and save us from bankruptcy."
</P>
<P>
Westerberg, also chairman of Telia (Swedish Telecom) who are
owed a large sum from the championships, said he hoped the city of
Gothenburg would help fund the rest of the deficit.

<HEADLINE> Marriage Status of Shanghai People Changing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey in China's
largest city of Shanghai shows that people's idea of marriage is
undergoing big changes, as more couples are tying the knot at a
younger age, and divorce is becoming more common.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of single people above age 25 -- the standard
age for marriage according to an international marriage survey --
is on a general decline in the city, while the divorce rate is
rising, especially among young people, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
In China, the legal age for marriage is 22 for both men and
women.
</P>
<P>
Among the people between the ages of 22-29, about one-third of
the women are single, and more than half of the men.
</P>
<P>
Men account for 84 percent of the unmarried in the 30-49 age
group, five times the number of single women, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that among older single people, women
have higher education and better jobs than men.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that in Shanghai, one out of every 100 people
above 25 is divorced. In 1995, the total number of divorced people
reached 45,300, up 40 percent over the figure of 1990.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this indicates that Shanghai citizens have paid
greater attention to the quality of marriage in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of people who have remarried since 1990
stands at about 20,000 per year -- more than the figures in the
1980s, but still far lower than the number of people divorced each
year.
</P>
<P>
The survey concluded that the major obstacles for remarrying
are connected with difficulties involving property, housing and
children, as well as the traditional negative attitude toward
remarriage among older people.

ZHENGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's only museum for ancient
tombstones, in Xinan county in central China's Henan Province, has
been listed among museums under state protection.
</P>
<P>
The museum consists of caves and courtyards and has more than
1,400 tombstones dating from the Western Jin Dynasty to modern
times.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,200 are from the Tang Dynasty (618-907), and record
lives of people from all walks of life, from royal family members,
literati, and monks to ordinary people. It is for this reason that
the museum has been called "Qian Tang Zhi Zai" (Hall of a Thousand
Records of the Tang Dynasty).
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars say they value the stones for their
inscriptions, most of which were written by famous calligraphers,
such as Chu Suiliang, Yan Zhenqin, and Liu Gongquan -- all top
calligraphers from the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The museum was set up by Zhang Fang, a general who collected
tombstones discarded by tomb robbers in the 1920s.

</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Muster, ranked number two in the world, ended
Philippoussis' eight-match winning streak with a 6-3, 7-6 (10-8)
victory.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Cooperative projects launched
between domestic electronics manufacturers and some big
international firms are becoming a new growth impetus for the
industry in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the gross output and 80 percent of the
sales volume in Beijing's electronics sector have been achieved so
far by joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one trans-national electronics firms, including such big
names as ABB, Philips, Matsushita and Mitsubishi, have invested an
aggregate 600 million US dollars to open 89 joint ventures in the
city, which plans to develop the electronics sector into its No. 1
pillar industry.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale technological cooperation and the introduction of
advanced technology and equipment have encouraged the enterprises
to frequently update their products, such as optical fiber cables,
video recorders, personal computers, and household electric
appliances.
</P>
<P>
The industry expects its annual turnover to reach 55 billion
yuan (6.6 billion US dollars) by the year 2000, which will account
for nearly 14 percent of the nation's total.

<HEADLINE> Wenzhou Urban Cooperative Bank To Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Wenzhou, one of the first
Chinese cities to adopt market-led reforms, has been given the
go-ahead from the People's Bank of China to establish its urban
cooperative bank.
</P>
<P>
It will be the city's first public-held, local commercial bank,
according to local official sources.
</P>
<P>
Wenzhou is known for its booming private firms, which so far
number 40,000 and account for over 90 percent of the city's total
industrial production.
</P>
<P>
The new bank, Wenzhou Urban Cooperative, will be formed on the
basis of 29 local urban credit agencies. It will operate under one
legal person, with the state to hold 30 percent of the stock,
former credit agencies to share 50-60 percent, and other legal
person units to buy 20-30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the first credit agency was set up in the city and by
the end of last year, there were 48, with deposits amounting to
over five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local banking experts speak highly of the role of these credit
agencies in supporting the city's private sector, but note that an
urban cooperative bank should be set up to overcome the weak
points of these agencies, such as poor management.
</P>
<P>
The proposed urban cooperative bank is expected to be formally
established by October, according to the sources.

FUZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan businessmen and companies
have offered funding for 285 agricultural firms in the city of
Zhangzhou, in east China's Fujian Province.

<P>
The firms, involving a combined investment of more than 300

It has been a priority of the local government to attract

Zhangzhou. More preferential policies will be issued to support
expansion of the agricultural sector, local authorities say.
</P>
<P>
Zhangzhou used foreign funds to develop crop planting, animal
breeding and processing of agricultural and sideline products, and
agricultural management, they say.

1995 to 520 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Helsinki Talks May be Hardest Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that his summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton next
week would be the hardest talks since he became Russian president
in 1991 and the "hardest in the history of Russian-U.S. relations."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin did not exclude the possibility of a fruitless ending
to the talks, saying that "we will not make any compromise that
may weaken Russia's defense ability."
</P>
<P>
This is the Russian government's stand.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia will never agree to let Americans deploy
conventional weapons on the territories of eastern European
countries, formerly members of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Moscow, Yeltsin said he would also
insist that in no way should the Baltic and countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) be admitted as members of
NATO.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed his concern over a series of contacts NATO's
Secretary-General Javier Solana has made with leaders of CIS
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said that he resolutely opposed the idea
of changing Russia's negative stance on NATO expansion as a trade
off for receiving investment from the U.S.. The U.S. government
had promised to invest about four billion dollars in Russia if it
cooperated in NATO's eastward expansion.

<HEADLINE> Henan Protects Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The protected area of farmland
in central China's Henan Province, a major grain producer in the
country, has so far reached 7.3 million ha.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that this illustrates the province's success in
saving farmland from being overtaken for other uses.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the craze for building development zones
claimed a significant amount of farmland. The grain-growing area
also decreased as a result of the development of sideline
production in rural areas such as aquiculture and fruit
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
To curb the trend, the local government in 1994 worked out a
regulation to protect farmland, which strictly safeguarded the
production bases for grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the provincial government further strengthened its
management of farmland and reclaimed the right to approve the use
of land which had been transferred to lower-level governments.
</P>
<P>
It also launched a series of checks on idle farmland.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Shifts More State Assets to Service Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- China's leading economic center
of Shanghai has redistributed its state assets in key industries,
to facilitate its ambition to evolve into an international
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
More assets are directed to the service sector, which accounted
for 51.4 percent of the city's 95-billion-yuan state property at
the end of 1995, compared to two percent in the agricultural
sector and 46.6 percent in industry.
</P>
<P>
The insurance industry proved to be a rising star in the
service sector; its output value accounted for 24.8 percent of the
service industry in 1995, up from 20.6 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment of industrial structure also gave full play to
science and technology, which now adds 36 percent to Shanghai's
economic growth, up from 26 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the nationwide strategy of "encouraging large
state-owned enterprise groups and granting small state ventures
more management flexibility," 57 large state enterprise groups
have been formed in Shanghai to improve the quality of the assets.
</P>
<P>
"The redistribution of the state assets in the three industries
well serves the city's globalization goal, and also gives a real
boost to the state sector in Shanghai," said a local official with
the Administrative Office of State Assets.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Against Olympic Professionalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 14 (Xinhua) -- President Juan Antonio Samaranch
said on Friday that he opposed paying athletes to participate at
the Olympics and expressed doubts over the effectiveness of
pre-competition doping tests, just introduced into cycling.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch made clear he still believed in the Games' amateur
vocation as he decried the IAAF's decision to award event winners
and those setting new world records 50,000 U.S. dlllars a time at
last week's world indoor athletics championships in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"If the athletics world thinks that paying athletes money is a
good means of promoting the sport then that is their business,"
Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
But athletes in contrast participate in the Olympics "because
it is an honour to take part in the world's most important
sporting occasion," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
On the question of pre-race haemoglobin tests for drugtaking,
recently introduced by the International Cycling Union (UCI),
Samaranch told reporters he believed it was "too early to apply"
such a measure.
</P>
<P>
"The UCI, which is no stranger to the doping problem, deserves
our praise for taking this measure, but I hope it does not run
into legal problems in applying it", he said.
</P>
<P>
The tests are designed to deter the use of EPO, or
erythropoietin, a drug produced to treat kidney disease and used
to increase oxygen-carrying red blood cell levels which improve
endurance.
</P>
<P>
They were introduced at the request of riders at the end of
January as part of the fight against the use of EPO in the sport.

few days:
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- Panama registered a 2.5 percent economic growth
in 1996, which interrupts a negative trend accumulated in the last
few years and puts its public debt at 7.005 billion U.S. dollars,
said Planning and Economic Policies Minister Guillermo Chapman
today.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian economy, which rose to 9.4 percent in 1991, lost
vigor in 1995, when the growing index was 1.8 percent, one of the
lowest in the history of this country.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The European Union, Israel, and Brazil continue
being the main markets for Uruguayan meat exports, which grew 52
percent in the beef sector, and 23 percent in the mutton sector
during the two first months of 1997, compared to the same period
last year, according to the National Meats Institute.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina industrial output will grow 6 percent
this year, four percentage points more than in 1994, when it
reached its highest record in the last 28 years, according to
official data published today.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production forecasts for 1997 is expected to surpass
by 12 percent as compared with that in 1995, when there was a
recession caused by the Mexican financial crisis reverberations,
said a report from the Industry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
HAVANA -- A great trade center with 18 buildings will be
built in the Miramar section of the Cuban capital, announced
S.A. real state company.
</P>
<P>
By the completion of the project, the complex will have a total
area of approximately 180,000 square meters, which will house
offices, commercial establishments, restaurants, travel agencies
and banks.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Chilean forest products exports will reach this
year 1.970 billion dollars, a 6.5 percent increase over the 1.85
billon dollars earned in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to Fernando Leniz, Chilean Lumber Corporation
president, the total sale of forest products abroad made up
11.8 percent of the total hard currency received by the country in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Leniz said wood pulp will lead the sales of the forest sector
and will obtain 830 million dollars, a 2.5 percent increase over
1996.

<HEADLINE> MLS to Make Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Major League Soccer will make
expansion for the 1998 season, adding teams in Miami and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The new clubs would bring the league, which began last year, to
12 teams.
</P>
<P>
An official announcement from MLS officials is expected by
mid-April.
</P>
<P>
Miami would continue the MLS strategy of marketing to the
growing Latino sports fan base. Chicago also has a broad ethnic
mix in its population.
</P>
<P>
Both will enhance the league's image for television
negotiations after the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
The league, which exceeded attendance expectations last year in
its first season, had planned to expand in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A complicating factor for new and established MLS clubs will be
the 1998 World Cup. Training and matches will occupy much of the
MLS season and no break is planned to accomodate the finals in
France, so many stars are likely to be absent.

MONTEVIDEO -- The Uruguayan unemployment rate continued at a
high level during the November-January quarter, although it
registered a slight drop in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Montevideo was 11.6 percent in the
period, dropping 0.1 percent as compared with that in the
October-December quarter.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate reached 12.2 percent in the urban
interior, against 11.6 percent registered in the last quarter of
1996.
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- National fuels consumption registered a
small increase in 1996, compared to previous years.
</P>
<P>
The daily demand of regular gasoline stabilized at an average
of 117,000 barrels, a 0.4 percent reduction in consumption, while
gasoline extra showed a 6.4 percent increase, equivalent to 11,500
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
A daily consuming of 56,000 barrels of diesel showed an
increase of 7 percent in demand.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- After the announcement made by the United States
government this week about the increase to the sugar quota for
1997, Nicaragua will be able to export more sugar to that country,
raising it from 34.076 million metric tons to 38.34 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The report released by the Nicaraguan Foreign Relations
Ministry says that this new quota allocation, 4.264 million tons
more, is a record for the export of Nicaraguan sugar to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Investments from entities not residing in
Argentine reached 16.94 billion U.S. dollars in January this year,
45 percent more compared to the same month of 1996, said the
National Stock Market Commission.
</P>
<P>
This group increased its investments 0.8 percent compared to
December of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The countries with the biggest participation in investments in
Argentina are the United States, the United Kingdom, and Begium.
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- The rate of poverty in the Panamanian population
dropped to 30 percent in 1996, compared to 45 percent registered
in 1990, announced Guillermo Chapman, Planning and Economic
Policies Minister.
</P>
<P>
This figure is still too high. People who receive a minimum
salary cannot acquire the basic staples basket, which costs 225
dollars.
</P>
<P>
People in this situation of extreme poverty are a fifth of the
total population.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Telephone companies will invest 550 million
pesos (approximately 72 millioin dollars) in public telephone in
the next three years, the Mexican Association of Public Telephone
Operators said today.
</P>
<P>
The investments of 23 firms supplying public telephone services
will permit a 47 percent increase in the number of public
telephones, which reached 231,142 telephone booths in September of
1996.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- The Brazilian 1997 grain harvest could reach a
little more than 81.185 million tons, as announced by Brazilian
Agriculture Minister Arlindo Porto.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the grain production during this year is due to
the recovery of the south of the country with more rain and
increased sale of fertilizers.

<HEADLINE> China Puts Forward Anti-Racism Proposal in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegation today put
forward a three-point proposal for a more strenuous UN fight
against new forms of racism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ongoing 53rd session of the UN Commission on
Human Rights in Geneva, Alternate Representative of the Chinese
delegation Xie Bohua made the following proposals:
</P>
<P>
1. The United Nations should continue to condemn and give
priority attention to all forms of racism and racial
discrimination, particularly new forms of racism which are all
gross violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
In the activities planned for the Third Decade to Combat Racism
and Racial Discrimination, the fight against new forms of racism
should be given a prominent place.
</P>
<P>
The work of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination should be vigorously supported.
</P>
<P>
2. The UN's relevant bodies should be mobilized to conduct a
comprehensive study of contemporary forms of racism with a view to
an in-depth analysis of its social causes and its various
manifestations and to recommend effective measures, in order to
obtain the aim of "the speedy and comprehensive elimination of all
forms of racism and racial discrimination, xenophobia and related
intolerance" as set forth in the Vienna Declaration and Program of
Action.
</P>
<P>
3. Countries still plagued by these phenomena should face up to
their responsibility and take all necessary measures to realize
genuine equality, human rights and fundamental freedoms for their
people, regardless of their racial or ethnic origins.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has been steadfast in its stand against
racism and racial discrimination," Xie pointed out. "China highly
appreciates and supports the UN Decade to Combat Racism and Racial
Discrimination and its follow-up activities."
</P>
<P>
"In the future, China will continue to enhance its cooperation
with other members of the international community in the
relentless struggle to once and for all eliminate racism from our
planet," Xie said.

<HEADLINE> SLeonean Riot Police Prevent Students Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Heavily armed riot police
sealed all fields in the capital today to present university
students from holding a meeting to discuss what they claimed as
''national issues''.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time in three days that the police have taken
such action.
</P>
<P>
A government statement broadcast on state radio said the
police have been ordered ''to take appropriate but reasonable
action to prevent a student group meeting anywhere throughout
Sierra Leone''.
</P>
<P>
''Any violators will be prosecuted whether they are students
or not,'' the statement warned.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged students ''not to be used as pawns by ill
motivated groups to disrupt the peace and good order in the
nation''.
</P>
<P>
It said students can hold their meetings at any of the
campuses throughout the country but not in any area outside the
university.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said they were surprised at the tough stand
taken by the government on the issue when both sides had come
''relatively closer'' following a meeting on tuesday after police
had dispersed the students with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the University Students Union NUSS
Mucturr Bomtay said, ''the government has back-tracked from a
previous commitment to allow the meeting to go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
Many Sierra Leoneans have not supported the students stand
amid increasing insecurity as a result of the rebel war and a
poor economic performance.

<HEADLINE> EU Liaises With NATO, OSCE on Action in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
today it was working closely with the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and NATO on a coordinated urgent
response to the deepening crisis in Albania.
</P>
<P>
"The union is coordinating closely with the OSCE and will
liaise actively with NATO and other organizations, so that
appropriate action can be taken urgently," the EU said in a
statement released by the Dutch Presidency.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union expresses grave concern at the breakdown of
civil order in Albania," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It calls upon the government, political forces and other
groups throughout the country to refrain from violence and to work
for the restoration of order and a return to a proper democratic
process, which is the only way to overcome the present crisis," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The EU reiterated its support for OSCE mediator Franz Vranitzky
who was meeting Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino today as part
of international efforts to halt more than a month of political
violence.
</P>
<P>
"The union expects that the safety of foreign nationals will be
safeguarded at all times," the EU statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government Thursday called for military
intervention by the Western European Union, NATO's European club,
to halt spreading disorder as the Western nations evacuated
nationals from the countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the European Union are expected to
discuss, among other things, the bloc's strategy towards the
current crisis in Albania at their semi-annually informal meeting
during the weekend in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> German Car Output Sees Another Drop in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- German automotive production plunged
sharply in February after a 1-percent drop in January, the
Frankfurt-based German Automobile Industry Association (VDA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Germany produced a total of 406,400 vehicles in February, down
7 percent from February 1996. Of the total, 378,900 were passenger
cars and vans, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The VDA blamed the shrunk output partly on the delivery
problems induced by the truck drivers' strikes in Spain.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that while domestic demand for private cars
remained weak in February, foreign demand remained robust. After a
9 percent increase in January, foreign orders rose a further 5
percent in February.
</P>
<P>
A total of 248,200 vehicles were exported by Germany in
February, and 230,600 of them were passenger cars.

U.S. at the U.N. Security Council session was really a disgrace
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said the issue had been raised in the U.N. Security
Council and all the member countries, except the U.S., voted
against Israel. However, it was the United States which cruelly
vetoed the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the issue was raised at the U.N. General
Assembly session on Thursday and all the countries, except the
U.S. and Israel, voted against it.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said that these affairs were among
important contemporary issues, which needed to be recorded in
the history and surveyed.
</P>
<P>
"Such an issue should serve as a warning and a
lesson to be learned by other nations, including Muslim
countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are surprised to see our brothers in Arab countries
calling the United States as their own friends," Rafsanjani was
quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying,
</P>
<P>
He said: "At the time when the United States is fully
dependent on the Persian gulf littoral Arab states and other
Muslim countries today, it has shamelessly stood against them and
denied Palestinian Muslims' legitimate rights."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that he had warned the Muslim world that
Israelis were planing to build new Jewish settlements in both
East and West of Jerusalem in order to usurp those areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 86 passengers and crew
members were killed in an Iranian military plane crash near
Neyshabur city, about 700 kilometers northeast of Tehran, on
Thursday night, local media said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the C-130
plane of Iranian armed forces crashed over the Mashhad-Neyshabour
heights at 18:00 local time (14:30 GMT) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An airlines spokesman said that the crash left no
survivors. The victims were either military personnel or their
families.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that eight of the victims belonged to
the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps' (IRGC) forces, 45 were from
the ground forces of the Iranian army, 22 from the logistics
headquarters, three from the army air force units, and the
rest were family members.
</P>
<P>
The plane was en route from Dezful in southwest Iran to
the religious city of Mashhad in the northeastern province of
Khorasan and crashed when it flew almost near its destination.
</P>

<P>
The report said that the pilot first reported problem of the
engines and sent emergency signal SOS before the communication
was cut off.
</P>

This is the second air mishap in the past 10 days in the
country. The last air crash occurred on March 3 as a French-made
Falcon aircraft crashed 25 kilometers northest of Ardebil city in
northeastern Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Falcon pilot and three flight engineers, all members of
the Iranian army's airborne unit, died in the Ardebil

HARARE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Government has not
lost hope of reaching a bilateral trade agreement with its
southern neighbor South Africa, Industry and Commerce Minister
Nathan Shamuyarira said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists in Mutare of east Zimbabwe, the

While attending the London Investment Conference last week,
the minister was reported as having been pessimistic about
negotiations with South Africa, saying he would only believe in
any agreement when it was implemented.
</P>
<P>
But today the minister said there were plans to resume
meetings with South Africa. One between him and his South African
counterpart Trevor Manuel was scheduled for April 1, this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Decides to Go Ahead With Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet today
decided to begin carrying out the controversial building project
in Har Homa in East Jerusalem next week.
</P>
<P>
In the six-hour weekly meeting, all ministers voiced their
backing to go ahead with the Har Homa project despite the
increasing pressure from the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet instructed the Housing Ministry to
present a plan within a week on housing construction for Arab
residents in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan which was approved two weeks ago by the
Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem Affairs, Israel would build
6,500 Jewish housing units in Har Homa, while at the same time
building 3,000 units for Arab residents in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Today's cabinet meeting was held just after the United
Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a resolution
calling on Israel to drop the Har Homa project.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat has time and again condemned the
Har Homa project, warning that such action could lead to renewed
violence. He has called an international meeting of foreign
diplomats in Gaza Saturday to muster more international support.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Israeli cabinet decided to carry out the
project on the assumption that Israel's compromise would only
lead to more outside pressure.
</P>
<P>
The crisis between Israel and the PNA was also intensively
discussed at today's cabinet session, which reviewed the whole
security situation and possible Palestinian reaction to Har Homa
construction. Ministers heard briefings from Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and other senior officials from the security
establishment.
</P>
<P>
Security officials warned the cabinet that PNA President
Yasser Arafat appeared to be easing his crackdown on the
extremist militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a move that
could lead to renewed violence. Both Hamas and Jihad have been
launching attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was held in the wake of the tragic shooting
incident Thursday on the Israeli-Jordanian border, in
which a Jordanian soldier shot dead seven Israeli teenage
schoolgirls and wounded six others. The meeting begun with a
moment of silence for the victims.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed the request by Jordanian King Hussein
to pay a private visit to Israel to offer his personal
condolences to the families of the victims. It is expected that
Hussein would travel next week to Beit Shemesh, west of
Jerusalem, to visit the bereaved families.
</P>
<P>
Hussein is eager to mend the ties with Israel following the
Thursday shooting which has set back the already soured bilateral
relations due to the Israeli-Palestinian tension.
</P>
<P>
Israel blamed the shooting incident on Hussein's recent
harsh criticism of Netanyahu over his hardline policies on Har
Homa and further troop pullbacks in the rural West Bank.

<HEADLINE>   British Envoy: Chances for Cyprus Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- British envoy for Cyprus Sir
David Hannay expressed his belief today that chances for a Cyprus
settlement are better now, and face-to-face talks between the two
communities on the island should begin before the end of the
coming June.
</P>
<P>
The British envoy made the remarks at a press conference at the
Ledra Palace Hotel in U.N.-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia prior
to his departure for Brussels after a three-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
He described his two separate meetings with President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, as well as a
lunch with party leaders from both sides of the divide, as
"extremely useful."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the British government's view that face-to-face
negotiations between President Clerides and Denktash should take
place before the end of the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, he said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will convene
such a meeting on advices from his representatives and after
consulting others who are active in working out a settlement in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Sir David did not go into specifics about the issues discussed
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
The envoy spoke of the problems of reaching a solution, which
have met repeated failures in the past, but he believed "the
chances of getting a settlement are better than they have been for
quite a long time in the past."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction with the fact that the two sides
"are getting a little bit away from general statements and into
identification of things that are really important to each side
as that is the basis for negotiation."
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Sir David will brief Annan's Special
Representative for Cyprus, Han Sung Joo, and European Union
External Affairs commissioner, Hans van den Broek, on his talks in
Cyprus and his recent contacts in Ankara and Athens.
</P>
<P>
Sir David's visit here is part of international community's
peace effort to bring about an early solution to the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the two communities
on the island started Monday, which were aimed at paving the way for
face-to-face negotiations between President Clerides and
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The two men have not met since October 1994 when two rounds
of informal talks between the two leaders were held under the
U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Calls for Implementation of UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Esmat Abdul Meguid, Secretary
General of the Arab League (AL), reiterated here today the
necessity to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, and
called on the United Nations to respect its resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Meguid, who arrived in Beirut Thursday to participate in
commemoration activities of the Israeli occupation of south
Lebanon since March 14, 1978, held meetings today with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his talks with the Lebanese foreign minister, the
AL chief said: "We must implement and uphold Resolution
425, and ask the United Nations and the Security Council to
respect its resolutions and implement them, just as they
implement others."
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425, adopted by the U.N. Security Council
following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1978, demands an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the Israeli existence in south Lebanon
is a pleasure trip, and the Jewish state is paying a high
price," Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
"If it decided today to withdraw from this area, it would
avoid additional catastrophes and big losses," the secretary
general underlined.
</P>
<P>
He described the situation of the Middle East peace process
as "dangerous," but said that the Arab countries have "chosen
the peace as a strategic choice."
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is currently threatened, there are
dangers," Meguid said, "so we are desirous to advance in this
process, on the road to a just and comprehensive peace without
hegemony, control and without giving up our rights."
</P>
<P>
He stressed a unity of other Arab states with Lebanon, noting
that Lebanon has proved its tenacity in its resistance against
occupation.

<HEADLINE> Greece Ready to Receive Refugees From Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece is preparing to receive
refugees from Albania in line with a request from the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by the government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas today.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said, however, the question had not been raised of
offering asylum to Albanian President Sali Berisha whose
whereabouts were reportedly unknown.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said no communication had yet been received
regarding talks currently under way between Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) special envoy Franz
Vranitzky and Greek Foreign Undersecretary Yannos Kranidiotis with
representatives of the Albanian government and the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
The talks are being held on an Italian frigate off the coast of
the Albanian port of Durres.
</P>
<P>
Reppas noted that no representatives of the U.S., Russian or
Italian governments are participating in the talks.
</P>
<P>
With regard to an eventual multinational force for Albania, the
spokesman said that Greece would only participate if an official
request in writing were made on behalf of all political forces in
Albania, with a specific legal framework, under the auspices and
control of an international organization. Nevertheless, he
emphasized that there was no such plan to date.

<HEADLINE> US Lawmakers Oppose US Participation in Gaza Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen Republican members of
Congress have accused President Bill Clinton of participating in a
Gaza meeting on the Middle East peace process organized by
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, including House speaker Newt Gingrich, said in a
letter, dated March 13 and released today, that U.S.
representation at the meeting Saturday was "a critical mistake and
a slap in the face of a faithful ally."
</P>
<P>
"By agreeing to participate in the Gaza conference, the United
States is sending the message that it is possible to drive a wedge
between the United States and Israel," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said he is convening the meeting, which is also to
be attended by European, Arab and Asian countries, to salvage the
peace process after a series of Israeli actions which have
seriously strained relations with the Palestinians and threatened
the future of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has recently decided to build Jewish
homes in historically Arab east Jerusalem, to shut down four
Palestinians offices in the holy city and to cede only 9 percent
of the rural areas in the West Bank in the first of three stages
of withdrawal, far short of requirement from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly of the United Nations Thursday censured
Israel's decision of house construction in east Jerusalem by
overwhelmingly adopting a critical resolution, similar to the one
vetoed by the United States last week in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, disagreeing to the U.N. resolution,
however, has criticized Israel rhetorically over the Israeli
housing plan, and accepted an invitation from Arafat to attend the
Gaza meeting.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the reason of U.S. attendance, State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said it was to give the Palestinians "an
opportunity to express their concerns about the present situation
in the Middle East and to hear views of friendly countries like
the United States."
</P>
<P>
But he said the United States "does not see this meeting as
forum for decisions on the Middle east peace issues or as a
negotiating session."

PARIS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today called on Europeans to take up responsibility for Albania
when the European Union foreign ministers meet this week in the
Netherlands, said a presidential spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"France hopes that in liaison with its partners the Europeans
could bring their contribution to any operation which will be
decided within the framework of a political solution, the only one
to solve the crisis," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also hailed the good work done today by the French
troops in evacuating 88 people, including 45 French nationals,
from Albania on board five military helicopters to the Italian
port of Prindisi.
</P>
<P>
The French troops are carrying out a second rotation of

Meanwhile, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that France
will send observers to Albania within the mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
"France brings its entire support to the mission of the OSCE
led by former Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and it is ready

<P>
Vranitzky today proposed the dispatch of an international
police force to Albania during his talks with Albanian Prime
Minister Bashkim Fino on an Italian warship in the Adriatic Sea.

France also asked the West European Union, the military
alliance of Western European countries of which France is the
current president, to study contributions it could bring to solve
the Albania crisis, he said.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Liberian Politican Tipoteh Joins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A veteran Liberian politician,
Togba-Nah Tipoteh, on Thursday announced his intention to contest in
the country's May 30 presidential elections, a report reaching here
said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally of the Liberia People's Party (LPP) at the
Monrovial City Hall, Tipoteh said that if Liberians are looking
for a president free of corruption, immortality and capable of
managing the economy and building institutions, he is the one.
</P>
<P>
The LPP is one of the seven politicial parties that have formed an
alliance to contest the presidential and parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"Let the alliance take due note that Tipoteh is the presidential
candidate the alliance needs, and with Tipoteh, the alliance will win
the May 30 elections," said Tipoteh, the LPP Chairman.
</P>
<P>
Tipoteh was the Minister of Planning and Economic Affairs
under the regime of former President Samuel Doe, who was
assassinated in 1990, months after the Liberian civil war broke
out.
</P>
<P>
A former professor of economics at the University of Liberia,
Tipoteh now heads Liberia's oldest aid agency, the Susuku, which gives
scholarships and other incentives to more than 10,000 ex-combatants to
encourage them to disarm.
</P>
<P>
The alliance will decide who will represent it at the elections
during its convention next week, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates for the presidency include Charles Taylor,
who ignited the Liberian civil war in December 1989, and George
Boley, the leader of the Liberia Peace Council.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Employment Growth in City of London Raises Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Employment in international
financial services in London is set to grow by up to 2.5 percent a
year over the next 25 years, with up to 60,000 new jobs coming in
the next decade, mainly in the City.
</P>
<P>
The forecast, released here today, is from a study commissioned
by the Corporation of London, the local authority for the Square
Mile.
</P>
<P>
The study looks at the growth prospects of the City's
industries over the next 20-25 years and the implications for
employment growth and office space needs.
</P>
<P>
Sectors analyzed include domestic banking, international
banking, forex, securities trading, derivatives trading, corporate
finance, insurance, accountancy and law.
</P>
<P>
Employment growth rates are translated into office demand based
on assumptions on office occupancy rates, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Calculations for the minimum scenario result in a projected
requirement of 10-15 million sq ft of office space in the Square
Mile over the next 10 years and an additional 5-10 million sq ft
for the five years after that.
</P>
<P>
The growth scenarios raise many questions over the location of
such activity in London and consequent implications for public
services, transport infrastructure and labor requirement.

<HEADLINE> Sporadic Shellings in S. Lebanon on 19th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic shellings took place in
south Lebanon today, but a relative calm shrouded the area on the
19th anniversary of Israel's first invasion against this country
and the Israeli occupation of nearly one tenth of its territories.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the Israeli forces in the so-called
"security zone" in south Lebanon fired about 20 artillery shells
in the morning and afternoon at the vicinities of several south
Lebanese villages without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also hovered at medium and low altitude
over the areas of Natatiyeh, Iglim Al-Toffah and the Western
Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
announced that they fired artilleries and heavy machine guns at
a number of Israeli positions in the buffer zone Israel
self-carved in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the Shiite fundamentalist group
said that one group of its fighters launched an attack on the
Israeli position at Sujoud this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that a number of Israeli soldiers were killed or
wounded in the bombardment and attack, but the casualties have
not been confirmed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian Amal Movement, another Muslim Shiite moderate
organization headed by Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri, said
that its fighters attacked a position of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army militia at Zamrya in the occupied enclave.
</P>
<P>
It said that the guerrillas used mortars and rocket-propelled
grenades in the attack.
</P>
<P>
However, the security sources in south Lebanon noted that
these minor clashes did not go beyond daily frictions on the
last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict, which has
become a barometer of the situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a rally commemorating the first Israeli aggression against
Lebanon on March 14, 1978, House Speaker Berri warned of the
consequences of "Lebanon's collapse," and called on the other
Arab states to "live up to their promises."
</P>
<P>
The thorn remains as it was 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally held in the south suburb of Beirut, the
capital of Lebanon, this afternoon, Berri said, "We want the Arab
brothers to make their best taking part in the creation of a just
and comprehensive peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
He said that Lebanon should be turned into an
"Arab sample of tenacity and resistance, and Lebanon's collapse
will lead to a collapse of the Arab history and the Arab
struggle (against the Zionism) in the past 50 years."
</P>
<P>
Berri added that the making of peace in this country needed
the other Arab countries to "live up to their promises to
provide material supports for Lebanon's tenacity."
</P>
<P>
He also called for the establishment of an Arab and
international foundation for assisting Lebanon in order to make
contributions to Lebanon's reconstruction process.

<HEADLINE> EAC Marks Its First Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma today called for strengthened economic and trade
cooperation within the one-year-old East African Cooperation
(EAC), reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Juma commended the EAC Commission Secretariat for its efforts
to form a single market in the region at the celebrations marking
the first anniversary of the EAC in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He said the EAC facilitated the convertibility of the
currencies of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The EAC also eased cross border movement of people and goods,
set up the regional business council and a regional capital and
securities markets authority in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The three EAC member states are planning to introduce an east
African passport next month, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there was still a long way to go for the EAC, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must take cognizance of the stark truth that this is just
the beginning of a long and arduous journey we have undertaken to
build our cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All of us, as East Africans, must redouble our efforts. We
are all stakeholders in this endeavor," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called upon the EAC member states to fight
desertification which is threating the region.
</P>
<P>
"I urge the member states to treat it as a matter of high
priority and intensify our efforts before it is too late and our
region is engulfed by desert," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Nicholas Biwott, the Commission Chairman and the
Kenyan Minister responsible for EAC's affairs, said that in the
past 12 months eastern African people have demonstrated the need
for working together.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of protecting peace and security
in the region, saying the factors were a pre-requisite for
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's Minister of State for EAC Rebecca Kadaga also
pledged her country's continued commitment to the EAC.
</P>
<P>
She said the people in eastern Africa have supported the
commission with great enthusiasm, testifying their resolve to
restore what was lost 20 year ago.
</P>
<P>
About 400 people, including high-ranking government officials
and businessmen from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, attended the
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations will last three days.
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat of the EAC Commission was launched by
presidents Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya
and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda in Arusha on March 14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The EAC has its roots stretching back to the days before the
defunct East African Community which collapsed in 1977. enditem

<TEXT>

BONN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- One of the six German helicopters on
the evacuation mission came under fire today in Albania, Inspector
General Hartmut Bagger of the German armed forces said in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter returned fire, he said. No one on board was
injured.
</P>
<P>
The flight was part of the first such operation the German
armed forces, known as Bundeswehr, have ever taken in the post-war
era.
</P>
<P>
Despite the incident, the six CH-53 helicopters deployed with
the SFOR (Stabilization Force) multinational peacekeeping forces
in Bosnia had managed to ferry about 120 people out of Tirana,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Defense Minister Volker
Ruhe told a news conference later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said 20 Germans, including 11 embassy staff, about 100
people of 15 other nationalities, including 12 Austrians, 11 Swiss
as well as Japanese, Danes and Hungarians, had been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Describing the operation as "extremely dangerous," Ruhe said
the German helicopters, all heavily armed, originally planned to
land in front of the U.S. embassy in Tirana, but another landing
site was used after a U.S. gunship came under fire near the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
The evacuees would be first taken to Montenegro of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, from where they would be flown by Transall
supply aircraft to Bonn in the evening, the ministers said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Vows to Keep Currency Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will not revaluate its
currency at present, Egyptian Central Bank Deputy Governor Faeqa
al-Refaee announced today.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Egyptian pound will be subject to supply and
demand, she told a symposium on Efficiency and Modernization in
Economic Information in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria,
235 kilometers northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
She said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked Egypt, in
the light of the successful economic performance it has made, to
revaluate the Egyptian pound.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the IMF had urged Egypt to devaluate the pound as a
precondition for supporting Egypt's economic reform program,
Refaee added.
</P>
<P>
The bank official pointed out that Egypt's balance of payments
scored, for the first time, a surplus of 600 million dollars in
the later half of 1996. "This means that the Egyptian economic
policy has succeeded," she said.
</P>
<P>
Refaee said the Egyptian Central Bank's foreign currency
reserves have dropped by about 100 million dollars to 18.9 billion
dollars after the bank met its debt commitments to the Paris Club
members and domestic commodity requirements.
</P>
<P>
However, according to an IMF official, the IMF is now pressing
the Egyptian government to further implement structural reforms so
that the value of the pound will fluctuate in line with the market
situation.
</P>
<P>
IMF chief Arvind Subramanian said there is a large rise of
capital inflows in Egypt behind the market pressure to prop up the
exchange rate, however the Egyptian government is resisting the
pressure and doest not want the pound to appreciate and
consequently affect the export sector.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank official dismissed reports that the government
have immediate plans to privatize public sector banks.
</P>
<P>
"Only after the completion of the privatization of joint banks,
due to be finalized by the end of this year, could the government
consider putting up other banks for sale," she added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief has said recently that the government is fully
committed to privatizing the banking sector, especially keen to
quickly eliminate government holdings in joint-venture
banks.
</P>
<P>
At the current inflation rate, Refaee said that Egypt's
financial policy is aimed at bringing down inflation to less than
7 percent by July from January's 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has embarked on the economic reform program since 1982 but it
only quickened the pace in 1991 when free currency exchange,
reduction of subsidies, adjustment to prices and further
liberalization of export were introduced.

<HEADLINE> Tories Revive Aggressive Attack on Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The British Tories today
reactivated an aggressive propaganda battle against the opposition
Labor Party, warning that Labor was duping voters with promises to
cut taxes and hold spending in check.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Party's central council meeting for encouraging
the Party's confidence in Bath, western England, Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke said: under Labor, Britain could turn its back on
the liberalizing economic approach.
</P>
<P>
"If you vote Labor, you call a halt to tax-cutting, you vote
for higher spending, you give more powers to the trade
unions...voting Labor means an end to the economic reform agenda
which has transformed Britain from basket-case to role model," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Michael Portillo launched a direct attack on
Labor leader Tony Blair, saying "Tony Blair or John Major?
Slippery Tony or Honest John. That is the choice: not only a
choice of men but a choice of parties and principles."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Conservative strategists are using "one
simple proposition" to voters during the general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to contrast what they call Major's track record of
"stability in an uncertain world" with the "risk of a leap in the
dark by a man who would do anything to get elected"
</P>
<P>
However, the efforts by senior Tories to rally the party for a
drive to win the fifth term to Downing Street were shadowed by
some Tory MPs indulging in public speculation about what would
happen if they lost.
</P>
<P>
Former minister Edwina Currie told BBC that manoeuvring ahead
of a post-election leadership contest was already under way.
"There is already a great deal of formation of columns and lines
and factions and groups," she said.
</P>
<P>
Currie even called on Prime Minister Major to resign quickly as
party leader if the Tories were to lose, saying "Please, John,
please don't make us hang around. Please don't make us wait...."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Currie's remarks, a BBC correspondent said her
remarks could not be worse timed, with a likely election on May 1.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Watching Albanian Situation Closely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States is closely
watching the situation in Albania, fearing that violence would
spread to neighboring countries in the Balkans, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said today.
</P>
<P>
"This seems to be an isolated case as far as Albania is
concerned, but obviously it could have spill-over effects," Cohen
told reporters in a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
"If you have a mass flow of refugees trying to move into other
countries that could cause some instability so all of the
countries in that region are concerned about bringing order to
what is clearly a state of anarchy right now," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that at the moment, the U.S. was trying to get
Americans out of Albania. "We're watching it very closely," Cohen
said. "Our sole motivation right now and goal and objective is to
get the Americans out of there safely."
</P>
<P>
Cohen added, "Beyond that there is no planning for U.S.
intervention."
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, director of operations for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon that 170
Marines are in Tirana, capital of Albania, and nearly 2,000 more
are available off shore if needed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Marine Corps have been evacuating American diplomats and
other Americans in the country in the last couple of days. But
helicopters suspended evacuation operations today after taking
ground fire in two incidents.
</P>
<P>
The Marines came ashore from three amphibious ships that also
carrying nearly 2,000 sailors that routinely patrol the
Mediterranean as part of the U.S. forward-deployed force in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the United States has about 500 troops in
neighboring Macedonia and nearly 8,000 in nearby Bosnia as part of
peacekeeping operations in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Up on Benign US Economic Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- All the three major stock markets
in Europe opened lower Friday, but later reversed the trend and
ended in positive ground, as benign US economic figures eased
fears of a near-term US interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London recovered much of their early losses
after US producer price data showed a greater fall than expected,
easing interest rate rise fears.
</P>
<P>
A strong opening on Wall street today also lifted the London
market higher, with the FTSE 100 index ending up 26.6 points at
4,424.3, once again above the 4,400-point level, and a gain of
four points over last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt market in Germany, which suffered the heaviest
losses on Thursday, also staged a recovery later today, boosted by
the US economic data, although trading volumes were modest, with
the DAX-30 shares closing 9.48 points higher at 3,359.29, a loss
of 60.22 points on last week.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, French shares recovered from early losses
on the back of Wall Street's renewed strength. Firmer French bond
prices also helped to fortify stocks, with the CAC-40 index
closing the week 13.52 points higher at 2,645.62, but 62.66 points
down from a week ago.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 26.6
points higher at 4,424.3. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index finished up
9.48 points at 3,359.29. In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed 13.52
points stronger at 2,645.62.

<HEADLINE> Uganda-Sudan Talks Open in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The talks between Uganda and
Sudan were officially opened by Ugandan President Y. Museveni in
Murchison Falls National Park, western Uganda, today, reported
Radio Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Museveni expressed hope that the talks
would find solutions to the problems between the governments of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He, however, urged the concerned parties to discuss the issue
of southern Sudan, noting that the problems between the two
countries stem from the issue.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern about the terrorist methods used by the
Sudanese government in unleashing the rebel criminals of the
Lord's Resistance Army to propel the war in northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He emphasised that the government of Uganda does not suppport
the war in southern Sudan but sympathises with the struggle of
the southern Sudanese people to guard their god-given rights and
emancipate themselves.
</P>
<P>
Museveni explained that the peoples of Africa will be mutually
linked together through promotion of trade and investment,
infrastructure development, peace and respect of equality of all
peoples in an appropriate constitutional framework.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called for serious, thorough and fruitful
deliberations which can harmonise the relations between the two
countries and help to curtail the activities of Sudanese-
sponsored terrorists who mutilate Ugandan civilians and kidnap
school children.
</P>
<P>
The opening function was attended by Iranian Foreign Minister
Akbar Ali Valayati, who led the Iranian delegation that included
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Scheikhol Islam, Deputy
Head of the Iranian mission in Nairobi Mohammad Soleimani and
Iranian Director of Protocol Bahaman Ossienpour.

<HEADLINE> US Production Increases 0.5 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua)-- The production at the U.S.
factories, mines and utilities increased by 0.5 percent in
February, the strongest in three months, the U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Fed also revised the industrial production in January down
to a decline of 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that manufacturing output rose 0.8 percent in
February after a 0.2 percent decrease in January. The gain mainly
reflected a rebound in durable goods such as appliances, business
equipment and construction supplies all registering gains.
</P>
<P>
The production of nondurable goods rose by 0.3 percent,
retracting part of the decline in January.
</P>
<P>
U.S. industries operated at 83.3 percent of capacity, up from
83.2 percent in January. Those are levels that allow room for
production increases without inflationary bottlenecks developing.
</P>
<P>
The factory operating rate rose by 0.4 percentage point to 82.5
percent in last month, slightly above the level of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of a pressure-free economy, the U.S. Commerce
Department reported today that business inventories edged 0.1
percent higher in January after an identical decline in December.
</P>
<P>
An unwanted buildup of inventories can cause layoffs and
production cutbacks as businesses try to clear warehouses and
backlogs.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Appeal WTO Magazine Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said today
that it is preparing to appeal the recent World Trade Organization
(WTO) ruling against its policy of blocking so-called "split-run"
magazines.
</P>
<P>
The WTO made public its ruling on the case today, by
circulating the final report to all WTO members. The report
supports three of four complaints made by the United States to the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
The trade case was filed by the U.S. at the WTO in March 1996
after a long battle over the attempts of the U.S. Time Warner Inc.
to establish an edition of Sports Illustrated magazine in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The magazine was forced to shut down its three-year old
Canadian edition after Canada began to impose the 80 percent tax
in December 1995 on the revenue of split-run magazines.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. complained that the new tax violates "national
treatment" provisions in the 1995 WTO pact.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO, a government must treat foreign companies the
same way they treat domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
Canada insisted that the tax was acceptable because of a WTO
clause that it did not sign, and was a reasonable response to a
U.S. attempt to raid the limited Canadian advertising market.
</P>
<P>
On June 19, 1996, the WTO set up a dispute-settlement panel to
address the U.S. complaint covering four Canadian measures related
to magazines.
</P>
<P>
The measures include Canada's Tariff Code 9958 that prohibits
the import of split-run magazines, the 80 percent excise tax on
advertising in split-run magazines, the postal subsidy and the
commercial publications mail rates that favor Canadian magazines.
</P>
<P>
Of these four disputed measures, the WTO has upheld Canada's
right to maintain a postal subsidy for Canadian magazines.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO, both parties to the dispute may appeal legal
aspects of the decision. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding
allows a maximum of 60 days for the parties to file their appeal.
</P>
<P>
"The trade law experts are examining very thoroughly the
details of the ruling," Canadian minister for International Trade
Art Eggleton said while announcing the appeal decision today.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government is working together with the Canadian
magazine industry "to plan our appeal strategy and to assess the
full impact of this ruling on the industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The final report states very clearly that this decision does
not take issue with the ability of any WTO member to take measures
to protect its cultural identity," noted Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps.
</P>
<P>
"Canada will continue to promote its cultural objectives and
ensure that Canadians have access to magazines that speak to us
about our own country," she said.
</P>
<P>
Both Eggleton and Copps also stressed the WTO decision does not
immediately change the rules of business for Canadian magazines.
</P>
<P>
"The laws, policies and programs of Canada remain as they are
unless Canada decides otherwise," Eggleton said.
</P>
<P>
Despite Canada's plan to appeal the WTO ruling, the chance of
any major change in the final ruling would be quite remote,
analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling has dealt a serious blow to the Canada's efforts to
protect its already endangered magazine industry.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that half the English-language magazines in
Canada and four-fifths of those sold in newsstands are at present
from abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said today that the United States is monitoring
the situation in Albania "very carefully."
</P>
<P>
"We are monitoring the whole situation, obviously, very
carefully," Albright told a State Department news conference. She
said that her nation was watching the situation not only through
its task force, but through other parts of the government.
</P>
<P>
She said that the United States was getting contacts with
former Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, who is coordinating
the Albanian situation for the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSEC).
</P>
<P>
She said that Vranitzky was meeting with some of the leaders
from the Albanian government and his mission was to get them to
cooperate with each other to reestablish some sense of control and
security in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Albright told reporters that the U.S. task force has evacuated
some 500 Americans out of Albania. But the evacuation has been
suspended temporarily for security reasons, but it will continue.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. Marine helicopters were taking
ground fire in two incidents without any injury or damage.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan has
postponed his scheduled trip to Washington next week for talks
with President Bill Clinton, the White House announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Partly because of King Hussein's schedule and partly now
because of the president's schedule, both the Jordanian side and
the U.S. side felt it was better to postpone King Hussein's
scheduled visit here to Washington on Monday," White House
spokesman Michael McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Reports has already come out that King Hussein might put off
his visit to Washington when a Jordanian soldier shot dead seven
Israeli school children on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein cut short a visit to Spain on the same day and
returned to Jordan. He expressed condolences to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said he had asked to meet with the
families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has also had to change his schedule as he was
undergoing surgery at a hospital for an knee injury incurred early
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein is the last of four Middle East leaders who were
scheduled to meet Clinton in Washington for discussions on the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was the first to come at the end of February, and
his visit was followed by Palestinian President yasser Arafat
and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> NATO Promises No Permanent Stationing of Conventional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO made today another attempt
to allay Russia's concerns about its expansion plan by promising
that there will be no permanent stationing of conventional troops
on the territory of new members it plans to admit from Central and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
This step followed a meeting of the North Atlantic Council,
NATO's decision-making body, chaired by NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana, at NATO Headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
An "Unilateral Statement" issued by the North Atlantic Council
said: "In the current and foreseeable security environment, the
Alliance will carry out its collective defense and other missions
by ensuring the necessary interoperability, integration and
capability for reinforcement rather than by additional permanent
stationing of substantial combat forces."
</P>
<P>
However, the statement stopped short of a guarantee that NATO
will not deploy Western troops in its new members under any
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
It also did not mention moving eastward the Alliance's military
infrastructure, such as military communications, air defenses and
fuel pipelines, a step which is firmly opposed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
In last December, NATO has assured Russia that it has "no
intention, no plan, and no reason" to deploy nuclear weapons on
the territory of new members.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rebound on Wall Street </HEADLINE>

NEW YORK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rebounded Friday
amid new signs that inflation has remained tame despite worrisome
indications a day earlier that led to a 160-point tumble by the
Dow industrials.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 56.57 points to
6,935.46, taking back about a third of Thursday's slide which was
the fifth biggest after July 15.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaled 486.93
million shares, down from 503.73 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 3.61 to 793.17, the
NYSE's composite index rose 1.83 to 417.70, and the American Stock
Exchange composite index rose 2.45 to 600.47.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq composite index gave back some gains by the
close, falling 0.29 to 1,292.99.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported this morning that wholesale
prices paid to farms and factories fell by 0.4 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected decline more or less calmed down investors'
worries about rising inflation and a possible interest rate hike
by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
The new data helped bonds rebound. As bond prices rose today,
the yield on the 30-year Treasury fell as low as 6.91 percent from
late Thursday's 6.96 percent before settling at about 6.94
percent.
</P>
<P>
Helping fuel the Dow's rise today was a partial rebound by
Philip Morris. On Thursday, the cigarette and food maker plunged
more than 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Create World Water, Climate Database </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Water and Climate
Atlas for Agriculture, a global computer database about
precipitation and temperatures, will be released Sunday night, an
agricultural consultative group announced today.
</P>
<P>
The database, created by scientists at the International
Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI) and Utah State University,
will serve as a high-tech tool for farmers, agronomists,
meteorologists and government policy makers, IIMI researchers say.
</P>
<P>
"The Atlas integrates the available agricultural climate data
into one computer program and represents the most comprehensive,
quality-controlled climatic data set in existence," says Ismail
Serageldin, Vice President for Environmentally Sustainable
Development of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Created from data received from 56,000 weather stations around
the world, the Atlas covers the 1961 to 1990 period. "It will
assume even greater importance in coming years, as water becomes
scarcer," says David Seckler of IIMI at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The Atlas enables users to zoom in on any 2.5 square kilometers
region of the globe and extract data such as precipitation and
probability of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures and
average temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Using this meteorological map, engineers can develop specific
plans for irrigation and water conservation projects; farmers can
assess the potential for plant adaptation to climatic conditions;
and scientists can combine the data with crop growth models to
select and breed different plants.
</P>
<P>
Some of the data is now available on CD-ROM and the entire
Atlas will be accessible on the Internet in July. "The next
version of the Atlas will improve the precision by more than 50
percent, presenting the data at one kilometer intervals" when new
or improved data available, especially from local stations, Mr.
Seckler added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will
suspend its activities in Tajikistan, except for a limited
presence of the U.N. Mission of Observers, due to the
deterioration in security.
</P>
<P>
According to a resolution passed here this afternoon by the
U.N. Security Council, the decision was made by the
Secretary-General Kofi Annan after the personnel of the United
Nations, the peace keeping forces and other international
personnel in Tajikistan were attacked continuously in the country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also says the Security Council decides to extend
the mandate of the U.N. Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT)
until June 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The resolution "strongly condemns" the acts of mistreatment
against UNMOT and other international personnel, and urgently
calls upon the parties to cooperate in bringing the perpetrators
to justice, to ensure the safety of the international personnel.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also calls upon the government of Tajikistan to
take further and more rigorous measures to this end, thus enabling
the international community to support Tajikistan on its difficult
path "from armed conflict to normal peaceful life."
</P>
<P>
The resolution also says that the Security Council welcomes
the results of the latest round of inter-Tajik talks held in
Moscow from February 26 to March 8, including the agreements on
disarmament and disbandment of the armed units of the United
Tajik Opposition, reforming the power structures of the Republic
of Tajikistan.
