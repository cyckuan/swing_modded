<P>
CAIRO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Germany's world famous hotel chain Top International
is to establish its regional office in Beirut, Lebanese press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Hans Miller, chairman of the
hotel during his recent visit to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The German conglomerate, which now owns and runs over 230 hotels
worldwide, has conducted a study on the hotel sector in Lebanon
and planned investment, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Trade between Syria and Lebanon fell by 59 percent to
57.9 million U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year
compared with the same period last year, the Daily Star reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the paper did not give reasons. With the decline in trade
volume, Syria has dropped to ninth in the list of exporting
countries to Lebanon, after years of being the top exporter.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's Societe-General Libano-Europeenne de Banque
has become the first local bank to take over a foreign one by
buying a 35-percent stake in Jordan's Middle East Investment Bank
(MEIB).
</P>
<P>
The agreement, making the Lebanon's bank the biggest
shareholder in the Jordanian bank, was signed Sunday, the Daily
Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanon's bank earned a net profit of 19.69 million dollars
in 1998. The MEIB has 20 branches and about 1-2 percent of the
market in Jordan, with a capital of some 14 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's Khuzestan Steel Complex has planned to sign a
200 million dollars contract with a foreign partner to produce
wide slates of steel used in heavy industries and shipbuilding,
Deputy Manager of the complex Mohammad Reza Taheri said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the contract will enable the complex to produce
4.5-meter-wide steel slates within three and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Taheri said a foreign company has won the international tender
and negotiations are underway to finalize an accord in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Khuzestan Steel Complex produces 1.5 million tons of steel
annually.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Visiting Saudi Electricity Minister Hashim Ben
Abdullah Ibn Hashim Ycity is to reach 69,000
megawatts by 2020 from the current 25,000 megawatts, at a cost of
100 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Iranian Energy Minister Habibollah Bitaraf said
Iran ranked 20th worldwide for generating 107 billion kilowatt
electricity per hour last year.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers stressed the need for the optimal use of
installations for generation and transfer of power, commercial
cooperation, joint investment in power industries and equipment,
engineering and technical cooperation, exchange of experiences,
manpower training, environment protection, reducing pollution
caused by power plants activities and ways of curbing energy
consumption.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan Protests Over Missile Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry
Wednesday protested to Russia over an alleged Russian missile
launch last Friday that caused an explosion near the village of
Gymyr.
</P>
<P>
"Considerable damage was caused to buildings as a result of
this incident," the ministry said in a statement released
Wednesday in Baku, the Azeri capital, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Azeri Defense Ministry said the explosion was caused by a
surface-to-surface missile launched from Russia, an allegation
denied by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Defense Ministry is responsible for the
consequences of this incident. It must investigate objectively and
state its official position with regard to this incident," the
Azeri Defense Ministry said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement said that "Russia's refusal to
acknowledge this incident gives rise to a negative attitude from
the Azeri public."
</P>
<P>
"The Russian side must acknowledge the launch of a combat
missile, violation of Azerbaijan's air space and material damage,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"An appropriate Russian reaction to the incident, which was
caused by the actions of the Russian army, would show respect for
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Thatcher Slams "Judicial Kidnap" of Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher is expected to praise former Chilean leader
Augusto Pinochet Wednesday and accuse the Labor government of
conspiring in his "judicial kidnap."
</P>
<P>
In remarks prepared for delivery at a rally on the fringe of
the Conservative party conference, she will attack the Labor
government on the way it handles the case of Pinochet, who is
currently under house arrest near London and waiting for Britain's
decision on whether he should be extradited to Spain to face
charges of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
"I never thought in my lifetime to see the honor of Britain and
the reputation of British justice so demeaned as in this affair,"
a Reuters report quoted Thacher as saying in her prepared speech.
</P>
<P>
"All those responsible must be shamed, and held publicly to
account," she said.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister had repeatedly offered her support to
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
She has previously visited him in public at his temporary home
in Surrey, southwest of London, and on Wednesday night, she will
set out her views in detail in Blackpool, where the Conservative
Party annual conference is being held, said the Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in London nearly a year ago at the
request of Spain, which wants to try him on torture charges dating
from the latter part of his 1973-1990 rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the retired general was excused on health grounds
from attending the ruling in his case Friday.

<HEADLINE> Good Harvest Expected in Mozambique for Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's National Early
Warning System has predicted a "good" harvest from the 1999/2000
agricultural campaign, based on a weather forecast for the six
months between October this year and March next year.
</P>
<P>
The crop growing provinces in northern and central Mozambique
have the greatest likelihood of the good rainfall required for the
staple crops, Jorge Amade, an official of the National
Agricultural Research Institute, said in Maputo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, Mozambique will fall under the influence of
the "la nina" weather phenomenon, which tends to increase
rainfall, contrary to "el nino" which is believed to induce
drought in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Mozambican Agriculture Ministry also expects a good
harvest for the next campaign, but has not risked any comparison
with the 1999 harvest with about 1.8 million tons of grain, which
was described as the best in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The food deficit areas in southern Mozambique will predictably
have low rainfall while the fertile central and north can produce
a surplus.
</P>
<P>
Maize, sorghum, millet, beans and cassava are the basic
foodstuffs grown in Mozambique.

MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and his Belarussian counterpart, Alexander Chumakov,
signed a resolution here Wednesday on establishing a regional
military coalition in the western direction.
</P>
<P>
This resolution was signed "in the framework of union
commitments on a joint regional group," Sergeyev said, adding that
it would "ensure our two countries' security."
</P>
<P>
This army group "does not target a concrete enemy. It will be
ready for action if (the enemy) does appear," the Interfax news
agency quoted Sergeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chumakov, for his part, said that "units of the regional army
group will provide defense in the East-European region should it
become necessary."
</P>
<P>
Command and supply headquarters are being set up so that this
group could be formed, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests "Illegal Excavations" in Ancient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government has
protested the "illegal excavations" in one of Cyprus' ancient
Kingdom-cities, Salamis, by archaeologists of the University of
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Salamis is in the north of Famagusta, northern Cyprus. Before
1974, excavations in Salamis were carried out by the Cyprus'
Department of Antiquities in cooperation with a French mission
from the University of Lyon, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Everything came to a halt when Salamis fell into the advancing
Turkish troops. Turkey still maintains 35,000 troops in northern
Cyprus, where the Turkish Cypriots proclaimed a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations Educational Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Famagusta Mayor Andreas Pouyiouros,
a Greek Cypriot, noted that Salamis represents part of Cyprus'
historical and cultural roots, calling on UNESCO to intervene and
save this ancient site.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the illegal excavations in Salamis by the Turks a
step that contributes to the destruction of our cultural heritage,
which has for many centuries offered a lot to civilized society,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pouyiouros appealed to UNESCO not to allow the Turks "to cut
out our roots".
</P>
<P>
Salamis was founded by Teucer, a hero of the Trojan war, and
for more than 2,000 years it played the most prominent role among
the island's 10 kingdoms.

<HEADLINE> Irish Police Arrest Four Suspected Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Irish police arrested four
suspected republican guerrillas Wednesday as part of continuing
efforts to avert an attack against Northern Ireland's peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"Four men, three in their 30s and one in his 40s, were arrested
in County Donegal," a Reuters report quoted a police spokesman as
saying in Dublin, the Irish capital.
</P>
<P>
The report said the arrests were part of an ongoing operation,
which security sources say is grounded on fears of a possible
bombing attack by dissident republicans against Northern Ireland's
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made using special anti-terror laws which
allow detainees to be held for up to 72 hours without charge.
</P>
<P>
The special laws had been passed in 1998, shortly after a car
bomb exploded in the Northern Irish town of Omagh in August that
year, killing 29 people.
</P>
<P>
Irish police arrested six people for questioning Saturday as
part of the operations and one of them as charged with membership
of an illegal organization Monday.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Urges Senate Not to Reject Nuclear Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen Wednesday warned that the Senate's rejection of a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty will pose serious challenges
to the U.S. nonproliferation goals.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is scheduled to vote on the treaty on October 12
while the chamber's leaders worked toward an agreement Wednesday
to postpone the vote.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Armed Services Committee of the Senate,
Cohen, who opposed a nuclear test ban when he represented Maine in
the Senate in the 1980s and early 1990s, said he has changed his
mind on the ban.
</P>
<P>
"The threat of nuclear missile proliferation was more acute
today than it was in 1992, and accordingly the importance of
strengthening nonproliferation has increased," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the Senate should ratify the treaty, but suggested
that, if it couldn't, it should avoid a direct vote rejecting it.
"That would put the United States in a rather difficult position,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that even if the United States continued the moratorium
on testing that has been in place since 1992, it would make it
extremely hard to protest if other nations tested, given a Senate
vote against the ban.
</P>
<P>
"If the Senate rejects the treaty, the proliferation of nuclear
weapons is more likely, posing serious challenges to our
nonproliferation goals," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty requires that each of 44 specific countries sign and
ratify the document before it enters into force. But only 23 of
those countries have done so thus far.

<HEADLINE> China Says Non-Interference Principle Not Outdated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China said Wednesday that
despite the profound changes after the end of the Cold War, the
principles of respect for state sovereignty and non-interference
in internal affairs are far from outdated.
</P>
<P>
The point was reiterated by Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, at a U.N. session on the
annual report of the secretary general on the work of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Deviation from or contravention of these principles will lead
to the possibility that sovereignty will be willfully weakened and
widely accepted norms of international relations severely damaged
or even obliterated, thus inflicting dangerous consequences on
international relations, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
He advocated that the issue of humanitarian assistance should
be handled in accordance with the principles of humanitarianism,
neutrality and fairness.
</P>
<P>
Giving different treatment to different regions in terms of
humanitarian assistance by certain country or country bloc based
on their political and economic interests has caused imbalanced
distribution of the assistance, the Chinese envoy said.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, he said, for too long the humanitarian disasters
have not received active or adequate assistance from the
international community. "This situation is very worrisome and we
hope it can be reversed soon," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commending the U.N. for its work in poverty eradication, Qin
said China hopes that the organization will conduct in-depth
discussions on the ominous impact of globalization on poverty
elimination and cope with relevant specific strategies tailored to
the need of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that U.N. operational activities will make poverty
elimination their priority task," he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Narrowly Approves Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Wednesday
narrowly approved the foreign aid bill for next fiscal year after
the House did so Tuesday while President Bill Clinton is expected
to veto it.
</P>
<P>
The 12.6 billion U.S. dollar legislation, which cuts nearly 2
billion U.S. dollars from Clinton's request, was approved by a
vote of 51-49. All the Democrats voted against it.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who last week promised to forgive 1 billion U.S.
dollars in debt owed by the poorest countries, has indicated that
his administration would veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which was compromised by the House and Senate
negotiators based on earlier versions, was approved Tuesday by a
vote of 214-211 on a partisan line with 212 Republicans voting
"yes."
</P>
<P>
The bill eliminates 241 million U.S. dollars for a program to
assist former Soviet Union nuclear weapons scientists, cut off 500
million U.S. dollars to help implement the Palestinian-Israeli Wye
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has vetoed an earlier version
approved by Congress because the legislation has an anti-abortion
provision which prohibits U.S. funds from flowing into
international family planning institutions that back abortion.
</P>
<P>
The provision was eliminated in the new version. But Clinton
still vowed to veto it. The bill offers a "woefully inadequate"
funding for foreign aid, Clinton said in a letter to House Speaker
Dennis Hastert on September 30.
</P>
<P>
Democrats in the House complained that the bill does not match
the "leadership role" of the United States in the world while
Republicans said there wasn't any more money for foreign
countries.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Denmark to Consult on Cooperation Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Denmark have agreed to
hold on November 5 the annual consultations on development
cooperation in Cairo, an Egyptian trade official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the week-long consultations, the Egyptian Ministry for
International Cooperation will define with the Danish side the
Egyptian projects to which the Danish government will contribute
funds, said Alaa Khalil, first undersecretary of trade.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, viewed as a key force to help maintain peace and
stability in the strategic Middle East, enjoys close relations
with Western countries, including Denmark. It receives from them
billions of dollars of economic assistance each year.
</P>
<P>
The non-refundable grants offered by the Danish government
annually amount to 100 million Egyptian pounds (29.41 million
U.S. dollars), Khalil said.
</P>
<P>
The grants are used to finance Egyptian development projects in
the fields of energy, environmental protection, potable water,
sanitary drainage and health care, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he disclosed that a number of Danish firms
specialized in manufacturing advanced medical equipment will take
part in an Arab exhibition focusing on medical apparatus, which is
scheduled to be held in Cairo on January 26-29.
</P>
<P>
The Danish health minister will pay a visit to Egypt on the
occasion, and hold talks with senior Egyptian officials on
bilateral cooperation in the health sector, Khalil said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Denmark are carrying out 13 joint ventures in the
fields of industry, agriculture, tourism and services with a an
estimated capital of 135 million pounds (39.71 million
dollars). The Danish side contribution accounts for 56 percent.

<HEADLINE> IDB Finances Toll Road Project in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of 20
million U.S. dollars in financing to enable a private company to
expand a toll road project in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The six-lane toll road is operated by Linha Amarela, S.A., on a
concession from the municipality. The financing will enable the
firm to rehabilitate an additional 5.15 kilometers of road,
building access facilities and other works, and integrate it into
the existing 16.1-kilometer system that links the southwestern
area of the city with northwestern and northeastern areas as well
as downtown.
</P>
<P>
The project will ease congestion on access routes to the toll
road and also complete the linkage between Linha Amarela and Linha
Vermelha, another major thoroughfare in Rio de Janeiro. A viaduct
on the Canal da Cunha will be constructed for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing consists of a loan of 10 million dollars from
the bank's ordinary capital and a syndicated loan of 10 million
dollars with funds provided by commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The current IDB financing supplements a 14-million-dollar loan
approved in 1996 for Linha Amarela, the first completely new toll
road project to be given in concession in Brazil. The toll road
began operations in January of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Probe Human Rights Abuses of All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Wednesday ordered an extension of an probe of human
rights abuses to the country's first military coup in 1966.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to demands for a thorough
probe of the rights abuses of all the military regimes since
Nigeria's independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The probe commission sworn in last month for rights probe was
initially mandated to investigate the country's rights grievances
during the past 15 years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
In 1966, soldiers overthrew the elected government and the
country slid into turmoil leading to a bloody civil war when the
eastern part of the country attempted to secede in 1967. More
than a million died in the war, which lasted until 1970.
</P>
<P>
The coup in 1966 started a tradition of military rule in this
oil-rich west African country. As a result, 39 out of its 49
years after independence were reigned by military regimes.
</P>
<P>
There have been complaints recently that abuses of the period,
including reports of massacres, had never been investigated.
</P>
<P>
The panel, headed by retired Justice Chukwudifu OputaIndeed, is
also responsible to cover the period of 1976 to 1979, when
Obasanjo was in power as a military ruler.
</P>
<P>
The commission last week held a consulting meeting with experts
from South Africa, Chile, Guatemala and Argentina, which have all
held probes of human rights abuses in the past.
</P>
<P>
The panel has so far received over 11,000 memoranda detailing
alleged human rights abuses and now expects many more, said
Justice Oputa.
</P>
<P>
"We will look to produce a general survey of what has gone
wrong in Nigeria, as well as investigate specific cases of rights
abuses," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the head of the commission also said that the first public
hearings may not begin this year. The commission has one year from
the date of its first public hearing to complete its work.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns Rise of Neo-Nazi Party in Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- In another strong message to
Austria, Israel warned Wednesday that it would reassess its
relations with Vienna if a far-right party which emerged
victoriously in the national election was included in the new
coalition.
</P>
<P>
"We will carry out a reassessment over our relationship with
Austria if that party would be included into the government,"
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told the Knesset
(Parliament).
</P>
<P>
In an election deemed as the most radical realignment of
Austria's politics since World War II, the anti-foreigner Freedom
Party surged into second place, a critical place for the shape of
the next government.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider, who is best known for
having praised Adolf Hitler's employment policies in the past,
had campaigned on such pledges as ending immigration.
</P>
<P>
Levy said the neo-Nazi party would cast a stain on the entire
new Austrian government if it joined in.
</P>
<P>
The success of the Freedom Party in the election early this
week has drawn wide concerns from Israel. Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Tuesday that the result should "set off a red light"
for the world who still remember the horrors of World War II.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman said Tuesday that he hoped the European
culture, which suffered a lot from Nazism in the past, would know
how to deal with the rise of the neo-Nazi party.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.S. for Impeding Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has held the U.S.
representative at the U.N. Sanctions Committee responsible for
delaying or suspending Iraq's agricultural contracts for buying
equipment needed for fighting drought.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Abdul-Ilah Hameed said on Wednesday
that Iraq sustained severe drought this year due to scarcity of
rain and the lowest water level of Tigris and Euphrates rivers
since 1961, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that despite the intervention by the U.N.
humanitarian coordinator in Iraq and the representative of Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the U.S. envoy has only agreed
to two contracts out of 13.
</P>
<P>
He added that the items in the blocked contracts signed under
the oil-for-food program include 700 irrigation systems with
spray, 1,300 pumping sets, 500 irrigation apparatus, 500 sinking
pumps and 312 generators.
</P>
<P>
Hameed said that his ministry has adopted some measures to
tackle drought, including coordination with the U.N. Humanitarian
Office in Iraq and the FAO.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, which has entered its sixth stage,
Iraq is allowed to export limited amount of oil in every six
months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for
its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys at the
Sanctions Committee of impeding endorsement of its contracts,
arguing that the humanitarian program has failed to alleviate the
sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Accused of Fraud in Municipal Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
has been accused of fraud during the 1989 municipal elections in
Paris, when his rightwing alliance obtained an overall victory in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Monde Wednesday quoted two leftwing politicians of
Paris as saying that Chirac himself orchestrated an organized
fraud operation during the election in order to win a "grand slam"
in Paris in 1989.
</P>
<P>
After he was beaten by Francois Mitterrand in the 1988
presidential election, Chirac intended to improve his image by
strengthening his control over Paris, they said.
</P>
<P>
Yves Contassot, an official in the city of the 3rd district of
Paris who came from the Green Party, and Pierre Montacie, a
Socialist Party official, said on October 5 that they would ask
for a court hearing of Chirac and the current mayor of Paris, Jean
Tiberi, on charges of fraud in the municipal elections in 1989 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
They said that they have grasped evidence from computer files
in the city hall of the 3rd district that the officials of the
central city hall of Paris organized 895 RPR supporters who did
not live in Paris to register with false addresses to participate
in the municipal elections in the 3rd district alone.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's RPR and its rightwing allies beat the Socialists and
other leftwing parties in all of the 20 districts of Paris in
1989.
</P>
<P>
Two former RPR officials said in 1998 that they were asked to
organize fraud elections with false electors in 1989 by the city
hall of Paris.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Suspends Purchase of Angolan Diamonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's De Beers
Corporation said Wednesday that it has suspended purchasing
diamonds from Angola within the framework of U.N. sanctions
against Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
This move was taken as a response to the sanction resolution
adopted by the United Nations Security Council against the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), said
Gery Ralfe, General Manager of the world's largest company in
diamond industry.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports reaching here from London, the U.N.
resolution bans all purchase of diamonds smuggled out of Angola in
an effort to cut off the UNITA's source of income and to prevent
further war.
</P>
<P>
Ralfe said that De Beers Corporation is considering to buy
diamonds from Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Earlier, the Angolan government has accused the company of
illegally purchasing diamonds from UNITA and threatened to ban all
activities of the company in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the company said the agreements signed in the past
will still be effective, including the contract signed with SDM, a
joint consortium of the Angolan government and Australia's Aston
Mining Company.

<HEADLINE> WTO Members Still Divided Over Number of Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Wednesday failed to agree on how many deputy
directors-general (DDGs) should be selected at a General Council
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Through my consultations, it has become apparent that there is
still a broad divergence of views as to whether there should be
one, two, three, four or five deputy directors-general," said
General Council Chairman Ali Mchumo.
</P>
<P>
There were four posts of DDGs under former Director-General
Renato Ruggerio, who retired on April 30 after a four-year term.
</P>
<P>
According to Mchumo, current Director-General Mike Moore's
preference is for the WTO members to agree on four DDGs. Moore
will have to consult his successor, designated Director-General
Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand on this matter, under a General
Council arrangement last July to appoint the two as the WTO's
successive leaders.
</P>
<P>
Besides the number of the future DDGs, the 134-member WTO will
also have debate about whether they are from developing countries
or developed countries and whether one of them should be female.
</P>
<P>
If there is no consensus before the ministerial conference
scheduled for late November in Seattle, the debate will be
postponed.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Shares Pride With China in Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Mirza Gholam Hafiz, president of
Bangladesh-China Friendship Association, said here Wednesday that
Bangladesh shares joy and pride with the Chinese people and
government for their great achievements and tremendous progress.
</P>
<P>
"The world has observed with immense interest that after the
emergence of New China by defeating capitalism, imperialism and
feudalism, the great Chinese people have undertaken a huge
challenge to build a socialist economy and scored enormous
achievements in its national economy by the policy of opening the
country to the outside world and by carrying out policy of
reform," said Hafiz in a message of congratulations to a function
organized by the association here to mark the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Hafiz was conferred the title of "Friendship Ambassador" by the
Chinese People's Association for Friendship With Foreign Countries
on May 4, 1994, because of his outstanding contributions to the
Sino-Bangladesh friendship.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Hafiz highly appreciated the friendship between
China and Bangladesh, which is based on the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence. "The independent foreign policy of China has
become the guarantee for the maintenance of world peace and
stability in Asia and other countries and for safeguarding the
sovereignty of the developing countries like Bangladesh," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Khondaker Mosharaf Hossain, a former cabinet minister and
senior vice president of Bangladesh-China Friendship Association,
said at the function that the association will continue to work
hard for strengthening friendship and developing economic and
cultural relations between the two countries "for achieving peace
and progress of the two peoples."
</P>
<P>
About 200 people from all walks of life in the country and
Chinese diplomats attended the function.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the function, Chinese Ambassador Wang Chungui highly
appreciated the unremitting efforts made by all the members of the
association for the promotion of the friendship between China and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China has already invested in several
sectors of Bangladesh's economy such as transport, power
generation, telecommunication, manufacturing and construction.
</P>
<P>
"It's the policy of the Chinese government to consolidate and
develop friendly relations and cooperation with Bangladesh. China
is ready to join Bangladesh in exploring new forms of
cooperation," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Finnish President in Lebanon on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari Wednesday made a lightning visit to Beirut during which
he held talks with Lebanese leaders on the peace process in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his Lebanese counterpart Emile Lahoud,
Ahtisaari told a news conference that he is optimistic about the
widely sought restart of the peace talks between Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said his country will continue its efforts to help push the
peace process forward and is willing to host any talks or
negotiations that might be held.
</P>
<P>
"Although talks remain complicated and difficult, I believe a
solution will be finally sought as long as parties concerned
continue their dialog," the president added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Lahoud renewed Lebanon's position over the peace
process, saying his government will not stop supporting resistance
movement unless Israel withdraws its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been fighting to drive the
Israeli troops out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud stressed that his country will persist in entwining
Syrian and Lebanese tracks during talks with Israel and asked
Israel to release all Lebanese held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
During his less than three-hour stay in Beirut, Ahtisaari also
called on Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa at the Beirut
American University Hospital where he underwent a successful
emergency heart operation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa, 59, was suffering from aortic dissection. He was
first admitted to a private hospital in Damascus on Sunday evening
with chest pains during a reception for the visiting Finnish
president.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari, accompanied by Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen and
European Union (EU) peace envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos, has
visited Syria, the Palestinian self-rule area and Israel in his
Mideast ongoing tour.
</P>
<P>
Finland currently holds the half-yearly rotating presidency of
the EU.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Trade Account Improves in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade account
in August improved by 10.4 percent to a deficit of 93.6 million
U.S. dollars from a deficit of 104.5 million dollars in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
A rise in exports, coupled with a simultaneous decline in
imports, brought about the improvement, Bank of Tanzania (BOT)
said in its latest monthly economic review report.
</P>
<P>
While export earnings went up from 25.8 million to 29 million
dollars, imports decreased from 130.3 million to 122.5 million
dollars, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
In August, traditional export earnings increased sharply from
5.7 million in July to 8.2 million dollars while non-traditional
export earnings increased slightly from 20.1 million to 20.7
million dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the increase in earnings from traditional exports
resulted from higher export volumes of coffee, cotton and cashew
nuts, which went up by 75.7 percent, 219.4 percent and 49 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Higher earnings from non-traditional exports originated from
petroleum products, manufactured coffee, manufactured tobacco and
other products, which were up by 178.2 percent, 493.2 percent,
255.1 percent and 52.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Fish products increased by 8.6 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
However, other items, namely, minerals, manufactured goods,
cotton yarn, sisal products and horticulture produce declined by
41.7 percent, 1.3 percent, 76.7 percent, 5.3 percent and 26.9
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the import bills for two major
categories, capital goods and intermediate goods, registered
decreases of 8.5 percent and 10.4 percent respectively, while the
imports for consumer goods saw a slight increase of 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, comparison of trade account performance in August 1999
with the same month a year earlier shows that the position has
worsened slightly by 1.7 percent from a deficit of 92 million to
93.6 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Release 150 Palestinians As Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel will release the
second batch of Palestinian political prisoners Friday as
scheduled in the latest peace agreement with the Palestinians,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Israel will Friday release 150 Palestinian prisoners in
accordance with the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement. This is the second
round of prisoner releases as required by the agreement, and has
been approved by the cabinet," the prime minister's office said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under Sharm el-Sheikh, which was signed one month ago, Israel
would release 350 Palestinian prisoners held for anti-Israel
activities in two groups. The first group of 199 prisoners were
released on September 9.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Prisons Authority said Tuesday that Israel might
release the second batch of prisoners Thursday, one day ahead of
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
A group of Israeli victims of terror attacks met with
President Ezer Weizman Wednesday to voice their opposition to the
release of those Palestinians "with blood on their hands."
</P>
<P>
Weizman said he would prefer not to make comments on this
issue since the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is "not a
simple one."
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that it would not release those who had
killed Israelis or belong to Islamic militant groups like Hamas
and Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The statement also praised the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) for "a marked improvement" in its implementation of the
Sharm el-Sheikh agreement.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has presented Israel a list of its police force and has
formed several committees to deal with its security obligations
under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel has also expressed satisfaction with the PNA over its
full security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the two sides fulfilled another obligation set by
the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement, signing a protocol over the
opening of a safe passage route linking Gaza and the West Bank,
which will provide relatively free travel for Palestinians between
their controlled areas for the first time in decades.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Not to Attend UK Court Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet, waiting for a British court decision on his extradition
hearing, will not attend the court verdict late this week due to
health reasons.
</P>
<P>
A British magistrate Wednesday excused Pinochet, 83, on health
grounds from being present for the verdict on whether he will be
extradited to Spain to face trial for torture. The verdict is
scheduled to be announced Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Ronald Bartle made the ruling after one of
Pinochet's doctors said Pinochet was "permanently giddy" and had
memory and urination problems after two apparent strokes last
month.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied that Senator Pinochet's health would be further
seriously endangered by his having to appear in this court. His
attendance is therefore excused," Bartle said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in a London hospital last October at the
request of a Spanish judge who accused him of responsibility for
the death and disappearance of nearly 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Spain kept on asking Britain to extradite the retired general,
who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990, to Spain to face the charges.
</P>
<P>
Last week Bartle heard four days of legal argument for and
against the proposed extradition. He said after the hearing that
he would announce his decision in the case Friday at 11 a.m. (1000
GMT).
</P>
<P>
Normally a defendant is required to attend the verdict in an
extradition case and Pinochet was previously reported to be
attending the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, currently under house arrest in a hired mansion in
southwest London, was also excused from attending the extradition
hearing last week.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet denies all the charges against him and calls himself
England's only political prisoner.

<HEADLINE> 70 Feared Dead in London Train Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Police said on Wednesday that
they believed at least 70 people died in Tuesday's London train
crashes and the death toll could go even higher.
</P>
<P>
"The evidence we have is clear -- 70 at least are dead. There
may well be more," Deputy Assistant Police Commissioner Andy
Trotter told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Trotter said a further 100 people were still unaccounted for.
They may add to the death toll or may have escaped and not
informed police.
</P>
<P>
Railway authorities revealed Wednesday the smaller of the
trains involved in the disaster, a three carriage Thames Train,
went through a red stop light seconds before the crash near
Paddington Station in central London.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the operators of the two trains and
Railtrack, which runs Britain's train tracks and stations, said
the signals at the intersection where the trains collided were in
full working order.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Railtrack said the inquiry would focus on why
the Thames turbo did not stop at the red light.
</P>
<P>
The trains were operated by Thames Trains and First Great
Western.
</P>
<P>
The investigation will also examine the history of the main
signal at the crossing near London's Paddington main line station,
the joint statement said.
</P>
<P>
Railway authorities said red lights have been missed eight
times in the past six years at the crossing where Tuesday's crash
happened.
</P>
<P>
Train drivers have regularly reported that a key signal at the
intersection is obscured by other equipment.
</P>
<P>
Details of the inquiry came amid charges that the tragedy, the
second in two years on that stretch of line, was the result of a
ramshackle, underfunded rail system.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government, in a bid to quiet public anger, promised
to pour money into rail safety.
</P>
<P>
Railway experts said Wednesday that the investigation would
focus on safety systems and track signals.
</P>
<P>
Police urged relatives of anybody missing to contact them
urgently in order to clarify the exact death toll.
</P>
<P>
Two trains collided Tuesday morning just outside London's
Paddington station. It was one of Britain's worst rail accidents.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Performs Well In Labor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Official findings show that the
Netherlands has been doing well in performance of the labor market
compared with that of Germany, France, Italy, Britain and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
A comparative international study conducted by the Netherlands
Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB) said the fact that the
Netherlands comes out so well suggests, among other things, the
institutional changes in the labor and product markets in recent
years have had beneficial effects on the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the CPB study said, this healthy picture is also caused
by the fact that the study was carried out using standardized
international unemployment definitions.
</P>
<P>
A broader definition of unemployment, such as people on
unemployment benefit, income support, disability benefit, sickness
benefit and those who have taken early retirement, covers
approximately 20 percent of the Dutch workforce, the study said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday met in a closed-door session to consider a report by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the latest situation in
Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said that while
"undeniable progress" has been made since his last report in
April, "the transition process in Guinea-Bissau is still
encountering difficulties and many challenges lie ahead in
building a strong foundation for sustainable peace."
</P>
<P>
"Although the internal security situation remains relatively
stable, concerns about the impact of subregional instability in
Guinea-Bissau persist," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The priority for the people of Guinea-Bissau, with the help of
the international community, is to continue to mobilize the
political will and resources for promoting reconciliation and
respect for human rights and the rule of law, particularly in the
absence of a competent judiciary and an accountable and
well-trained police force," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to further promote peac and stability in the West
African country, Annan said," It is my hope that the successful
completion of the elections will encourage the international
community to resume with renewed vigor its cooperation with
Guinea-Bissau and contribute to the rebuilding of its state
institutions and the reconstruction and rehabilitation of its
dilapidated economic and social structures."
</P>
<P>
Former army commander Ansumane Mane overthrew President Joao
Bernado Vieira in May this year, and the former president was
granted political asylum in Portugal, the West African country's
former colonial ruler.

<HEADLINE> Macao Airport Sees More Passengers, Less Cargo in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of passengers at the
Macao International Airport rose 15 percent in September this year
over that of the same month in 1998, but the cargo transport
declined 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the airport on Wednesday,
the airport handled 210,885 passengers and 3,859 tons of goods in
September this year.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the airport said the cargo traffic was booming in
September last year when there was considerable spillover cargo as
a result of operation constraints at the new Hong Kong airport.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the January-September period in 1998, cargo
volume went down 21 percent during the first nine months of the
year as a whole.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, airport sources attributed the continued
passenger growth to the fact that airline companies have improved
efficiency and increased their transport capacity. In the first
nine months of the year, passenger traffic grew 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Airlines in East China has doubled its weekly
scheduled flights between Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Next month, Air Macao will start or increase flights to Seoul
of the Republic of Korea, Guilin in South China, and Taipei and
Kaohsiung in Taiwan, according to the press release.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Earns US$ 89 Million in Flower Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is quickly
turning into a major exporter of flowers and flower cuttings, with
earnings topping 89 million U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's flower export has overtaken Uganda by 10 percent
in the European market and falls closely behind Kenya the leading
exporter, Financial Times newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the Arusha Region in north Tanzania that enjoys a cool
climate, flowers cover about 120 acres with 8,500 people depending
on the business, the weekly paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands and Germany are the main markets for Tanzanian
flowers.
</P>
<P>
But the native Israeli complained that while Tanzania has
potential to produce a lot of flowers, transport for the bulky
produce remains a problem.
</P>
<P>
Flowers, mainly roses, have become one of the top 10 foreign
exchange earners in the country, Tanzania's Board of External
Trade said, adding that Tanzania has currently more than 10
horticulture firms.
</P>
<P>
A research and planning official at the board told Xinhua that
the Iringa and Mbeya regions in the southwest are also suitable
for the development of horticulture for their cool climate but the
bottleneck is transportation.
</P>
<P>
The official said Tanzania's horticulture has a large potential
to tap but local companies need to increase co-operation with
foreign partners.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday met in a closed-door session to consider a
recommendation by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send U.N.
troops into Sierra Leone to promote the peace process in the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came after two rebel leaders had returned home
three months after the signing of a peace agreement in the
Togolese capital of Lome.
</P>
<P>
The return of Revolutionary United Front leader Foday Sankoh
and former military junta ruler Johnny Paul Koroma is expected to
accelerate the implementation of the July 7 peace accord, which
was hammered out to end the eight-year civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Annan had proposed a 6,000-member U.N.
peacekeeping mission to replace and augment the Nigerian-led West
African peacekeeping force who had intervened on behalf of
President Ahmad Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that Sierra Leone desperately needs international
assistance to prevent another descent into violence and he asked
the 15-nation Security Council to authorize the peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
The exact makeup of the U.N. force remains unclear, but Annan
said it would be made up mainly of West Africans, including the
Nigerian-led troops already in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Annan's recommendation was well received by the Sierra Leonean
government, which has seen it as "a positive step in the right
direction" because the bulk of the peacekeepers will be from the
West African countries that fought to defend the government.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who began the rebellion in 1991, received amnesty
for their war crimes under the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people were killed and many more injured
in the war, which left Sierra Leone in ruins. More than a million
people have left homeless and 500,000 into exile.

<HEADLINE> International Furniture Show Opens in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Index '99, the ninth Middle
East International Furniture and Interior Decoration Exhibition,
opened Wednesday in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with
more than 1,000 companies from 51 countries participating.
</P>
<P>
Among the largest pavilions are the U.K., which is represented
by around 100 suppliers, Italy, with more than 80 exhibitors,
France, with almost 50 participants and Malaysia, which is
fielding 66 companies, according to the organizer of the event DMG
Index Exhibitions Ltd., which is part of Britain's Daily Mail
Group.
</P>
<P>
The annual exhibition, which will last until Sunday, has also
attracted big first-time participants such as China, Egypt,
Korea, Indonesia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Dubai has emerged as the principal trading center for
furniture, shop fitting and interior products in the Gulf, with
70 percent of its imports being re-exported in 1998, said a study
by DMG Index.
</P>
<P>
Total imports last year of furniture, shop fitting and
interior products by Dubai were 632 million U.S. dollars. The
UAE's total imports were 921 million dollars last year against
868 million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Re-exports from Dubai and products in-transit will typically
be transported on to Asia (42 percent), other Gulf states (15
percent), other Middle East countries (12 percent) and Africa (7
percent)," said the study.
</P>
<P>
With the Gulf's population set to increase to over 170 million
by 2010, the regional market for furniture and shop fitting will
increase considerably.
</P>
<P>
"Approximately 60 percent of the Gulf population is under 25
years old. This will result in the establishment of several
hundred thousand new households in the coming decade, stimulating
demand for interior products," the DMG Index report added.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Trying to Save Falling Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda (BOU) has pumped
another seven million U.S. dollars into the foreign exchange
market to save its currency shilling from further stumbling.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the management of the central bank
Tuesday evening said the bank intervened in the foreign exchange
market on the sale side to stem pressure on shilling.
</P>
<P>
"Bank of Uganda intervention on October 6, 1999 puts the total
amount of intervention since the beginning of September to 32
million dollars," it said.
</P>
<P>
The market received more than seven million U.S. dollars from
various sources on October 5 alone, it added.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's intervention, together with the direct
capital flows, has greatly improved the supply of foreign exchange
in the market, said the statement, adding that BOU is ready to
intervene further if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan shilling has been depreciating against U.S. dollar in
recent weeks, from one dollar to 1,450 shillings a month ago to
the current one U. S. dollar to 1,520 shillings. The devaluation
has led to rises in fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
Stagnated tourism industry, slumping export of fish products,
and severe droughts in the coffee-growing zones are said to be the
main reasons for shortage of U.S. dollars in the market.

<HEADLINE> French Judge Investigates Charge Against Gaddafi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A French judge Wednesday launched
an investigation on a legal charge against Libyan President
Muammar Gaddafi for his alleged involvement in a 1989 terrorist
attack on a French passenger plane.
</P>
<P>
Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere of the Paris Investigation Court who
is in charge of anti-terrorist files, said he would agree to probe
into the charge made in June by an anti-terrorist civil group,
SOS-Attentat, and the families of victims of the bombing of a
DC-10 plane of the UTA air company above Niger on September 19,
1989, in which 170 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi was accused of "complicity of voluntary manslaughter"
in that case because the government of Libya was suspected to be
behind the bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
Bruguiere disputed a recommendation by the Public Prosecutor's
Office of Paris in August that the case be closed because the
international customary law covers all sitting heads of state with
immunity, except crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
"It does not result from any clause of the code of criminal
procedure, from the criminal code or the international convention
or treaty which have been ratified by France, in any sort of
immunity of sitting heads of state," he said.

MAPUTO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi Wednesday called on the international community to
continue to support the Mozambican government in eliminating
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the call in capital Maputo when
launching a national program for integrated social action.
</P>
<P>
"If we can not eliminate absolute poverty, we'll have no
environment attractive to investment," said Mocumbi.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that due to the war from 1976 to 1992,
 Mozambique became one of the poorest countries, with 70 percent
of its population living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Agriculture Ministry said that the program was
designed to increase employment for the Mozambicans, and youth in
particular, so as to improve the living conditions of the people.
</P>
<P>
The program needs some 38 million U.S. dollars and it will take
some four years before 250,000 people, mainly women, children,
elderly and the handicapped, will be benefitted.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the social program will start from
Nampula Province in north, Manica Province in central part and
Maputo Province in south.
</P>
<P>
It will take 15 million dollars more for all disadvantaged
Mozambicans to benefit from the poverty reduction program.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate to Postpone Vote on Nuclear Test Ban Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Wednesday the White House and the Senate are seeking to
postpone a vote by the Senate on a comprehensive nuclear test ban
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters at the White House, Clinton said,
"After two years of inaction, one week (of debate) is very little
time for considered action."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would continue to press for the treaty's
approval as long as it is scheduled for a vote Tuesday. He added
that Democrats and Republicans were discussing "a better process
for deliberating on this important treaty."
</P>
<P>
"I fervently believe... that this treaty will restrain the
spread of nuclear weapons, while enabling us to maintain the
effectiveness of our nuclear arsenal," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart raised the idea that
senators may need more months to look at the treaty and "If they
change the schedule, we will adjust accordingly."
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Defense
Secretary William Cohen also asked the Senate to delay the vote.
</P>
<P>
"There should never be a rush to ratify something as
complicated and comprehensive as this...This is the first hearing
that has been held. There should not be a quick vote, but rather a
very thoughtful examination," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who opposed a nuclear test ban when he represented Maine
in the Senate in the 1980s and early 1990s, said he has changed
his mind on the ban.
</P>
<P>
"The threat of nuclear missile proliferation was more acute
today than it was in 1992, and accordingly the importance of
strengthening nonproliferation has increased," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the Senate should ratify the treaty _ but suggested
that, if it couldn't, it should avoid a direct vote rejecting it.
"That would put the United States in a rather difficult position,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said even if the United States continued the moratorium on
testing that has been in place since 1992, it would make it
extremely hard to protest if other nations tested, given a Senate
vote against the ban.
</P>
<P>
"If the Senate rejects the treaty, the proliferation of nuclear
weapons is more likely, posing serious challenges to our
nonproliferation goals," Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Holds Reception Marking China's Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
held a reception at his residence here Wednesday evening to mark
the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Weizman highly appreciated the achievements
made by the Chinese government and people in various fields in
the past 50 years. The new China was founded on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
China has a long history, Weizman said. He noted that fifty
years ago, China was a poor country under the domination of
foreign powers, but during the past 50 years, China has changed a
great deal in all aspects and the country is marching toward
modernization.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visit to China in April this year, he said
China's political and economic developments showed that China is a
great and important country in the world now.
</P>
<P>
Attending the reception were Regional Cooperation Minister
Shimon Peres, Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Industry and
Trade Minister Ran Cohen and others. The reception was also
sponsored by the Council for the Promotion of Israel-China
Relations (CPICR).
</P>
<P>
Peres, also honorary president of CPICR, told the gathering
that the revolution of China during the last 50 years was very
impressive.
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about China you can not forget to say something
about China's rich history and culture. But one thing people will
never forget, that China provides enough food to 20 percent of the
world population with its limited land," he said.
</P>
<P>
Not doubt that China has made great achievements in the
economic field, but China also played an important role in the
world affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is a great hope for the future for us all, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Israel Wang Changyi briefed the
gathering on China's monumental changes in the past 50 years as
well as developments in the cooperation between China and
Israel.

estimated revenue of 4.866 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil and
the estimated potential revenue in the current phase could reach 7
billion dollars, the United Nations said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Office of the Iraq Program said during the
week to 1 october 1999, Iraq exported a total of 15.2 million
barrels of crude oil for an estimated revenue of 328 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Gore Opens New Headquarters in Tennessee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Wednesday officially moved his campaign headquarters to Nashville,
Tennessee State, in an attempt to rejuvenate his campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Now we start a new task, organizing from the grass-roots up,"
Gore said to the cheers of supporters.
</P>
<P>
Gore's campaign was stung in recent weeks by polls and
fund-raising reports showing that former Senator Bill Bradley has
become a formidable challenger for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
The move to Tennessee is part of Gore's attempt to make an
image as an outsider, distance himself from President Clinton and
retool a top-heavy campaign, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The vice president announced Wednesday that he had selected
Donna Brazile, one of the Democratic Party's most experienced
grass-roots organizers, as his new campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
Though Gore was born and raised in Washington, he considers
Tennessee his home. As a boy, he spent summers working on his
family's farm in Carthage, about 50 miles east of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
As a young man, he worked as a reporter at The Tennessean in
Nashville before being elected to the U.S. House in 1976. He also
represented Tennessee in the Senate.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Guatamalan President Alvaro Arzu
concluded a three-day visit to Cuba on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arzu praised at a press conference "the self-sacrificing work
of the 409 Cuban doctors in difficult zones of Guatamala, where
there was either little or no medical assistance".
</P>
<P>
Arzu also gave thanks for the opportunity given to 259 young
Guatamalans, who received grants to study in the Latin American
School of Medicine in Havana.
</P>
<P>
He commented that his visit had completed all its objectives
and was very happy with the agreements signed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Guatamalan president also praised the results of the
meetings between Guatamalan businessmen and the Cuban authorities,
which concluded in the signing of agreements in the areas of
textiles, tourism and construction.
</P>
<P>
Arzu, in addition, praised the cooperation agreement signed
between the two countries for the protection of the heritage in
the historic centers of both Havana and the former capital of
Guatamala, Antigua Guatamala.
</P>

Relations between Cuba and Guatamala were re-established in
January of 1998 after a break of 36 years.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Compensate Iran for Bombing Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will compensate Iran for
the losses caused by its warplane strikes on July 18, Turkish
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli said that a joint Turco-Iranian investigation at the
site had found that the Turkish jets had not bombed Iranian soil,
but that of northern Iraq, where Turkish forces frequently carried
out operations against the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels, with some based in northern Iraq, have been
fighting since 1984 a guerrilla war for an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Atacanli said that "Iranian nationals who were present in
the region at the time suffered certain damage."
</P>
<P>
"In line with the friendly relations between Turkey and Iran,
and out of entirely humanitarian concerns, Turkey will help in the
compensation for this damage," the deputy spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has charged that Turkish fighter jets bombed its
territories on July 18, killing five people and wounding 10
others. Turkey has denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
In late July, Turkish and Iranian officials carried out a
joint investigation into the incident.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be taken up at an upcoming meeting between
Turkish and Iranian officials, who convene regularly within the
framework of a bilateral security cooperation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli declined to tell the approximate amount that Turkey
was ready to pay, saying that this would also be discussed at the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Approves Merger Forming Largest Local Phone Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), by a vote of 5 to 0, cleared Wednesday the way
for a marriage between Ameritech Corp. and SBC Communications, a
deal that would bring together two regional Bell companies to form
the country's largest local phone company.
</P>
<P>
Approval by the FCC is the final step for the deal, originally
valued at 57 billion U.S. dollars, which already has been cleared
by the Justice Department and state regulators. Through one of the
largest mergers in U.S. history, now worth more than 70 billion
dollars, the combined business would control 57 million, or
one-third, of the nation's local phone lines spread across 13
states.
</P>
<P>
"It is the most momentous merger we have ever approved," said
FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. "The commission has never approved a
more comprehensive set of conditions to further competition in
local markets."
</P>
<P>
San Antonio-based SBC and Chicago-based Ameritech say the
merger is good for consumers and competition. They believe it will
spur local phone competition and possibly lower prices, accelerate
the roll-out of high-speed Internet access and data services, and
create jobs.
</P>
<P>
But major long-distance companies and consumer groups had
expressed concern about the merger. MCI WorldCom, Sprint and AT&AMP;T
had argued that the concessions offered by SBC-Ameritech were
accompanied by so many other limitations that they would not aid
competition.
</P>
<P>
Those three companies also would face a potent rival if the
merged company eventually wins federal permission to provide
long-distance service to its local phone customers.

<HEADLINE> Scottish Parliament Seeks to Abolish Feudalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The ruling coalition in
Scotland's new parliament on Wednesday unveiled a bill to formally
end feudal land ownership centuries after most of the rest of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Deputy First Minister Jim Wallace, of the Labor-Liberal
Democrat coalition, said the bill would abolish obscure rights
that feudal superiors still have over people's property, the
Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
While the current law gives feudal superiors some useful rights
to protect conservation areas, for example, it also allows them to
demand money from landowners who want to make even minor changes
to their homes or property, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The current laws have degenerated from a useful system of land
tenure to one which often simply allows people to extract money
from others," the agency quoted Wallace as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the abolition of Feudal Tenure Bill would likely be
passed by next Summer.

ADDIS ABABA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian youth
organization is preparing to start an extensive campaign aimed at
educating people to guard against HIV/AIDS by using condoms, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Greece Expects Turkey's Specific Policy Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said Wednesday that his country did not expect a
specific goodwill gesture from Turkey but a specific change in its
policy on Cyprus and bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with his French
counterpart Hubert Vedrine in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki, Papandreou said that Greece would welcome any steps
on the part of Turkey, however, the issue was not to ask for some
specific move, but for there to be a specific desire on Cyprus and
bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
As for his visit to Istanbul earlier this week, Papandreou said
that the attitudes of the two peoples sent a message to political
leaders and a window had opened for opportunities which Greece and
Turkey must tap.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Vedrine voiced France's desire to see a
rapprochement between Greece and Turkey, which have nearly come to
war three times in the past 25 years for their disputes in the
Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The latest development opened up new prospects and hopes for
both countries and Europe, said Vedrine, who is in Thessaloniki to
attend a Greek-French seminar on cooperation between the two
countries in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece said Wednesday that Cyprus' accession to the
European Union (EU) could not be undermined by anyone, given that
the island's candidacy constituted an EU decision.

Prescott said the new review would examine which was the best

The review would cover train protection systems and ways of

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Delaying Senate Vote on Nuke Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Wednesday the door is left open for the Senate to postpone
a vote by the Senate on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters at the White House, Clinton said,
"After two years of inaction, one week (of debate) is very little
time for considered action."
</P>
<P>
The administration made the choice after realizing that it is
almost impossible for the treaty to be passed by the Senate.
Almost every Republican in the Republican-controlled Senate
opposed ratifying the pact.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would continue to press for the treaty's
approval as long as it is scheduled for a vote Tuesday. He added
that Democrats and Republicans were discussing "a better process
for deliberating on this important treaty."
</P>
<P>
"I fervently believe... that this treaty will restrain the
spread of nuclear weapons, while enabling us to maintain the
effectiveness of our nuclear arsenal," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart raised the idea that
senators may need more months to look at the treaty and "If they
change the schedule, we will adjust accordingly."
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Defense
Secretary William Cohen also asked the Senate to delay the vote.
</P>
<P>
"There should never be a rush to ratify something as
complicated and comprehensive as this...This is the first hearing
that has been held. There should not be a quick vote, but rather a
very thoughtful examination," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who opposed a nuclear test ban when he represented Maine
in the Senate in the 1980s and early 1990s, said he has changed
his mind on the ban.
</P>
<P>
"The threat of nuclear missile proliferation was more acute
today than it was in 1992, and accordingly the importance of
strengthening nonproliferation has increased," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the Senate should ratify the treaty _ but suggested
that, if it couldn't, it should avoid a direct vote rejecting it.
"That would put the United States in a rather difficult position,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said even if the United States continued the moratorium on
testing that has been in place since 1992, it would make it
extremely hard to protest if other nations tested, given a Senate
vote against the ban.
</P>
<P>
"If the Senate rejects the treaty, the proliferation of nuclear
weapons is more likely, posing serious challenges to our
nonproliferation goals," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The pact has been signed by more than 154 countries, but will
take effect only after all the 44 countries in the Conference on
Disarmament ratified it. Only 26 of them have ratified the treaty
thus far.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Grants $61.5 Million to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAAM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has
granted 61.5 million U.S. dollars to Tanzania for improving
financial institutions and paying debts, the Minister of Finance
Daniel Yona said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters at his office in capital Dar es Salaam, Yona
said 25 million dollars are for improving the Privatization Trust
Fund which is under the Parastatal Sector Reform Commission,
strengthening of the Capital Market Policy and strengthening of
the Insurance Company at treasury which is a regulatory of finance
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The funds were disbursed according to one of the three
financial agreements reached by Tanzania and the World Bank in a
recent meeting in Washington, Yona said.
</P>
<P>
"Money will also be spent on improving the People's Bank of
Zanzibar," the minister said, adding that the third agreement
signed was on the Debt- Buy-Back facility, under which the World
Bank had offered some 35 million U. S. dollars for paying
outstanding debt.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Multi-lateral Debt Relief Fund, the minister
said that Tanzania was previously given some eight million dollars
for poverty alleviation under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative and has implemented the program for last four
years.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on HIPC, he said, such a relief was only made
available to countries that perform efficiently in improving the
national economic growth and properly manage financial resources.
</P>
<P>
"Under this phase, about 28 countries including Tanzania will
be given a debt relief to be used in poverty eradication. We are
expecting to get the relief by June next year," he said, adding
that the amount is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, Tanzania's external debt stood at 8.07
billion dollars, according to the latest monthly economic review
of the Bank of Tanzania, central bank of the east African country.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Welcomes Approval of EU Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 6 (Xinhua) --The South African government
and opposition parties Wednesday welcomed the overwhelming
approval by the European Parliament of a trade deal between the
European Union and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The deal, approved earlier in the day, will cut customs tariffs
on trade in both directions and will be signed in Pretoria on
October 11, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Of 525 voting deputies in the European Parliament, 430 said yes
to the deal finalized after three and half years of tough
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Chief director for foreign trade in the South African
Department of Trade, Bahle Sibisi, said that the decision was an
important signal from the European Parliament, which had always
taken a positive approach to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Sibisi said South African and European Union representatives
were preparing for next week's signing by President Thabo Mbeki
and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who presides over the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The trade official said the agreement, to come into force at
the beginning of next year, would mean immediate benefits through
a phased reduction of tariffs on industrial exports to the EU, and
more competitive tariffs on agricultural goods.
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, it would boost South Africa's
attractiveness to investors looking for a platform for exports to
the EU and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been concern about a separate wine and spirit
 agreement, which should be finalized soon. It had not been
anticipated that it would necessarily be signed at the same time
as the main agreement.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party trade spokesman Nigel Bruce said the deal was
"substantially to our mutual benefit" and that it would be
churlish to make too much of the "pedestrian" negotiation process
that led up to it.
</P>
<P>
The deal would have a major impact on trade with what was
already South Africa's larger market.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the agricultural clauses are not as we would have
wanted them, but given the European intransigence (even paranoia)
on agricultural matters, this country is not at a major
disadvantage," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He feared that South Africa's initial insistence on a
developmental emphasis rather than a focus on free trade gave the
French and their allies a chance to press demands such as the
naming of "port" and "sherry" with more vigor.
</P>
<P>
Inkatha Freedom Party trade spokesman Hennie Bekker welcomed
the finalization of the deal, which was "long overdue", and what
the country needed.
</P>
<P>
The 200-page agreement will liberalize nearly 90 percent of
trade between the EU's 15 member states and South Africa, which
totals 17.1 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will lift customs duties from 86 percent of EU
exports to South Africa over a 12-year period.
</P>
<P>
It will also eliminate custom duties from 95 percent of South
African exports to the EU over 10 years.

<HEADLINE> More Extremists Repent under Reconciliation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Senior Algerian officials here
Wednesday assessed the implementation of the Civil Reconciliation
Law aimed at persuading extremists to lay down their arms and
surrender to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Abdul-Malik Sallal, Justice Minister Al-Ghoti
Makamshah and leaders of local and environment groups held a joint
press conference on the law which took effect in June.
</P>
<P>
Sallal was quoted by the Algerian News Agency as estimating the
number of repentant extremists within and outside the country till
mid-day Tuesday at 531.
</P>
<P>
The 531 repentant extremists including 25 women, who
surrendered themselves voluntarily to the security authorities,
belong to the Armed Islamic Group, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the enactment of the law, the number of extremists
surrendering to the authorities was 463, he added.
</P>
<P>
The law, issued by President Abdul-Aziz Bouteflika on July 13
after being endorsed by the two chambers of the parliament,
provides special measures in dealing with those who were involved
in terror acts and want to express themselves without resort to
violence.
</P>
<P>
The law offers an opportunity for those people to achieve their
aspirations and integrate into the society, Sallal said.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that all the repentant elements enjoyed preferential
treatments under the law, Sallal said the deadline for leniency
falls on January 13, 2000.
</P>
<P>
After the deadline, the public law will be enforced strictly
and relentlessly, the interior minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
There are still many who are subject to pressures from the
armed group leaders and can not surrender to the authorities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry intends to distribute stickers and
leaflets in public places and mountainous areas by helicopters to
explain the law and show its guarantees to those "elements," he
added.
</P>
<P>
By the holy fasting month of Ramadan, the Civil Reconciliation
Law might meet its targets, thus introducing Algeria to the third
millennium with the great hope of establishing peace, security and
stability, Sallal said.

LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) - Europe's three main stock markets
rose for a third straight session Wednesday as Wall Street pushed
higher.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 gained 30 points in the last half-hour of
trading to close up 13 points, or 0.2 percent, at 6079.50 after
spending most of the session in the red.
</P>
<P>
A modest rally late on the day pulled the market up after a
morning spent in the doldrums as once again interest rate fears
cast a long shadow over trading.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE Eurotop 300 ended 0.36 percent higher. The
telecommunications, utility and technology sectors all climbed
more than 1 percent while steel and transport stocks fell.
</P>
<P>
Transport stocks suffered selling pressure in a sector where
sentiment has turned bearish following the fatal rail crash in
London Tuesday. Railtrack, which maintains the track involved in
the crash, slid 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt made the strongest showing,
climbing almost 1 percent to end its session at 5353.32. A strong
5.1 percent showing in German industrial orders for August boosted
the index.

JERUSALEM -- Israel's beaches have been contaminated by a large
amount of heavy metal carried here by wind from Europe and some of
the metal is considered toxic and with nitrates used in fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Researchers conducted test on dust particles on the beaches and
found that the contaminants were carried to Israel by dust
particles from Europe and some of them came down with the rain.
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen and ammonia also made their way here from Europe
and the source of those elements was fuel combustion and animal
waste.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said that compared to rivers in other
places in the world, Israel's rivers have been polluted with
fertilizers to a considerably higher degree. This is because of
the small amount of water flowing in the rivers and large amount
of sewage poured into them. (BC-Israel-Sea Pollution)

<HEADLINE> Study: Global Warming Could Be Tackled with Less Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A multi-gas strategy, which
controls multiple greenhouse gases instead of focusing only on
carbon dioxide, may not only be a better option in tackling global
warming, but could reduce the control costs significantly as well,
U.S. scientists said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said that a general preoccupation with the
importance of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels
may be exaggerating the costs involved in meeting the aims of the
Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997 by 84 countries, aims to cut
carbon emissions to just over five percent below their 1990 level
by 2008 to 2012 with the intent of slowing global warming.
</P>
<P>
Much current analyses of costs to comply with the Protocol have
considered only emissions of carbon dioxides from fossil fuels.
Likewise, most analysis and policy discussion also narrows climate
issues to a debate about carbon emissions from fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
However, a new study, by Dr John Reilly of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the United States, and colleagues, found
that emphasizing on carbon emissions has led to an approximately
21 percent overestimation of annual costs in 2010 for meeting
Kyoto Protocol emissions caps in industrialized regions.
</P>
<P>
Their analysis, published in the British science journal
Nature, showed that inclusion of non-carbon dioxide gases in the
Kyoto Protocol can lead to greater reductions in the impact of
greenhouse gas emissions than if only controlling carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
The research, the first comprehensive assessment of economic,
atmospheric, climatic, and ecosystem effects of the Kyoto
Protocol, also indicated that a multi-gas control strategy could
cut the costs of meeting the Kyoto agreement by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The main finding is that including gases other than carbon
dioxide emissions from fossil fuels could greatly reduce costs of
meeting the Protocol," Dr John Reilly has concluded.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Volcano Expulses 200,000 Tons of Ash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's volcano Guagua Pichincha
expulsed a total of 200,000 tons of ash on Tuesday, said Quito's
Mayor Roque Sevilla on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The explosion of the Guagua Pichincha had already been
anticipated, due to the appearance of a cupola in the super part
of the volcano, said the Mayor at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The volcano, with a height of 1,794 meters, is situated ten
kilometers to the east of the the capital city of Quito.
</P>
<P>
The cloud of ash expulsed after the explosion reached a height
of 20 kilometers above the volcano, and there were 330 low
intensity seismic shocks recorded, according to experts from the
Geophysical Institute of the National Polytechnic School (GINPS)
in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The Mayor said that of the ash expulsed, around 5,000 tons fell
on the capital.
</P>
<P>
He added that the scientists forecast the explosions of the
volcano will continue for months, possibly even years.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the GINPS said that this explosion was the
strongest recorded since the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Britain Tells U.N. of its Arms Export to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain has notified U.N.
Security Council sanctions committee that it is exporting a
shipment of arms and ammunition to Sierra Leone for use by its new
army, following an end to a nine-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Notification of the supply of arms and ammunition to the Sierra
Leonean Government, as well as of the port of entry -- in this
case Elizabeth ii Quay in the West African nation's capital of
Freetown -- is required under a June 1998 Security Council
resolution.
</P>
<P>
That followed an October 1997 council resolution that banned
all arms exports to the former British colony when it was under
the control of a rebel military government.
</P>
<P>
The British Government was involved in a scandal at the time
when a British defense service company, Sandline, provided Sierra
Leone's legitimate president, Ahmad Kabbah, with arms.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah was elected president in elections in 1996, but was
overthrown by the rebels in 1997. He returned to office in 1998
with the help of a group of neighboring states in the region.
</P>
<P>
A letter circulated here Wednesday by the chairman of the
sanctions committee said it was notified by Britain that it was
exporting 132 general purpose machine guns and two million rounds
of ammunition for those weapons: 24 81-millimeter mortar systems
and more than 2,000 81-mm mortar bombs; 24 hand-held mortar
computers; 24 mortar sights; 7,500 self-loading rifles; 3,000
uniforms and boots; and 800,000 rounds of training ammunition for
rifles.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Keen to Know China's Experience: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- "The people and the government of
Bangladesh not only consider China as a friend, but are also keen
to know the experience of China for our own achievement and
success in our economic development," a Bangladeshi official said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at a seminar on China's reform, arranged by
Bangladesh China People's Friendship Association on the occasion
of the 50th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of
China, Abul Hasan Chowdhury, state minister for foreign affairs,
expressed his confidence that China will become a great power both
politically and economically in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury reaffirmed that the present government of Bangladesh
gives full support to the "one China policy" and to China for its
entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Zillur Rahman, minister for local government, rural development
and cooperatives, said in his speech that China has achieved great
success today due to its policy of reform and opening up and the
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the traditional good relations
between Bangladesh and China will further develop in the future.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of well-known experts, professors and journalists
attended the seminar which lasted for more than four hours.
</P>
<P>
Reazuddin Ahmed, chief editor of The Financial Express, noted
that the objective of China's opening-up policy is "to draw into
China the competition mechanism" for its economic development and
to achieve "common prosperity."
</P>
<P>
During the present financial crisis which has been engulfed
most of the Asian countries, "the Asian tigers are sick, but the
lion of China is not affected," Ahmed said, adding that "No doubt,
the opening-up policy of China is correct."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar, Wang Jinsheng, secretary general of the
Chinese Association for International Understanding and leader of
the visiting four-member Chinese delegation of the association,
briefed the seminar on China's modernization drive and reform and
opening up over the past 50 years, especially over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who arrived here last Monday at the invitation of the
Bangladesh China People's Friendship Association, observed that
China has changed in an all-round way over the past 50 years and
the most prominent is the rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Deng Xiaoping Theory is the only correct
theory that ensures that China's development proceeds along the
right path.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategic goal is to basically realize modernization by
the middle of the 21st century and turn China into a strong
democratic, culturally advanced socialist country," he said.
"China's development cannot be separated from the rest of the
world and global prosperity also needs China. China will, as
always, actively participate in international economic
cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Better HK Foundation Panelists Applaud Tung's Policy Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Better Hong Kong Foundation
panelists have given full support to the long-term vision and
plans outlined by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa in his policy
address, describing them as laying out a clearer road map for
making Hong Kong an international hub.
</P>
<P>
They believed that improving Hong Kong's environment and
attracting and nurturing talent will help win back residents'
confidence in the city's future.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came from the panelists who participated in the
Better Hong Kong Foundation Forum Wednesday on Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa's annual policy address.
</P>
<P>
This is the third year that the Better Hong Kong Foundation has
organized such a forum.
</P>
<P>
Setting a positive tone for the forum discussion, Professor Lau
Siu-Kai, associate director of the Chinese University of Hong Kong,
described the policy address this year as realistic, practical and
"back to basics."
</P>
<P>
Professor Richard Wong, director of the School of Business of
the University of Hong Kong, commended the policy address as
having well-articulated key points. He applauded the government's
intent to improve the environment and believed that the government
has provided specific proposals, particularly regarding
controlling transportation and gas quality. Furthermore, the
government's emphasis on collaborating with different regions in
China's mainland to improve the environment shows its seriousness
and determination.
</P>
<P>
Eden Woon, director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce, also found the policy address satisfactory. He observed
that the Hong Kong business community would appreciate Tung's
assurance that government interference in the market only occurs
under extreme circumstances. In addition, Woon said that paying
attention to the environment would not only improve Hong Kong
residents' health, but can also help attract talented hi-tech
experts from abroad to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson from the Better Hong Kong Foundation said the
chief executive emphasized the importance of free market and fair
competition when he talked about the government's role in
economics. These conditions are essential for Hong Kong's future
economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that preserving 'small' government will be
important to the business community and especially to maintaining
international investors' confidence in Hong Kong," he said.

firmly opposed to the U.S. State Department's unwarranted charges
against China's religious affairs, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department recently criticized China's religion
affairs on the basis of the Religious Freedom Act of the United
States, and threatened to impose sanctions against China, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government adopts the policy of freedom in religion,
which has been guaranteed by law, Zhang said, adding that article
36 of China's Constitution stipulates that the citizens of the
People's Republic of China enjoy freedom in religion.

CPPCC Chairman Meets Russian Communist Party Delegation
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), met here today
with a delegation from the Communist Party of Russia (CPR), led by
chairman of its central committee Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
On relations between the two parties, Li said it is helpful
for the two parties to increase contact and exchange views on
issues of common concern. The CPC is willing to continue to deepen
its friendship with the CPR on the principles of independence,
complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov noted that during the current visit he has found that
China has changed greatly, under the correct policy guidance of
the CPC. Deng Xiaoping Theory and the achievements during China's
reform and opening up have attracted attention in Russia.

<HEADLINE> China Planning Venture Investment System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese ministries are working
on a report on establishing a venture investment system, Deng Nan,
Vice-Minister of Science and Technology, said at the First China
International High Technology Fair here today.
</P>
<P>
The report is expected to be made public before the end of this
year, she said. To ensure the smooth development of a venture
investment system, government departments will suggest that the
corporation law be amended and that related laws and codes be
changed.
</P>
<P>
Because of a lack of a venture investment system, she said,
many sectors cannot get enough funds, and at the same time, many
financial institutions are not using their money efficiently. So,
a venture investment system is a must.
</P>
<P>
There's a great deal of interest in China in venture investment
and overseas investors will be encouraged to participate in
establishing one, she said.
</P>
<P>
There are some 80 venture investment institutions in China,
with a total investment volume of 3.5 billion yuan (430 million U.
S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Abu Dhabi Sea Port Authority will host the
"Abu Dhabi '99 World Ports Conference and Exhibition" here from
November 22 to 23.
</P>
<P>
This is the first event of its kind to be held in the United
Arab Emirates, said the Khaleej Times daily on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 40 world leading companies engaged in port services,
logistics, cargo handling and shipping will take part in the
conference and the exhibition which will be held on the sidelines
of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the port business will be presenting technical
papers dealing with ports, logistics, warehousing, port planning,
freight variations and other topics, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese Customs Higher Council has imposed a minimum
tariff of five U.S. dollars per kilogram on imported honey, the
Safir newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase has raised the tax on imported honey from 34
percent to 35 percent at the end of last week, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Imported honey, much of which comes from Germany and Greece,
accounts for 95 percent of the Lebanese honey market, which
consumes 400 to 500 tons of honey each year.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Malaysian Timber Council (MTC) has officially
opened a regional office in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
to promote sales of Malaysia's timber products in the Gulf region,
the Khaleej Times daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dubai handles more than 90 percent of the UAE's imports of
timber products, said Ismail Anwang, chief executive officer of
MTC. He added that in 1997, timber imports through Dubai reached
about 400 million U.S. dollars, with Malaysia supplying 73.7
million dollars, which works out to a market share of 18.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's export of timber products to the Middle East is
also very promising as export volume totaled 149.59 million
dollars in 1998, said Anwang.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese government will introduce its longest
maturity of Treasury bills (T-bill) before the end of this year,
the Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister George Korom said that the new T-bill would
have a maturity of either three or five years.
</P>
<P>
The country's Central Bank currently auctions T-bills with
maturities of six, 12 months and two years.
</P>
<P>
Average yields on the two-year T-bills have fallen by almost
two percentage points since June and now stand at 14.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Korom said three- or five-year paper would help reduce the
government's reliance on shorter-term T-bills and spread out its
schedule of debt repayments.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Chief Urges Kosovo Albanians to End Threats to Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 7 (Xinhua)-- Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
should end their threats to the Serb population, Knut Vollebaek,
Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More ethnic tolerance is needed for the building of a
democratic new Kosovo, said the Norwegian foreign minister who is
currently holding the rotating presidency of the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in Pristine, Vollebaek called the
Albanian leaders to take tangible measures to end the spread of
violence and massacre against the Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Yugoslavia news agency Tanjug released a
statement, saying that Vollebaek was obliged to make the remarks
on the issue, because should he remain silent, "the OSCE-planned
election to be held next year in Kosovo would have only Albanians
as the participants."
</P>
<P>
The current situation in Kosovo is a result of the appeasement
policy adopted by the international peacekeeping forces and the U.
N. special representatives toward the Albanian terrorists, the
statement charged.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the U.S.-led NATO's two-month airstrikes
against Yugsolavia and the mass return of ethnic Albanians to
Kosovo, there have been continuous ethnic violence against the
minority Serbs, forcing most of them out of the province.

obstacles that hindered the growth of bilateral trade and
strengthening of border trade."

BEIRUT -- Three Israeli soldiers were wounded Thursday in a
clash with Lebanese guerrillas in south Lebanon, security sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The casualties occurred when a patrol of Israeli troops was
ambushed by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party
of God, at the entrance to the Israeli outpost in Rihan in the
eastern sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas and Israeli troops consequently fell into
a face-to-face fighting and strong smoke can be seen rising from
the outpost, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in a statement that several Israeli military
vehicles were also destroyed in the clash, in addition to Israeli
casualties.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official confirmation of the casualties from
the Israeli authority.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 allegedly to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli troops out of the
country. (Lebanon-Israel-Casualties)

<HEADLINE> Former Singapore PM Says Confucianism Passes Test Of Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Singaporean Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew said here on Thursday that Confucianism has
passed the test of time and that it is still valuable in today's
world.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who is honorable president of the International Confucian
Association, prepared a speech for the International Seminar on
the 2,550th Anniversary of the Birth of Confucius that was read by
Chin Siat Yoon, Singapore's Ambassador to China, on behalf of Lee.
The four-day seminar began on Thursday at Beijing's Great Hall of
the People.
</P>
<P>
In it, Lee said that, during the Asian financial crisis, some
western countries accused Asian values like Confucianism of being
flawed. Professor Thomas Metzger of the Hoover Institute, agreed
with him, saying that it is unreasonable for people to accuse
Confucianism, which is one pole of the world culture, of being
imperfect. There is no doctrine in the world that is perfect, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Gong Dafei, the executive vice-president of the Association,
said that the reason they study Confucianism is not by any means
to restore the ancient ways, but rather because many ideas from
Confucianism could inspire today's world to deal with issues like
peace, development, the environment, and human relations.
</P>
<P>
Among the 400 participants at the seminar are senior diplomats
from South Korea, Germany, and France, and experts from Indonesia,
Thailand, Australia, Britain, the United States, Russia and Israel.

<HEADLINE> China Commends National Day Gala Participants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The CPC Central Committee and
the State Council have issued a memo to commend units and people
participating in the 50th National Day gala and its preparations.
</P>
<P>
October 1 this year marked the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic of China. Beijing held a military parade,
mass procession and grand ceremony on Tiananmen Square in honor of
the event.
</P>
<P>
The memo, issued on October 4, says that the military parade
demonstrated the capability of China's military force to safeguard
the safety of the country as well as China's desire to promote
world peace and development. The mass procession reflected the
great achievement made by the Chinese people over the past five
decades under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with
Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin at its core.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council, all celebration activities were undertaken by the Leading
Group and the Preparatory Committee of Celebrations for the 50th
Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China,
which have been working since May last year.
</P>
<P>
The memo also offers high praise for soldiers and other gala
participants who devoted their time, energy and enthusiasm to the
parade.
</P>
<P>
The departments who prepared for the achievement exhibition
honoring the 50th anniversary have pushed the exhibition to an
unprecedented high level, it says.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the celebration activity is closely related to
the efficient work of the Beijing Municipal government," it says.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for all the Chinese people to learn from those
National Day gala participants, and closely unite around the CPC
central committee, with Jiang Zemin at its core, hold highly the
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and march toward the trans-century
lofty goals.

<HEADLINE> Pak Has Proof of Terrorist Camps in Afghanistan: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Thursday said that Pakistan has solid evidence of the
existence of terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and that his
government has asked the Taliban militia to eradicate them.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Sharif said that "we have
concrete evidence of terrorist training camps inside Afghanistan"
and that people trained there are involved in the terrorist
activities in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Some people have been arrested and investigation revealed that
there is a training camp in Afghanistan" where these people got
the training to carry out terrorism in Pakistan, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, a Pakistani delegation led by
a senior intelligence official was sent to Kandahar, the
headquarters of the Taliban, and had a meeting with Taliban leader
Mullah Muhammad Omar who was provided with strong evidence of
terrorist camps in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the Taliban authorities have been told clearly to
take immediate measures against these camps.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan acted promptly as it "will not allow any one to
disrupt law and order at any cost," he added.
</P>
<P>
At least 27 people, including both Shiite and Sunni Muslims,
have been killed during the past eight days in a fresh wave of
terrorist violence in different parts of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said some people thought that there had been possible
involvement of some "foreign hand" in the recent killings in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"I will avoid saying this unless there is solid evidence in
this regard," said the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Jobless Claims Rise to Highest Level in Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Thursday that the number of new claims for jobless benefits in the
country increased last week to the highest level in more than two
months.
</P>
<P>
The department reported that 312,000 people filed new claims
for unemployment benefits for the week ending October 2, up by 10,
000 from the previous week. It was the highest level since July
17, when claims were at 315,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the four-week average for claims also was up last
week to 294,000. That was the highest level since July 31, when
claims were at 295,250.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials said part of last week's increase could be
related to the Hurricane's effects.
</P>
<P>
Many economists expect the nation's unemployment rate, now at 4.
2 percent, to stay at that 29-year-low when the government
releases its September unemployment report Friday. Some
economists believe that rate could dip to 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department also said that for the week ending September 25,
21 states and territories reported increases in new jobless claim
applications, while 32 reported decreases. The state data lag a
week behind the national figures.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest increase was North Carolina, up by
10,352. Officials said the increase was mainly because of the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest decrease was New York, down by 829.
Officials didn't give a reason for the decline.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Two Commercial Banks to Form Holding Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank, two of
Japan's major commercial banks, have agreed to establish a joint
holding company in October 2000 to create the country's third
biggest bank with assets of about 59 trillion yen (551.4 billion U.
S. dollars), the banks announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By October 2001, the banks plan to reorganize their operations
into three banks covering Japan's three key financial centers --
Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka -- as well as an international investment
banking unit.
</P>
<P>
The two banks will put greater emphasis on lending operations
for medium-sized and small businesses and individuals in Japan,
and both will continue to target mainly at Japan's small
businesses operating abroad.
</P>
<P>
A total of 70 domestic branches and outlets will be merged,
while around 10 business bases abroad will be integrated, the
banks said.
</P>
<P>
Asahi and Tokai, following Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and
the Industrial Bank of Japan, did not opt for a merger. The three
banks announced in late August that they plan to integrate
operations under a holding company to create the world's biggest
banking group.
</P>
<P>
The decision only to integrate operations was intended to allow
independent management of subsidiaries and avoid internal
confusion and conflicts that could be caused by a merger, the two
banks said.
</P>
<P>
The holding company will have its head office in Tokyo. Asahi
Bank President Tatsuro Ito will be the chairman of the holding
company, while Tokai Bank President Hideo Ogasawara will be
president.

<HEADLINE> Norman Challenged, Chang Advances in Shanghai Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Hot favorite second seed Magnus
Norman of Sweden overcame a lack of sleep to defeat fiesty Peter
Wessels 6-7 (4-7), 7-5, 7-6 (7-3) in the second round of the
Heineken Open here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Norman was taken aback by Wessels's solid baseliner as well as
his powerful serve in the first set. Fortunately he pulled himself
together in the following two sets.
</P>
<P>
"He was a better player from the back court than I expected",
the world 23-ranked Swede said. "I knew he had a good serve and
volley, but then I also made him good because I didn't have any
depth to my strokes. I will have to be more concentrated on the
court in the next match."
</P>
<P>
Norman put his under-par performance to lack of sleep last
night. He said he went to bed at 10 p.m yesterday but could not go
to sleep till 3.30 a.m. in the morning. He tossed and turned. He
watched a movie. Then it was too hot, then it was too cold. The
bed was too hard. It was just one of those nights.
</P>
<P>
"The day did not start too good because I woke up late because
I went to sleep late, and I didn't have breakfast, so it was not
as good a start to the day as the finish," said Norman.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Michael Chang cruised through what was
potentially a very tough match where he beat Max Mirnyi of Belarus
6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
"He played tough tennis tonight," said Chang. "His serve is one
of the biggest on the Tour and I tried to stay tough."
</P>
<P>
Jan-Michael Gambill was well and truly in the drivers seat as
he found himself a parking place in the quarterfinals by steering
his way through the Frenchman Anthony Dupuis 6-3, 6-4. Joining
fourth seeded Gambill is the Thai player Paradorn Srichaphan who
defeated Dutchman John van Lottum 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Gambill, who has a passion for motor cars in particular those
with a jaguar on the bonnet having recently purchased his fifth
one, is hoping to make up for what he calls a disappointing summer
on the American circuit this year.
</P>
<P>
"Dupuis is tough and he can hit winners from anywhere on the
court, but one thing I did well was to return well," said Gambill
about the one hour 26 minutes match. "I have been working on the
fundamentals of my game, practicing really hard and doing lots of
weights and running."
</P>
<P>
Before Srichaphan walked on court to play van Lottum of the
Netherlands he felt confident of a positive result even though van
Lottum had beaten him in the Ho Chi Minh Challenger earlier in the
year.
</P>
<P>
The crowd was in full support of the Thai player, who was a
winner of the gold medal at the 1998 Asian Games, and the win
placed him in his second consecutive quarterfinal, the last one
was in Tashkent a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to break into the top 200 and in January this year
I was 350, now I am 169, so in the three months left (of the year)
I want to try for the top 150," said Srichaphan. "I think the
crowd like me because I hit the ball very hard and I am fun to
watch."
</P>
<P>
The quarterfinal lineup pits top seed Marcelo Rios against "
lucky loser" Todd Woodbridge, fifth seed Jonas Bjorkman against
Andreas Vinceguerra, Norman against Srichaphan and Chang against
Gambill.
</P>
<P>
In the doubles, defending champions and top seeds Mahesh
Bhupathi and Leander Paes were forced to withdraw because Bhupathi
injured his left leg during their previous doubles match. That
gave Neville Godwin and Grant Stafford a walkover into the
semifinals.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Vice President Al Gore Wednesday formally shifted his
presidential campaign headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee, from
Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States, backed by Russia, introduced a draft
resolution in the U.N Security Council Wednesday to impose an air
embargo and financial sanctions on Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
unless it surrenders Saudi militant and accused terrorist Osama
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. House and Senate struck a deal that would let the
70 billion dollars F-22 Air Force fighter go into production if it
passed stringent flight tests.
</P>
<P>
-- The death toll from the train crash in London rose to at
least 70 and the fate of 100 more people remained unclear,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- AT and T said Leo Hindery, the company's top cable and

to AT and T's plans to turn the company into a major player in
cable TV, using cable lines for local phone service and Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
-- India began counting votes from its monthlong election, and
the only question appears to be how comfortable the Hindu
nationalist-led alliance's victory will be. A thin margin may
mean instability. The Congress Party's Sonia Gandhi won at least
one race she ran in.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Teachers Stage Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Primary and post-primary school
teachers in most states of Nigeria have staged an indefinite
strike following the expiration of the ultimatum given by the
National Union of Teachers (NUT) to the government.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters on the strike beginning from Wednesday, the
union President David Atunrase said in Ilorin, Kwara State, that
the action is taken as a protest against salary arrears for
teachers since January.
</P>
<P>
Atunrase said the union's dialogue with Nigerian education
minister broke down because the minister insisted that the
salaries had been sent to states while the striking teachers said
that the funds meant for their salaries had been diverted by some
state governments, the New Nigerian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the union would meet the minister for
education again next week, adding that "we are not opposed to
dialogue."
</P>
<P>
He also asked the government to consider the other demands of
the union, including the payment of benefits of retired teachers
and the establishment of a sustainable pension scheme for
teachers.
</P>
<P>
The education sector in Nigeria has been riddled with crisis in
recent months with the outstanding arrears of teachers' salaries
being a burning issue in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
The universities are currently rusty due to the on-going strike
by the Academic Staff Union of Universities while evidence shows
that the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics are most likely to
follow soon.

<HEADLINE> One-stop Action Center to Spur Investments: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada expressed confidence Thursday that his administration's
one-stop action center for investors would spur foreign
investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president said the one-stop center should get rid of red
tape and other hassles that had deterred foreign businessmen from
pouring their resources here in the past.
</P>
<P>
"There is too much red tape, that's why foreigners decide to
invest elsewhere. That's why we decided to put up this one-stop
shop," he said in a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
Estrada earlier signed an executive order to revitalize an
investment center under the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
and make investing in the Philippines hassle-free.
</P>
<P>
The one-stop center, he said, would provide investors with
information, guidance and advice regarding Philippine customs,
trade, taxes and other laws.
</P>
<P>
"The one-stop shop would offer services of the Department of
Foreign Affairs, Bureau of Immigration, Board of Investments and
the DTI," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Also on hand to offer their services in the one-stop center, he
added, are agencies that grant permits involving local government
units and the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president said the establishment of the one-stop
center is one of the measures that his administration is
implementing while long-term economic reforms through the
charter-change process are not yet in place.
</P>
<P>
The economic reforms that Estrada is seeking include the
lifting constitutional restrictions on the foreign ownership of
land and equity in local businesses, including the public
utilities sector.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Annual Military Maneuvers End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The annual military maneuvers of
Cyprus National Guard, code-named Nikiforos '99, ended Thursday
with a military parade in which Greek fighter jets participated.
</P>
<P>
Four F-16 fighters of the Greek air force as well as Cyprus
National Guard Bell and Gazelle helicopters flew over the
four-hour parade, in the southern coastal town of Larnaca and in
Paphos on the western coast.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides took the salute of the Larnaca
parade.
</P>
<P>
The six-day "Nikiforos '99" was carried out in conjunction
with Greek military maneuvers "Toxotis" and was watched by the
Greek military leadership.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said at the end of a military parade the country's
armed forces have been upgraded a great deal since last year.
</P>
<P>
He also said this year's parade was carried out according to
plan and was not in any way affected by any Turkish threats.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has claimed that Cyprus' military exercises caused
instability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus president said the National Guard is more than
ready to fulfill its duty of defending the country.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased to see the good coordination between
Nicosia and Athens, in the framework of the joint defense pact.
"The people of Cyprus should feel very safe," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus reached an agreement in November 1993 that
Greece will offer Cyprus land, sea and air cover in the event of
fresh Turkish attacks.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were
wounded Thursday in a clash with Lebanese guerrillas in south
Lebanon, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The casualties occurred when a patrol of Israeli troops was
ambushed by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party
of God, at the entrance to the Israeli outpost in Rihan in the
eastern sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas and Israeli troops consequently fell into
a face-to-face fighting and strong smoke can be seen rising from
the outpost, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in a statement that several Israeli military
vehicles were also destroyed in the clash, in addition to Israeli
casualties.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official confirmation of the casualties from
the Israeli authority.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 allegedly to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli troops out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Mild Quakes Hit Southeastern Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A mild earthquake was felt in
southeastern Bangladesh's Chittagong seaport early Thursday
morning, the BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 10-second tremor started at 04:25:45 local time, but no
major damage or injuries due to the earthquake have been reported
from any place so far, police and local administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
"The epicenter of today's quake was 78 kilometers off from the
port city," said officials of the country's only Seismic
Observatory Center, which is located in Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
According to records of the center, three mild earthquakes
shook different places of the country, including Dhaka, Sylhet and
Chittagong, since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seismic observatory center, however, failed to provide
exact locations and details of the quakes because of lack of
modern equipment to translate the data into the Richter scale, the
BSS said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Geological Survey of Bangladesh were quoted as
saying all the three quakes were below 2.8 on the Richter scale as
any tremor with an intensity of above 2.8 degrees was reported in
the Internet web site of the United States Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
On October 5 and 6, two mild tremors were recorded by the
seismic observatory center, the epicenters of which were located
437 and 113 kilometers off the port city respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mild earthquakes rocked the Maheshkali Island in the Bay of
Bengal, 25 kilometers from the southeastern sea resort of Cox's
Bazar, late July and early August this year, killing five people,
injuring about 200 others and damaging thousands of houses.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kathmandu Valley Paralyzed by Threat of Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kathmandu Valley is almost
paralyzed Thursday amid threat of violence by the ultra-leftist
guerrillas who called for a national strike to protest against the
killing of one of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
The city is unusually quiet, with no more bustles and rustles
from busy traffic of vehicles as on normal days.
</P>
<P>
People are warned not to go to work, otherwise, they may be
attacked. As motor vehicles are said to be the main target of
attacks, one can hardly find any cars or buses on streets, except
for sporadic motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Lack of transport has led to the closing of offices, schools,
shops and public services.
</P>
<P>
"As the hospital I am working for is far from my residence, I
will not take risks to go to work by motorcycle. Instead, I will
stay at home," said Suman Dongol, a doctor working in the
Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Secretariat decided to "unofficially" observe a day
of holiday. Several embassies are having difficulty to maintain
normal operations as their employees could not come to work.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic missions in Kathmandu have taken extra care to
ensure the security of their staff as well as visitors from their
countries. The U.S. Embassy issued an advisory telling its
nationals to stay indoors on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police have stepped up security measures and mobilized extra
personnel to patrol sensitive areas such as VIP residences and
government offices.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the threat of violence has not brought about any
danger to Kathmanduites' lives although it has caused
inconvenience to their daily life.
</P>
<P>
"The problem here is that the milk delivery van has not come
and my family has not been able to have our first cup of tea this
morning," said Man Bahadur Rai, a retired British Gurkha soldier
living in Kathmandu city.
</P>
<P>
But there are some reports of bus damage from outside
Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
A petrol bomb was hurled at a passenger bus near Butwal, some
200 kilometers southwest of Kathmandu, injuring the driver and the
conductor.
</P>
<P>
There are some other reports of bus damage from other parts of
the country and seven other people were reported injured.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Home Ministry said that altogether 78
persons were arrested all over the country Thursday in connection
with violence.
</P>
<P>
Since one of the key guerrilla members, Suresh Wagle, was
killed in an encounter with police on September 24, the guerrillas
have carried out a series of attacks and blasts in Nepal, killing
eight policemen and one local politician and injuring dozens of
other people.
</P>
<P>
Besides police posts and government buildings, factories,
passenger buses, VIP residences and bazaars are also targets of
blasts.
</P>
<P>
A total of 945 persons have been killed since the guerrillas
launched their People's War in 1996. Among them, 158 were
civilians, 81 policemen and 706 guerrilla members.

BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua)-- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met here today with a delegation from the
Communist Party of Russia (CPR), led by chairman of its central
committee Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Li, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC), extended a warm welcome to Zyuganov and his party.
He said China and Russia are friendly neighbors, and in recent
years, high-level contacts have been frequent, and cooperation in
various fields has been expanding.
</P>
<P>
This is in the best interests of both sides, and is beneficial
to the peace and development of the world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On relations between the two parties, Li said it is helpful for
the two parties to increase contact and exchange views on issues
of common concern. The CPC is willing to continue to deepen its
friendship with the CPR on the principles of independence,
complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference into each
other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov congratulated Li on the 50th anniversary of the PRC's
founding, saying the occasion is of great importance not only to
China but to the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that during the current visit he has found that China
has changed greatly, under the correct policy guidance of the CPC.
Deng Xiaoping Theory and the achievements during China's reform
and opening up have attracted attention in Russia, he noted,
stressing the CPR is willing to keep its friendly contact with the
CPC and further promote bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary on Leading Force in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China's official news agency
Xinhua released a commentary today spotlighting the core force
that leads the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people will never forget October 1, 1949, when Mao
Zedong, the late leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC),
proclaimed the founding the People's Republic of China, the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Before that, generations of th Chinese people with lofty ideals
had fought for the liberation of the Chinese nation. However, only
the CPC succeeded in bringing about a change for the better.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, the CPC led the nation in
ending the state of disunity of old China, enabling the people
live a peaceful and stable life and establishing a socialist
system in the country, it says.
</P>
<P>
Despite some setbacks in its exploration along the socialist
road, China has recorded tremendous achievements over the past
five decades, and laid a material, scientific and cultural basis
for the modernization of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, the achievements over the past decades
should be attributed to the unified efforts of the whole Chinese
nation and the correct leadership of the CPC, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The past fifty years have proved that without the CPC, there
would be no New China, and that only the CPC can lead the Chinese
people to perfect the socialist system, usher in a socialist road
with Chinese characteristics, and revitalize the nation.
</P>
<P>
The commentary stresses that the CPC has proved to be the
correct party, the mainstay of the Chinese nation, and the strong
leading core in China's socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary Jiang Zemin of the CPC Central Committee
mapped out at the 15th CPC Congress the country's blueprint for
the next 50 years, by then China will basically realize
modernization and become a prosperous, democratic and culturally-
advanced socialist country.
</P>
<P>
To turn the theory into reality, it is vital to stick to, unify
and improve the leadership of the Chinese Communist party, the
commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
The commentary expressed the firm belief that under the CPC
leadership, the Chinese nation will score a new and victorious
chapter in the next millennium.

expectations and the party has suffered reverse."

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Denies New Settlement Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel has not built any new
Jewish settlement in the West Bank territories since Prime
Minister Ehud Barak came to office in July, Israeli Foreign
Minister David levy said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine, Levy
told reporters that the accusations by the Palestinian side on
this issue are "unacceptable" because Israel has not added any new
settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Such accusations must be stopped, he said.
</P>
<P>
Levy was speaking in response to the criticism of the Israeli
government over the past few days by a number of Palestinian
officials, including Yasser Abed Rabbo, head of the Palestinian
final-status negotiation team, who accused Prime Minister Ehud
Barak of taking "crazy decisions" on settlement expansions.
</P>
<P>
Since the current Israeli government came to power in July, it
has reportedly approved tenders for building 3,000 new housing
units for various settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has also criticized the
Israeli government's decision in this regard as aimed at
destroying the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak Wednesday urged the Palestinians to lower their tone in
regard to settlement construction, saying for the first time that
he will review all the illegal building activity in settlements.
</P>
<P>
He said he does not believe the criticism will do anything to
help the situation, urging the Palestinians to put forth their
grievances, on whatever matter, on the negotiating table and not
in media.
</P>
<P>
He said the tenders granted by the Housing Ministry since July
were approved long before he took office and most of them were
around Jerusalem in large settlement blocs.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Vedrine, Levy said they discussed the
issues concerning the peace process. Vedrine said his government ,
if asked for, is ready to provide any assistance to move the
process forward.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine arrived here Wednesday evening for a three-day visit.
He is also scheduled to meet with President Ezer Weizman and
Barak, besides visiting the Palestinian territories and holding
talks with Arafat.

<HEADLINE> MAS Announces New Exemption to Boost Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) Thursday announced new measures to boost the
country's capital market.
</P>
<P>
Under the measures, MAS would exempt banks from the minimum
cash balance (MCB) and minimum liquid assets (MLA) requirements on
funds in Singapore dollars received from non-bank customers via
foreign currency swaps which have original maturities of one year
or more.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was in response to recommendations made by the
Debt Capital Market Working Group in June this year to further
develop Singapore's debt market.
</P>
<P>
MAS said in a press release that the new exemption aims to
promote more competitive pricing and boost liquidity in the
long-term swap market.
</P>
<P>
Under previous regulations, funds in the Singapore dollar
received by banks from non-bank customers via foreign currency
swaps had to be included in the liability base for the maintenance
of MCB and MLA.
</P>
<P>
However, MAS rejected a recommendation for reactivating the
system of registered dealers for the Singapore Government Security
market.
</P>
<P>
The government also turned down a recommendation to extend
concessionary tax rate on interest income earned from holding
qualifying securities to individuals and another recommendation to
grant tax concessions on interest income earned from investing in
bond funds.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Doctors Claim Bypass Surgery Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A group of Canadian doctors have
claimed success of their first bypass heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper of Canada said Thursday that
surgeons at London Health Sciences Center in Ontario, Canada's
largest province, announced the breakthrough "closed-chest, robot-
assisted, beating-heart bypass" Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Not only is this much less pain and trauma for the patient,
but it's much better value for health dollars," hospital head Tony
Dagnone was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
During a six-hour operation on a 60-year-old dairy farmer on
September 24, Canadian doctors performed the entire procedure on a
beating heart through tiny incisions, without cracking open the
chest.
</P>
<P>
The success could revolutionize surgery by transforming complex
operations into outpatient procedures or one-day admissions, the
newspaper said.

BRUSSELS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Confidence in the industrial
sector rose in September in both the euro zone and the European
Union (EU) as a whole, a survey published Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
The business and consumer survey conducted by the European
Commission, the EU's executive arm, said France and Britain
contributed to this situation in particular with important
improvement in production expectations in France, while order
books and exports are the main contributions in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Spain contributed to a lesser extent, and Germany has seen a
promising rebound, the survey said. The construction confidence
indicator rose slightly in the euro zone while remaining constant
in the whole EU region, it added.
</P>
<P>
Italy shows the most significant increase while Germany
confirms its positive trend. Consumer confidence rose by one
percentage point in the EU while it remained stable in the euro
zone, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, the economic sentiment indicator for September
shows an improvement in the euro zone and a more significant rise
in the EU as a whole compared to August," the European Commission
said.

<HEADLINE> Europeans See General Deterioration of Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BRUSSELS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday that a forest health survey showed a general
deterioration of the crown condition of the main tree species in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive said the trend of the
forest condition is comparable with that of the past years. "The
long-term development must be seen differently for each species of
tree and for each individual region," it said.
</P>
<P>
While the vitality of the Pine in parts of Eastern Europe has
been recovering the condition of common, sessile Oak in Western
Europe has clearly been deteriorating," the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
"It gets more and more apparent that photooxidants, with ozone
as the main substance, can lead to visible damage in forests. This
is particularly true for the Mediterranean. Ozone damage is to be
suspected in other regions as well," the EU commission said.
</P>
<P>
On the average, the crown condition (defoliation) in Europe
between 1992 and 1998 worsened on approximately 31 percent of the
observation plots and improved on only 15 percent of the plots.
</P>
<P>
The main causes of the vitality losses and damages are direct
and indirect air pollution and extreme droughts, the survey
pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Native leaders from 35 bands in
Atlantic Canada have agreed to a 30-day lobster fishing moratorium
in a bid to end tensions with non-native fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Native leaders announced the decision after a day of meeting
Wednesday with federal Fisheries Minister Herb Dhaliwal in Halifax,
Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
Violence has been reported between natives and non-natives
since hundreds of native fishermen in Prince Edward Island, Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick were allowed to fish Atlantic lobsters
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in September that natives
have rights to fish out of season and without a license to make a
moderate living.
</P>
<P>
But non-natives feared the lobster resource would be depleted
by the time their own fishery could open next spring.

<P>
JOHANNESBURGE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- An ancient skeleton,
thought to be between 500 and 1000 years old, was unearthed at
Melkbosstrand on the west coast of the Cape, the Cape Times
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The skeleton was found in an old sand dune due to be flattened
for the development of a new central business district.
</P>
<P>
Tiny beads, a stone tool and a stone pendant were discovered
with the remains.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologist Jonathan Kaplan of the Agency for Cultural
Resource Management was commissioned by the developers to survey
the area for archaeological remains as part of an environmental
impact assessment.
</P>
<P>
"I recommended this midden should be excavated. I wasn't
expecting to find a burial, and then on Wednesday we dug the toes
out," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The flexed position of the skeleton, the stone tools and beads
all point to an intentional burial," Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
The bones of the skeleton will be chemically analysed, which
could give archaeologists an idea of whether the prehistoric
people's diet consisted mainly of seafood or land animals.
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said that two weeks ago, four other prehistoric
skeletons had been unearthed by bulldozers excavating the post
office site for Melkbosstrand.
</P>
<P>
However, the context of their burial was destroyed and
archaeologically valuable information was lost.

show on Wednesday at the Palace of Congress in Paris, the
rightwing politicians, including President Jacques Chirac, rushed
to the show in a nostalgia for the past of gaullism, which is no
more today.
</P>
<P>
-- In a commentary contributed to Liberation, Francois Gere,
the director of Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, said
that the world is beginning to experience a new schism, which is
developing on the basis of a growing difference over the
fundamental principles of international politics due to a dispute
between the American model and those who oppose it. Facing this,
he said, Europe should affirm its political personality.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac criticized on Wednesday the
plan of the leftwing government to deduce money from income of
social security taxes to pay for its 35-hour work week plan in
2000. Meanwhile, some socialist deputies and communists are
opposing a plan by the Ministry of Finance to lower tax charges on
stock holdings, or stock options, and calling for a heavier tax
following the obtaining of 300 million francs of stocks by Elf
president Philippe Jaffre, paid by his company for his retirement.
</P>
<P>
-- The European Commission will not approve a merger between
the French oil groups Total-Fina and Elf Aquitaine, unless they
make concrete measures to liberalize the French market of oil
distribution. Experts in Brussels have expressed doubt over the
compatibility between such a merger and the rules of the European
Union, as it poses problems to competition, especially on
expressways in France.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Export to Kenya up Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's export to Kenya
 increased dramatically from 7.8 billion shillings (10 million
U.S. dollars) to 21.6 billion shillings between 1997 and 1998,
while Kenya's export to Tanzania dropped from 94.8 billion
shillings to 69.9 billion shillings.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released Wednesday by Kenyan High Commissioner
to Tanzania Njuguma Ngunjiri who was encouraged by the positive
trend of the trade between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Ngunjiri said the increase in Tanzania's export to Kenya was
healthy and that with sustained efforts, more Tanzanian goods
could be sold in Kenya, newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Currently Kenya stands as the biggest market for Tanzanian
products in Africa and the sixth in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, however, expressed concern over the informal and
unrecorded trade that goes on between the two countries and a lot
of goods, such as maize, rice, cotton and hides, found their way
from Tanzania to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Ngunjiri said Kenya is the second biggest investor in Tanzania
with 48 companies having registered with the Tanzania Investment
Center.
</P>
<P>
Kenya plans to hold a trade exhibition and an investment forum
in Tanzania's Mwanza Region on the southern shore of Lake Victoria
from December 9 to 12. Forty Kenyan companies will be represented
at the exhibition, he said.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Judge: Chinese Gymnast Needs to Handle Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Could Chinese men's gymnasts won
their fourth team title at the coming world artistic gymnastics
championships?
</P>
<P>
The answer given by the Swedish judge is that the Chinese
gymnasts need to well handle their mental pressure in the
tournament, which made its debut in China.
</P>
<P>
Anders Hallquist, member of the men's technical committee of
Swedish Gymnastics Federation, said Thursday that the Chinese side
needs to be "strong in their heads" so that they can display
performances truely to their level.
</P>
<P>
"You have good technic, your routine are clean and elegant, but
you need to deal with the pressure in the heads." said Anders who
will officiate the men's competition at the championships
beginning on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Anders, who has judged four world championships and five
European championships, said that some "silly mistakes" costed
dearly China's winning chances at major world competitions.
</P>
<P>
"Their pressure has made them susceptible to silly mistakes in
landing, although they have wonderful routines," said Anders.
</P>
<P>
However he held Chinese men gymnasts as the most heavily
favored for the team title which also is coveted by China's arch-
rival Russia and traditional powerhouses like Belarus and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese men's side has the best chance, but if they fail
to do a good job in coping with the pressure, Russia will unseat
them. "
</P>
<P>
History has been on the side of China who has three team titles
to its credit with one slipping to Russia since the disintegration
of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Cushioned by the home-court advantage, China has set its eyes
on a third world championships title since they were crowned in
the past two versions.
</P>
<P>
"The team is the best ever," said Huang Yubin, head coach of
the Chinese Gymnastics national squad, at a news conference on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The hosts will be anchored by Li Xiaopeng, who won the floor
exercises and parallel bars at the World Cup Grand Finals in Japan
last year. Lu Yufu and Huang Xu, both members of the 33rd world
championships winning team, will help China shore up for the
championships bid.
</P>
<P>
The other three boys of Xing Aowei, Dong zhen and Yang wei, who
all emerged from the Bangkok Asian Games last year, will be the
cards in the sleeves of China, who has benefited from a great
depth of gymnastics talents.
</P>
<P>
"Their average age is less than 20, and they are very pushy.
All the six of them are free from injury and complete in their
technics." said Qian Kui, team leader of the national team.
</P>
<P>
"If they have no big faults, they will take at least two golds
in the team and individual events," Qian added.

<HEADLINE> China Eyes Two Gold Medals at Gymnastics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China cautiously set a target of
winning two gold medals at the 1999 Artistic Gymnastics World
Championships, according to the Chinese team officials at a press
conference here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Our gymnasts are in good form and if we perform our best we
can claim victory in the men's team competition," the team leader
Qian Kui said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a well-balanced and best ever men's team, which
hopefully can retain the team title for the fourth consecutive
time," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
China regards Russia as its arch-rival for the men's team
contest. "The Russian team has some big names like Alexei
Bondarenko and Alexei Nemov who are also hot contenders in the
individual events," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of injured world champions Zhang Jinjing and
Kui Yuanyuan, the Chinese team is mostly composed of inexperienced
young athletes, averaging 20-year-old for the men and 16 for the
women.
</P>
<P>
Besides the men's team title, China also has strength to claim
the victory in the pommel horse, floor exercise, vault and bars.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is difficult for us to win more than one
individual gold medals," team head coach Huang Yubin admitted. "
There are many hot contenders also from Belarus, France, Japan,
and Spain."
</P>
<P>
Comparing with their men's counterparts, Chinese women's team
face a tougher prospect of making a breakthrough to win the team
title. They took the silver medal in 1995 and bronze in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As the only girl who had competed in the world championships,
Liu Xuan, a beam and uneven bars specialist, will be the Chinese
women's backbone and leads six debutants for the meet.
</P>
<P>
"It seems like an elder sister spearheads six little sisters,"
Qian joked. "However, they are competitive in the traditional
strong points of the beam and uneven bars events."
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Ling Jie had dethroned Russian Olympic champion
Svetlana Khorkina in the uneven bars in their recent three
encounters.
</P>
<P>
"Ling Jie and Liu Xuan are our best shots at the coming
tournament," their coach Liu Guicheng said.

<P>
LAGOS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- About 14 people got killed in a
stampede during a religious ceremony in Nigeria's southern Benin
city Wednesday, the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper,
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy took place in the "Great Gospel Campaign" organized
by renowned German Evangelist Rev. Reinhard Bonnke, which was
kicked off on Tuesday night in the old capital of Benin Empire
with over half a million people in attendance.
</P>
<P>
But a stampede broke out Wednesday morning when the mammoth
crowd moved forward to listen to Bonnke's speech and some people
were trampled to death, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
A doctor at a local hospital said that 11 of those brought in
were women, including a girl at the age of 14.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, october 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philatelic Service of
Israel has decided to issue a postage stamp memorizing Hussein ibn
Talal, the late King of Jordan, sometime next February, the first
anniversary of his death.
</P>
<P>
The stamp design, created by Daniel Goldberg, shows a 5.50
Shekels (1.375 U.S. dollars) denomination, but the face value
of the stamp has not yet been decided.
</P>
<P>
The design was published in the latest issue of Shovel, the
magazine of the Israel Philatelic Federation.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first Israeli stamp to bear the visage
of the leader of an Arab country and a former arch foe.
</P>
<P>
Philatelic Service Director Yinon Beilin said it is up to the
government to decide whether to have an international ceremony to
which prominent Joranians, or even members of the royal family,
can be invited to attend.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said Israel never produced a stamp with the visage
of Egypt's late president Anwar Sadat, but a stamp was issued
to mark the peace agreement with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Proposals to issue separate stamps in memory of Sadat and
Morocco's recently deceased King Hassan II have also been put
before the government, which is due to decide on them soon, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Rising Fatality in Construction Industry Concerns Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore official
Thursday voiced his deep concern about the rising fatality number
in his country's construction industry and affirmed that the
Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has decided to press for severe
penalties against unsafe acts in an effort to reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 16th annual construction
safety campaign, Minister of State for Manpower Othman Haron
Eusofe said, "We are deeply concerned that safety performance in
the construction industry has deteriorated since 1994."
</P>
<P>
"The number of accidents increased alarmingly from 1994 to
1998, and especially the rising number of fatalities recorded in
the industry," he added.
</P>
<P>
Eusofe revealed that the number of fatalities rose from 32 in
1994 to more than double at 73 cases in 1998 and for the first
nine months of this year there were 36 accidents resulting in 39
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Over this period, a total of 316 workers died in 301 accidents,
he summed up.
</P>
<P>
Citing other data to support his view, Eusofe said the
accident frequency rate, which measures the number of accident per
million man-hours worked, increased from 2.5 in 1994 to a peak of
3.0 in 1997 before declining to 2.7 last year, and the severity
rate, which measures the number of man-days lost per million
man-hours worked, rose from 664 in 1994 to a peak at 968 in 1997
before falling to 846 last year.
</P>
<P>
Eusofe said his ministry has decided to press for deterrent
sentences, including jail sentences to anyone that commits unsafe
acts, or fails to take precautionary measures to prevent
accidents.
</P>
<P>
More severe penalties are needed if the industry does not show
appreciable signs of improvement, he added.
</P>
<P>
Eusofe also said his ministry will continue current compulsory
training for all levels of manpower in the construction site from
workers to supervisors and project managers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the Construction 21 (or C21) Study
initiated by MOM and the Ministry of National Development in May
1998 to address the problems faced by the construction industry
had looked at putting in place the Construction (Design and
Management) Regulations (CDM) with an aim to improve the overall
management and coordination of safety, health and welfare issues
of construction workers throughout all stages of a project.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's construction industry contributed an average of 8.2
percent of the national Gross Domestic Product over the last five
years.

<HEADLINE> Certain Fruits, Vegetables May Reduce Stroke Risk: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Harvard School of
Public Health has found that a higher consumption of fruits and
vegetables, particularly citrus fruits and juice and cruciferous
vegetables, may reduce the risk of ischemic stroke by up to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 men and women participated in the study and
their fruit and vegetable intake was analyzed, according to the
October 6 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found drinking a glass of orange juice every
day may lower the risk of stroke by 25 percent, compared to 11
percent with other fruits. These positive effects were achieved
with only a single serving of orange juice daily.
</P>
<P>
While the study supports the recommendation of five servings of
fruit and vegetable per day, the researchers found no significant
additional benefit among participants who consume six or more
servings daily.
</P>
<P>
Speculating that the constituents of fruits and vegetables
responsible for the beneficial effects include potassium, folate
and fiber, the researchers recommend a glass of orange juice in
the morning, an apple in the afternoon and a vegetable at dinner.
</P>
<P>
The school noted that numerous and ongoing studies have also
linked constituents found in orange juice to reduced risk of
cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and birth defects.

<HEADLINE> Spokeswoman Refutes U.S. Charges Against China's Religious Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and
people are highly indignant over and firmly opposed to the U.S.
State Department's unwarranted charges against China's religious
affairs, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department recently criticized China's religion
affairs on the basis of the Religious Freedom Act of the United
States, and threatened to impose sanctions against China, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government adopts the policy of religious freedom,
which has been guaranteed by law, Zhang said, adding that article
36 of China's Constitution stipulates that the citizens of the
People's Republic of China enjoy religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that instead of being concerned about its many
domestic issues, including religion, the U.S. government is keen
on making slanderous accusations against China's religious affairs
and even threatens to impose the so-call sanctions.
</P>
<P>
This is in essence a wanton interference in China's internal
affairs under the pretext of religious freedom, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people will never accept this, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that recently the United States has repeatedly
expressed its desire to restore and improve Sino-U.S. relations,
and that the relationship has reached a crucial point.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are demanding that the United States discontinue
using the so-called religious issue to interfere in China's
internal affairs, and promote the improvement of Sino-U.S.
relations with action, instead of doing anything detrimental to
the bilateral relations, she said.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Muses on Six-Nation Security Meeting </HEADLINE>

<P>
SEOUL, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Foreign Minister
Hong Soon-young said on Thursday that Seoul is planning a proposal
for a meeting of foreign ministers from South Korea, the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, Japan, United States
and Russia on regional security issues.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the stage of creating the concept of such a meeting
and we can communicate on the issue," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Seoul is reportedly considering making the proposal at an
annual meeting of cabinet ministers of South Korea and Japan
slated to open on South Korea's Cheju Island on October 23-24 this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the South Korean minister added that Seoul has yet to
discuss the issue with other five nations.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said Seoul and Tokyo are expected to
jointly propose the six foreign ministers' meeting early next year
to discuss peace and security in Northeast Asia, particularly on
the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Seoul believes there is the possibility that Pyongyang will
join the meeting because the general atmosphere in Northeast Asia
is turning favorable for such a conference, said a South Korean
official.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Seoul, Pyongyang, Washington and Beijing are engaged
in quadripartite talks designed to replace the Korean Armistice
Agreement with a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The six-party meeting, if realized, will also meet the desire
of Japan and Russia to join security talks on Northeast Asia, said
the official.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's New Cabinet Emerging: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister-designate
Atef Ebeid is expected to come up with a list of cabinet ministers
early next week, the influential national daily Al Gomhuria
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government paper, which usually mirrors the thinking of
the leadership, carried a full list of what it termed as the final
line-up of the new cabinet, which includes 13 new faces.
</P>
<P>
After he was sworn in on Tuesday for a fourth consecutive
six-year term, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak chose Ebeid to
form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Among the newcomers, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority Ahmed
Fadel, Sharkia Governor Hussein Kazem, Dean of Cairo University's
Economics Faculty Ali Eddin Helal, chief of the Administrative
Monitoring Agency Hitler Tantawi will respectively lead the
ministries of transport and telecommunications, manpower and
administrative development, education, and cabinet affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the Arabic-language paper, other ministries whose
heads will be replaced are those of insurance and social affairs,
electricity and energy, tourism, finance, industry, local
administration.
</P>
<P>
Local reports cited many causes for the replacement of the
former ministers, including their lack of achievements, inability
to control the situation in their particular fields of duty, old
age and bad health conditions.
</P>
<P>
The emerging cabinet will have three new ministerial posts,
namely the ministries of scientific research and technology, land
reclamation and national projects, and youth and small-scale
projects, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The expected appearance of new faces in the cabinet is in line
with Mubarak's thinking that "new blood should be injected into"
the national action team. And the creation of the three ministries
are aimed at helping fulfill Mubarak's dreams in the three
particular areas.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has attached great importance to the development of
science and technology in a bid to sustain a forceful economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The country is currently carrying out large-scale irrigation
schemes to reclaim land from desert in the south and Sinai to lure
people to leave the over-crowded Nile valley.
</P>
<P>
In the coming 10-15 years, an estimated 500,000 young people
will enter the labor market each year, Egypt is striving to set up
more small- and medium-sized enterprises to attract young laborers.
</P>
<P>
In the new cabinet, Ebeid will take the post of public business
sector minister himself to continue supervising the privatization
program that began in 1995, Al Gomhuria said.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen ministers of the former cabinet headed by Kamal
El-Ganzouri, who resigned after Mubarak's swearing-in to pave the
way for the formation of the new cabinet, will retain their
posts. They include the leading posts of deputy prime minister,
ministers of defense, information, foreign affairs, economy and
oil.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police have smashed a
highly organized syndicate allegedly behind the attempt to launder
200,000 U.S. dollars in forged notes.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka police chief Bernard Mayonda confirmed the arrest of a
retired defense force officer and three other men including a
foreigner linked to the crime ring, Times of Zambia newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The four men have since been charged with possession of fake
currency.
</P>
<P>
Mayonda said 120,000 of the counterfeit currency in 100 dollar
bills was found on the suspects following a special operation
mounted by the police in conjunction with the Bank of Zambia
(BOZ).
</P>
<P>
Police suspected 80,000 dollars fake notes had already been
off-loaded onto the market.
</P>
<P>
The special task force was still probing the sources of the
forged currency.
</P>
<P>
A BOZ spokesman said a preliminary examination of the
counterfeit notes revealed that the main difference from the
genuine dollars was the poor paper quality.
</P>
<P>
The business community and the public were advised to use
institutions licensed to deal in foreign currency to avoid being
swindled.

<HEADLINE> Northern Passage Talks Resume Between Israel, PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) are to resume Thursday
on the opening of the northern safe passage linking Gaza Strip and
the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
According the Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum signed by PNA
Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
early September, the northern safe passage should have been agreed
upon by October 5, thus allowing four months to set up temporary
terminals.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are still at odds over the location of the
northern terminal of the northern passage, according PNA chief
negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants the northern terminal near Ramallah, while the
PNA insists that it be near Latrun, an Israeli town near the
highway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The problem has held up an agreement for two years as both
sides fear that the location of the terminal will determine the
borders in the final settlement, Saeb Erekat added.
</P>
<P>
To help break the deadlock, the two sides agreed to mention in
the Sharm El Sheikh deal that the location of the northern terminal
will have no bearing on the final borders.
</P>
<P>
To the Palestinians, the northern passage is more important,
since Ramallah is the Palestinian social and commercial center in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the two sides signed the agreement on the opening
of the southern passage after intensified negotiations. Final
preparations for its opening are under way.

illegal building activity that has been going on since 10 months
ago.

</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>

Israel will "reassess" its relations with Austria and may even

elections, occupying a critical place for the shape of the next
government.
</P>
<P>

to be released Friday.

<P>
-- Iran is transporting a large amount of weapons to Hezbollah

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian-Thai border
demarcation project along Sungai Golok, a border river, will start
next week, Land and Cooperative Development Minister Kasitah
Gaddam said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project is vital following some problems between the two

"With the completion of the border demarcation project, we will
have a permanent border and this will enable us to enforce all the
laws of the country," he was quoted as saying after observing
preparations for the implementation of the project.

<P>
The concept of a permanent border along Sungai Golok was agreed
to by the governments of Malaysia and Thailand in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that both countries agreed that the border
demarcation project along Sungai Golok be expedited in discussions
on May 18 and 19 this year.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Highlight Tung's Policy Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- All the major Hong Kong
newspapers Thursday ran a wide range of stories on the Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa's annual policy address.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po said in an editorial entitled "The Cross-Century
Policy Address" that Tung's address took a broad and long view of
how Hong Kong would welcome the coming of the new millennium, and
laid out the plans for the future development of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Also in an editorial, Hong Kong Commercial Daily said that Tung
's policy address of 1999 presented a clear-cut orientation for
Hong Kong's future sustained development. The policy address this
year is quite different from the previous ones in many aspects,
reflecting that Tung has turned to be more active in carrying out
the policy concept, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Po devoted much of the pages to commenting on Tung's
policy address, saying that it is a cross-century policy address
drawing up a plan for Hong Kong's future. The newspaper said that
Tung's address is objective, pragmatic and pertinent.
</P>
<P>
It is generally acknowledged that Tung's address is "positive"
and it is "a good address", the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In an article entitled "Tung's world-class vision" on its front
page, Hong Kong Standard, one of the only two English newspapers
in Hong Kong, said that a better living environment and a higher
quality workforce could help Hong Kong 6.8 million people develop
their home into a world-class city in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also carried an analysis saying Tung chose to
focus on education and environment because he believes that they
are important in preparing the Special Administrative Region for
the stride into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The other English newspaper South China Morning Post also ran a
front-page story highlighting Tung's policy address. It said that
Tung Chee Hwa outlined strategies to clean up the environment and
cultivate talent in an effort to make Hong Kong a world-class city.
The newspaper devoted eight inside pages of news and analysis
covering almost all the areas mentioned in Tung's address.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Various business sectors in
Hong Kong have expressed their support to the blueprint for Hong
Kong's future development made by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa,
following the publication of his third policy address.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Tourism Association (HKTA) Chairman Lo Yuk Sui said
that the address clearly demonstrated the government's support and
recognition of the importance of the tourism industry and its
commitment to improving the environment.
</P>
<P>
"It was most encouraging to hear Mr. Tung mention many areas
that are pertinent to the current initiatives of the (HKTA) and
the tourist industry, in particular the endeavors of the heritage
tourism task force," said Lo.
</P>
<P>
He warmly welcomed Tung's commitments regarding Hong Kong's
long-term development into a world-class city.
</P>
<P>
"The chief executive aptly described why Hong Kong is so unique
and is unparalleled by any other city in the region in terms of
cultural diversity and appeal," he said. "We are delighted that
the policy address mentioned how essential it was to raise
awareness of heritage development and 'green' tourism, and also
the issues of pollution and environmental protection."
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's leading air carrier, also welcomed
the importance the government places in promoting tourism to Hong
Kong and on further strengthening Hong Kong's aviation
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The airline remains firmly committed to the future of Hong Kong
and to increasing the contribution of aviation and tourism to the
local economy.
</P>
<P>
Victor Fung Kwok-king, chairman of the Airport Authority,
expressed his satisfaction about the liberal policy for air cargo
services in the chief executive's policy address.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Authority believes that this initiative set a
direction which would further increase the competitive edge of
Hong Kong International Airport as a leading air cargo hub, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The pledge to maintain and enhance Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center is well responded by the Securities
and Futures Commission (SFC).
</P>
<P>
Andrew Sheng, chairman of the SFC, said that maintaining an
open, fair and efficient market is vital to strengthening the
confidence of local and international investors in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The SFC will work closely with the merged exchange, the
administration and the financial community, to implement the
various measures proposed in the policy address, he said.

percent over the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown is mainly attributed to dilapidated
infrastructure, inadequate provision of public services and
reduced donor support, the Central Bank said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, the mainstay of the country's economy, grew by 1.4
percent, down from 1.5 percent in 1998, the bank said, adding that
but it was better than 1.0 percent posted in the same period of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that manufacturing was almost stagnant at last
year's level of 1.2 percent, due to poor infrastructure, saying
it expects that increased trade with Tanzania and Uganda will
stimulate exports from the sector.
</P>
<P>
However, the review points out that the recovery of the sector
will depend on reduced operational costs and the costs of doing
business in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Other crucial sectors such construction and services posted
substantial declines as the construction sector dropped to 1.3
percent in the year to July 1998 from 1.8 percent in the same
period of 1997, the review adds.

<HEADLINE> Landslides Kill 5 in Northern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Landslides triggered by typhoon
"Pepang" Wednesday killed five persons and injured 14 others in
Benguet province in the northern Philippines, the Benguet Disaster
Coordinating Council said Thursday in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report said three of the victims were inside their houses
near a mountainside when landslides occurred, while the other two
were walking along a road when they were swept by another
landslide.
</P>
<P>
The injured are now confined at the Baguio General Hospital,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Pepang," while dumping torrential rains in the province, also
lashed it with gusty winds blowing at more than 50 kilometers per
hour.
</P>
<P>
The report said rescuers had difficulty reaching the landslide
sites due to partial closure of the Baguio-Itogon Road, adding
that the death toll is expected to rise as the rescue operations
continue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture is still assessing the
crop damages in the province, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical
Services Administration (Pagasa) said Thursday that "Pepang" has
changed its course to the north-northeast in the direction of
southeastern coast of China.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pagasa said "Pepang" will continue to cause rains
and gusty winds over the northern Philippines till Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Nations Urged to Take Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Delegates stressed the need to
match rhetoric with action at the third Southern Africa
International Dialogue (SAID) in Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls, the
daily Herald said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conference which ended on Wednesday agreed to create more
jobs and fight the AIDS epidemic as well as encourage viable joint
venture projects in the region.
</P>
<P>
Francis Antonio, secretary-general of the Malawi Congress of
Trade Unions, Wednesday told the Herald, "We are really good at
talking but there is nothing happening on the ground. There should
be political will to move forward."
</P>
<P>
He said a number of protocols had been signed by Southern
African Development Community members but were not being put into
force.
</P>
<P>
Antonio, who attended the SAID conference, said there was
danger that summits were now being regarded as "more or less going
on a vacation if we continue to talk, talk and talk without
action".
</P>
<P>
Phil Molife, editor-in-chief of South African Broadcasting
Corporation, said dialogue was necessary but must at the same
time be "matched with action".
</P>
<P>
Other commentators said the conference was a step in the right
direction and expressed hope that there would be real action.
</P>
<P>
Drawing their inspiration from South African President Thabo
Mbeki's speech, they said the leaders appeared geared to do
things.
</P>
<P>
"It is amazing to hear a president speak like that," said
Harare-based business executive Elias Ngugama, in reference to
Mbeki's appeal to his counterparts to take the resolutions
seriously.
</P>
<P>
Host President Robert Mugabe said the delegates had made an
undertaking to get down to business and implement ideas raised at
the SAID conference.

<HEADLINE> 73 Bangladeshis Killed by Indian BSF in 4 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 73 Bangladeshi people,
including six members of the country's border forces, the
Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), were killed and 84 others were injured in
firing of India's Border Security Force (BSF) in the border areas
over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
Records of the Home Ministry and the BDR showed that the BSF
had been involved in 260 incidents of shooting in the 4,095
kilometer-long Bangladesh-India frontier during the period, The
Daily Star newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Besides the recorded list of firing and deaths, the BSF is
alleged to have kidnapped people from the bordering areas of
Bangladesh and is accused of taking away harvested paddy and
livestock of Bangladeshis living along the border.
</P>
<P>
The number of Bangladeshi citizens that had died of BSF firing
during the last ten months surpasses records of previous three
years, officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 people, including three BDR personnel, were
killed and 36 were injured from January to October 4 this year,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The highest number of 130 firing incidents took place in 1996,
leaving 13 people including a BDR member dead and 18 others
injured.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 11 persons were killed and 11 others injured in 39
firing incidents, and in the 56 BSF firing incidents in 1998, 23
people including a BDR man were killed and 19 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BSF and the BDR had a skirmish on Wednesday on
Kurigram border, northwest Bangladesh, over the abduction of a
Bangladeshi citizen by the BSF and the arrest of an Indian by the
BDR in Bangladeshi territory, The Independent daily newspaper
reported.

<HEADLINE> High Court Orders Restraint on Comment on Anwar's Sodomy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The High Court here
Thursday ordered those in power to restrain themselves from
commenting on the alleged sodomy by former deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim because that is an issue to be determined by the
court.
</P>
<P>
Judge Arifin Jaka ruled "Comments made should avoid as far as
possible on issues that are being tried in the present
proceeding," hoping those in power ... the less said the better.
</P>
<P>
He said the question of sodomy alleged to have been committed
by Anwar should not be referred as this very issue was to be
determined by the court.
</P>
<P>
The judge made the ruling Thursday after defense counsel Karpal
Singh had applied to the court for the appearance of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik,
Education Minister Najib Tun Razak and Rural Development Minister
Annuar Musa for their statements regarding the court case,
according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
The judge was quoted as saying "I want to stress that if the
comments made are contemptuous, those responsible should face the
consequences in the event that action is taken against them."
</P>
<P>
"Restraint is best to avoid unnecessary aspersions on the issue
and to avoid misconception that the court licenses anybody to
comment on the proceeding," he added.
</P>
<P>
Karpal, in his application, said the prime minister had made
certain allegations against him which he heard over TV3 and RTM
(radio and television Malaysia) with his son Gobind Singh Deo who
is representing another accused person Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat
Madja in the sodomy case.
</P>
<P>
Karpal considered what the prime minister was saying that he
was taking legal action against him (Karpal) as a threat.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said at a press conference on his return from overseas
Wednesday that the government would look into the libelous
statements of lawyer Karpal Singh who alleged in court that the
government had poisoned Anwar.
</P>
<P>
Karpal said: "Any threat by anyone, however high, to counsel in
relations to what he said in court amounted to a serious contempt
of court. That seriousness is further compounded by the fact that
it comes from the prime minister himself."
</P>
<P>
Karpal said the prime minister had repeated the allegation that
Anwar is a homosexual who pretended to be a religious person.
"This also amounted to contempt of court," Karpal said.
</P>
<P>
However the judge asked Karpal to take separate proceeding
against them, saying that "this court is not the proper forum to
hear the matter".

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Present Annual Budget in Mid-April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Ministry is
planning to move the annual budget presentation in mid-April, the
Kathmandu Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To justify the need to change the budget session, Finance
Minister Mahesh Acharya said in a interaction program by
ministers, MPs and experts Wednesday that the change is to make
the budget implementation process more effective.
</P>
<P>
"If we are able to present the budget by mid-April, we can
expect to release the resources on time and the concerned projects
can make necessary tender calls by mid-July," said Acharya, adding
that this will address the present delay in tender calls and
project implementation.
</P>
<P>
Member of the National Planning commission Dr. Shankar Sharma
also emphasized the need to change the budget session.
</P>
<P>
"The change in the budgetary session will provide the lawmakers
with plenty of time for discussion and it will also help to
correct a number of prevalent malpractice," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the idea encountered opposition from some MPs.
</P>
<P>
Former speaker Ramchandra Poudyal said there was no need to
reschedule the budget session. "If we could correct present
mistakes in the budget implementation process, it would
automatically address the problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, speaker Taranath Ranabhat said there is no legal
hurdle to reschedule the budget session.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Planters Urged to Jointly Market their Tea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Tea plantation companies should
join hands to effectively market Sri Lankan tea as a branded
product in a bid to increase earnings, industry officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Planters' Association Mahendra Amarasuriya told
Xinhua he would consult tea planters on the concept of joint
marketing in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
With the cost of labor at 50 to 60 percent of the total cost of
production, tea producers now get only a small fraction of the
price paid by the ultimate consumer for the Sri Lankan tea.
</P>
<P>
However, most profits go to tea exporters who only blend and
repack tea and have had no affiliation or obligation to the
producers although plantation companies have been trying to break
this process and get closer to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
Amarasuriya said there was a need for plantation firms to
invest in a large marketing operation providing consumers with a
variety of teas from various agro-climatic locations.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the New Zealand Dairy Board to get all
producers together and export New Zealand dairy products under
their own brand name has been quoted as a good example of
producers joining hands to successfully market a very special
branded product," he said.
</P>
<P>
Amarasuriya said some companies have limited success in
establishing their brand in the Commonwealth of Independent States
and some European countries.
</P>
<P>
With concerted efforts, Sri Lankan plantation companies will
have more chances of success in marketing its tea in the world tea
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been the largest exporter of tea in the world and
the main tea producer second only to India and China.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Industrial Production increases in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Industrial
Production Index (IPI) for August 1999 increased by 12.9 percent
over that for the same month of 1998, according to the Statistics
Department.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly induced by the growth in the indices of
the manufacturing and electricity sectors by 17.4 percent and 6.4
percent respectively, the department said in a statement released
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IPI for the month under review however dropped marginally
by 0.4 percent in comparison with the IPI in July, it said, adding
the drop was attributed to the decline in the indices of the
manufacturing and electricity sectors by 2.7 percent and 3.3
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
For the first eight months of 1999, the IPI expanded by 4.3
percent over the same period of 1998, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of the overall index was mainly attributed to
the growth in the indices of the manufacturing and electricity
sectors by 6.4 percent and 3.4 percent respectively while the
index of the mining sector contracted by 3.5 percent, it said.

DHAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin
Ahmed will pay a state visit to Turkey in November this year, and
that will be his first visit to a foreign country since he was
elected as the head of state three years ago, The Daily Star
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president will be going for a five-day visit to Turkey
between November 1 and November 5 at the invitation of his Turkish
counterpart, Suleyman Demeril.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed has been invited by the Turkish president four times, by
former South African president Nelson Mandela twice and by Iranian
president Mohammad Khatami once.
</P>
<P>
Demeril first invited Ahmed when he visited Bangladesh along
with Mandela and Yasser Arafat in March 1997 to attend the Silver
Jubilee celebration of the country's independence.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president renewed the invitation when he was here
to attend the Developing-Eight Conference in March this year, and
later sent a fresh invitation to Ahmed to visit Turkey and attend
the celebrations marking the 75th founding anniversary of the
Turkey Republic in October this year.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo's Profits Surge in July-September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Internet media giant Yahoo
Inc. reported a third-quarter profit Wednesday that easily beat
Wall Street estimates. Traffic running through its network of web
sites increased 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the three months ending September 30, the California-based
Santa Clara reported an operating income of 40.41 million dollars,
compared to 6.92 million dollars for the same period a year ago.
Revenue climbed 134 percent to 155.1 million dollars against its
previous year's results.
</P>
<P>
Analysts were surprised at the success of Yahoo's performance
in the third-quarter, which is typically a slow period in
anticipation of the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo, the No.1 web portal and considered by many analysts a
bellwether of the rest of the sector, averaged 385 million page
views a day in September, up 24 percent from the average of 310
million page views in June.
</P>
<P>
Web portals try to leverage strong traffic growth to lure more
advertisers. Gary Valenzuela, Yahoo's chief financial officer,
said the number of advertisers on the company's sites grew to 3,
150 from 2,800 in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
"Our advertisers keep coming back and spending more money with
us," said Tim Koogle, Yahoo's chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
During the third quarter, Yahoo's advertiser and merchant
partner base expanded to 3,150 clients from about 2,700 in the
second quarter, according to Yahoo officials.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed Up Ratification Process of CTBT, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China will try her best to speed
up the ratification process of a global nuclear test ban treaty
based on a full review of the treaty and the international
security environment, a Chinese official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sha Zukang, head of a Chinese delegation for the first
Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), made the remark at
the opening ceremony of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China, as a responsible and signatory state,
will abide by the CTBT, actively support and participate in the
preparatory work of the treaty organization, and work to promote
its entry into force.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's basic position on the treaty has
remained unchanged, he told participants coming from more than 100
countries and groups.
</P>
<P>
Sha said that the CTBT, the result of long-term painstaking
efforts by the international community, is of epoch-making
significance in international nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
It not only represents a major step in mankind's endeavors
toward complete prohibition and destruction of nuclear weapons,
but also constitutes an important achievement in global arms
control and disarmament, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since its opening for signatures on September 24, 1996, 14 days
after its approval by the United Nations General Assembly, 47 out
of 154 states have ratified the treaty. This demonstrates that the
international community is supportive and confident of it, Sha
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official lauded CTBT's preparatory work over the
past three years, saying the endeavor is in full swing due to
efforts of many concerned people, including Dr. Wolfgang Hoffman,
the first Executive Secretary of the Provisional Technical
Secretariat of the Preparatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret over the sluggish ratification process and
the lack of participation by the parties concerned in the Treaty
Organization's preparatory work, while commenting that the
phenomenon is not an isolated event and its root causes deserve
reflection.
</P>
<P>
He set out as examples the successive nuclear explosions in
South Asia a year ago, and the 78-day bombing campaign against a
small non-nuclear weapons state by the world's most powerful
military bloc.
</P>
<P>
All these events, Sha said, dealt "a heavy blow to the nuclear
non-proliferation regime and disarmament process" and is not
something the world wishes to see occur again.
</P>
<P>
"Some countries" want to "strengthen both their sword and shield
to gain their own absolute security" by vigorously pursuing a
national missile defense system and theater missile defense system,
Sha noted.
</P>
<P>
Such an approach will "inevitably bring severe damage to global
and regional strategic balance and stability," he said, and "this
is surely not a gospel to those states which are positively
considering to ratify CTBT."
</P>
<P>
As a result, Sha said, the consequences of the mentioned
developments have begun and will continue to reveal themselves.
They will ultimately hinder the entry into force and the
universality of CTBT.
</P>
<P>
China sincerely hopes the window of opportunity in arms control
and disarmament -- opened in the wake of the relaxation of
international relations after the end of the cold war -- "will not
be closed by some countries as a result of their irresponsible
pursuit of cold war mentality and hegemonism," Sha added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it should be realized that disarmament can be
promoted and international peace and security achieved only by
abandoning the old security concept based on a military alliance
and build-up of armaments and establishing a new one based on
mutual trust, mutual benefits, equality and cooperation.

<P>
Sha held that only this represents the precondition and
foundation for CTBT's increasing acceptance and early entry into
force.
</P>
<P>
He urged those states which have not yet signed or ratified the
treaty to do so at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The final declaration and the follow-up actions of this
conference should be in line with such an aim, he said, noting
that attempts to amend the entry-into-force article will be
legally or practically undesirable.
</P>
<P>
CTBT can only take effect 180 days after all 44 countries in
Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament with nuclear reactors or
research programs endorse it. At present only 21 states with
nuclear capacity have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette and Austrian
Vice-Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel spoke
at the conference which is aimed at accelerating the
implementation of CTBT by appealing to those that have not signed
or ratified the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Likely to Sit out Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Ewing was back in
uniform when the New York Knicks opened their training camp, but
the big center could stay only for photographer to capture a few
frames.
</P>
<P>
As he sat low in his chair and discussed his left Achilles'
problems, it became apparent that this injury has caused him to
reflect. There is regret, Ewing admitted, that he didn't shut it
down last season.
</P>
<P>
He thought a summer of rest would allow him to be ready for
training camp. But it didn't. Ewing can't even run and will not
return until the pain subsides.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks started training camp yesterday without Ewing and
backup Chris Dudley, who has a sprained right knee.
</P>
<P>
Coach Jeff Van Gundy never knew if his starting center was
available until game time. Ewing couldn't defend his position
because he could barely move. He couldn't practice and was knee
deep in a buck of ice before and after every game.
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a combination of a lot of different things,
trying to make the playoffs, trying to win," Ewing said. "If we
lost, Jeff would have probably lost his job. I was thinking about
everything. "
</P>
<P>
Ewing also wanted an NBA championship and didn't know how
serious the injury could get. He said again he wasn't made aware
that a tear could result if he continued. But at the same time,
there was no finger pointing. Right now his focus is on getting
back.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old said: "I feel once I'm healthy I'll be back to
the old Patrick, running up and down the court pain free, blocking
shots, rebounding, everything."

<HEADLINE> BJP Set To Win India's Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) is most likely to emerge as the single largest party in
India as signs showed that it was set to win the latest elections
which began on September 5.
</P>
<P>
According to declared results till 0830 hours local time
Thursday morning, BJP and its allies won 228 seats to Lok Sabha,
the lower house of parliament, and were leading in another 65 out
of total of 537 seats.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Congress party and its allies won 104
seats and were ahead in another 31, far below their expectation,
while left candidates were declared elected in 38 seats and other
parties had secured 34 seats.
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee defeated his
Congress rival Karan Singh by over 123,000 though his victory
margin went down by more than 100,000 votes in Lucknow, capital of
the north Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
As a balanced play, Congress President Sonia Gandhi beat back
here BJP rival Sushma Swaraj in Bellary, a Congress stronghold in
the south state of Karnataka, by 56,100 votes.
</P>
<P>
With 154 seats already in BJP's kitty and Congress followed
with 86 seats, BJP is emerging as the largest party in the
country, which has seen three general elections in four years.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the initial results, Vajpayee said Wednesday that
the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which consisted of
24 small parties, would secure a majority and that the results
were expected.
</P>
<P>
BJP made a clean sweep of all seven seats in the Congress-ruled
capital, a result of which was attributed by local news media to
"Vajpayee wave", low turnout and "wrong choice" of Congress
candidates.
</P>
<P>
However, Congress and its allies staged a comeback in the south
states of Kerala, Karnataka and certain area in the northeast due
to "lack of coordination between BJP and its allies".

<HEADLINE> Marketing Campaign of Iodized Salt Launched in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A major social marketing
campaign of iodized salt was launched here Wednesday, the Rising
Nepal reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nepalese families will be the target of the campaign, which
aims at eliminating Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) as a public
health hazard in Nepal. Past studies have shown substantial
cretinism and goiter among Nepalese. The level of goiter in Nepal
is as high as 40 percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of the campaign is to replace crystal salt with
refined or crushed iodized salt packed in sealed plastic bags,"
the Health Ministry and the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) told a joint inaugural ceremony Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry of Nepal has been pursuing the goal of
universal use of iodized salt since 1973.
</P>
<P>
Nepalese consumers prefer large crystal salt which is presently
consumed by 90 percent households in Nepal. Only 55 percent of the
crystal salt is adequately iodized because of iodine losses during
storage and distribution.
</P>
<P>
The lack of iodine in the body usually results in goiter,
cretinism, reproductive failure as well as mental and physical
retardation.
</P>
<P>
As a mountain country, the iodine in salt from Nepal is
deficient.

giant pandas, began dwindling in the early 1980s, people
immediately sent giant pandas to live in zoos that could ensure
adequate food and safe shelter.
</P>
<P>
The average giant panda consumes 10 kilograms of fresh arrow
bamboo per day.
</P>
<P>
Pandas in captivity also eat fruit, milk, minced meat and
powdered calcium to maintain a balanced diet.
</P>
<P>
There are currently under 100 giant pandas living in captivity
in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang maintains that giant pandas should be slowly trained to
regain their wild nature.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas raised in captivity are often quite used to and
affectionate towards human beings.
</P>
<P>
But Wang sees this as a drawback: "The pandas should be able to
attack, protect and get food by themselves."
</P>
<P>
Wild giant pandas tend to live in isolated areas in order to be
safe from human attacks and other dangers.
</P>
<P>
The wild giant pandas live scattered across areas of Shaanxi,
Gansu and Sichuan provinces, but the majority live in Sichuan's
bamboo forests, says the report.

<P>
BELGRADE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has started a new
round of negotiations with KFOR to discuss the possibility of re-
establishing a number of Serb forces to balance a paramilitary "
Kosovo Corps," formally known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA),
a high ranking official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
General Nebojssa Pavkovich, chief commander of Yugoslavia's
Third Group Army, which was originally stationed in Kosovo, was
quoted by Belgrade TV as saying that a small number of Serb
military and police forces were needed to defend the border and
Serb historic relics.
</P>
<P>
Pavkovich said the "Kosovo Corps" and former KLA were to blame
for the instability in Kosovo after KFOR had taken control of the
region four months ago.
</P>
<P>
The general stressed that it is "absolutely reasonable" for non-
Albanian ethnic groups in Kosovo to have their own protection to
balance a paramilitary "corps" protecting Kosovo Albanians.

</P>
<P>
Vietnam Airlines will add one more weekly flight to its Ho Chi

<HEADLINE> Illegal Crops Increase Sharply in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Illegal crop
production in Colombia rose from 45,500 hectares in 1995 to 101,
200 hectares by the end of 1998, an increase of 122 percent, the
Transnational Institute (TNI) of Andean-Colombian Action said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by TNI said that Colombia has not achieved
its objectives, reportedly established four years ago, for the
eradication of the illegal crops of coca and poppies.
</P>
<P>
Efforts made by the state to combat poppy crops have yielded
few results. In the past seven years, over 2 million liters of
weed killer has been used at a cost of 53 million U.S. dollars.
The weed killer has been sprayed over more than 6,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, however, weed killer, which is sprayed in areas
where illegal crops are planted, can only stop illegal production
temporarily, the document revealed.
</P>
<P>
As for the country's coca production, "It is possible to verify
with high precision the size of the failure of the policy," added
the statement, indicating that between 1994 and 1998, 41 million U.
S. dollars were spent on the use of chemicals and anti-drug
operations, while illegally cultivated area tripled.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Colombia has been the only Andean country that has
not reduced the illegal crop production through its eradication
program. As a result, Colombians produce 53 percent of the total
amount of illegal crops in the western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, Peru had 129,200 hectares of illegal crops,
but at present, it has been reduced to 38,000.

SOFIA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands
started a three-day official visit in Bulgaria on Wednesday, the
first such visit since the two countries established diplomatic
ties 90 years ago.
</P>
<P>
After her arrival, the queen met with Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov. During their talks, they discussed the impact of the
Kosovo conflict on Bulgaria. Stoyanov explained the problems and
economic losses to the region caused by disruptions to the
physical and financial infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov also thanked the queen for her nation's support of
Bulgaria in its bid for accession to the European Union (EU)
during the Helsinki summit.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Central Bank Forecasts 2 Pct Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian central bank is
forecasting 2 percent inflation throughout 1999 if the domestic
political situation improves following the October 20 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
"The board of governors believes pressure on prices will remain
low and inflation could be checked at 2 percent in 1999," the
Jakarta Post Thursday quoted a statement of Bank Indonesia as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia earlier forecast that inflation for this year
would be around 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said prices currently were stable and under
control, as reflected by the 0.68-percent deflation in September,
the seventh consecutive month of deflation.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Statistics said recently that September's
0.68-percent deflation sent the annualized inflation level down to
1.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia suffered hyperinflation of more than 77 percent last
year as the economic crisis deepened.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia said the deflation over the past seven months
was the result of supply outweighing demand.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said increased production was seen in the
agriculture and mining sectors and the processing industry, while
demand remained low because of weak household purchasing power and
the ailing banking sector was still not providing significant
financing for new investments.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation process in the banking sector and the slow
restructuring of the real sector were the primary reasons behind
the low level of investment by the private sector, the central
bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also pointed to its tight monetary policy during the
second and third quarters of 1998 as a factor behind the still
lagging pace of private investment.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia also said if the post-election political
situation improved, the 1999 economic growth could reach zero
percent, compared to last year's 13.68 percent contraction.
</P>
<P>
"But if the domestic social and political situation is not as
conducive as expected, the board of governors projects the economy
will contract by 1 percent, accompanied by inflation of between 2
percent and 4 percent," it added.

BRASILIA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will continue its
participation in the International Space Station (ISS) project,
which is headed by NASA, the U.S. space agency, Brazil's Minister
for Science and Technology said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will rigorously comply with all technological

<P>
Brazil relegated 120 million U.S. dollars in 1997 to construct
equipment modules for the space station, but the financial crisis
last January delayed the construction plan.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Opening to Go on in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So far, China has attracted 13 insurance companies from eight
countries to set up 12 operations in coastal cities of Shanghai
and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
"The past experience has proved a success, and shows that the
introduction of foreign investment in this field can spur growth
in China's domestic insurance industry," he was quoted as saying
by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Further opening the insurance market can improve the country's
macroeconomic environment by providing better insurance services.
It can also improve the management of domestic insurers and
enhance their competitiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, liberalization should be based on a sound regulatory
environment, said the official from CIRC, which was set up late
last year to supervise the country's commercial insurance.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC is aimed to cultivate and speed up the development of
China's insurance industry, and set up a sound and open market,
the official noted.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance industry is still in its initial stages.
Insurance laws and regulations are insufficient and companies are
inexperienced in self-monitoring.
</P>
<P>
To minimize operational risks, the watchdog must impose tight
controls on both market behavior and insurance companies' claim
settlement ability, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Since last March, a rectification move has been launched on the
intermediary market and has succeeded in eliminating most
violations from the intermediary market, the newspaper said.

JAKARTA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Sports Council (KONI)
has forged a deal with the United States Sports Academy (USSA) to
help improve the country's sporting acumen, the Indonesian
Observer reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deal was signed here on Wednesday by Wismoyo Arismunandar,
Chairman of the KONI, and Tom P. Rosandich, representing USSA.
</P>
<P>
"We will do whatever is needed to help improve Indonesian
sports. We want to know what you want to do, where you want to go,
" Rosandich said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the area of assistance may include the provision
of instructors, coaching, research and services.
</P>
<P>
"We may arrange for students to have access to library sources
in the United States for their research," he said.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating further on points relating to the issue, Rosandich
spoke of the importance of good talent scouting and coaching
programs, from which reliable coaches can be produced.
</P>
<P>
If the coaching program works well, Indonesia does not need to
send its athletes to take part in overseas training programs.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia has many sporting talents. And they can be trained
at home," he said, adding that the moulding of an athlete should
incorporate the factors of speed, stamina, strength and agility.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old Rosandich is not new to the Indonesian sports
scene. He helped prepare Indonesian athletes for the 1962 Asian
Games in Jakarta.

GENEVA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Both Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Greg
Rusedski scored victories in their openers at the one million US
dollars Swiss Indoors tennis tournament in Basel, Switerland on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Russian Kafelnikov, the Australian Open champion, defeated

pace with French and U.S. Open champion Andre Agassi in the battle
for the No. 1 year-end ranking.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Russian was broken in his opening serve, but
regained his upperhands by the American's next two serves to jump

solution to the Abkhazian conflict within the Geneva process.
</P>

At the same time, the EU reiterated the necessity of finding a

TEGUCIGALPA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Experts from public and
private institutions, as well as international organizations,
ended a Central American Forest and Climate meeting on Wednesday
in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
</P>
<P>
The meeting revealed that 388,000 hectares of forest are lost
in the region per year in addition to natural disasters created by
the losses, according to a statement from the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The isthmus has registered a rise in desertification in some
zones due to human activities, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The degradation occurring in drainage areas generates sediments
which obstruct, dam and reduce the possibility of an improvement
in the quantity and quality of the water for use by the population.

<P>
WELLINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Online shopping is till in
its infancy in New Zealand, but pundits predict it will boom in
the future, with the float of the first Internet shopping company
in the wings.
</P>
<P>
Local media Thursday quoted IDC, a technology research company
in New Zealand, as believing that Internet commerce is developing
quickly in the country, with spending expected to leap from 19
million NZ dollars (about nine million U.S. dollars) in 1997 to
more than 200 million (104 million U.S. dollars) by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that entrepreneurs Eric Watson and Craig
Heatley, both are based in Auckland, the largest city in New
Zealand, are looking to cash in on the go-ahead sector by setting
up a joint Internet shopping company to be floated on the New
Zealand Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
IDC research manager Pat Pilcher was quoted as saying "It is
early days yet in terms of Internet shopping, however we are very
bullish about it. We do expect some significant growth to happen."
</P>
<P>
Internet use in New Zealand with a population of about 3.8
million is regarded as high, with IDC's latest survey showing that
315,020 New Zealanders have Internet subscriber accounts at the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of retailers offering online shopping on Telecom's
Internet shopping service, XShop, keeps on rising, with 90 stores
