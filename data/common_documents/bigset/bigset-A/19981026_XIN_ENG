<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Interim Deal Unlike Oslo Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEN GURION AIRPORT, TEL AVIV, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the interim
deal he struck with the Palestinians was unlike the Oslo Accords,
which he said were not good agreements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here after returning from 11-day
stay in the U.S. for negotiations, Netanyahu said his deal did
provide security guarantee for Israel while being required to
relinquish lands to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo Accords, signed by his predecessor, late Yitzhak
Rabin, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground
for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of
"land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the newly-concluded agreement established for
the first time a concrete mechanism for the Palestinians to
fulfill their security commitment before Israel hands over part of
the West Bank to them.
</P>
<P>
He said this was the best he could have been achieved under the
current circumstance.
</P>
<P>
He described as "tremendous difficult" the nine days of
bargaining with the Palestinians under U.S. mediation at the Wye
Plantation near Washington.
</P>
<P>
The talks began on October 15 and resulted in the new interim
agreement signed at the White House last Friday by Netanyahu,
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women's volleyball
team downed its visiting Italian counterpart in a 3-0 straight
sets on Sunday, the first of their two-game warm-ups for the
next month's world championship in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The host China, led by former Chinese star Lang Ping, scored a
15-4, 15-11 and 15-12 victory over Italy, who arrived in Beijing
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women met little challenge and took the first set
easily. In the second, however, the Italians played very strong
both in the attack and defense and led the score 11-9 before
lossing the set.
</P>
<P>
Italy, one of the rising team in the world volleyball for
women, edged China 3-2 in last year's World Cup, where China went
out of top four.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is the level of the Italian team," said Lang
Ping. "They came here yesterday and have to overcome a
time-difference problem. They are expected to be much better
tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Both sides will play their second warm-up match on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 World Women's Volleyball Championship will be held
from November 3 to 12. China plays opener with its Europen
opponent Croatia.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Army Confirms Warplane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese army admitted
Sunday that a fighter plane of government troops crashed Saturday,
killing its pilot, but denied it was shot down by rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
The statement from the central command of the Sudanese army did
not mention the type of the plane, but said it was on "military
mission as part of the ongoing fighting operations in East
Equatoria province to clear the remaining rebel pockets."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the plane crashed due to technical fault and
was not shot down by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) said their
forces shot down a MIG-23 fighter of the Sudanese Air Force
Saturday near al-Jabalain, 64 kilometers east of Juba, capital of
the East Equatoria province.
</P>
<P>
Fightings between government forces and the SPLA rebels have
been going on for more than a month in the East Equatoria province.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 to win autonomy for the
Christians in southern Sudan from the north's Muslim and Arab
population. More than 1.5 million people have died in the fighting
and the accompanying famines.

As Typhoon Babs is approaching Hong Kong, No. 3 wind signal is
being hoisted here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With all the four divisions having completed enough racing on
Friday and Saturday, it was possible to calculate results for the
series raced within the Hong Kong SAR waters.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hi Fidelity, a Sydney 46 skippered by Neil Pryde,
who is vice-chairman of the Racing Committee, won the Racing
(CHS) division, and the Cruising (HKPN) division title went to
Catalina-type Bewitched, which is skippered by Glenn Smith.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Babs, moving slowly across the South China Sea towards
Hong Kong, is likely to affect local weather for at least another
two days. With its course altering to westerly, it will make
Wednesday's start to the long offshore race -- Tsing Tao Beer
Hong Kong-Sanya International Race -- impossible.
</P>
<P>
"We will be anxiously watching the track of Babs and, with the
help of the Hong Kong Observatory, will need to make a decision
on Tuesday night at the skippers briefing whether to race to
Hainan or not," said Littlechild.
</P>

China Race Week is jointly organized by the Hong Kong Yacht
Club and the Chinese Yachting Association.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Determined to Defend Its Territorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- President Glafcos Clerides said
Sunday that Cyprus is determined to defend its freedom,
independence and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after a military parade in Larnaca, marking
the end of the six-day annual National Guard manoeuvres code-named
"Nikiforos '98", conducted in conjunction with the Greek "Toxotis"
manoeuvres.
</P>
<P>
"The political message of this year's exercises to all
concerned is simple: we have repeatedly stressed that we shall
defend our freedom, our independence and our territorial
integrity," President Clerides, who took the salute of the
parade, said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The military parade was attended by the
manoeuvres-participating National Guard units with their advanced
weapons including French exocet missiles, Russian T-80 tanks and
Brazilian Caskavelle armored personnel carriers, as well as Greek
 F-16 fighters and Naval helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou also said that Cyprus is
preparing to deal with any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
"I think the exercises have spoken and the parade simply
ratified that we can trust the unlimited power of our people and
at the same time we can work with the Greek people and Greece to
deal with the visible threat, the threat of Turkish
expansionism," Omirou noted.
</P>
<P>
The annual military exercise, conducted in the eastern town of
Larnaca, was held within the framework of a joint defense pact
between Cyprus and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The pact, signed in November 1993, provides that Greece will
come in aid for Cyprus in case the government-controlled southern
part of the island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
The military exercise, which started last Tuesday, was
participated by some 10,000 troops and reservists.
</P>
<P>
During the exercise, the Greek jet fighters and bombers
attacked mock targets in the Nicosia area and a joint search and
rescue drill at sea was carried out by Greek Air Forces and Navy
units with Cyprus National Guard' air and naval rescue units as
well as police.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has since then maintained 35,000 troops in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots, who declared unilaterally
in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"
recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Interim Deal Based on Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEN GURION AIRPORT, TEL AVIV, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the interim
deal he struck with the Palestinians was based on security and
unlike the Oslo Accords, which he said had a lot of holes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here after returning from 11-day
stay in the U.S. for negotiations, Netanyahu said his deal was the
best he could have achieved under the current circumstance.
</P>
<P>
It did provide security guarantee for Israel while required
Israel to relinquish lands to the Palestinians, Netanyahu
said. "Only when they give in, do we give in," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo Accords, signed by his predecessor, late Yitzhak
Rabin, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground
for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of
"land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the newly-concluded agreement established for
the first time a concrete mechanism for the Palestinians to
fulfill their security commitments before Israel hands over part
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He then elaborated on what the Israeli side has achieved in the
talks. He said one of the most important achievement was the
Palestinian commitment to amend its National Charter calling for
the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side will also step up anti-terrorist efforts,
- arrest terrorists and confiscate weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that by agreeing to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians, 3 percent of which as a nature
reserve under Israeli security control, Israel has successfully
lowered the expectation of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The previous Labor government promised to give the Palestinian
90 percent of the West Bank after completing all three stages of
troop redeployment, he said, Israel will control most of the West
Bank under the current agreement.
</P>
<P>
He described as "tremendous difficult" the nine days of
bargaining with the Palestinians under U.S. mediation at the Wye
Plantation near Washington.
</P>
<P>
The talks began on October 15 and resulted in the new interim
agreement signed at the White House last Friday by Netanyahu,
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Turnout Low In Iran's Experts' Assembly Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced Sunday that 46.3
percent of its eligible voters turned out in Friday's election of
the Experts' Assembly that oversees the country's supreme leader, a
report released by the election headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
The voter turnout Friday was in a striking contrast with the
presidential election in May last year, in which about 30 million
of the country's 38.6 million eligible voters showed up and more
than 20 million voted for moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Many residents in Tehran said that they stayed away from the
election because of the screening policy of the Guardians
Council, which is empowered to review the qualification of the
candidates for the country's elections, the official news agency
IRNA reported.,
</P>
<P>
Out of the 394 applicants, the council approved 167 candidates
to run for the 86 seat of the assembly.
</P>
<P>
But at least four candidates from the left-wing factions
withdrew before the election in protest of the council's screening
policy.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing groups, which formed a coalition with the
moderates in support of Khatami, refused to announce their
candidate list after their key nominees were rejected by the
Guardians Council.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turnout Low In Iran's Experts' Assembly Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced Sunday that 46.3
percent of its eligible voters turned out in Friday's election of
the Experts' Assembly that oversees the country's supreme leader, a
report released by the election headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
The voter turnout Friday was in a striking contrast with the
presidential election in May last year, in which about 30 million
of the country's 38.6 million eligible voters showed up and more
than 20 million voted for moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Many residents in Tehran said that they stayed away from the
election because of the screening policy of the Guardians
Council, which is empowered to review the qualification of the
candidates for the country's elections, the official news agency
IRNA reported.,
</P>
<P>
Out of the 394 applicants, the council approved 167 candidates
to run for the 86 seat of the assembly.
</P>
<P>
But at least four candidates from the left-wing factions
withdrew before the election in protest of the council's screening
policy.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing groups, which formed a coalition with the
moderates in support of Khatami, refused to announce their
candidate list after their key nominees were rejected by the
Guardians Council.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservatives have won a clear victory in Friday's
election, gaining 44 of the 70 decided seat, and the moderates
obtained eight.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Interim Deal Based on Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEN GURION AIRPORT, TEL AVIV, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the interim
deal he struck with the Palestinians was based on security and
unlike the Oslo Accords, which he said had a lot of holes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here after returning from 11-day
stay in the U.S. for negotiations, Netanyahu said his deal was the
best he could have achieved under the current circumstance.
</P>
<P>
It did provide security guarantee for Israel while required
Israel to relinquish lands to the Palestinians, Netanyahu
said. "Only when they give in, do we give in," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo Accords, signed by his predecessor, late Yitzhak
Rabin, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground
for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of
"land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the newly-concluded agreement established for
the first time a concrete mechanism for the Palestinians to
fulfill their security commitments before Israel hands over part
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He then elaborated on what the Israeli side has achieved in the
talks. He said one of the most important achievement was the
Palestinian commitment to amend its National Charter calling for
the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side will also step up anti-terrorist efforts,
- arrest terrorists and confiscate weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that by agreeing to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians, 3 percent of which as a nature
reserve under Israeli security control, Israel has successfully
lowered the expectation of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The previous Labor government promised to give the Palestinian
90 percent of the West Bank after completing all three stages of
troop redeployment, he said, Israel will control most of the West
Bank under the current agreement.
</P>
<P>
He described as "tremendous difficult" the nine days of
bargaining with the Palestinians under U.S. mediation at the Wye
Plantation near Washington.
</P>
<P>
The talks began on October 15 and resulted in the new interim
agreement signed at the White House last Friday by Netanyahu,
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.

JERUSALEM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended the peace deal he signed
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, saying it closed the
"holes" of the Oslo Accords and lowered Palestinian expectations.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Netanyahu, who opposed the Oslo Accords when they were signed,
said the newly-concluded agreement established for the first time
a concrete mechanism for the Palestinians to fulfill their
security commitments before Israel hands over part of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important achievements for the Israeli side
was the Palestinian commitment to convene the Palestinian National
Council (PNC) to cancel the provisions in its National Charter
calling for the destruction of Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PNC will do it publicly, before U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who has promised to address the PNC meeting, Netanyahu
said. The cancellation will also be announced in Arabic so every
Palestinian family will know it, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have also made concrete plans to fight
terrorism, including arrest alleged terrorists and confiscate
weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
By clinching the deal on the basis of security guarantees and
making the Palestinian plans specific and measurable, the Israeli
side successfully closed "a lot of holes" in the Oslo Accords, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has succeeded in lowering the Palestinian
expectation by handing over 13 percent of the West Bank, 3 percent
of that as a nature reserve, in the second stage of redeployment,
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians had the understanding from the previous Labor
government that they would get most of the West Bank after the
completion of all Israeli troop redeployments, he said.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to cater to the extreme right-wingers in
his own camp, who accused him of "treason" by making concessions
to the Palestinians, Netanyahu promised "to fight in the last two
years very hard to reduce their expectations."
</P>
<P>
He said he understood and has considered the security concerns
of Jewish settlers, who vehemently opposed the agreement. "We will
fight the battle for you ... to reduce the damages," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Schroeder's Party Approves Ruling Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- German chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD) Sunday overwhelmingly
approved a final agreement on forming a coalition government with
the Greens party.
</P>
<P>
The decision made at a SPD party convention on Sunday cleared
the final hurdle for the advent later this week of Germany's first
center-left ruling coalition after 16 years of conservative rule
under Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
The Greens already approved the so-called "Red-Green Coalition"
at their party convention on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, which emerged as Germany's strongest party after a
decisive victory over Kohl's conservative alliance in general
elections on September 27, needs to form a coalition government
with the much smaller Greens in order to muster a stable majority
in the new German parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the party convention on Sunday, Schroeder
reiterated his election pledge to combine modernity with social
justice in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The coalition agreement negotiated by his SPD and ecologist
Greens over the past two weeks pledges modest tax cuts while
vowing to restrengthen Germany's social welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
The new government also sets fighting unemployment as its top
priority and will launch roundtable negotiations between industry,
labor unions and government over measures to create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
While the SPD-Greens programs have drawn support from trade
unions, it has been sharply criticized by many business leaders,
who said that the new government's economic program would not be
helpful to address Germany's economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday both Schroeder and Oskar Lafontaine, the SPD chairman
who will become finance minister in the new government, dismissed
the widely publicized rivalry between them. They vowed to work
together to ensure a strong government in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Germany's new parliament will convene its inaugural session on
Monday and will formally elect Schroeder as chancellor the day
after.

<HEADLINE> AL Urges Honest Israeli Execution of Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Sunday
called for "honest execution" by Israel of an agreement on
redeployment reached recently with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The words made by AL chief Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid reflected
the skepticism of the Arab world whether Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu will live up to the signed deal.
</P>
<P>
After nine-day tough negotiations mediated by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
leader Yasser Arafat and Netanyahu signed a interim peace
agreement Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw its troops from
another 13 percent of the West Bank and release part of the 3,000
jailed Palestinians while PNA has agreed to intensify crackdown on
Islamic militants and scrap references in the covenant that call
for destruction.
</P>
<P>
Calling the deal a key step forward in the Mideast peace
process, Abdel-Meguid said the momentum should be used to settle
the thorny issues, including the status of Jerusalem, Palestinian
refugees and statehood, between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also called for the resumption of peace talks on
the Syrian-and-Lebanese-Israeli tracks.
</P>
<P>
The talks have been deadlocked since early 1996 due to disputes
between Syria and Israel over the future of the Golan Heights
captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Defends His Deal; Sharon Says Price High </HEADLINE>

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended the peace deal he signed
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, saying it closed the
"holes" in the Oslo Accords and lowered Palestinian expectations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at Ben Gurion airport near Tel
Aviv upon returning from an 11-day stay in the U.S. for
negotiations, Netanyahu said his deal signed last Friday was the
best he could have achieved under the current circumstance.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls on Israel to withdraw from an additional 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for specific Palestinian
steps to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
By linking Israeli troop redeployment with concrete Palestinian
 plans, Netanyahu said, the Israeli side successfully closed a
lot of holes in the Oslo Accords, under which Israel has "given
up lands but received nothing."
</P>
<P>
The Oslo Accords, signed by his predecessor, late Yitzhak
Rabin, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground
for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of
"land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who opposed the Oslo Accords when they were signed,
said the newly-concluded agreement established for the first time
a concrete mechanism for the Palestinians to fulfill their
security commitments before Israel hands over part of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has succeeded in lowering the Palestinian
expectations in the talks. He said the previous labor government
had promised the Palestinians that more than 90 percent of the
West Bank would be under Palestinian control after the completion
of all Israeli troop redeployments.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian will control only 40 percent of the West Bank
after the current agreement is implemented. Without giving the
specific figure, Netanyahu said the size of the third
redeployment will be "small."
</P>
<P>
Another important achievement for the Israeli side was the
Palestinian commitment to convene the Palestinian National Council
(PNC) to cancel the provisions in its National Charter calling for
the destruction of Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PNC will do it publicly, before U.S. President Bill

said. The cancellation will also be announced in Arabic so every
Palestinian family will know it, he added.

</P>
<P>
He described as "tremendous difficult" the nine days of

Plantation near Washington.
</P>
<P>
The talks began on October 15 and resulted in the new interim
agreement signed at the White House last Friday by Netanyahu,
Arafat and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Before the news conference, Netanyahu and his two ministers
who took part in the U.S. negotiations, Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, received a
red-carpet reception at a welcoming ceremony held by most of his
cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said at the news conference that the agreement was a
"good one" and the Israeli side has achieved "as much as
possible" concerning security guarantees in the talks, which he
described "as difficult almost as wars."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the price Israel paid for the agreement
was "very heavy," noting that the size of the withdrawal, 13
percent of the West Bank, was decided in advance.
</P>
<P>
Sharon declined to indicate whether he will vote for or
against the agreement when Netanyahu presents it to the cabinet
later this week, but reiterated his position that 13 percent
withdrawal will compromise Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Jewish settlers blocked intersections and
highways in the West Bank to protest against the agreement. At
least 20 settlers were arrested in clashes with Israeli police.
One policeman was injured.

<HEADLINE> Iran Summon Dutch Ambassador for Protest Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
summoned Dutch ambassador to Tehran Sunday to convey its
"strongest protests over the seditious acts" of some anti-Iran
groups in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The protest came after a group of Iranian dissidents,
including members of the outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization
(MKO), disrupted last week a scheduled speech by Faezeh Hashemi,
daughter of former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani in Dutch
western city of Leiden, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official said that since the Dutch
authorities were informed of the scheduled ceremony of the
International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern
World and the formal invitation extended to Ms. Hashemi, the
occurrence of such an incident was "unjustifiable."
</P>
<P>
Iran demands the arrest and punishment of those responsible
for the disturbing incident, he said.
</P>
<P>
Relaying his country's deep regret over the incident, which is
under investigation, the ambassador promised that results will be
presented to the Iranian Foreign Ministry as soon as the inquiry
is concluded.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was one of Iranian political groups, which fought
against the former Iranian Shah Regime before the Islamic
Revolution in 1979, but it was outlawed in 1981 due to its some
sharp differences with the government.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the MKO, based in Iraq, launched
a series of attacks against the Iranian interests inside and
outside Iran.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rebels to Attend Lusaka Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The rebels fighting to
overthrow President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
Laurent Kabila will participate in Monday's peace talks in
Zambia's capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Presidential Affairs Minister Eric Silwamba confirmed
this in an interview with Zambia National Broadcasting
Corporation ZNBC Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Lusaka meeting, which is a follow-up of high-level
meetings in the past two months in Zimbabwe and South Africa on
the Congolese crisis, is meant to discuss a proposed ceasefire
and have consultations among all parties concerned in order
to find a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
At a regional summit held at Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls Town
on September 8, Rebels were refused to address the meeting
aimed at working out a truce in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba said that Secretary-General of the Organization of
Africa Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim, representatives from the
United Nations, and ministers of defense and foreign affairs from
the 14-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) will
attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
More and more African countries have been involved in the DRC
conflict since it began in early August. And some SADC members
including Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola even sent their troops to
assist Kabila in fighting against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
While the rebels, allegedly backed by Uganda and Rwanda who
claimed to have security interests in eastern DRC, now hold most
of the northeast part of the vast central African country. On
October 12, the rebels captured the strategic town of Kindu.
</P>
<P>
According to the rebel-held Radio Goma broadcasts last Friday,
the rebels were poised to capture at any time Mbuji-Mayi, capital
of the diamond-rich Kasai Occidental Province, which is
strategically important for the two warring sides in the war.

BAGHDAD, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Sunday opened its
second Exhibit for Industrial and Agricultural Technology in
Baghdad in an effort to enhance relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, which will last seven days, is held by the
Iraqi Agronomists Union in cooperation with the Lebanese
Industrial Marketing Company.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit brought together 82 Lebanese companies specialized
in construction, chemical, food, plastic, electric, agricultural
equipment and textile industries, as well as 120 industrialists.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Jack Sarraf, head of the
Lebanese Industrialists Association, stressed that the exhibit
reflected Lebanese industrialists' determination to enhance the
bilateral ties and break the embargo on Iraq imposed in 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Sarraf said that Lebanon will soon open its embassy in
Baghdad. Lebanon cut off its diplomatic relations with Iraq in
1994 after a prominent Iraqi opposition figure was assassinated in
Beirut, allegedly by Iraqi secret agents.
</P>
<P>
Sarraf said that Lebanese consulate would embark on granting
visas to Iraqis willing to visit Lebanon and a Lebanese Week is
expected to be held in Baghdad from November 6, which will be
attended by Lebanese Minister of State for Industrial Affairs
Nadim Salem.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Has Talks With Russian Duma Chairman (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, the chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
had talks here this afternoon with Gennady Seleznev, the chairman
of the Duma of Russia who is here as Li's guest.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his Russian
counterpart Boris Yeltsin have met many times, which has
established the guiding principle for the bilateral relations and
laid foundation for developing bilateral good-neighborly and
friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
He said China will join Russia in making an effort to bring
about more results in bilateral parliamentary exchanges. He said
that parliamentary exchanges are an important part of Sino-Russian
strategic partnership and that with joint efforts in the past few
years, exchanges and cooperation between the two parliaments have
gone smoothly with high-level visits, and normal working relations
were established between some special committees, and visits made
by parliament officials.
</P>
<P>
These activities have increased bilateral relations, enhanced
mutual understanding, developed a common ground and increased
friendship, promoting the development of Sino-Russian relations,
Li said, pointing out that developing Sino-Russian relations on
the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence and on
international laws is an important policy in China.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, bilateral relations have had good
development momentum, and Sino-Russian strategic partnership is a
new one with mutual respect, equality, mutual trust,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, good-neighborly
friendship and common development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia share mountains, rivers, and a long border,
and bilateral long-term and good-neighborly friendship is in their
interests and the interests of their people, he said, and China
and Russia are two important and influential countries which have
common interests in international affairs and their cooperation in
the field has been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
He cited the cooperation in seeking political solution to the
Kosovo crisis recently, and said that China hopes to further
strengthen consultations and cooperation in major international
and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the two parliaments should make a greater
effort to push the growth of Sino-Russian relations and the
development of bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Li also discussed the historical background of the Taiwan and
Tibet issues and China's position on them and said that he
appreciates the "one China" stance of Seleznev and most Duma
members.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, a small number of people have always wanted
to harm the sentiments of the Chinese people by acting in a
different way on the Taiwan question, which will inevitably cause
concern from the Chinese government.

President Petar Stoyanov and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov, who arrived here Sunday on a two-day state visit to
India, the first by a foreign head of state to India since it

Stoyanov, also met Congress President Sonia Gandhi at her
residence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Stoyanov said his visit to India would boost bilateral
ties. Narayanan said the visit would help in reviving the
traditional spiritual and cultural ties between the two countries,
and add a new economic dimension to these relations.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said that his country is in the midst of economic
reforms and restructuring and increased investments in various
fields would help in that process.

<P>
On the international situation, Li said that the world is
moving towards multi-polarization, which is conducive to the
establishment of a just and rational new international political
and economic order.
</P>
<P>
He discussed China's reforms and opening up over the past two
decades, and its success in dealing with the relations between
reform, development and stability, and the people's congress
system.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev said that there is a deep traditional friendship
between the people of the two countries, and that the two
countries have a consensus on international and bilateral
relations, and that the leaders of the two countries have set up a
regular meeting mechanism, and various departments have kept
constant contacts, which has laid a firm foundation for the
development of bilateral political relations.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic and trade relations will be further
explored, Seleznev said, adding that he has visited China several
times and witnessed China's achievements in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
He said that he expects his visit to Shanghai, Shenzhen and
Hong Kong to learn more about China's new achievements and
successful implementation of the "one country, two systems"
principle after Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Duma strictly abides by the "one China"
principle and believes that the government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing
China.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the visit of Zhirinovsky, a Duma
member, to Taiwan does not represent the Duma and that he himself
opposed this act from the beginning.

and autonomous regions in China should learn from the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region in its thrifty arrangements for its 40th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
It says that Ningxia has set an example for the whole country
in saving state funds for the 40th anniversary of the region, on
October 25, and asked officials at various levels to cut out all
unnecessary meetings, especially celebrations, receptions,
parties, symposiums, news conferences, and to use the money
instead for economic construction and for solving problems in
people's life.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia had scheduled a big celebrations for its 40th
anniversary, but, after the devastating floods that hit many parts
of the country, the regional government decided to reduce the
number of activities and responded to the central government's
call for supporting for flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has reduced the number of days for celebrations from 7
to only 1, the paper says, giving up a 10,000-person parade, a
large reception, and some other activities, as a way to save funds
for poverty-stricken areas.

that other parts of the country could follow and that it shows
patriotic, socialist unity among all ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> ECA Chief Underlines Proper Use of Natural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- K.Y. Amoako, Executive
Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA), urged African countries Monday to properly use their
natural resources and prevent environmental degradation when they
are developing national economies.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement at a three-day seminar on
environmental and natural resources held here at the U.N.
Conference Center, Amoako said "food insecurity, rapid population
growth, depletion of natural resources and environmental
degradation constitute a very important challenge to public
policy in Africa today."
</P>
<P>
He said many African countries are richly endowed with natural
resources, such as forests, minerals, water and fisheries, but
Africa has suffered a severe crisis manifested in the constant
decline of its economic growth rate, particularly during the two
decades up to the mid-1990s, simultaneously with a rapid
depletion of its natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Amoako cited two basic facts as contributing markedly to the
deterioration in the average quality of life in Africa, namely
the population growth rate which exceeds that of per capita food
production in most African countries; and the rapid deterioration
of the environment and depletion of natural resources on the
continent which has led to declining productivity.
</P>
<P>
"There is a compelling need for policy-makers to get a handle
on the key mutually reinforcing factors of high population
growth, low economic growth, environmental degradation, natural
resources depletion and poverty," Amoako stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECA Chief, the current system of national
accounts pays scant attention to the depletion and degradation of
environmental assets, and its attendant losses and costs to
society.
</P>
<P>
"Natural assets have often been used without regard to their
nonrenewable character and without properly accounting for their
value in the economic planning process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many African countries have consumed much of the revenues
generated form natural resources instead of making adequate
long-term investments in projects that yield high returns," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the participants of the seminar would support the
efforts of African governments to identify, capture and use
resources rents for economic sustainability of natural resources
and overall national development.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which is organized by the ECA, will discuss
issues such as the role of natural resources in Africa's
economies, the system of integrated environmental and economic
accounting, and integrated accounting and policy reforms.
</P>
<P>
Participants from some African countries will present reports
on their experiences and policy implications.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba: Violence No Way to End Congo (K) Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said here Monday at a regional meeting that violence
can't end the on-going war in the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC)
and dialog is the only solution.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the ministerial meeting held here to
address the DRC crisis, Chiluba said "violence is not the
solution to the problem in Congo. The solution lies in a quiet
and reasoned settlement of pertinent issues."
</P>
<P>
He even cited the word of Obafemi Awolowo as "Violence never
settles anything right."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba noted that war has been discarded in searching for a
way to end conflicts nowadays and it can't bring about lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that wars will end up through dialog and the Congo (K)
is not a exception.
</P>
<P>
"Every war must be settled on a round table conference. The
war in the Congo is not any different, its cessation can only
come about by way of dialog, conciliation and accommodation,"
said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president, who has been mandated by regional
leaders to mediate the fighting, also observed that all the
African countries should accept and share responsibility for what
is happening in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged the participants to find an African way to bring
an end to the Congo (K) crisis, saying "Congo is an African
problem which must be resolved by African people using African
expertise, experience, resources and acumen."
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general
of the Organization of African Unity, also called on the
participants to adopt a "pragmatic" approach to the crisis in
Congo and strive to emerge with a mechanism that will pave the way
for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the former Zaire and
for a cessation of hostilities there.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, at least six countries have been involved in the
Congo (K) war and some southern African countries such as
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have sent thousands of their troops
to assist President Laurent Kabila in fighting against the
rebels, who now hold most part of the country's northeastern
territory
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview with Xinhua, Kaire Mbuende, executive
secretary of the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
said he was optimistic over the results of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende who later chaired the meeting said if the solution to
the Congo (K) war could not be found as soon as possible, there
will be a "disaster" for the African people.
</P>
<P>
He added that the war can only be resolved by the African
people instead of other external forces.
</P>
<P>
Besides Salim and Mbuende, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General
for Political Affairs, Ibrahima Fall, as well as foreign and
defense ministers from 14 African countries attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Congolese rebel representatives who started a
rebellion in early August to topple President Laurent Kabila
arrived here Sunday but were denied access to the meeting as they
had been treated at a regional summit held in Victoria Falls
Town, Zimbabwe early September.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony started at noon Monday and was followed
by closed-door consultations.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Strengthens Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian rupiah strengthened
to 7,500/7.700 rupiah against the U.S. dollar in the Jakarta
inter-bank spot market on Monday following rumors that Bank
Indonesia was planning to introduce an intervention band in the
money market.
</P>
<P>
"The intervention band rumors made the rupiah-U.S. dollar
trading (on Monday) more active than at the weekend," a dealer
working with a private bank said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the rumors, many speculators let their U.S. dollars
go at a time when the rupiah was trading at 8,000 to the
greenback, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. dollar selloffs raised the rupiah's value to 7,150
per U.S. dollar, but it weakened against to 7,500 following profit
taking actions," a dealer working with a state bank said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which hit an eight-month high of 7,150 last
Wednesday slid back to 7,800 on Thursday and to 7,850 on Friday
following a controversial statement by Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the ideal level of the rupiah-U.S. dollar
exchange rate would be between 7,000 and 8,000 to maintain the
competitiveness of the country's exports.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Flat on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed barely
lower on Singapore Stock Market Monday in the absence of fresh
trading incentives.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) inched down 0.09 points
to end at 1,113.50 points despite expectations that the market
will stay volatile this week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had predicted that stock market activities this week
are expected to be a replay of the seesaw pattern of the past
fortnight or so with trading revolving around the 1,100-point
mark.
</P>
<P>
Market experts had reckoned stock prices would run up, only to
be pulled back by profit taking or negative news from Japan.
</P>
<P>
They had also said that the market was continuing its
corrections following the hefty run-up over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Throughout last week, profit-taking was dominant as investors
pulled back after a few days of sharp gains.
</P>
<P>
However, the market managed to stave off a correction following
its recent run-up Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market has remained supported since foreign
funds were still willing to put money in the region.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover declined to 215.88 million units worth
248.42 million Singapore dollars (153.16 million U.S. dollars).
Gainers led losers by 141 to 88 with 193 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was a 19.82-million-unit parcel of ST Cap
which topped the active chart. SembCorp was the second most
heavily traded stock on the exchange with a turnover of 16.52
million shares. Vic Balla was next with 7.21 million counters
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 led the ascent of the day as it rose by 50 cents to
19.00 Singapore dollars at close. Vic Balla went up 27 cents to
finish at 1.05 Singapore dollars. DBS F was up 20 cents to end at
8.95 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, OCBC F was the biggest loser of the day with a
loss of 25 cents to close at 6.60 Singapore dollars. Bukit Sem
retreated 20 cents to close at 7.80 Singapore dollars. Transmarco
also inched 20 cents lower but it ended at 3.00 Singapore dollars.

contributions during the 16-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
The award has been only be received by Germany's first

<P>
Kohl, 68, was defeated by Gerhard Schroeder of the Social
Democratic Party (SPD) in general elections on September 27.

<HEADLINE> Bad Week for Nairobi Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nairobi Stock Exchange
(NSE), like other bourses in sub-Saharan Africa -- with the
exception of South Africa -- had a bad week of trading last week,
veteran analysts here have said.
</P>
<P>
While the market in Johannesburg responded positively to a
recent surprise cut in U.S. interest rates, other African markets
are unlikely to pick up until global market volatility ceases,
reported Monday's East African weekly.
</P>
<P>
Trading remained depressed in Nairobi's stock market, with a
grim economic outlook overshadowing a further drop in interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark 91-day Treasury Bill rates fell to 19.816 percent at
last Thursday's auction, down from 27 percent in April. Stock
brokers said investment had been affected by poor profit
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Lucas Otieno, a financial analyst with Shah, Munge &AMP; Partners,
said that the NSE 20-share index rose to 2783.26 last Friday from
2775.72 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
He said total market turnover last week had risen to
62,157,925 from the previous week's 39,693,211. The number of
shares traded went up from 1,002,494 to 1,597,148. There were
785 deals during last week.
</P>
<P>
Foreign activity continued its downward trend. From January to
September, the turnover was 862 million Shillings (14.3 million
U.S. Dollars), accounting for 26.8 percent of the total turnover.
</P>
<P>
This was a sharp drop compared with last year when the foreign
turnover was 2.3 billion Shillings and accounted for 36 percent
of the total market.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said foreign investors had taken more money out of the
market than they had brought in since the beginning of this year,
adding that the trend was likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
The stock market has been affected by the recent teachers'
strike and the uncertainty in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The NSE had hit a 10-year low in mid-October, a situation
analysts attributed this to recent economic and political unrest.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said people were holding back on investing because
they were not sure whether the momentum which the economy had
started gaining in the third quarter of the year would last.
</P>
<P>
An NSE official said recently that the exchange was concerned
over the depressed market and revealed there were plans to
recruit new companies to increase liquidity in the market.
</P>
<P>
In September, there was a decline of turnover by two percent
over August. Shares traded fell by 8.8 percent to 9.4 million.
Market capitalization also declined by four percent from 1.86
billion U.S. Dollars in August.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Peru and Ecuador signed a
peace treaty here Monday to end a dispute over a 78-kilometer
section of their border in the Andean foothills in the Amazon
jungle.
</P>
<P>
Present at the signing ceremony at the Brazilian foreign
ministry were Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Ecuadoran
President Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was brokered by the United States, Brazil, Argentina
and Chile -- the four nations which guarantee the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the disputed section of the border will
follow the heights of the Cordillera del Condor mountain range, as
Peru had claimed.
</P>
<P>
But a one-square-kilometer hilly area within Peru's territory
called Tiwintza will be granted to Ecuador as private property,
with Peru maintaining sovereignty over it.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over the
disputed region. Peace talks over the dispute began in 1995.

paramedics from a nearby Palestinian hospital could not help.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, a divided city with 130,000 Palestinians and 500 Jewish
settlers, is one of the flashpoints between Israelis and the
Palestinians. A Jewish settler was stabbed to death in August.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not Exporting Terrorism to Any Country: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
said Monday that there are no terrorists in Pakistan as such who
operate from here against any other country.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Pakistan itself has been a victim of
terrorism, Sharif said in Lahore during an interview on regional,
bilateral and international issues with Saudi reporters who were
accompanying visiting Saudi crown prince.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was quoted by the Associated Press of Pakistan as saying
that fighting terrorism and eradicating it have been a firm
resolve of the Pakistani government and it is ready to play that
role wherever terrorism takes place.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions about neighboring Afghanistan, Sharif
said it is very unfortunate that whatever happens in Afghanistan
affects Pakistan as well and there is no other neighborly country
so adversely affected by events taking place in another country
than Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
As Afghanistan is a land-locked country, Sharif explained, its
people use routes through Pakistan while going in and out, but he
assured that Pakistan would not allow export of terrorism through
this conduit and stands for the elimination of any terrorism
sprouting from the soil of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
As Pakistan is directly affected, he said, "We want stability
in Afghanistan because it is its instability which affects us."
</P>
<P>
About the recent trip and talks of U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi
with Pakistani and Afghan leaders, Sharif said the talks have been
very useful and constructive and "it is a very positive sign."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been playing a positive role in Afghanistan for
the last many, many years, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the impact of U.S. sanctions on Pakistan's economy,
Sharif said that the U.S. sanctions have been unjust and unfair
because Pakistan had been forced to go for nuclear detonation as a
response to the Indian nuclear blasts.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is not to be blamed for this but its security concern
had forced Pakistan to do it, he said, adding that India wanted to
teach Pakistan a lesson and wanted to bring Pakistan to its knees.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the sanctions against Pakistan would have to be
removed. He said he brought home Pakistan's viewpoint to U.S.
President Bill Clinton during his meeting with him in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He hoped there is some progress going on in that direction and
the U.S. Congress has approved waiver to the president to lift the
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Welcomes Palestinian-Israeli Interim Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Algeria on Monday welcomed the
new Israeli-Palestinian interim deal, saying it "constitutes a
step in the direction aspired by all those seeking comprehensive,
just and lasting peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Aziz Saba told a press
conference that "Algeria firmly adheres to such kind of
settlement."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed the importance of making good on the signed
agreement, saying only "its implementation on the ground will
demonstrate the ability of the Wye Plantation accord to actually
revive the peace process."
</P>
<P>
After nine days of marathon negotiations under U.S. mediation,
Israel and the Palestinians eventually reached a deal last Friday
on a 13 percent israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in exchange
of concrete Palestinian measures against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian spokesman criticized Israeli government for
"retreating from all signed commitments" which had brought the
Mideast peace process to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
He said the peace process would not have true significance
unless it ensures international legitimacy and guarantees the
inalienable rights of the Palestinian people as well as Israeli
withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
He added that it goes without saying that a peace process that
disregards the Golan Heights and south Lebanon, all under Israeli
occupation, can not possibly serve the cause of a comprehensive,
just and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat paid a short visit to
Algeria Sunday, briefing President Liamine Zeroual on the details
of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement.

<HEADLINE> Fatigued Yeltsin Cancels Trip to Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has cancelled a planned trip to Austria at the insistence of his
doctors, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Yeltsin was suffering from "serious
fatigue" and his doctors recommended he cancel the visit,
scheduled for Tuesday, and take a holiday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will instead go to Austria,
which now holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, to
attend the Russia-EU summit on behalf of Yeltsin, Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, suffered from a cold and bronchitis earlier this
month, forcing him to cut short a visit to Kazakhstan by one day.
</P>
<P>
He suffered two heart attacks in 1996 in the wake of the June
16 presidential election and had quintuple heart bypass surgery in
November that year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Yakushkin told reporters that Yeltsin had recovered
from the cold and his health was good for a man of his age.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's perceived poor health has prompted many rumors about
his ability to serve out his full term till 2000.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside his doctors' advice, Yeltsin went ahead with
meetings at the Kremlin with senior aides several times in the
past two weeks, in an attempt to show the world that he was still
fit.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Yakushkin as saying that
"recent bronchitis combined with violations of doctors'
prescriptions and overwork resulted in the development of an
asthenia condition" which manifested itself in "unstable blood
pressure and undue fatigue."
</P>
<P>
As Russian television broadcast footage of Yeltsin nearly
losing his footing at a ceremony during a recent trip to
Uzbekistan, his political opponents and other presidential
hopefuls renewed their questions on Yeltsin's fitness to serve as
head of state and supreme commander of the Russian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Even Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, formerly a staunch supporter of
Yeltsin and a strong contender for the presidency, joined the
chorus, saying Yeltsin should step down for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Such talk was hurtful to Yeltsin, his spokesman said last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is talking about the president's health," he said, "I
think the president feels hurt when the people he has been working
with and is still working with are discussing the subject."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin "has set very strict standards for himself," Yakushkin
said. "He has a clear goal, which is to complete his presidential
term and leave in 2000."
</P>
<P>
The President "is evidently strong and willing to fight against
any type of illness", said Yakushkin.
</P>
<P>
"That is why he keeps travelling despite objections from his
doctors," the spokesman added.

</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two newspapers will jointly print and

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier, Finnish Prime Minister Meet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, in
a meeting with Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen here this
afternoon, said that China is ready to make a concerted effort
with Finland to promote bilateral cooperation in the fields of
politics, economy, trade, science, technology, culture and
education.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers discussed bilateral ties and other
issues of common interest, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry
sources.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that Sino-Finnish relations are very good and that
bilateral cooperation in various fields has progressed smoothly
and there have been constant high-level exchanges between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Lipponen's visit will further the
development of bilateral friendship and cooperation and that he
appreciates the "one China" policy of the Finnish government.
</P>
<P>
As long as the two countries abide by the principles of mutual
respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and of
equality and mutual benefit, the Sino-Finnish friendship and
cooperation will bear more fruits, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, there have been good developments in
relations between China and the European Union (EU), Zhu said,
pointing to a joint statement signed earlier this year on a
long-term, stable and constructive partnership oriented toward the
21st century. He said that the EU passed a new China policy and
the second meeting of Chinese and EU leaders will be held next
year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China places importance on the EU's role in
international affairs, and when the world is accelerating its pace
toward multi-polarization and economic globalization, the
strengthening of Sino-European cooperation is conducive to
Asian-European cooperation and world peace and stability.

<P>
Lipponen pointed to the nearly 50 years of diplomatic ties
between Finland and China and said that bilateral relations have
developed well, and when China started its reforms and opening-up

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Predicts Economic Recovery for Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said here Monday that he
expected recovery in Hong Kong's economy in the second half of
next year.
</P>
<P>
Flemming Larsen, deputy director of Research of the IMF, told a
news conference in Hong Kong that the crisis in Asia "will begin
to bottom out in the next three to six months and next year we
expect the recovery to begin."
</P>
<P>
It was possible that Asia could start to emerge from the
financial crisis before other parts of the world, Larsen said,
adding that the recoveries in Asia "will be critical in allowing
Hong Kong to begin to recover."
</P>
<P>
Larsen praised Hong Kong's defense of its currency link with
the U.S. dollar and expressed "understanding of the government's
market intervention."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government has "played an important role in
stabilizing the region by maintaining the peg (linked exchange
rate) with the U.S. dollar," he said, adding that abandoning the
peg would not have been in Hong Kong's interests.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong had suffered pain in maintaining the peg.
</P>
<P>
"We do not see anything inherently wrong in government agencies
investing some of their resources in local equities. In other
economies around the world it is far from unusual that government
funds be invested in a country's own enterprises," the official
commented.

<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-European Seminar on
Women's Issues, sponsored by the All-China Women's Federation
(ACWF) and the European Union, opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 15 European countries and 60 Chinese delegates
came to discuss protecting womens' rights, benefits for poor
women, women's education, and women in economic development, in
politics, and in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
As a result of improved relations between China and European
countries, exchanges and cooperation between Chinese and European
women have grown, according to Shen Shuji, vice-president of the
ACWF.
</P>
<P>
Violence and the maltreatment on women, which are a serious
violation of human rights, will be one of the major topics at the
seminar, said Daniela Napoli, director of the Human Rights and
Democracy Department of the EU.
</P>
<P>
She said that the EU has encouraged member countries to pass
laws prohibiting violence against women and to provide special
training on aiding female victims of violence to legal workers and
the police, and non-government organizations can play an important
role in fighting violence.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF is the largest women's organization in China to
protect women's rights and interests, and promote gender
equality. It has more than 800,000 grass-roots units and 80,000

<HEADLINE> Hamas Members Arrested, Palestinians Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- In a tightening crackdown on
the Islamic militant group Hamas, Palestinian security forces have
arrested three of its members after they refused to promise not
to carry out terror attacks, Israel Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the Israeli-Palestinian talks at the
Wye Plantation in Maryland, the United States, 50 Hamas members
had signed guarantees not to conduct terror attacks, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
The talks began on October 15 and resulted in a land-for-peace
deal which was signed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat at the White House last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the interim peace agreement, Israel will pullback its
troops from another 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
specific Palestinian security measures, including arresting
alleged terrorists and confiscating weapons.
</P>
<P>
Several Hamas activists including at least two leading members
have been arrested by Palestinian security forces in Gaza and the
West Bank since the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians staged a general strike Monday in the
West Bank city of Ramallah in protest of the killing of a
Palestinian youth by PNA security forces Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Wasim Yousef Tarifi, a supporter of Arafat's
Fatah movement, was killed in clashes between the security forces
and Fatah members in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted when hundreds of Fatah members were
staging a demonstration to protest a raid on their offices late
Saturday night by PNA police and military intelligence who were
trying to collect unregistered weapons. Two people were wounded
in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said Fatah members staged a protest again
Monday in Ramallah, demanding that the killer be put on trial.

WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO's top two generals left Belgrade with assurances that
Yugoslavia would withdraw enough of its forces from Kosovo by a
Tuesday deadline to avoid punitive air strikes, Western diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Senate intelligence committee Chairman Richard C.
Shelby on Sunday described as "troubling" the Clinton
administration's plan to use the Central Intelligence Agency to
monitor anti-terrorism efforts in the Middle East and said his
committee would hold hearings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
-- Forty-eight hours after he shook Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's hand in the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu dispensed with the soaring rhetoric of peace and
reconciliation Sunday, describing the U.S.-brokered Middle East
accord as painful for Israel and the best that could be achieved
under bad circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Friday's accord between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders
angered hard-liners among their constituents. Israeli settlers
blocked roads throughout the West Bank, and members of Yasser
Arafat's own Fatah faction clashed with Palestinian police over
moves to confiscate arms. U.S. President Bill Clinton will have
to fight his own battle with Congress for funds to meet U.S.
commitments that helped push the talks.

<HEADLINE> World's First Encyclopedia of Chinese Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The world's first
Encyclopedia of the Chinese Overseas, compiled and published by
Singapore's Chinese Heritage Center, was launched by Singapore
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Goh Chok Tong said the publication of
the Encyclopedia by the Chinese Heritage in Singapore is a
"commendable, pioneering effort."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Ethnic Chinese are perhaps the most widespread
racial group in the world and they live in more than 135 different
countries, the Prime Minister said the publication of the tome is
a scholarly contribution to the literature on the "Chinese
Diaspora.."
</P>
<P>
"The encyclopedia will help us to understand the lives and
contributions of the Chinese overseas, a community liked by common
ancestry but separated by geography, nationality and social
environment," Goh Chok Tong added.
</P>
<P>
The tome, that documents the diaspora of the Chinese, was
edited by well-known writer Lynn Pan who based her work on
articles contributed by more than 50 writers across the world. The
Chinese version, which contains more than 400,000 Chinese
characters and more than 1,000 photos, was translated by the
Center's researcher fellow Choi Kwoi Keong who was dean of the
department of history of the former Nanyang University.
</P>
<P>
The volume, characteristic of being readable so it could reach
to public ordinary readers, tells the story of the evolution of
the overseas Chinese from segregation to integration after they
had moved to reside in foreign lands from China. A large part of
the book is devoted to telling how overseas Chinese encountered a
lot of adjustments in an alien environment and suffered a lot of
local prejudice.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Chinese Heritage Center Wee Cho Yew, who is
also chairman of the United Overseas Bank, the second largest in
Singapore, has bestowed high praise to the tome, saying "It is
good for the young people to know their roots... They should know
the good life today is only possible because of the struggles of
their forefathers."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Heritage Center, located on the campus of the
Nanyang Technical University , was founded by the Singapore
Federation of Chinese Clan Associations in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Forbid Foreign Trips for Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has cancelled a planned trip to Austria at the insistence of his
doctors, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Yeltsin was suffering from "serious
fatigue."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday will go to Austria,
which now holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, on
behalf of Yeltsin for the Russia-EU summit, Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, suffered from a cold and bronchitis earlier this
month, forcing him to cut short a visit to Kazakhstan by one day.
</P>
<P>
He suffered two heart attacks in 1996 in the wake of the June
16 presidential election and had a quintuple heart bypass surgery
in November that year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Yakushkin told reporters that Yeltsin had recovered
from the cold and his health was good for a man of his age.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's perceived poor health has prompted many rumors about
his ability to serve out his full term till the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside his doctors' advice, Yeltsin went ahead with
meetings at the Kremlin with senior aides several times in the
past two weeks, in an attempt to show the world that he was still
fit.
</P>
<P>
As Russian television broadcast footage of Yeltsin nearly
losing his footing at a ceremony during his trip to Uzbekistan
just days ago, his political opponents and other presidential
hopefuls renewed their questions on Yeltsin's fitness to serve as
head of state and supreme commander of the Russian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Even Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, formerly a staunch supporter of
Yeltsin and a strong contender for the presidency, joined the
chorus, saying Yeltsin should step down for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Such talk of his health was hurtful to Yeltsin, Dmitry
Yakushkin said last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is talking about the president's health," the
presidential spokesman said. "I think the president feels hurt
when the people he has been working with and is still working with
are discussing the subject."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin "has set very strict standards for himself," Yakushkin
said. "He has a clear goal, which is to complete his presidential
term and leave in 2000."
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said Yeltsin "is evidently strong and willing to
fight against any type of illness."
</P>
<P>
"That is why he keeps traveling despite objections from his
doctors," Yakushkin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Forouq
al-Sharaa said here on Monday that normalization of ties
between Damascus and Ankara should result in the settlement of
all disputes between them.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa made the remark at the end of his two-day visit here,
the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He termed his talks with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi
as "positive and constructive," saying that the recent crisis
between Damascus and Ankara was the main topic in his talks with
senior Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that Syria and Turkey have reached consensus on
security issues, for which he thanked the mediation efforts by
Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
Damascus and Ankara signed an agreement after Kharrazi paid a
mediation visit to Syria and Turkey to defuse the tensions between
the two neighbors over the issue of Turkey's Kurdish rebels, who
have been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey accused Syria of supporting the separatist Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) and warned to wipe out the PKK bases in
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Seeing off al-Sharaa, Kharrazi expressed the hope that through
continuation of bilateral talks, issues between the two sides will
be settled.
</P>
<P>
He said that given the deep-rooted close relations between
Iran and Syria, the two sides should make consultations on
various issues whenever necessary.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over Israeli policies, Kharrazi said
Israel's hegemonic policies is a cause of concern not only for
Iran and Syria, but for all regional countries.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister arrived here Sunday afternoon to
deliver a message from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Condemns Riot Acts by Ethnic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
condemned the renewed hostilities between the Ijaws and
Itsekiris, two ethnic groups in Warri, southern Nigeria, saying
it will no longer tolerate any act of lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
Rear Admiral Ibrahim Ogohi, member of the Provisional Ruling
Council (PRC), condemned the spate of arson in the area during
his visit to assess the extent of damage in the mayhem which is
going on in the oil-rich communities, the Post Express reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ogohi who is the flag officer commanding West Naval Command
appealed to the youth now holding on to some oil installations in
the area to vacate them and give peace a chance in their own
interest.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that there was an exchange of fire between the
Ijaw youths and security forces during the crisis, adding that
the Ijaw youths were overpowered by security forces.
</P>
<P>
Ode-Itsekiri, the ancestral home of Itsekiri, and the
alternate palace of the Olu of Warri, were reportedly razed at
the weekend as the Ijaw/Itsekiri conflict escalated.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaws were also said to have sacked the divisional police
stations at Burutu and Bomadi government areas and taken all the
policemen hostage.
</P>
<P>
An all embracing meeting of Ijaw and Itsekiri opinion leaders
is to be held Monday to broker peace between the two ethnic in
Warri.
</P>
<P>
Issues concerning the seized flow stations and oil
installations which are still being held by irate Ijaw youths
will also be tabled at the meeting for discussion, according to
chief press secretary of Delta State Administrator.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was described as the first major step taken by the
state government to defuse the tension in the Warri area as a
curfew was imposed on the three Warri local councils and the
alleged shot-at-sight order was issued by military authorities
last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Agree Not to Use Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
have announced that landmines will not be planted in the areas of
Afghanistan which are under their control.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued from the Taliban's Headquarters said that
the Taliban will remain stick to the treaty concluded last
December in the Canadian city of Ottawa which suggests a complete
ban on the use of landmines, the Associated Press of Pakistan
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Taliban have advised its opponents
also to avoid using landmines.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Taliban's decision to impose ban on the use of
landmines is a unilateral one at present no matter whether the
opposition imposes a ban or not.
</P>
<P>
Although, more than 10 years have elapsed after the pull-out of
the former Soviet forces from Afghanistan, yet thousands of
landmines planted by them are still present in the entire
Afghanistan. Hundreds of people become victims of these landmines
every year.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Winder, who heads a "Save The Children" program being
launched in Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that he was very much
pleased by the statement of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
He said his organization "Save The Children" first of all has
launched a campaign to get landmines banned in Afghanistan. Hence
it is a matter of pleasure that the Taliban have agreed to impose
a complete ban on the production, distribution and use of
landmines.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban appealed in the statement to all those countries
who have not yet signed the Ottawa agreement to immediately sign
it. They have also appealed stopping the supply of landmines to
rival factions in Afghanistan.

central African country.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the participants to work out a mechanism
that can facilitate the withdrawal of foreign forces from the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
Africa should "strive to emerge with a mechanism that will
pave the way for the withdrawal of foreign forces form the DRC
and to establish a follow-up mechanism that will assist the
government of DRC to promote a national dialog for a new
political dispensation," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
More and more African countries have been involved in the DRC
war since it began last August. Some members of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) such as Zimbabwe, Namibia
and Angola have sent thousands of their troops to assist DRC
President Laurent Kabila to fight against the rebels, who now
hold most part of the northeast DRC.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the OAU secretary general also warned that if
the confrontation is allowed to continue and escalate, it will
take Africa to "uncharted terrain" whose consequences are too
"ghastly" to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of the war, said Salim, will "jeopardize if
not diminish our efforts to find African solutions to African
problems."
</P>
<P>
Salim noted sadly that the crisis in the DRC has brought
immense suffering to the people there and had negative impact on
peace and stability in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
However, it was very frustrating to observe that so far there
has not been any sign of progress that is commensurate with the
efforts the African countries have made to end the war, he said
with regret.
</P>
<P>
The warring sides in the DRC are still fighting intensively
although in the past two months regional leaders in southern
African have met and put up various initiatives including a
proposed truce to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Besides the OAU chief, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for
Political Affairs, Ibrahima Fall, SADC Executive Secretary Kaire
Mbuende as well as defense and foreign ministers from at least 14
African countries including Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Uganda and
Rwanda attended the meeting that was officially opened by Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese rebels who arrived Sunday in Lusaka were refused
to enter the venue of the meeting as happened last September when
a regional summit held at Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls Town to find
a solutio to the Congo crisis.
</P>
<P>
A closed-door meeting went on following the openin ceremony.

<HEADLINE> S. African Wholesale Firm to Enter Uganda Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- South African wholesale giant
Metro Cash and Carry is expected to launch its first outlet in
Uganda in November, supplying a variety of goods ranging from
groceries to electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
The newcomer plans to invest some 12 to 15 million U.S.
Dollars in the next three years, according to a report of the
latest East African weekly.
</P>
<P>
The outlet, to be situated in Kampala, will intensify
competition for the local market.
</P>
<P>
The pouring in of South African goods in the region is
worrying Kenyan manufacturers whose dominance of the region is
declining. Kenya has been Uganda's leading traditional trading
partner although it has favorable balance, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Land-locked Uganda reportedly imports from Kenya many consumer
goods including tooth-paste, shoe polish, margarine, detergents,
toilet soap, sanitary ware and motor vehicle windscreens. It
mainly exports cereals, fruits and grains.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Uganda imported goods worth 303 million Dollars from
Kenya but exported goods worth only 7.7 million Dollars in
return.
</P>
<P>
South African products are considered good and affordable in
the east African market and trade imbalance to be caused by the
coming of South African firm constitutes the main worry for
exporters in neighboring countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The recently created Boma
Court inside the Kirinya prison in Jinja, some 80 km east of
Ugandan capital Kampala, has committed 192 rebel suspects of the
West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) to the High Court for trial soon.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, some as young as 12 years of age, are charged
with treason and misprison of treason. The offenses can carry a
maximum of death penalty on conviction, the New Vision paper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
These suspects were transferred to Jinja from the West Nile
region and southern Sudan where they were reportedly arrested in
1995/1996.
</P>
<P>
They are alleged to have attacked Moyo and Arua districts in
the region and killed civilians and destroyed infrastructure with
the aim of weakening national defense.
</P>
<P>
Christine Kania, the Jinja chief magistrate, was quoted as
saying that the suspects will be transferred to Arua, in
northwest Uganda, for trial since it is there that they allegedly
committed their offenses.
</P>
<P>
According to the 33rd section of the Magistrates Courts, every
case must be tried where the offense is committed, she added.
</P>
<P>
The WNBF rebel force has been virtually wiped out following
the arrest of its top commanders in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Defense Budget Unchanged over 4 Years: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has said that it's defense
budget has remained unchanged over the past four years and
actually had a drop if taking the inflation into account.
</P>
<P>
Keyvan Khosravi, press advisor to the Iranian defense minister,
said on Sunday in an interview with the official news agency IRNA
released on Monday that Iran's defense spending is driven by needs.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has been able to maintain a proper defensive
capability in spite of the low spending in the sector thanks in
part to the country's reliance on domestic resources for its
defense needs.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting reports by some foreign media which claimed a 20
percent increase in Iran's defense budget, Khosravi said that
"undoubtedly, Iran has the lowest defense budget among Middle
East countries."
</P>
<P>
The official did not mention the figure of defense budget in
the current Iranian year (starting from March 21). But according
to the budget approved by the Iranian Majlis (Parliament) in
March, this year's defense budget stands at 2.89 trillion rials
(1.65 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Khosravi also refuted the recent remarks by a U.S. naval
commander on Iran's capability to build nuclear weapons, saying
that the International Atomic Energy Agency has consistently
confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
the official said, adding that based on its convictions, Iran
regards as inhuman the development of nuclear energy for
non-peaceful purposes.

<HEADLINE> FIVB to Propose New Scoring System for Sydney Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Volleyball
Federation (FIVB) said Monday it would propose to its general
congress this week a new scoring system which would be in force
for the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The main change will be that teams score points at each rally
in the style of current tie-breaks, not only when a team has
served, the FIVB said.
</P>
<P>
Matches will be played in the best of five sets style with 25
points for the first four sets and 15 points for the fifth set.
</P>
<P>
If the FIVB board of administration accepts the proposal
Tuesday, the delegates of the 217 affiliated national federations
will be asked to approve the new scoring system.
</P>
<P>
"Volleyball has to evolve to meet the requirement of an
ever-demanding public," said FIVB president Ruben Acosta.
</P>
<P>
"This rally point system has been successfully tested in the
Brazilian league and at the recent America Cup held in Argentina,
with a very positive acceptance by the spectators.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese volleyball association has also proposed to
adopt immediately this running score system which features a more
interesting and thrilling game and this is what we want -- to
keep the public on the edge of their seats," added Acosta.
</P>
<P>
The congress will be held on Wednesday before the world
championships which get under way November 3 in several Japanese
cities.

<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A regulation from China's
Supreme People's Procuratorates (SPP) today will put prosecutors
under public scrutiny to try to keep them from abusing their
power.
</P>
<P>
The regulation details rights and responsibilities of litigants
and the time limits of different stages of an investigation to
make prosecutorial work known to the public, except for
investigations kept secret as decided by law, according to Zhang
Qiong, deputy procuratorate-general of the SPP.
</P>
<P>
The regulation says when procuratorates are authorized to
investigate. These include 12 crimes of graft and 34 crimes of
dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
It also has criteria for cases that should be brought to court
in felonies like bribery, embezzlement and dereliction of duty and
says that beatings, abuse of suspects, and forced confessions are
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
Suspects have 12 kinds of rights like the right to refuse to
answer questions that are irrelevant to the case and to check the
interrogation notes.
</P>
<P>
The public should know about how to report crimes and to
appeal. The procuratorates will publish booklets to make the
regulations known to the public to eliminate corruption following
the recent impeachment reforms, Zhang said.

TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has shut down 55 polluting
industrial units in Tehran province during the first six months of
the current Iranian year (starting from March 21), the official
news agency IRNA reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Organization (EPO) announced on
Sunday that the industrial units were closed down due to their
failure to obey the environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
The EPO announcement said that 35 units were located in the
city of Tehran and the rest in the suburbs. But it gave no more
information.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts repeatedly warned that the Iranian
capital Tehran is facing "extremely dangerous air pollution,"
urging the government to take more serious measures than before
to control pollution in the city.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that due to its natural and geographical
location, Tehran faces the phenomena of inversion and the
accumulation of various pollutants in the air for 240 days every
year.
</P>
<P>
However, reports said that the most important source for
increasing pollution in Tehran is the emission from dilapidated
motorized vehicles and improper combustion of fuel in those
vehicles.

<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-one new cases of HIV/AIDS
were reported from July to September in the Philippines, bringing
to 1,130 the number of people infected with the disease since the
first case was reported in the country in January, 1984.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health said Monday that all the cases were
infected through sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
Sex is the predominant mode of how the AIDS (acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome) virus is being transmitted in the
country, particularly heterosex.
</P>
<P>
Of the new HIV/AIDS cases, the department said, 11 were
reported in July that include two AIDS cases; six in August, all
of which are HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) positives; and 14
in September including seven AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
Of the total figure, 13 are females while 18 are males, and age
range of the new infections is from five to 58-year old, it said.
</P>
<P>
The department said that five deaths were reported in August,
which brought to 184 the total number of people who succumbed to
AIDS in the country since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Alberto G. Romualdez described the country's
AIDS picture as in smoldering pattern, no ups no downs.

<HEADLINE> One Third of Timber Markets Shut Down in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Municipality on the
upper reaches of Yangtze River has shut down 26 timber markets
since the city announced to ban logging of natural forests in
early September.
</P>
<P>
The number is almost one third of the city's total timber
markets, and most of the closed markets, with a combined timber
trading volume of 200,000 cu m, are "black markets" without any
approval, said a local official.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the timber markets shut down are situated in
natural forest zones along the Yangtze and its tributaries, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
This summer's serious flooding on the Yangtze, and on Songhua
and Nenjiang rivers in northeast China, has helped increase
Chinese people's awareness of ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore of vital significance for Chongqing, also the
hinterland area of the Three Gorges Dam reservoir, to do a good
job of water and soil conservation, the official went on.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, with a forest cover rate of 21 percent, has 1.13
million hectares of natural forests and is considered as one of
the areas deficient in forest resources in China.
</P>
<P>
The city has 72 timber trading markets where about 30 million
cu m of timber are traded annually because of its geographic
position being the center of southwest China's waterway and land
transport.

<HEADLINE> AIDS to Cut S. African Population: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- South African population
will be slashed by eight percent by 2010 due to the rampancy of
AIDS in the country.
</P>
<P>
Daily newspaper Sowetan Monday quoted Janina Slawski of
Southern Life, a risk management consultancy, as saying that the
epidemic will peak between 2005 and 2010.
</P>
<P>
The agency estimated that during that period, about six
million South African people will be infected with AIDS virus
while a further 600,000 will develop full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The virus, according to the 1997-98 survey released by the
South African Institute of Race Relations, will have the greatest
effect on the 30 to 40-year age group and will multiply the
national mortality rate by five or six times.
</P>
<P>
Up to one third of children born to mothers infected with HIV
will be infected at birth, while more will become infected
through breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
Slawski said AIDS could slash the average life expectancy in
South Africa from 62 to 40 years by 2010. In addition, it could
reduce the rise in gross domestic product by about two percentage

<HEADLINE> 1.8 Million-Year-Old Tooth Fossil Found in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have
found an important tooth fossil of early hominids dating back 1.8
million years in the Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The fossil, a lower right fourth pre-molar tooth believed to
belong to a group of early hominids (australopithecins) known as
paranthropus, was found in August after a two-month excavation by
experts from Tanzania and the United States, local newspaper
Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The site is close to where Dr Louis Leakey and his wife
stunned the world with the discovery of a 1.75 million-year old
Zinjathropous skull of man's ancestor in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The fossil, described as OH 66, has been taken to the Olduvai
Landscape Archaeology Project (OLAP) facilities at the Arusha
Natural History Museum for cleaning, moulding and casting for
further studies.
</P>
<P>
Fidelis Masao, the co-director of OLAP, was quoted as saying
here at the weekend that the new find was an important specimen
to come from Olduvai in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Initially we thought it belonged to a homohabilis. But this
has now been corrected by our specialists who say it really
belonged to paranthropus, a robust group of early hominids," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Masao, a former senior lecturer in archaeology at the
University of Dar es Salaam, said the new find was an important
breakthrough because it was found in the oldest geological
sequence of the world-famous gorge.
</P>
<P>
Recent major discoveries at the gorge, about 30 kilometers
west of the Ngorongoro Crater in the Arusha Region, include OH 65
fragmented skulls and jaws of homohabilis sensulato found at
Nasiusiu on the western side of the gorge in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1989 other fossils, which included a skull of
australopithecus boisei or nutcracker man, were found in the
vicinity of the gorge at the onset of OLAP activities. They were
described as OH 64.
</P>
<P>
The OLAP co-director said the new discoveries dispute the
argument that the Olduvai Gorge, which has been a focus of
archaeological investigations and excavations since 1911, has
been exhaustively researched.
</P>
<P>
"This is far from true because so far OLAP has already found
three important hominid specimens -- OH 64, OH 65 and OH 66,"
Masao concluded.

<HEADLINE> China's Currency Stable Because Of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China's decision not to devalue
the yuan was decided by current economic realities, especially the
favorable balance of payments, Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng
said recently.
</P>
<P>
It is, he said, by no means a political commitment and
explained that economists say that devaluation only occurs when
there is an unfavorable balance of payments or when foreign
exchange reserves are insufficient to regulate deficit capital
accounts, and China is in neither situation.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoling, director of the State Foreign Exchange
Administration, said that China still has a surplus of both
current and capital accounts and has a solid economic foundation
for a stable yuan exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
From January to September, China's foreign trade surplus
amounted to 35.3 billion U.S. dollars and the actually used direct
foreign investment amounted to 31.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, foreign exchange reserves amounted to
141.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
All the economic indicators in the third quarter suggest that
the government's policy of creating demand by increasing spending
on infrastructure is working.
</P>
<P>
China also has the ability to prevent financial risks, because
the yuan can only be exchanged under the current accounts and
capital accounts exchanges are strictly controlled and devaluing
the yuan would possibly lead to inflation and harm foreign
investors' confidence in Chinas, as well as triggering another
round of devaluation of currencies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that in the fourth quarter, China will have
higher economic growth and this trend may continue into next
year.

GUANGZHOU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in Guangzhou,
the capital of the Chinese province of Guangdong, announced the
discovery of a group of fossilized dinosaur eggs in the central
part of the city.
</P>
<P>
They unearthed the fossilized eggs in a 200-sq.m. area under an
ancient ditch along Zhongshan Road in downtown Guangzhou,
according to Sunday's Yangcheng Evening News.
</P>
<P>
In addition to common elliptic shape, some of the eggs are in
the shape of a spindle with one end pointed, a rare find.
</P>
<P>
What fascinates the scientists is a number of small round eggs
only five centimeters in length and four centimeters in diameter,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say the find will give them important materials
for geological, seismological and paleontological studies.

<HEADLINE> Poor Quality Products May Hurt Healthy Growth Of China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Shoddy and poor quality
products may affect the healthy growth of China's economy,
according to Zhu Mingxian, Deputy Director of the State Bureau of
Quality and Technology Supervision.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told the press recently that fake and poor quality products
have affected people's consumer desire. Domestic consumption is
restricted mainly by two factors, he said, one is increasing
unemployment, the other is the large number of fake and poor
quality products in the markets.
</P>
<P>
These bad products destroy people's confidence, he pointed out,
emphasizing that the destructive price-cutting now common in
China's markets must come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
"We'll take measures to stop the price-cutting to create a fair
competitive environment for enterprises," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Rational market competition must mainly focused on competitive
quality, service, and reputation, he said. The price-cutting does
no good to either producers or consumers because when prices are
cut, the quality is also lowered.
</P>
<P>
The worsening price situation has caused a lot of concern in
society, and has become an urgent problem that needs to be solved
to ensure the sound operation of the economy.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Leaders to Ratify Conflict Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming west African
summit is expected to ratify a draft mechanism for the prevention
of further conflicts in the sub-region, The Post Express reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Adrienne Diop, the Director of Information of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), disclosed in Nigerian
capital Abuja that ECOWAS leaders would adopt the right of the
neighbors to intervene in the internal crisis of other states.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the illegality of one country intervening in
conflicts in other sovereign countries had been the problem in
the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Diop stressed that no country is isolated because what happens
in a country would result in influx of refugees into its
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this region has to do something in the cases of
overthrow of legitimately elected governments or attempts to
overthrow," she added.
</P>
<P>
By setting up the draft mechanism, Diop said, "all problems
would be solved through ECOWAS," adding that the 16-member
regional body is able to really deal with conflicts in its member
country so that the conflicts would not move to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed Gbadamosi, Chairman of the ECOWAS Council of
Ministers, said Saturday in Abuja that ECOWAS would appoint a
deputy executive secretary in charge of political and military
affairs in order to work out modalities for conflict resolution,
prevention, management and peace-keeping initiative within the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Gbadamosi who is also Nigerian Minister of National Planning
said that the new mechanism would replace the ad-hoc arrangement
that provided the basis for ECOWAS intervention in Liberia and
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Diop also disclosed that 23-year-old ECOWAS and the Economic
and Monetary Union of West Africa (UEMOA) may be merged to speed
up the economic and political integration of the west African
region.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Science Park to Open in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Demonstrating the
determination of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government in providing a favorable environment to local
scientific and technological development, the first phase of the
Hong Kong Science Park project has been set to open in 2001, a
leading SAR government official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Executive Council of the SAR accepted
the recommendations of a planning committee special set up on the
Park as the broad planning basis upon which the Park should be
taken forward.
</P>
<P>
A site of 22 hectares at the Pak Shek Kok Reclamation Area in
Sha Tin had been earmarked for the three-phase development project
of the Park. With a capital cost estimated at 3.33 billion HK
dollars (0.43 billion U.S. dollars), Phase One of the project is
targeted to open in the second half of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The overall project is to be completed in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon talk on the future of the Science Park
here Monday, Director-General of Industry Francis Ho said that
the Park aims at attracting to Hong Kong new technology-based
firms and activities; stimulating locally owned technologically
advanced business; supporting the development, transfer and use of
advanced technologies in Hong Kong; enhancing the role of Hong
Kong as a value-added international entrepot for technology
transfer; facilitating technology transfer; and providing suitable
land and premises to the research and development of local and
international high technology firms and activities.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has given full support to local scientific
and technological research projects either by individuals or
organizations and it has insisted that the Science Park should
provide a favorable environment to such activities, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
As the Park project estimate is worked out on the basis of
certain assumptions and the best information available, it may
need to be adjusted in the light of actual experience, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
With a solid economic foundation and a bright prospects for
property industry, Sha Tin will set up an example for and be a
miniature of the SAR as Hong Kong's economy is expected to undergo
a process of profound and diversified development within 10 years,
Ho predicted.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales in Hong Kong Drops in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The value of total retail
sales in Hong Kong in August 1998, estimated at 16.5 billion HK
dollars (2.1 billion U.S. dollars), decreased by 20 percent
compared with August 1997.
</P>
<P>
These figures were released by the Census and Statistics
Department of Hong Kong Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, total volume of retail sales for
August also declined by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by type of retail outlets and on a year-on-year
comparison, sales of motor vehicles declined the most, by 49
percent in value or 45 percent in volume in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by sales of clothing and footwear;
commodities in department stores; jewelry, watches and clocks, and
valuable gifts; miscellaneous consumer goods; fuels; consumer
durable goods other than motor vehicles; and food, alcoholic
drinks and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, sales of commodities in supermarkets (excluding
supermarket sections of department stores) increased by 4 percent
in value, but decreased moderately by 2 percent in volume.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman noted that retail business
suffered a continued distinct setback in August 1998, as local
consumer spending plunged sharply further amidst slackened income
and higher unemployment. The negative wealth effect stemming from
the dip in asset prices that month also dampened consumer
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Yet sales of basic necessities such as foodstuffs and
commodities in supermarkets still showed a decelerated decline in
August, compared with that in July, the spokesman said.

<P>
Sheng made the point when delivering his maiden speech after
taking office as the chief of the regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
"It goes without saying that my first priority is ensure that
the securities regulatory framework will fit and facilitate Hong
Kong's continuing status as a modern, efficient and competitive
international financial center," he told a luncheon organized by
the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the SFC will work with the financial
community, the government, the legislature, academia and its
overseas counterparts in order to achieve this objective.
</P>
<P>
On the legislation front, Sheng admitted, the existing
Securities Ordinance, already 25 years old, is "somewhat
obsolete," while the Securities Composite Bill was five years in
the drafting and remains basically a consolidation of past
legislation.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that an expert group will be formed to look at
legislation in two of the most vibrant markets in the world -- the
United States and the United Kingdom, to see how to strengthen the
legal framework in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In his speech entitled "Hong Kong and Global Markets: Back to
Basics," Sheng noted several trends in the development of
securities markets: the markets are moving into global, 24-hour
trading, the development is high-tech driven, and fierce
competition will come through innovation and change.

SHANGHAI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's economic
and financial center, attracted 2.56 billion US dollars during the
January-September period, 28 percent down from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the city's statistics bureau, foreign investors
have tended to invest more in the manufacturing sector and

decrease. But Hong Kong is still Shanghai's biggest investor,
followed by the United States, the Netherlands, Japan and Britain.

<HEADLINE> New Kosovo Accord Reached Over Weekend: Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said on Monday that a new agreement reached between
NATO and Belgrade over the weekend could be a "significant
advance" toward solving the Kosovo crisis if adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival here for a European
Union foreign ministers council meeting, Cook said that the
agreement was reached between two NATO senior officials and
Yugoslav authorities after marathon talks in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate on the detail of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Cook said: "If he (Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic) keeps
to this agreement that is now being proposed then that will
certainly be a significant advance.
</P>
<P>
"But we want to see the evidence first."
</P>
<P>
NATO Military Committee Chairman Klaus Naumann and Supreme
Allied Commander Europe Wesley Clark went to Belgrade on Saturday
and held a 12-hour talk with the Yugoslav military chiefs. Talks
continued on Sunday as well.
</P>
<P>
The two NATO officials are expected to brief NATO
decision-makers on Monday about their mission to Belgrade and the
new agreement before NATO decides what to do after its ultimatum
for air strikes expires on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO activated the order on October 13 for air strikes and then
prolonged on October 16 the ultimatum for 10 more days.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers are scheduled to discuss, among other
topics, issues of Yugoslav compliance with United Nations Security
Council Resolutions, Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe decision to immediately deploy verifiers in Kosovo and NATO
air strike deadline.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers are expected to focus their debate on the
EU contribution toward the overall process for a solution in the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The EU member states are expected to contribute half of the
2,000-member verification mission.
</P>
<P>
European Humanitarian Commissioner Emma Bonino also joined the
foreign ministers to inform them on what more humanitarian efforts
the union could make in Kosovo where winter is fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers are also to discuss the union's role
in the negotiations between the Kosovo ethnic Albanians and
Belgrade authorities concerning the definition of an enhanced
autonomy status for Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
ordered military and police intelligence agencies to validate
reported plans by the extremist Muslim group Abu Sayyaf to bomb an
oil depot in Zamboanga del Sur, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican told a press briefing here
Monday that the government is determined to counter alleged moves
by the Abu Sayyaf to terrorize people in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said Caltex Philippines has closed its depot
in Zamboanga del Sur in the face of threats by suspected Abu
Sayyaf members.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that the Muslim extremist group has been
demanding 100,000 to 300,000 pesos a month in "revolutionary
taxes" from Caltex.
</P>
<P>
The National Power Corp. in Basilan received a similar threat
from suspected Muslim extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
"The Southern Command and other military elements in Mindanao
are taking the necessary measures in order to secure oil depots
and to protect the communities in the area from any security
threats," Barican said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Remains Optimistic About Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it will meet its economic target for this year despite
the recent calamities, including the devastation caused by
super-typhoons Babs and Zeb.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here Monday, presidential
spokesman Jerry Barican said the effects of the two super-typhoons
have already been factored into the computation of economic
projections even before they hit the country in the last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The official was reacting to reports that the Philippines may
go into recession as a result of the damage caused by the two huge
typhoons,
</P>
<P>
"The typhoons caused some damage, but it was not entirely
unexpected. The effects have been foreseen and included in the
government projections," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures taken by the government to prevent
recession, according to Barican, is the move by the Bureau of
Treasury to bring down interest rates on treasury bills from 20
percent in June-July to 13 percent on 91 T-bills.
</P>
<P>
"These T-bills, as we know, are the benchmark of commercial
lending rates," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said that "our exports are up compared to
 Thailand and other countries in the region. Our current account
shows a surplus while the agriculture sector had a big turnaround
from the first two quarters."
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's foreign exchange rate is stabilizing
and is well within a healthy range while "inflation rates are kept
to a single-digit figure, at just a little over 9 percent from
January to September."
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, Barican said, "Initial forecasts for third
quarter growth rates remain positive. We expect the figures for
the third quarter to come in within 45 days from the end of the
quarter in September."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government predicted that the country's gross
domestic product could increase at least 1 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
weaker Monday, as market players await key domestic economic data
which could pave the way for a near term easing of monetary policy
by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
</P>
<P>
After tracking a narrow range in low volume, the local currency
closed in Sydney at 61.77 U.S. cents, down from last Friday's
close of 62.54 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Quarterly inflation figures and wage growth numbers are due
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Wednesday and Thursday
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the inflation data Wednesday to reveal the absence
of significant price pressure in the Australian economy," said
Societe Generale senior economist Glenn Macguire.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the large depreciation of the Australian dollar over
the last 12 months, imported inflation remains constrained by the
competitive domestic pricing environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe the Reserve Bank of Australia might
seriously consider a rate cut at its next board meeting on
November 2.
</P>
<P>
Against the Japanese currency Monday, the Australian dollar
ended at 73.38 yen from 74.34. It closed also at 1.0177 German
marks from 1.0265.

<P>
Addressing a two-day national convention of the Indian Youth

In the changed global economic scenario, governments have come

There is no hope if the state and central governments do not
cut their expenditure, tax reforms are not made, subsidies are not
controlled, public sector units continue to make losses and growth
rate does not increase, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
India should maintain a growth rate of about eight percent per
annum for the next 25 years, curtail government expenditure and
control subsidies if it is to become a key global player in the
next millennium, he said.
</P>

Expressing regret over the poor literacy rate in the country,

GUANGZHOU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A number of foreign
entrepreneurs attending the ongoing 84th China Export Commodities
Fair in Guangzhou said the Asian financial crisis will not affect
their business with China.
</P>
<P>
They said that the stability of exchange rates for the yuan has
boosted their confidence in doing business with China,.
</P>
<P>
"China offers one of the best markets in the world, and my
confidence in the nation is firm," according to Stewart Griffith,
vice-chairman of an American company participating in the fair.
</P>
<P>
China offers an excellent source of products for importers,
according to a European businessman. He added that the stability
of the yuan in spite of the financial crisis in Asia readily
indicates that the Chinese economy is capable of withstanding high
risk.
</P>
<P>
Chinese participants at the fair voiced similar views. Zhang
Jun, a trade representative for the China Huayuan Group, said his
company is engaged in extensive trade talks with new customers
from the Middle East, Africa and South America. He said that
business is brisk in spite of the fact that the majority of the
company's former clients from Southeast Asia are not attending the
fair.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. company which formerly imported products from Southeast
Asia and Europe signed an agreement worth over 30 million U.S.

beginning to show signs of recovery and the number of importers
from related areas has increased somewhere from 20 percent to 70
percent as compared with that in last year.
</P>
<P>
The stability of the yuan has contributed greatly to the
continuing growth in China's foreign trade, according to Sun
Zhenyu, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade competitiveness not only relies on
prices and exchange rates, but more importantly on political and
economic stability, according to Professor Shao Xueyan, deputy
president of the College of International Business and Economics
attached to the Guangdong University of Foreign Studies.
</P>
<P>
Shao's research shows that importers from the United States
regard commodity quality, timely delivery and fund-raising
capacity as well as regional political stability as the most
important indicators of a nation's foreign trade competitiveness.
China leads Asia in all areas, according to Shao.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Higher on Rate Cut Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Speculation of an imminent cut
in interest rates saw the Australian share market move higher
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index rose 19.4 points to 2,563.3, with low
volume seen to be a consequence of buyers awaiting Wednesday's
September quarter inflation figures, which were seen as a key in
rate cut hopes.
</P>
<P>
"Our market was up because of interest rate speculation. There
is plenty of talk and people predicting a rate cut the next time
the Reserve Bank of Australia meet on Melbourne Cup Day (November
3). And of course we have inflation figures later this week and
that might confirm that speculation," Steve Mayne from Macquarie
Nevitts said.
</P>
<P>
"The market was purely up on domestic factors because certainly
the overseas markets are down," he added.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index improved 32.6 points to 4,453.8.
</P>
<P>
Australia's four major banks all finished higher, with the best
performance from Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which was 30
cents higher at 19.30 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank rose 10 cents to 20.35 Australian
dollars, ANZ bank inched up 0.1 cent to 8.98 Australian dollars
and Westpac bank edged up two cents to 9.48 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index was up 9.1 points to 1,048.1, with
resources giant BHP continuing its improvement to finish 24 cents
stronger at 13.24 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index rose 13.6 points to 1,156.4.
</P>
<P>
The price of gold bullion in Sydney closed Monday at 292.60
U.S. dollars an ounce compared to last Friday's close of 292.55
U.S. dollars an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Kicks Off New Railway Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong broke ground for a
30.5-km new railway Monday, which is the biggest infrastructure
project after the completion of the 20-billion-U.S. dollar new
airport core programs in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Monday officiated at the
ground-breaking ceremony symbolizing the startup of the first
phase of West Rail, which is designed to meander across the
western part of the Kowloon Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Involving a total of 64 billion HK dollars (8.2 billion U.S.
dollars), the West Rail (phase one) is the first cross-century
infrastructure project kicked off after the founding of the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) in July 1, 1997, said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
The new railway will provide a swift and comfort means of
transport for residents in the northwest of the "New Territories"
to travel to Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
The West Rail (phase one) is planned to serve 340,000
passengers a day when it is completed in 2003; and the daily
throughput is expected to rise to 500,000 passengers by year 2010,
in consummate with the population growth in the northwest of the
"New Territories".
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary said that the West Rail itself is just
a beginning. The SAR government has decided to commence the
construction of more railway links and underground extension lines
before 2000.
</P>
<P>
"A comprehensive transport system can give an impetus to
economic growth, better people's livelihood and inject vitality
into the whole society. That's why the SAR government has attached
great importance to the development of railway and other
transport-related construction," said the SAR official.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong now operates a 34-km railway known as East Rail,
which began services in 1910 and carries more than 720,000
passengers a day.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams Palestinian-Israeli Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's ruling Socialist Baath
Party has termed the recent peace agreement between Palestinians
and Israel as a deal and called for confronting the "dubious
scheme hostile to the Arab Nation."
</P>
<P>
The Pan-Arab Leadership of the Baath Party held a meeting
Sunday to deliberate the accord signed between Palestinians and
Israel on Friday in the United States, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, an official source said that the
Pan-Arab leadership noted they had anticipated such a result,
calling the agreement a deal.
</P>
<P>
After nine-day's negotiation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed the interim
peace agreement, breaking a 19-month deadlock in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in three months and Palestinians will
step up its efforts against anti-Israeli activities in Palestine
and convene the Palestinian National Council to revoke anti-Israel
clauses in the Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
"This deal was born from womb of dubious attempts that have
pushed the Palestine issue and Arab-Zionist conflict into a
serious turning point, but it is an anticipated result of the old
premises, particularly the so-called Oslo Accord," the Pan-Arab
leadership said.
</P>
<P>
The leadership added that this deal has diverted the
Palestinian issue from central issue in the life of Arabs, and
from an issue of sanctities, rights and destiny into minor and
subsidiary issue of deals and bargaining.
</P>
<P>
"Such dubious acts will weaken and abrogate the liberation
objectives which unify Arabs, Muslims and all liberals of the
world to confront usurpation and aggression," the leadership said.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed official source said the Arab masses, in various
Arab countries, have expressed their adherence to the national
and patriotic principles.

AMMAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The major opposition party in
Jordan, the Islamic Action Front (IAF), Monday played a different
tune from the government, condemning the Palestinian-Israeli peace
agreement signed in Washington last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The IAF rejects and condemns this agreement and considers it
representing an act of aggression against the Palestinian
people, said a statement faxed to Xinhua by the IAF, the largest
political party in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people will pay a heavy price for this
accord in terms of security, unity, the rights of their children
and their right to resist occupation," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
After nine days of negotiations, Palestinian and Israeli
leaders signed the agreement at the White House last Friday, which
broke a 19-month deadlock in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw its troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank and free hundreds of Palestinian
prisoners, while the Palestinian side will step up efforts to
crack down on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Court of Jordan and the government have hailed the
agreement as an important step toward the final status talks
between the Palestinians and Israel and called for a timetable to
implement it.

<HEADLINE> East Africa Studies Power-Sharing Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda,
the three member states of the East African Cooperation (EAC),
are working out a plan to share power supplies from each other.
</P>
<P>
The regional energy interconnectivity plan will enable any EAC
country with an electricity deficit to tap it from a surplus
sister state, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project was first discussed by the EAC energy ministers in
Arusha in July when they resolved to get their technical teams to
work out the details before a full-scale study was carried out.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Energy Minister Richard Kaijuka was quoted as saying
that the project would enable areas of one country without
hydro-electric power to get supplies from the nearest grid across
the border.
</P>
<P>
The project under the auspices of EAC, also seeks to
discourage the use of wood fuel through joint provision of and
promotion of the use of liquified petroleum gas.
</P>
<P>
Among the three countries, Uganda has the biggest potential
for electricity generation in the region along the River Nile and
will play a major part in the power-sharing project.
</P>
<P>
Nile Independent Power, owned by AES Electric of Britain, is
to develop a 290-megawatt hydro-electric power plant worth 460
million U.S. Dollars at Bujagali on the Nile. It is billed the
largest foreign investment in Uganda's history.
</P>
<P>
AES Electric is a subsidiary of the U.S.-based AES
Corporation, which is the largest independent power producer in
the world with investments in 40 countries producing over 30,000
megawatt.

<HEADLINE> WB to Help Tanzania Solve Computer Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has
granted 100,000 U.S. Dollars to Tanzania to grapple with the
computer millennium problem.
</P>
<P>
The money will help the government development information
program to solve the problem which might paralyze computer
systems in the year 2000, press report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Co-operative and Rural Development Bank
has started to install a newly developed system to evade the
complications of the bug under the help of the Danish
International Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
The whole project will be completed by the end of next year,
said the bank's Head of Information Systems Adam Mayingu.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug problem means that computer systems may
fail, with potentially disastrous results, if internal clocks
that record only the last two digits of each year are unable to
cope with the change from 99 to 00.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Maua Daftari, the Deputy minister of Communications
and Transport, said that with less than 400 days before the
millennium bug attack, the ministry pledged full support to any
institution that will be working toward minimizing the losses
from the problem.
</P>
<P>
A task force set up by the government, with technological and
financial assistance from Britain, has started to work for the
aviation sector to deal with the problem.

<HEADLINE> Two Robbers Beaten to Death in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Two bandits have been
beaten to death in the capital of Tanzania after they
participated in an armed robbery and caught by an angry crowd of
people, press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The police are still hunting for their accomplices.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, five armed bandits invaded Hamis Haji Faki's
residence in the city and ask him to surrender his money, the Dar
es Salaam Regional Police Commander, Alfred Gewe, told reporters
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bandits escaped after grabbing property worth 1.8 million
Shillings (about 2,680 U.S. Dollars). Faki started to run after
them in a car and shouted for help from the public.
</P>
<P>
Hearing his cry, a number of people joined the chase and a
30-year-old man, named Athuman Said Kilungwana, was injured on
his left shoulder by a shot from the bandits, Gewe said, adding
that he has been admitted to hospital.
</P>
<P>
The bandits in a flurry knocked into a Datsun pick-up. One
bandit who was armed with a pistol hijacked the vehicle and ran
away. Another two bandits also managed to escape, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rest two fell into the hands of an angry crowd and were
beaten to death, in what was described by the police as "mob
justice." They were only identified as Mussa, 25, and Issa, 35.
</P>
<P>
The police recovered a pistol and four bullets at the scene of
the beating.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Ambassador to Zambia
Augusto Manuel has said the Angolan government will not join
Zimbabwe in sending more troops to the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).

Manue said over the weekend that the rebels, who captured
Kindu, the last major government stronghold in the eastern DRC,
last week, needed to be checked.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels should stop advancing to government-held positions
and the government-held positions should be reinforced," said
Manuel, whose country sent troops along with Zimbabwe and Namibia
to Congo (k) to back Laurent Kabila soon after the rebels rose up
against the government in early August.
</P>

Diplomatic sources here said the on-going talks by ministers
from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Monday on
the crisis in the DRC is expected to discuss the push-back of
rebel gains.

perceived alliance between the rebels, Angola's former rebel
movement, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), and ex-Mobutu generals spurred Angola's military
intervention in the vase central African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have signed an agreement
on ending hostilities in parts of southwestern Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency said Monday in a report that the two
sides signed the agreement in Cotabato City, Mindanao, over the
weekend to stop all hostilities in the Shariff Agwak-Datu
Piang-Talayan complex in Maguindanao, southwestern Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The week-long encounter which started on October 19 resulted in
the death of three soldiers and 20 Moro rebels and the wounding of
many other combatants from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Army Major General Santos Gabison, commander of the 4th
Infantry Division, and counterpart lawyer Lanang Ali, respective
heads of the government-MILF cessation of hostilities committee,
led in the signing of Resolution No. 3, which calls for the
immediate ceasefire in the complex, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
According to the state-run agency, the provisions of the
newly-signed resolution are:
</P>
<P>
-- immediate stop of hostilities at the complex;
</P>
<P>
-- repositioning of government and MILF forces in the area;
</P>
<P>
-- containing the MILF members at the defense line of their
Camp Omar situated at the tri-boundaries of Shariff Agwak, Datu
Piang and Talayan towns while the government forces come down to
the Cotabato-Isulan highway;
</P>
<P>
-- for both parties to strictly adhere to the implementation of
 the guidelines of an earlier truce signed in Marawi city;
</P>
<P>
-- to cease all existing armed conflict within the complex;
</P>
<P>
-- for the joint government-MNLF Quick Reaction Team (QRT) to
investigate the cause of the week-long battle between the
government army and MILF rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Moro rebels are still fighting for independence of
Mindanao, although another rebel group -- the Moro National
Liberation Front -- signed a pact with the government on peace in
the region two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Sub-regional Organizations, ESCAP Meet in Nepal Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The heads of the sub-regional
organizations in Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) began here Monday
two-day consultations over enhancing cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Attending the consultative meeting are heads of the ESCAP, the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Economic
Cooperation Organization and the Forum Secretariat which is based
in Suva, Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Asian Development Bank and the United
Nations Development Program are also present at the meeting hosted
by the Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat. The meeting is held
annually.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, Nepali Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala said that an important characteristic of the present times
is the increasing role of regional organizations, particularly on
matters of trade, economy and finance.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the Asian continent is passing through serious
financial and market upheavals whose final outcome is
unpredictable."
</P>
<P>
"Against this background, the need for enhanced cooperation
among regional groupings and trading blocks is an imperative," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"With more geographical areas becoming constituents of the
larger trading blocks in other parts of the globe, it might not be
utopian to work with the vision of an eventual emergence of a
larger Asian economic community," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, SAARC Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan
noted that the very fact that countries in the region have had to
bear the brunt of the ongoing financial crisis and its further
escalation makes it imperative for the regional groups to
collectively analyze the contributing factors and see how best to
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we have also long recognized that one of the
prime objectives of our institutional interaction should be to
promote greater cooperation in the areas of trade liberalization,
sharing of experience on infrastructure development, poverty
eradication, human resource development" and help each other
strengthen institutional capabilities.
</P>
<P>
At their fourth consultative meeting, the heads of the
sub-regional organizations and the ESCAP are expected to consider
concrete modalities for further strengthening cooperation among
them with a view to addressing the challenges faced by countries
in the region in sustaining the momentum of development, the SAARC
Secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to consider several ideas about
significantly enhancing cooperation among their respective
organizations to enhance their institutional capabilities to
effectively address the new challenges to constructive regionalism
arising out of the present global economic uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
And they will explore specific ways to strengthen cooperation
among sub-regional organizations in the region and specialized
U.N. agencies and other major international bodies, the
secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo C. Severino said that the
globalization of market, environmental pollution, drug trafficking
and other transnational crimes and the demand of modern industry
for human skills have required the utmost cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Let these contacts lead to a growing network of familiarity
and goodwill among our officials, traders, industrialists,
scientists, journalists, cultural leaders and students in a new
culture of cooperation in Asia and the Pacific," he suggested.

<HEADLINE> Sino-German Effort to Protect Yungang Grottos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and German scientists
plan to join hands to protect the Yungang Grottoes in north
China's Shanxi Province, one of China's three most famous grottos.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending a recent seminar held in Datong, Shanxi
Province, discussed ways to protect the Yungang Grottoes and
attributed weathering to water seepage and environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
The experts reached a consensus that protection efforts should
focus on controlling seepage, and suggested further research on
weatherproofing materials.
</P>
<P>
The seepage results from water flowing from nearby mountains
and constant monitoring will be required to control the problem,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
They added that coal dust and airborne particles, the major
deteriorating pollutants, are caused by the heavy volume of coal
truck using the frontage highway. They did note, however, that a
new bypass is under construction.
</P>
<P>
Cement used in the protection project produces a large volume
of salt and has been blamed for accelerating the weathering
process. Research is currently underway to an effective
replacement for cement used in water seepage treatment project.

<HEADLINE> Bad Week for Nairobi Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nairobi Stock Exchange
(NSE), like other bourses in sub-Saharan Africa -- with the
veteran analysts here have said.
</P>
<P>
While the market in Johannesburg responded positively to a
recent surprise cut in U.S. interest rates, other African markets
are unlikely to pick up until global market volatility ceases,
reported Monday's East African weekly.
</P>
<P>
Trading remained depressed in Nairobi's stock market, with a
grim economic outlook overshadowing a further drop in interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark 91-day Treasury Bill rates fell to 19.816 percent at
last Thursday's auction, down from 27 percent in April. Stock
brokers said investment had been affected by poor profit
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Lucas Otieno, a financial analyst with Shah, Munge &AMP; Partners,
said that the NSE 20-share index rose to 2783.26 last Friday from
2775.72 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
He said total market turnover last week had risen to
62,157,925 from the previous week's 39,693,211. The number of
shares traded went up from 1,002,494 to 1,597,148. There were
785 deals during last week.
</P>
<P>
Foreign activity continued its downward trend. From January to
September, the turnover was 862 million Shillings (14.3 million
U.S. Dollars), accounting for 26.8 percent of the total turnover.
</P>
<P>
This was a sharp drop compared with last year when the foreign
turnover was 2.3 billion Shillings and accounted for 36 percent
of the total market.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said foreign investors had taken more money out of the
market than they had brought in since the beginning of this year,
adding that the trend was likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
The stock market has been affected by the recent teachers'
strike and the uncertainty in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The NSE had hit a 10-year low in mid-October, a situation
analysts attributed this to recent economic and political unrest.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said people were holding back on investing because
they were not sure whether the momentum which the economy had
started gaining in the third quarter of the year would last.
</P>
<P>
An NSE official said recently that the exchange was concerned
over the depressed market and revealed there were plans to
recruit new companies to increase liquidity in the market.
</P>
<P>
In September, there was a decline of turnover by two percent
over August. Shares traded fell by 8.8 percent to 9.4 million.
Market capitalization also declined by four percent from 1.86
billion U.S. Dollars in August.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Joins Regional Efforts to Avert War in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister Joe Modise are due to
attend the regional talks on the civil war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) Monday in Lusaka, Zambia, press reports
here said.
</P>
<P>
This will be a last-ditch attempt to avert open conventional
warfare from engulfing the DRC and the Great Lakes region, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to South Africa, foreign ministers and defense
ministers from Gabon, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, Uganda,
Rwanda, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibi and the DRC will attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim
Ahmed Salim and representatives from the United Nations are also
expected to be at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
With more than 60,000-strong rebel forces involving in the war
against the DRC government led by President Laurent Kabila since
early August, fears abound that unless it is stopped now it could
spark a continental conflagration.
</P>
<P>
As preparations were under way for Monday's talks, Zimbabwe,
the main supporter of the DRC government, sent about 2,000 more
troops into the DRC to help quell the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Countries that support the DRC government also include
Namibia, Angola, Chad and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said at the weekend that South Africa would continue to
emphasize the importance of the Pretoria Declaration of 23 August
1998, which included a call for an immediate ceasefire and a
troops standstill.
</P>
<P>
This was necessary "to create right climate for the initiation
of a process of political dialog," he said.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela had a series of
meetings with key players in the DRC conflict last week in a bid
to end the four-month-old conflict, Mandela's aide said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela held confidential talks with Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Rwandan Deputy President Paul Kagame. Both Uganda
and Rwanda have been accused of backing the rebels against the
DRC government.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is also scheduled to meet with his Namibian
counterpart Sam Nujoma in Windhoek, Namibia Wednesday, as well as
representatives of the DRC rebels, reliable sources said last
week.

<P>
TOKYO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed steeply lower
in Tokyo Monday on across-the-board selling as investors took
profits following last week's sharp rise in the key Nikkei index.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 301.24 points, or 2.13
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 13,843.46.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 19.41 points or 1.82 percent to

million shares from Friday's 468.45 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Daiwa Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>

fundamentals, traders said.

<P>
Bank issues slid 3.79 percent as a sector after making
impressive gains last week.

<HEADLINE> Iranian, Syrian FMs Review Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian and Syrian foreign
ministers have reviewed the recent tensions between Syria and
Turkey, expressing satisfaction to the security agreement between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In the talks with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi on
Sunday, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa appreciated
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who is also the current
Chairman of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), for his
initiatives aimed at defusing tensions between Syria and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa stressed that Syria has always tried to preserve
stability and security in the region, and the Syrian government is
for a good neighborly relation with Turkey, the official new
agency IRNA reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that any conflict in the region would also harm other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey run to the verge of a military confrontation
after Ankara accused Damascus of supporting Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey. Syria denied the accusation and in turn expressed concern
over the military cooperation between Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi visited Syria and Turkey earlier this month in an
effort to persuade the two neighbors to settle their differences
through negotiation. On October 20, Ankara and Damascus reached an
agreement to avoid military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi expressed satisfaction over the agreement, saying that
the aim behind Iran's mediation was to help further strengthen
cordial relations among Muslim nations and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Turkey and Syria would continue their
constructive negotiations in order to settle other differences.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also expressed concern over the
military cooperation between Turkey and Israel, saying that
Israel's objective is to create tensions in the region and to pave
the way for its expansionist policies.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa arrived here Sunday afternoon to deliver a message
from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Soon after his arrival, al-Sharaa held talks with Chairman of
Iran's State Expediency Council and former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Terming Syria as the country in the front line of Jihad (holy
war) against Israel, Rafsanjani said that any discord and
difference among the Muslim countries would be in the interest of
the enemies of Islam, especially Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that the nations in the region should further focus
their efforts on bolstering neighboring relations and Islamic
solidarity through peaceful settlement of any possible
differences.

HANOI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Vietnam has
announced a list of 225 foreign-invested companies that will be
forced to sell at least 80 percent of their foreign funds held in
bank accounts to banks the Saigon Times daily reported Monday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israelis Steal Top Soil From Lebanon: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of tons of top soil
from south Lebanon are being systematically stolen by the
Israelis and dumped just inside the Jewish state for the benefit
of Israel's northern farmers, the Daily Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Israeli bulldozers have scooped the rich,
dark soil from an area of several hundred square meters in the
al-Marj area in the central sector of the Israeli occupied south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Trucks have transported the earth to form what appears to be a
series of terraces, 100 meters inside the Israeli border, which
are clearly visible from the border road.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted local residents as saying that the Israelis
only began removing the earth two weeks ago and the operation
appears to be a well-organized process.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
against Israeli forces, trying to oust them from the country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Starts to Revitalize Two Somali Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) has embarked on a project to revitalize
the northern Somali ports of Berbera and Bossaso, which were
destroyed by years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The two ports have a huge potential for maritime trade, which
UNCTAD is keen to develop, the project's manager, Captain Edward
Johns, was quoted by Monday's East African weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
Investments made in Berbera recently have resulted in a sharp
increase in cargo volumes, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Business is beginning to move and the entry point of that
business is Dubai and we are trying to sensitize people to get
more involved in regional trade," Johns said, adding that Dubai
has emerged as Somalia's main trading partner.
</P>
<P>
An assessment done by UNCTAD in earlier 1990s found that
Berbera and Bossaso ports had administrative apparatus in place
but were desperately in need of equipment.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD has now been providing maritime training to Somali
nationals and services to the ports in cooperation with the
International Maritime Organization.
</P>
<P>
Training conducted in the past 10 years has concentrated on
middle management, producing mechanics, cargo handlers and
statistical clerks.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has little manufacturing industry which means the
local administration can only derive revenues from trade levies
and taxes, Johns noted.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
continue imposing stringent conditions on all horticultural
related imports to protect Kenyan manufacturers and farmers from
unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to seal loopholes through which cheap
imports come into the country, the Kenyan authorities will
continue demanding full payment of duty imposed recently, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural Minister Musalia Mudavadi was quoted as saying
the aim was to discourage cheap imports flooding the Kenyan
market and affecting Kenyan farmers.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi also said at the weekend that he had directed all
industrial sugar users to be gazetted, including the amounts each
industry requires annually.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the industries that use sugar in the manufacturing of
products sometimes collude with importers to bring in the
commodity and from now henceforth, we are demanding that the
consumption by each industry and what they produce be made
public," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Horticulture earned the east African country 13.63 billion
Shillings (227 million U.S. Dollars) last year and is widely
expected to soon overtake coffee and tea in foreign exchange
earnings.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Limit Lending to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will restrict
its lending to Kenya to 150 million U.S. Dollars over the next
three years due to slow disbursement of the current 1.1 billion
Dollars loan portfolio and poor economic governance.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said Monday the bank's decision deals a new
blow to the country's economy whose real gross domestic product
(GDP) expanded by only about 1.5 percent in the year to June 1998
compared with 2.3 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan economy ran into trouble last year after the
International Monetary Fund suspended a key loan on the grounds
of rampant corruption and poor governance, a decision which sent
interest rates soaring and investors' confidence plummeting.
</P>
<P>
At the weekend, Financial Minister Simeon Nyachae called on
Kenyans to brace themselves for two more years of hard times
before the country's economy recovers from the current recession.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank sources said its assistance will then focus on
key social and rural sectors such as basic education, primary
health care, rural roads so as to improve the effectiveness of
its loans.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank is willing to increase its lending to
300-500 million Dollars, provided Kenya adopts sound
macro-economic management, speeds up the disbursement of loans,
takes specific measures to implement public-sector reforms and
improves governance, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The bank accepts that improvement from low-case conditions
(150 million Dollars) to base-case conditions (300-500 million
Dollars) is likely to be gradual because political commitment is
still weak for the effective implementation of reforms," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The bank is prepared to sustain low level lending support for
a relatively long period while encouraging the government to
build ownership of reforms through policy dialog and non-lending
services.
</P>
<P>
The bank will reportedly adopt a more systematic approach to
individual cases as it has done in the past.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu
Province yielded economic benefits of over 440 million yuan (49
million US dollars) during 1998 thanks to the comprehensive
use of wastewater and gas and solid waste materials.
</P>
<P>
The province discharges 240 million cu.m. of waste industrial
gases, 35,000 tons of wastewater, and more than 16 million tons of
solid waste materials each year. The vast portion of related
materials are either buried, or otherwise directly discharged into
rivers and the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government offers tax breaks, reduced fees and
financial subsidies to encourage enterprises to recycle waste
materials.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou No.2 Thermal Power Plant, which produced over
30,000 ton of coal ash each year, has earned profits of over nine
million yuan by using the waste material as a raw material in the
production of cement additives.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government also promotes the development of new
technology needed to ensure the comprehensive use of
resources. One Zhangye chemical corporation has joined hands with
Lanzhou University to develop technology for producing high
quality water purification products using waste produced by coal
mines. Various factories have used the products for wastewater
treatment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian President: Palestinian-Israeli Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has said that the recent accord signed by Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and Israel was harmful to Arab
countries, the daily Iran News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Receiving visiting Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa,
who arrived here Sunday afternoon, Khatami said that the deal
would not enhance regional peace and security, but it was
detrimental to all independent Arab countries, particularly the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"As a supporter of the independence and rights of
Palestinians, we will not allow their rights to be ignored," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president noted that Israel has shown that it
cares for nothing except its total dominance of Palestinians and
other sovereign peoples.
</P>
<P>
After nine-day negotiation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat signed the interim peace
agreement on Friday in Washington, breaking a 19-month deadlock in
the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in three months and Palestinians will
step up its efforts against anti-Israeli activities in Palestine
and convene the Palestinian National Council to revoke anti-Israel
clauses in the Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Khatami, Sharaa handed over a message from
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to Khatami and expressed Damascus'
support for Iran's stance toward the Palestinian-Israeli accord,
Iran News said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) will
launch services to the United States, Asian and Mideast countries
over the next five weeks after a long absence from the
international scene.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here Monday, PAL said that starting
Thursday, it will fly beyond Philippine borders for the first time
in 36 days when it begins a Manila-Los Angeles-San
Francisco-Manila routing.
</P>
<P>
PAL, Asia's oldest airline, folded last month after trade
unions rejected a 10-year no strike deal in exchange for four
board seats and a 20 percent stake in the company. Later, workers
reversed their stand in a referendum, and the airline resumed
domestic operations on October 7.
</P>
<P>
PAL's Asian regional services will begin on November 11 with
14-time-weekly flights to Hong Kong and daily flights to Tokyo, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Direct, thrice-weekly Cebu-Tokyo flights will also start on
November 11, it added.
</P>
<P>
On November 18, Singapore and Taipei rejoin the network with
daily flights, and Fukuoka will be served the following day, the
company said.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Demining Conference Opens in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A three-day International
Forum on Demining and Victim Assistance was opened here Monday,
aiming to strengthen the efforts to eradicate landmines.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 participants from around the world are attending
the Forum, including many of the most mine-affected countries:
Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Laos,
Mozambique, Myanmar, Nicaragua and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The forum comprises two days of formal sessions and a field day
covering mine action activities and a victim assistance project.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, Japanese State
Secretary for Foreign Affairs Nobutaka Machimura and Chairman of
the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC) Ieng Mouly delivered
speeches at the opening session.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk sent a royal message to the delegates for
international forum on demining.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the forum is "Toward Zero Victims based on
Ownership and Partnership".
</P>
<P>
The Phnom Penh International Forum on Demining and Victim
Assistance will follow up the Tokyo Guidelines, adopted in March
1997, which emphasize the importance of the ownership of mine
action activities by mine-affected countries and the partnership
among mine-affected countries, donor countries, international
organizations and NGOs in a bid to achieve "zero victims".
</P>
<P>
Three decades of civil war and mine laying have turned Cambodia
into one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays Cambodia continues to pay a heavy price. In 1998, the
country suffers between 150 and 200 casualties a month from mines
and unexploded ordnance. It is estimated there are still 4 to 6
million landmines in Cambodia soil.
</P>
<P>
"They (the mines) retard our development because the vast areas
of land they occupy are not productive for farming, industrial
production nor for living. These destructive weapons planted by
man have become a threat to our existence," the king said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, with the help of donor countries and
international organizations, Cambodia has made great efforts to
demine and assist the victims. "But manual-demining method is a
time consuming operation. With the current methods, Cambodia
cannot be free from landmines within the 10 years period as
recommended by the Ottawa convention," Ieng Mouly said.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia is totally committed to banning the use, stockpiling
and transfer of landmines," Ieng Mouly said.
</P>
<P>
On November 28 last year, the Cambodian royal government
drafted a law forbidding the use or possession of landmines.
Cambodia is also among the first signatories to the Ottawa
convention on December 3, 1997.

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Bangladeshis Likely to Be Deported From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- About 50,000 Bangladeshi workers
are likely to be deported from Malaysia and the deportation may
begin from early November, a Foreign Ministry source told Xinhua
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government last year decided to send back a large
number of foreign workers because of the financial turmoil that
gripped the nation along with other Southeast Asian countries,
fixing a deadline on October 30 this year for the foreigners
working without valid documents.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 300,000 Bangladeshis have been working in
Malaysia in agriculture, plantation and industrial sectors,
according to the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 200,000 Bangladeshi workers have lost their jobs
when a good number of Malaysian industries declared lay-off and
the employers terminated the workers from their agriculture and
plantation firms.
</P>
<P>
After bilateral discussions between the Bangladeshi and
Malaysian governments, the Malaysian side regularized 150,000
Bangladeshi workers in agriculture and plantation sectors, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
But about 50,000 workers have so far been staying there without
regular jobs and valid documents, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government declared a general amnesty to the
illegal foreign workers, asking them to go back to their
respective countries before October 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that most of the Bangladeshi workers who lost
their jobs and valid documents are now unable to return home
within the time-frame as they have no adequate money to buy air
tickets.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi workers would face legal action after the
expiry of the general amnesty, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some Bangladeshis who entered Malaysia without valid documents
had been detained in different camps and jails in Malaysia for
months, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry has already asked its High
Commission in Kuala Lumpur, capital of Malaysia, to extend
necessary assistance to the Bangladeshi workers who might face
deportation, he said, adding that Bangladesh would discuss the
issue again with Malaysia to convince the Malaysian government to
regularize more Bangladeshi workers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Association to Improve Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The strict discipline is aimed at ensuring that all shuttlers
carry out their training seriously and they are always in peak
form," PBSI Chairman Gen. Subagyo Hadisiswoyo said.
</P>
<P>
Opening a seminar on preparations for the Sydney Olympics in
Bandung, about 180 kilometers southeast of Jakarta on Sunday,
Subagyo said that PBSI would revise the rules applied in the
training camp to help Indonesian shuttlers restore their and the
nation's pride on the international scene.
</P>
<P>
"We have frequently failed to excel in international events
because we fall short in our preparations," he said.
</P>
<P>
When speaking about the lack of discipline, Subagyo
acknowledged he was referring to the doping case involving world
men's doubles champion Sigit Budiarto and the rumors swirling
around Olympic women's singles silver medalist Mia Audina.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the two cases have much to do with the loose discipline
at the training camp," Subagyo, also Army chief of staff, said.
</P>
<P>
The International Badminton Federation announced on Tuesday
that Sigit failed a dope test at the Singapore Open. Banned
substance nandrolone was detected in the "A" sample of his urine
test.
</P>
<P>
Mia is on the decline after taking a silver at the Atlanta
Olympics in 1996. Many believe her blossoming relationship with
her Suriname-born boyfriend is to blame for her ebbing form.
</P>
<P>
"I have never barred Mia from falling in love, but she will
have violated our internal rules if it's true that she once
allowed her boyfriend to spend a night with her in her room at
the training camp," Subagyo said.
</P>
<P>
On Sigit, Subagyo said the PBSI would ban him from all
competition for two years if he is found guilty.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Datang Telecom Technology
Co. Ltd. said today the company is preparing to commence mass
production of its copyrighted GSM900/1800 equipment and the move
is aimed at breaking the foreign dominance of the nation's mobile
telecommunications equipment market.
</P>
<P>
China's information technology companies have made a bid for
larger share of telecommunications equipment market with Datang's
development of the first home-made program controlled telephone
switches.
</P>
<P>
The GSM900/1800 equipment is now used for the new mobile
telecommunications network on Zhoushan, China's third largest
island, to replace imported products.
</P>
<P>
According to Board Chairman Zhou Huan, Datang will complete
trial links with the national public mobile communications network
and will then introduce the equipment nationwide.
</P>
<P>
China's mobile telecommunications market is currently dominated
by large international companies such as Motorola, Ericsson,
Alcatel and Nokia.
</P>
<P>
Datang is the only Chinese company which has developed
automatic frequency switching technology on par with the
technology of a few large international companies.
</P>
<P>
The company has also recorded major breakthroughs in key
technology needed to miniaturize smaller and offer more reliable
than foreign products.
</P>
<P>
Datang has not only complete mobile telecommunications systems,
but has also developed internationally advanced technology for
wireless interchange telephone lines and optical transmissions. It
is currently developing satellite telecommunications technology in
order to create new growth points.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the company is expecting to will double its 1998
operational revenues to four billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> New Method Improves Language Learning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing linguists claim to have
developed a new way which enhances interest and will double the
rate for learning Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
The method which was specially designed for foreigners
studying Chinese, one of the most difficult languages to learn,
will enable students to recognize thousands of Chinese characters
within less than three years, compared to six years required for
the conventional method, according to experts from the Beijing
Language and Culture University.
</P>
<P>
Linguists have concluded that the complicated Chinese language
system is based on 500-odd basic characters which serve as the
basis for all other characters.
</P>
<P>
The best way to learn Chinese is to master the structures of
the 500 characters, according to the linguists.
</P>
<P>
The book -- A Chinese-English Handbook for Learning Chinese
Characters -- recently published by the China Ocean Press fully
explains the method.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Garment Industry, Success Story of Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Garments
Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) had only 19
members when it was established in 1977, and to date it has
expanded to include more than 2,700 registered apparel
manufacturers and exporters employing some 1.5 million workers.
</P>
<P>
Starting from scratch in the 1970s, the garment industry earned
approximately 3.8 billion U.S. dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year
ending on June 30, 1998, contributing about 70 percent to the
country's foreign currency earnings. Its export target is about
4.5 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has become one of the major garment manufacturers
and exporters in the world by exporting Bangladesh-made apparel to
some 90 countries and regions, including the United States,
Canada, Britain, Germany, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
So far Bangladesh has become the 6th largest apparel supplier
in the U.S. market and the 5th largest in the European Union, and
the sector has assumed the role as the engine of the export-led
growth of the country's economy, according to officials from the
BGMEA.
</P>
<P>
The garment industry, which has come up as the biggest
export-oriented industry of Bangladesh from a small
non-traditional item, "is playing a vital role in our economy by
earning a major share of the country's foreign exchange," Finance
Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria said on the occasion of the Bangladesh
Apparel and Textiles Exposition '98 (BATEXPO '98), which was held
here earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The apparel industry now contributes about 12 percent to the
country's gross domestic products (GDP), bringing a profound
change to its overall socio-economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the BGMEA show that the industry has created a
large-scale employment scope for about 15 million people in the
country, in garment-related sectors such as the accessory and
textile industries, including spinning, weaving and dyeing.
</P>
<P>
Women, which constitute 90 percent of the 1.5 million garment
workers, are the ones that have benefited most from the
flourishing industry, as the garment industry provide them with
employment opportunities emancipating them from daily house chores
and enabling them to become less dependent on the family.
</P>
<P>
Employment has helped raise women's social status both within
and without the family in a men-dominated society as Bangladesh,
as women become more independent by having their own source of
income and helping support the family, gradually changing men's
attitudes towards women.
</P>
<P>
How the garment industry has developed so rapidly, at a rate of
nearly 20 percent over the past few years in Bangladesh, is a
miracle, experts here said.
</P>
<P>
Delivery on time, good quality, low labor cost, and efficient
management are the key factors that have contributed to the rapid
growth of the country's garment industry, according to Md. Atiqul
Islam, member of the BGMEA and chief coordinator of the BATEXPO
'98.
</P>
<P>
Favorable investment infrastructure, low inflation rate, easily
trainable labor force and flourishment of some new-generation
entrepreneurs have helped turn the sector into the highest
prospective investment focal point in Bangladesh, BGMEA President
Mostafa Golam Quddus said.
</P>
<P>
Abundant and cheap labor force is a key factor that has led to
the rapid growth of the industry. The price of labor in Bangladesh
is lower compared with some of its neighboring countries and with
some garment producing countries in Asia and East Europe.
</P>
<P>
To encourage foreign investment, the Bangladeshi government has
announced a series of measures, such as no ceiling for investment,
tax holiday of up to 10 years, duty-free imports of capital
machinery and spare parts for 100 percent export-oriented
industries, double taxation avoidance, and Bangladeshi taka
convertible on current accounts.
</P>
<P>
Low labor cost and government support play a decisive role in
the development of the country's apparel industry, the experts
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, investors in Bangladesh, a member of the World
Trade Organization, can take advantage of the generalized system
of preference allowing Bangladeshi products duty-free access to
American, European and Japanese markets, thus also contributing
significantly to the development of the country's garment
industry, they added.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Military Exercise Opens at Black Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A multinational military exercise,
coded "Sea Breeze-98", was launched Sunday in the northern part of
the Black Sea, near the Ukrainian coastal city of Odessa.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, as the Interfax News Agency reported, was
conducted within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's Partnership for Peace Program.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the United States and NATO, the exercise aimed to
train soliders for search and resue operations and the delivery of
humanitarian aids to victims when countries neighboring the Black
Sea are hit by earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which is scheduled to end on November 4, involved
4,500 men from 11 countries -- Ukraine, the United States, Russia,
Turkey, Britain, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, France, Italy and
Georgia. 1,500 of them were from the host country of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
So far, the United States and NATO have earmarked more than one
million U.S. dollars for the reconstruction of the training
grounds, command stations and harbors related to the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Russia, which refused to participate
in the "Sea Breeze-97" operation because of what was described as
its provocative nature, dispatched two vessels from the Black Sea
Fleet to take part in this year's exercise.

NEW DELHI -- The financial performance of the 105 companies in
India that have announced their results for the first half of the
1998-99 fiscal year (April 1, 1998 -- March 31,1999) suggests that
the slowdown in the economy is intensifying, Business Standard
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a year-on-year sales growth of over 20 percent in
the first half, the net profit of these 105 companies has declined
by 6.9 percent in the same period this year, an indication of the
increasing squeeze on profit margins. (India-Economy)

<HEADLINE> Basque Nationalist Party Wins Regional Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Basque Nationalist Party
(PNV) became the largest party in the next parliament of Spain's
Basque Autonomous Community after winning 21 out of 75 seats in
regional elections Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Popular Party of Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
took second place with 16 deputies elected, up from 11 in the
previous elections.
</P>
<P>
The political coalition of separatist ETA rebels, finished only
third.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the province's 18.2 million eligible voters
cast their votes in the regional elections, the first conducted
without fears of violence since the promulgation of the Spanish
Constitution in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said the record-high turnout and the
results of the elections show that most people in the northwestern
Spanish region are not for a separate Basque state. Both the PNV
and the Popular Party are opposed to the independence of Basque.
</P>
<P>
The ETA rebels' bombings and assassinations have marred past
election campaigns, but in the run-up to this vote, the prospect
of a real peace, prompted by the ETA's indefinite cease-fire,
dominated the atmosphere of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Basque separatist ETA rebels called a cease-fire last
month. And on the eve of the elections, the ETA made another
announcement, saying their commitment to the cease-fire was firm
and sincere.
</P>
<P>
Authorities nonetheless deployed some 3,000 policemen in the
736 polling stations and mobilized 12,400 volunteers to ensure the
voting go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
It is the sixth local election since the provincial parliament
was set up in 1980 after the death of Spanish dictator Francisco
Franco.
</P>
<P>
During the Franco era, people living in Basque had experienced
cruel oppression and persecution. After the death of Franco, a
number of separatists formed the Basque Country and Freedom (ETA)
in 1959 and fought violently for an independent homeland.

<HEADLINE> Stock Valuation Norms in India Likely to Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- India's Industry Ministry is
framing new guidelines for stock valuation in listed and unlisted
companies in cases of share acquisition by foreign companies,
official sources said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at stopping the practice of underpricing
shares resorted to by foreign companies in deals of acquisition.
There have been several complaints about underpricing of share
acquisitions by overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed norms, valuation of share acquisition by
foreign companies in unlisted firms will be done according to the
Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) share pricing formula while listed
companies will follow the Securities and Exchange Board of India
(SEBI) formula.
</P>
<P>
while the RBI formula for share pricing is based on a
combination of the net worth of a company, its past earnings per
share and future earnings projection, the SEBI formula stipulates
a six month average price of the scrip preceding the date of
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
At present, overseas companies are required to show only the
face value of the shares while seeking the Foreign Investment
Promotion Board's (FIPB's) approval for acquisitions. Under the
proposed new norms, however, foreign companies that acquire shares
in domestic companies -- either through open offers or negotiated
deals -- will have to specify the actual acquisition price while
seeking the FIPB's approval.
</P>
<P>
The foreign partners increased their stakes in joint ventures
either by buying out the local partners or through expansion of
equity.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Invest 309 Mln Dollars in Development Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Small and Cottage
Industries Corporation (BSCIC) will invest nearly 15 billion taka
(about 309 million U.S. dollars) in industrial and
poverty-alleviation projects within the current July 1998-June
1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
This investment program will soon be approved at a two-day
BSCIC annual conference being held here, press reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The money will be disbursed through the BSCIC and commercial
banks, and most of the funds have been earmarked for small
industries while a small amount goes to cottage industries, BSCIC
officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 billion taka (about 288.7 million dollars) will be
invested in small industries sector while the cottage industrial
and poverty-alleviation projects will get only 372 million taka
(about 7.91 million dollars) and 60 million taka (about 123,700
dollars) respectively, they elaborated.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Commerce and Industries has urged the BSCIC to
speed up its activities, they added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is one of the 48 least developed countries in the
world, with about half of its 127 million people living under the
poverty-line, and it's industrial sector is not developing
rapidly. Therefore, the Bangladeshi government has attached
importance to developing small and cottage industrial sector and
alleviating poverty among the poor people.

<HEADLINE> Slowdown in Indian Economy Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The financial performance of
the 105 companies in India that have announced their results for
the first half of the 1998-99 fiscal year (April 1, 1998 -- March
31, 1999) suggests that the slowdown in the economy is
intensifying, Business Standard said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a year-on-year sales growth of over 20 percent in
the first half, the net profit of these 105 companies has declined
by 6.9 percent in the same period this year, an indication of the
increasing squeeze on profit margins.
</P>
<P>
The picture would have been worse -- a double digit percentage
fall in net profit -- had it not been for the robust growth
registered by companies in the software and refinery sectors.
</P>
<P>
If the results of the 10 software companies and two refineries
were excluded, the net profit of the remaining 93 companies for
the first half shows a decline of 15.5 percent, and the sales
growth falls to 17.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The intensification of the slowdown is clearly established by
splitting the first-half performance into that for the first and
second quarters.
</P>
<P>
Financial figures of the 71 companies for which comparative
first and second quarter results are available show that the
slowdown has been accentuated in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Sales growth has declined from 28.6 percent in the first
quarter to 21.8 percent in the second, while net profit growth
declined from 20.3 percent to 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The results also show that most companies which did not publish
comparative figures for the first and second quarters fared poorly
during the entire first half of the current year, the paper said.

PRAGUE, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Czech government will issue 15.7
billion korunas (541 million U.S. dollars) of bonds to make up the

The bonds, which will mature in 15 years, are transferable on
the market one year after the issue. The annual interest rate of
the bonds will be decided with market demand.
</P>

The Czech Republic recorded a deficit of 15.78 billion korunas
(544 million U.S. dollars) last year. Its income stood at 508.95

COLOMBO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has appointed a 16 member Presidential Task Force on
Human Disaster Management with a view to developing a national
program, according to a report of the official Daily News Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reputed psychiatrist David Ratnavale has been appointed
chairman of the task force which consist of state officials,
social scientists, psychiatrists, psychologists, non-governmental
organizations and relief agency experts.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the task force will be held on Monday, the
 report said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, disaster management in Sri Lanka has been confined
to managing the effect of natural disasters and focused mostly on
providing basic materials for victims.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the government now is to help the increasing needs
of victims, who are affected due to continuing violent internal
armed conflict and its consequences, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The fall-out resulting from these kinds of disasters have
seriously affected certain vulnerable groups but the lives of many
others remain unfulfilled and open to risk.
</P>
<P>
The task force will address the requirements of all persons and
groups who have been traumatized. It will also examine the broad
problems of mending the social fabric by seeking ways and means to
bring order and a sense of security to the people, the report
added.

Nonetheless, according to Xie, law enforcement has remained
somewhat weak and some laws fail to explicitly stipulate punitive
measures for violations.

Other laws also must be amended to comply with the changing
situation in the country, she added.
</P>
<P>
The society plans to focus on problems women face today and
present legislative bodies with suggestions and proposals
concerning protection of the legal rights of women.
</P>
<P>
The society will also sponsor promotional activities to enhance
awareness of the need for women to use legal channels to protect
their interests, according to Xia.

<HEADLINE> Best Time to Promote EU-Chinese Ties: Santer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- President of the European
Commission Jacques Santer said it is now the best time to upgrade
the relations between the European Union and China.
</P>
<P>
Santer made the remark in an interview with Brussels-based
Chinese correspondents prior to his visit to China, the first by a
European Commission president since 1986.
</P>
<P>
"It is now the best time to upgrade EU-China relations to the
level EU cherishes with its other important partners in the
world," said Santer, who is scheduled to visit Beijing, Shanghai
and Hong Kong between October 29 and November 3.
</P>
<P>
He said since 1986 both the EU and China have undergone
remarkable changes. The EU, on its part, has endorsed a document
on the establishment of a full-fledged partnership with China
while the commission, the executive body of the 15-nation EU, held
its first summit with China in London this April.
</P>
<P>
China has scored great achievements during the past two decades
since its reform and opening up, Santer said. The country has
become one of the major trading nations with its per-capita income
doubled.
</P>
<P>
The commission president said as an important country in Asia,
China is serving as the pillar for the region's economic and
financial stability. He believed that the EU-China cooperation
will promote the prosperity and security of Asia.
</P>
<P>
"All these have laid down a solid foundation for the further
development of the EU-China relations," said Santer, who also
reaffirmed the commission's support for China's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He said China should become a member of the WTO, particularly
at the dawn of a new century.
</P>
<P>
The commission chief hoped that China would continue to open
its market, especially in such sectors as banking, services and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Apart from economy, Santer said he also planned to compare
notes with Chinese leaders on the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"People have witnessed the progress China has made in this
respect," said Santer, "progress like the rule of law, renovation
of legislation and development of local elections."
</P>
<P>
The economic reforms will accompany a more decisive movement

<P>
While in China, the European Commission president is also
expected to brief the Chinese leaders on the mechanism of the
single European currency, the euro, which is to be launched on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that both the EU and China have remained relatively
stable during the current financial crises.
</P>
<P>
While being fully confident of China's role as a stablizer in
finance, Santer said the launch of the euro will also play its
part in stablizing the economic and financial situations in the EU
nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the inauguration of the euro will also help promote the
economic stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Santer said the promotion of cultural and educational
exchanges between the EU and China is an important investment for
the future development of the EU-China ties.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to announce the establishment of an EU
scholarship program, under which the EU nations will start to
receive thousands of Chinese students and scholars from the year
2000.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Mekong Delta Reaps Bumper Harvest of Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Vietnam's Cuu Long
(Mekong ) delta, the country's largest marketable rice production
base, this year reaped bumper harvests of rice, the English daily
Vietnam News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that this year's total rice production of
15,451,180 tons in the delta reached a record level of production
despite bad weather, a prolonged drought, sea water encroaching
into the rice fields, a high incidence of fields being damaged by
pests and an unusually vicious plague of rats.
</P>
<P>
The delta's provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap, Can Tho, Long An
and Kien Giang each harvested around more than 2 million tons of
rice.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Cuu Long delta, covering an area of 2965 square
kilometers, is home to nearly two million people and provides half
of the country's rice production.
</P>
<P>
With three major rice crops a year, Vietnam can produce over
28.4 million tons of rice this year, an increase of 400,000 tons
above the plan and 900,000 tons higher than last year's crop.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the estimated production of 2.87 million tons of
other secondary crops such as maize and cassava, total food
production this year will be about 31.3 million tons -- 300,000
tons over the plan and an increase of 700,000 tons over last year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam already exported more than 3 million tons of rice by
the end of September. The Vietnamese government planned to export
3.6 million of rice this year.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Call for Common Foreign, Security Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders
Sunday ended a two-day informal summit in the southern Austrian
town of Poertschach with calls for forceful common foreign and
security policies for the organization.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following the two-day meeting,
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said that Europe should be more
forceful and rapid in its reaction to an outside incident, and
play a stronger role in the world.
</P>
<P>
Klima, whose country is holding the current rotating EU
presidency, said that the EU still needs to enhance coordination,
particularly in the economic and employment policies, and increase
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a common internal market in Europe and the
issuance of a single currency will not foretell the end of the
integration process in Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU should launch a new integration process which needs
broader coordination among the EU countries, Klima stressed.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques
Chirac echoed Klima's sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the EU and the Western European Union (WEU) should
either merge or clarify their functions.
</P>
<P>
During the summit which did not produce any concrete decision,
the EU leaders exchanged views on a wide range of issues including
the future of the EU and the efficiency of EU institutions.
</P>
<P>
On the suggestion of the EU Council of Ministers, they will
further discuss common foreign and security policies and the issue
of an EU common spokesman at the EU Vienna summit scheduled for
December.

<HEADLINE> First Hospice Association Set Up in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has established its
first Hospice Association, a non-governmental organization (NGO),
for cancer patients in the country.
</P>
<P>
The hospice association, founded and initially funded by U Hla
Tun, a honorary counsul-general of Myanmar, was inaugurated here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the founding ceremony, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first
secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, said
the Myanmar government is endeavoring to uplift the health
standards of the entire people in accordance with its social
objectives, adding that efforts are also being made to provide, on
one hand, basic health care to all nationals, and on the other,
better and more modern and up-to-date medical facilities to the
people.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is also chairman of the Myanmar National Health
Committee, emphasized that the government fully recognizes the
important role played by the private sector and NGOs.
</P>
<P>
The NGOs are playing an active role in the promotive activities
of Myanmar's social and health sectors with the support of the
government, becoming more multi-faceted and more widespread.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trust funds have also been set up at three Myanmar
hospitals, including the largest and the oldest Yangon General
Hospital, to provide health services to poor and needy patients.
</P>
<P>
A cost-sharing health care system was also recently practiced
in the country on account of the limited ability of the government
to bear all the national health expenditures alone.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, IMF to Sign Sixth Letter of Intent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The sixth letter of intent
(LOI) scheduled to be signed next month between the Thai
government and the International Monetary Fund would focus on
measures to spur domestic demand to help the economy recover,
according to the Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as saying that he
would discuss with IMF officials, who would be in Bangkok next
month, how Thailand could breathe back demand into the local
market.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said there were now favorable factors that could
contribute to the recovery including lowering of interest rates, a
lower-than-expected inflation, a more stable currency exchange
rate, improved international reserves and a current account
surplus.
</P>
<P>
"These things would help the interest at a low level without
causing problems to exchange rate," Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said once Thailand begins to see the light at the end
of the tunnel banks would then start lending to businesses again.
</P>
<P>
Bankers earlier told Tarrin they could not afford to inject
more money into the market to help stimulate the economy for fear
that non-performing loans (NPL) would grow if the crisis still
showed no sign of improvement.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the letter would also lay emphasis on following up
the progress of measures to rehabilitate the financial system and
to solve the NPL problem as well as issuing of laws to promote
foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> China Anticipates Good Autumn Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China expects the autumn grain
output to hit 20 billion kg and boost the year's total grain
output well over the 1998 target 492.5 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The overall output is expected to rise in spite of the fact
that a severe drought led to a drop in summer grain output.
</P>
<P>
China summer grain output hit 113.1 billion kg, down 14.6
billion kg on the 1997 record harvest, according to today's
overseas edition of People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The early rice output is expected to fall by some five billion
kg due to the reduction in paddy coverage and heavy flooding in
provinces along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
However, a record output is expected for autumn crops in north,
northeast and northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Output levels for oil- and sugar-bearing crops, vegetables and
fruit will surpass last year's figures, with no increases expected
for cotton and tobacco.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government, Businessmen Argue Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Recent advances made by the
rupiah against the U.S. dollar has left the Indonesian government
and the business sector arguing over the ideal level for the
currency in the economy's present state, the Jakarta Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The latest call for a limit to the sharp appreciation of the
rupiah came from commodity and furniture exporters.
</P>
<P>
They said the dramatic appreciation of the currency in the
money markets had presented them with a serious cash flow problem.
</P>
<P>
They explained that they buy raw materials for their exports at
an assumed exchange of over 8,000 rupiah to the U.S. dollar, but
export revenues are now being realized at around 7,000 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we must remind the government to limit the sharp
appreciation of the rupiah because it will have a negative impact
on exporters, especially small and middle-sized exporters," said
Firdaus Juven, a director of Chempex Jaya company.
</P>
<P>
Firdaus claimed that 13 other exporters had voiced similar
concerns.
</P>
<P>
"Many exporters are now unsure about whether to purchase (raw
materials) because they fear the rupiah may jump to the 5,000
level," he added.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita caused controversy on Wednesday by saying
the ideal level for the rupiah was between 7,000 and 8,000 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
His comments brought the recent appreciation in the rupiah to
an immediate halt and sent it sliding back to 7,850 rupiah at the
close of trade on Friday, down from an eight-month high of 7,050
rupiah reached earlier last week.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin said on Friday that the
rupiah would still be able to reach a level of between 6,000 and
6,500 rupiah on the back of improving economic fundamentals and
renewed confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a stronger rupiah would not hurt the
competitiveness of exports and said it would instead cut the cost
of raw materials for exporters.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia director Miranda Goeltom was also upbeat about
prospects for the rupiah to strengthen beyond the 7,000 rupiah
level and stressed that the central bank would not restrict the
appreciation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
She said that a stronger rupiah would be beneficial to local
companies saddled with massive overseas loans.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has risen sharply from over 11,000 rupiah last month
on the back of various factors including the strengthening of the
yen against the U.S. dollar, government dollar selling, improving
domestic economic indicators and positive remarks made by the
International Monetary Fund regarding progress in the country's
program of economic reform.

<HEADLINE> Made in Thailand Trade Fair to Be Held in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Seven hundred exhibitors are
expected to join the Made in Thailand trade fair in December in
Bangkok, as more producers shift their emphasis to local markets
amid the slump in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The fair, sponsored by the Board of Trade, will be held at the
Queen Sirikit National Convention Center from December 4-13.
</P>
<P>
Anuparb Sunananta, executive director of the board, was quoted
by the Bangkok Post as saying that last year's fair featured only
200 booths. More than half of the 700 booths this year have been
booked by producers of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
He said the fair would also provide another shopping choice for
Asian and other visitors in the country during the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The big rise in participants had occurred because many
companies were discovering that they could not perform as well in
export markets as they had hoped, he said.
</P>
<P>
The board hopes that the fair would show consumers how many
Thai companies were now manufacturing products at international
standard levels.
</P>
<P>
The Made in Thailand fair has been held annually for more than
10 years. It is a popular event with consumers looking for gifts
for the New Year greeting season.

<HEADLINE> Typhoons May Tip Philippines into Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Two huge typhoons, which hit the
Philippines in just a week, may tip the country into economic
recession, the Malaya Newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Former Planning Secretary Solita Monsod as
saying that the areas hit by "Babs" last week account for 55
percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and 35
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Babs ripped through coconut-growing Bicol and Southern
Tagalog before striking rice-growing Central Luzon last week, just
days after Typhoon Zeb unleashed its own fury.
</P>
<P>
Official reports from the Red Cross and the Office of Civil
Defense disclosed that more than 160 people are either dead or
missing, with at least 247 people injured after typhoon Babs swept
through the Philippines last week.
</P>
<P>
The two huge typhoons wreaked about 6.57 billion pesos (about
157 million U.S. dollars) in damage, causing nearly 4 billion
pesos (95.6 million dollars) of agricultural losses alone, the
National Disaster Coordinating Council said.
</P>
<P>
"It's not just destroying current output, it's also destroying
potential future output because it's also destroying the capital
goods, the infrastructure, the roads," Monsod said.
</P>
<P>
Congressman Joey Saceda was also quoted by the paper as saying:
"The damage I think is huge, enough to tip the scale between
recession and a slowdown of the economy."
</P>
<P>
"Definitely the third and fourth quarter will be affected," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The government predicted earlier that the likelihood of a
recession was low and the GDP could increase 1 percent this year
against 5.1 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Moving Industrial Manufacturers to Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's efforts to remove
local industrial manufacturers from downtown districts to the
outskirts are progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the municipal economic commission said today this
largest industrial city of China has started to build nine
city-level manufacturing centers on the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the new centers have so far
registered 2,623 industrial projects, with a total investment of
49.2 billion yuan. Of the projects, about 740 are funded by
overseas investors including 46 from the world's top 500
transnationals.
</P>
<P>
These new centers have been busily building up their major
industries in line with the city's industrial restructuring
plan. The Jiading Industrial Zone, for example, has already
established four pillar industries: automotive accessories,
refrigeration equipment, electronic goods and metal processing.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts predict that the industrial centers are expected
to become modernized satellite towns in the years to come.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Beat Blackburn in English Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The victory lifted the Gunners from sixth to third in the
table, five points behind leaders Aston Villa.
</P>
<P>
In the day's only other premier league match between Leeds and
Chelsea referee Mike Reed was the busiest man on the pitch,
booking 11 players and sending off Chelsea's Franck Leboeuf.
</P>
<P>
The ill-tempered game ended goalless.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, who had scored only once away in the league this
season, went ahead in the 25th minute through Anelka's sweetly
struck 25-meter shot. It was his fifth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
Petit's goal in the 39th minute owed more to luck than
judgment. His shot from a short free kick took a wicked
deflection off the defensive wall and left goalkeeper Tim Flowers
helpless.
</P>
<P>
Blackburn, struggling near the bottom of the table, forced
their way back into the game with teenager Damien Johnson's
headed goal after 64 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Davies appeared to have salvaged a point when he netted
10 minutes from time but his strike was ruled out for a foul on
Martin Keown.
</P>
<P>
Blackburn played out the final few minutes with 10 men after
Chris Sutton was sent off for a crude challenge on Patrick Vieira.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, unbeaten since the opening day of the season, were
indebted to goalkeeper Ed De Goey for their point at Elland Road.
</P>
<P>
He saved a Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink penalty on the stroke of
half-time, awarded after Mike Duberry's foul on Hasselbaink, and
made several other important saves after Leboeuf's dismissal for
a second bookable offense in the 61st minute.

HAIKOU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, China's southernmost
island province, has set up an agricultural information homepage
on the Internet recently.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Dawei, secretary-general of the Hainan Provincial
Association For Agricultural Exchanges, said that market
information is very important to Hainan, as most of its
agricultural markets lie outside the island.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that his association plans to cooperate with
enterprises in setting up an information network for China's
tropical agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Manager Facing Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kinnear's criticism of Mike North followed two incidents at
Selhurst Park.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough's second goal from Hamilton Ricard was allowed
to stand despite a strong offside appeal and then Marcus Gayle's
late effort for the Dons was adjudged to have not crossed the
line.
</P>
<P>
Kinnear said: "It's difficult, I don't know if it's because
he's too thick.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we were too smart or too quick for him but I think we
were robbed of three goals.
</P>
<P>
"If he's trying to become a referee, he should be told not to.
In the end, he's done us more damage than Middlesbrough.
</P>
<P>
"He said for Hamilton Ricard's goal that Brian Deane was not
interfering with play in the penalty box. What's he doing there,
then
</P>
<P>
He said TV pictures showed that Gayle should have completed a
hat trick when his late attempt was gathered by Middlesbrough
keeper Marlon Beresford.
</P>
<P>
"If the linesman's up to scratch, he'll see that sort of
thing," said the Wimbledon boss.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Adrian Bevington said: "If Joe Kinnear has any
complaints about an official for a match, there are proper
channels for him to make his complaint.
</P>
<P>
"He complies a report after every game and he's entitled to
make his comments on that. Every football club is aware of that,"
Bevington said.
</P>
<P>
The incident is not the first time involving Kinnear
criticizing a match official.
</P>
<P>
Most recently he criticized David Elleray after the referee
gave two penalties and sent off Wimbledon's Carl Leaburn at Villa
Park.
</P>
<P>
Elleray had changed his shirt for a white Villa top because of
a clash of colors with Wimbledon's dark blue strip.
</P>
<P>
Kinnear made a suitably cutting remark about the referee's
colors after the game, and complained about past run-ins with
Elleray.
</P>
<P>
Last season he asked for referee Steve Dunn to be replaced for
an FA Cup replay after he had disallowed another Gayle effort at
the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
That request was turned down.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou's Laid-Off Workers Prefer Self-Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
most workers laid off by local factories in this capital of
Guangdong Province in south China, have found new jobs by their
own efforts, instead of waiting for help from the government or
their old employers.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the city's statistics bureau,
indicates that 73.28 percent of the 10,000 respondents became
re-employed by their own efforts.
</P>
<P>
Very few found new jobs with the help of their previous units,
government-backed re-employment service centers or job agencies.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say the trend represents a more active attitude
on the part of local people to the ongoing economic reforms. They
say that they believe that this helps alleviate employment
pressure on the government and society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 46.58 percent of those re-employed
have joined the private sector, mostly in the service industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 55,600 workers laid off by the city's
state-owned enterprises found new jobs.

<HEADLINE> More Channels for Foreign Investment in Transport Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China will open more channels
for direct foreign investment in its transportation infrastructure
to solve fund shortages in this sector.
</P>
<P>
According to Dong Xuebo, deputy director-general of the
Department of Planning of the Ministry of Communications, shortage
of funds is the main problem China faces in its quest to achieve
long-term targets in transportation infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China must continue to attract foreign capital while
making full use of domestic funds, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Loans from international financial institutions and foreign
governments will be mainly used to build national trunk
highways as well as inland waterway projects in central and
western areas, while direct foreign investment will be guided to
the better-developed eastern region.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to explore new ways such as BOT
(Build-Operate-Transfer) and joint financing, the official said,
noting that the ministry will apply the new methods to a number of
highway and bridge projects on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
China will also improve its legal framework concerning foreign
investment in the transportation sector, he said. The drafting of
relevant laws and regulations, including regulations on BOT, will
be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Dong said that despite rapid development in recent years,
China's transportation infrastructure is yet to meet the demands
of the national economy both in quantity and quality.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Tightens Rules on Emergency Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has imposed new conditions for the grant of emergency
loans to ailing banks, the number of which has been increasing
because of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Business World newspaper Monday quoted Central Bank
Governor Gabriel Singson as announcing that ailing banks must
comply with new conditions before they can access the emergency
loans from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The new conditions include: the requirement that emergency
loans should be used only to service withdrawals, that bank
shareholders submit a written agreement not to withdraw their
deposits from the bank, and a central bank comptroller will be
assigned to the bank to see to it all conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
"These are (our) conditions now and (ailing banks) have to
(agree to these) before they can avail of an emergency loan,"
Singson said.
</P>
<P>
The new step by the central bank is to prevent ailing banks
from crowding out clients who want to withdraw their money during
a bank run, analysts here said.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Again Lowers Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The central bank Bank Indonesia
has again lowered interest rates of guaranteed time-deposit, the
Indonesian Observer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rates for one month deposits is now 61 percent, down from the
previous 63 percent, for this week (October 26 to November 1).
</P>
<P>
"This is the fourth time in four weeks Bank Indonesia lowered
the interest rate," an official of the central bank Perry Warjiyo
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that rate for this week's guaranteed three
month-deposit was set at 60 percent, down from the previous 61
percent; six-month deposits at 49 percent; 12-month interest rate
at 47 percent and 24 months at 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia also set the U.S.-dollar denominated deposit
interest rate at 15 percent for 1, 3 and 12 month periods, while
the 24 month deposit interest rate at 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
The guaranteed inter-bank call money is set at 53 percent, down
from the previous 57 percent, while the U.S. dollar-denominated
inter-bank call money is set at 11 percent, down from the previous
14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia director Aulia Pohan said that the deposit
interest rate is expected to go down between 5 percent and 6
percent in a month on a constant basis.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Made in Thailand Trade Fair to Be Held in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Seven hundred exhibitors are
expected to join the Made in Thailand trade fair in December in
Bangkok, as more producers shift their emphasis to local markets
amid the slump in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The fair, sponsored by the Board of Trade, will be held at the
Queen Sirikit National Convention Center from December 4-13.
</P>
<P>
Anuparb Sunananta, executive director of the board, was quoted
by the Bangkok Post as saying that last year's fair featured only
200 booths. More than half of the 700 booths this year have been
booked by producers of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
He said the fair would also provide another shopping choice for
Asian and other visitors in the country during the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The big rise in participants had occurred because many
companies were discovering that they could not perform as well in
export markets as they had hoped, he said.
</P>
<P>
The board hopes that the fair would show consumers how many
Thai companies were now manufacturing products at international
standard levels.
</P>
<P>
The Made in Thailand fair has been held annually for more than
10 years. It is a popular event with consumers looking for gifts
for the New Year greeting season.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Force Ready to Take Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
on Sunday military force may be used if Yugoslavia does not keep
its promise to withdraw armed forces from its province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on "This Week" program of the American Broadcasting
Company (ABC), U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has the "authority
to take military action and is ready to do so."
</P>
<P>
Berger's comments came after NATO supreme commander General
Wesley Clark met with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in
Belgrade until early on Sunday in advance of Tuesday's deadline
for compliance by Yugoslavia with U.N. demands for peace in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We're not satisfied with compliance at this point," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Berger added that some Serbian Army combat units have
left Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"we have seen the Serbian Army combat units that were
reinforced leave. We have now a hundred million tons of
humanitarian aid going in a day. We have 30,000 people coming down
from the mountains," said Berger.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Milosevic has not put the police units
back into garrison.
</P>
<P>
On another TV show, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
also emphasized that Milosevic had not yet lived up to his
obligations.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot more to do," Albright said on the "Face The
Nation" show of Colombia Broadcasting System (CBS). "This special
police have to be withdrawn, more military have to be withdrawn."
</P>
<P>
"I think what we need to find out is what Gen. Clark has been
able to accomplish and that is what we are going to be looking at
in the next few days," she added.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council authorized ground and
air monitors for Kosovo, but stopped short of endorsing the use of
force -- to which both Russia and China object.

<HEADLINE> Greece Warns Turkey for Air Space Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece Sunday strongly warned
neighboring Turkey not to violate Greece's air space over the
Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Evros, on the Greek-Turkish border, Greek Defense
Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos said that Greece would not tolerate
any further conduct of the Turkish aircraft that put into danger
the safety of both military planes and civil aviation, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish fighter planes have since last Thursday been reportedly
violating Greek and Cypriot air space in an attempt to prevent
Greek military aircraft from participating in a joint Greek-Cyprus
military exercise, and in many instances, interceptions by Greek
fighters escalated into virtual dog fights.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos warned that Turkey would be held totally
responsible for any possible accident related to military flights
over the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey assumes tremendous responsibilities and is being called
to realize that, given its aggressive behavior in the Aegean, it
will be responsible for future accidents," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's threats against Greece and Cyprus would not yield any
results, he pointed out, adding that the sooner Ankara realized
this, the brighter its future in the European Union (EU) would be.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO member states, have been at odds
for decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air
space limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the
Aegean Sea as well as the Cyprus problem.
