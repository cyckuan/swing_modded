AILING VET HAD A SECRET: HE'S A WORLD WAR II ERO

<P>
   PHOENX _ Edward Sherlock doesn't have much time left.
</P>
<P>
   A stomach problem, which has plagued him since being released as
a prisoner of war during World War II, has slowly deteriorated his
body.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most of what he sees is in room 526, bed B, at a
hospital in Sun City West, near Phoenix. And some days, his family
feared, there wasn't much more for the 75-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   But as Sherlock's wife, Anna, and son, J.W., searched through
his old Army records, trying to find something that might increase
his veteran's benefits and help pay his bills, they discovered a
secret of his past.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock is a war hero.
</P>
<P>
   They already knew he had spent 27 months as a prisoner of war.
But what they didn't know was that his efforts fighting in three
battles in North Africa during World War II had earned him a Bronze
Star, a Purple Heart and several other ribbons for his service.
</P>
<P>
   So, quietly, they collected paperwork, finding old records about
Sherlock and calling government offices to learn the rest. With
help from staffers from the office of Senator John McCain, also a
former POW, they were able to learn more about Sherlock's service.
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, the family had a special ceremony, complete
with the posting of the colors, at the Disabled American Veteran's
post in Glendale. But as Sherlock's health declined, they couldn't
take him to the ceremony. Instead, J.W. picked up the award and
then his wife and two of his three sons gathered in a small waiting
room to present him the medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got something for you, Dad,'' said his son, J.W.
Sherlock. ``Your stars and all the ribbons you're due. Now everyone
knows you're a hero, Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Taylor, director of the Governor's community policy office,
handed him a special certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very touching,'' said Taylor. ``It's been (more then 50
years) since he was in the military. This just kind of fell through
the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock, a quiet man, looked down into his lap. He smiled and
said thanks. ``It's a real surprise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To know Sherlock helps to understand his underwhelming response.
</P>
<P>
   He's a modest man.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up one of 13 children in Uniontown, Penn., he joined the
Army at age 16. He lied about his age, figuring it was the right
thing to do, his family recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He fought three battles in North Africa before the Germans
captured him. Then he spent two years and three months as a
prisoner of war. During that time, he slept on wooden planks and
straw. He was malnourished and told his wife that once he had to
march 25 miles, and watched some of his friends collapse and die.
</P>
<P>
   When he was released from the camp, he weighed just 78 pounds,
45 pounds less than his usual weight.
</P>
<P>
   And when he returned to his hometown in 1945, he just wanted to
get on with his life. His mom had died when he was 12. His dad had
died when he was a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   For his injuries - mostly a severe stomach problem developed
while in one of the prison camps - he got $45 a month from the
government. That eventually increased to $275 he now receives.
</P>
<P>
   So he moved to New York where a few of his sisters lived. He met
Anna and got married. He found a career as an office manager. They
later had three boys.
</P>
<P>
   And when any of them would ask about his service, Sherlock would
brush off the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask as a kid, he'd change the subject,'' remembers J.W.,
now 45. ``He'd move on to something else. `What's the score of the
Yankees' game' or something.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way he is, says Anna, his wife of 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look for glory,'' says Anna, 70. ``He wasn't raised
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The last few years, since they retired to Sun City West, he has
spent his days tinkering about the house. ``That's still his
prisoner of war stuff. He likes to be alone,'' she said. ``He's
fixed everything in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   But last fall, he started growing sicker and weaker, she said.
His body no longer was absorbing food. Now, he's on oxygen and IVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he doesn't want a fuss made about him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So it didn't surprise her if he seemed even a little bit
embarrassed by Saturday's celebration.
</P>
<P>
   She says that other veterans also may be due awards, but just
don't know it. Now, she says, the family is waiting to see if the
increased medical benefits come through.
</P>
<P>
   And they're trying to celebrate Sherlock's accomplishments more
than 50 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, they'd be thrilled. But I think he wonders what
he needs it for,'' she says. ``But I think in his own little way,
he was thrilled. He would never let you know. But I think in the
days to come, I think he may think, `Well, they appreciated me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And when his son, J.W. tried to ask his father about the award,
a ``What do you think, Dad,'' type of question, Sherlock just
looked down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we had turkey for lunch,'' he said. ``Maybe I should
head back to my room.'' &QL;

STATE'S `TOBACCO SLAYING' ATTORNEY GENERAL HONORED BY MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PAYNTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With the character issue now a top campaign priority,
Good Housekeeping magazine's golden seal of approval is something
any officeholder would love to take to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But while Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire
will get the magazine's highest award for women in government on
Wednesday in Washington, D.C., she will not be allowed to accept
the $25,000 check that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Because the rules of the Washington State Ethics Commission,
which works for the Attorney General's Office, say that no one in
state government can receive any additional compensation for simply
doing his or her job. No matter how far beyond the call of duty
they may go and no matter where the money comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy as it may sound, the Ethics Board is very strict about
this,'' Marty Brown, Gov. Gary Locke's deputy chief of staff and
legislative director, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire was chosen first among 10 ``women who made a
difference'' in 1999. ``The Tobacco Slayer,'' as the article calls
her, is being honored for tenaciously waging the tireless
negotiations that ultimately forced the nation's top cigarette
makers to pay taxpayers a $206 billion settlement. And for ridding
the landscape of Joe Camel and other cigarette ads aimed at kids.
And for helping to secure millions of dollars from big tobacco for
a campaign to discourage teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if you were in the private sector, you would get a
bonus or a contingency fee for something like this,'' Brown said.
``But that's not the way the Ethics Board works. Unfortunately,
it's just seen as doing your job _ really, really well.''
</P>
<P>
   No one argues the months Gregoire spent separated from her
family to hammer out the settlement in New York City amounted to a
huge sacrifice, Brown said. ``But the problem is where do you draw
the line?''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, nobody in the Department of Labor and Industries
got a reward for the $4.4 million settlement _ including a record
$1.1 million fine _ that was paid to the state by Equilon Puget
Sound Refining after the Anacortes, Wash., explosion in November
that killed six.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gregoire is reportedly the only winner of the Good
Housekeeping prize who ever had to turn down the money. She admits
she was surprised and she says the people from Good Housekeeping
were ``shocked'' when she told them she couldn't take the money.
</P>
<P>
   The award was established with the thinking that people who go
into public service are less handsomely paid than those in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a citizens panel raised Gregoire's salary from
$93,000 a year to $123,000. Commission members noted that some
state officials hadn't seen any raises, including cost-of-living
adjustments, since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire has no intention of fighting the ethics rule and
emphasizes that, check or no check, she is thrilled with the award.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire didn't even know she had been nominated for the award
by Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Margaret McKeown until an
editor from the magazine called for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home and told my family and they couldn't believe it,''
Gregoire said on Friday while en route to meet Vice President Al
Gore on his presidential campaign stop in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Gregoire had told her two teenage daughters,
Courtney and Michelle, the $25,000 would be equally spent on their
educations.
</P>
<P>
   The other nine winners will receive $2,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend the Gregoire family got together via conference
call to decide which charities will get the money.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire, her husband, Mike, and their daughters will donate
$5,000 each to the charity of their choice. Then, as a family, they
will give the remaining $5,000 to one charity they all like.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney, 19, is working in Washington, D.C. this summer and
will join her mother there for the awards ceremony while Mike stays
home to take Michelle, who just finished the eighth grade, to her
soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire took a red-eye flight home from the tobacco
negotiations last year to be in the bleachers for one of Michelle's
games. But she missed too many others, she admits.
</P>
<P>
   Mike takes in stride the good-natured kidding he sometimes gets
as the husband of one of only seven female attorneys general in the
country. When he goes to events for spouses, the outings are
usually shopping trips and museum tours.
</P>
<P>
   He'll change that when he takes charge of spouse events when the
National Association of Attorneys General has its annual meeting in
Seattle next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Gregoire will travel to Nashville, Tenn., for this
year's annual convention. The group recently elected Gregoire
president by a unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   And what's next for the ``tobacco slaying'' medal winner, the
woman Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore nicknamed the
``Tiger Lady'' for her never-back-down style?
</P>
<P>
   Since the settlement victory, and since deciding not to run
against Sen. Slade Gorton for a seat in the U.S. Senate, Gregoire
pondered her options.
</P>
<P>
   Some say she will surely be offered a presidential Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   She says she'll believe that when she sees it. And she won't
talk about it until then.
</P>
<P>
   She has also been urged to run for governor and Gregoire says
she is not ruling that out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that the state may very well be the key,''
Gregoire said. ``At this point, I haven't seen the federal
government capable of reaching into the lives of everyday people to
help them solve their problems.''

LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE PATIENTS WAIT FOR BREAKTHROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The hard part about having a fatal disease in 1999 is
that the promises of miracle cures, genetic antidotes and
biococktails twinkle all around like lights of distant rescue ships
_ too far off to be of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very maddening,'' said Kevin Spicer, afflicted with Lou
Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish those breakthroughs would be available right now,
before the disease takes over more of my body.'' Lacking the muscle
control to speak, the Tucson man communicates these thoughts
through his computer e-mail system. (would not give his age)
</P>
<P>
   Spicer's disease, named for the baseball legend who died of it
in 1941, is scientifically known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
or ALS.
</P>
<P>
   ALS gradually destroys the motor nerves, causing muscles to
atrophy, leading to paralysis. Arizona's 250 to 300 victims of Lou
Gehrig's disease know that three to five more years of life is the
most they can expect after diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Though the disease has no cure, many of its victims do not sit
and wait. An estimated 20 percent of Arizonans with ALS, including
Spicer, are enrolled in research projects.
</P>
<P>
   They explore, looking for something that works, something that
will extend their time and give them a fighting chance. And even
those who have given up on their own chances often want to do
something that will help others, turning their personal tragedies
into something of value to medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the best ALS antidote is a drug called Riluzole. But
it lengthens life by only three to five months.
</P>
<P>
   So nationally, a flood of medical experiments is now probing
ALS, giving sufferers an opportunity to be involved in the search
for answers.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, at least four major studies are under way at Mayo
Clinic Scottsdale and at the University of Arizona. Barrow
Neurological Institute in Phoenix also is nationally known for its
research on ALS, though it doesn't have a study under way
presently.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is easy about ALS; it's even difficult to diagnose.
Doctors usually identify it only by observing how the person walks
or speaks, and by eliminating all other possible diseases. The one
left is ALS.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a way to spot the disease earlier is a priority research
project at UA. Dr. Valerie Cwik is using magnetic resonance imaging
technology to track the chemical indications of neuron loss in the
brain, a research path she hopes will lead to earlier diagnosis and
to better tracking of the disease's course.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Bosch of the Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, meanwhile, is
experimenting with implanted pumps that deliver a potent drug
directly into the cerebrospinal fluid canal. He is hoping that it
will increase survival time. The medication slowed the progress of
the disease in laboratory rats, but a later human trial was not
successful. Better delivery of the drug, through use of the pump,
might make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Bosch is also testing new pills that might slow the progression
of the disease and increase survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biology of ALS is better understood now, and we are
finding ways to slow down the disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In all the ongoing Arizona research projects, doctors comment
that ALS patients volunteer readily and are unusually brave, almost
cheerful, in the face of their fate. It may help that ALS is
usually not physically painful.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the experience of being alive seems more clear and
interesting when the end of life comes suddenly into view. One of
Bosch's late patients told him that this was the luckiest time of
her life because it made her appreciate every moment.
</P>
<P>
   To make that experience last as long as possible, some ALS
patients are willing to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   George Pittman, 61, of Tucson, recently brought his wife, Sally,
and his 11-year-old grandson with him to his appointment at the
Mayo Clinic. His implanted medicine pump was due for a checkup and
refill. He reported some sleeplessness and tingling sensations
throughout his body _ potential side effects of the medication.
</P>
<P>
   Bosch asked him if he wanted to reduce the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, no!'' said Pittman emphatically, adding that he could
live with the side effects if the drug gave him any chance of a
longer life. He looked at his wife and grandchild. Not long ago he
was playing golf in the top of health.
</P>
<P>
   It all started in January 1998, when he fell a few times while
jogging. There was no apparent reason for it. After a seemingly
endless battery of tests with no answers from his Tucson doctor, he
came to Mayo and was given the bad news by Bosch.
</P>
<P>
   His implanted pump, the size of a computer mouse, contains, he
hopes, a new drug considered by the Mayo Clinic to be a big
improvement. There is a one-third chance that Pittman is part of
the study's control group and his pump contains only a waterlike
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an amazing group of patients,'' said Cwik. ``There is a
saying among ALS doctors that they have the nicest patients in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not easy doctoring. ALS doctors at Mayo, Barrow and UA
have learned how to deal with the difficulty of telling people they
are going to die, then watching them lose body functions over just
a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have cried a lot with patients and families,'' Cwik said.
</P>
<P>
   Roxanne McLaughlin, research coordinator for the Mayo ALS
studies, agrees that it is tough duty: ``When I think I can't do
this anymore, I look at the letters, poems and cards I keep above
my desk from patients and families we have helped.''
</P>
<P>
   The bestselling book ``Tuesdays with Morrie'' is about the
wisdom of a thoughtful ALS patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get life lessons five or six times a day like those in that
book,'' McLaughlin said. ``So many of the patients are so
accommodating. I wonder if I would be that generous if someone was
always asking for blocks of my time and my remaining time was so
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease may be toughest on patients who would like to
participate in the Scottsdale and Tucson experiments but do not
qualify, are too sick or live too far away.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Beck (NO AGE GIVEN) lives 4{ hours from Phoenix in Ganado
on the Navajo Reservation _ too far for him to travel. His family
is relying on traditional Native American healing ceremonies to
ease his suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Though his decline continues _ he has lost his voice and most of
his movement _ they believe the ceremonies give him a psychological
boost and the hope that a cure might be found for him.
</P>
<P>
   A few ALS patients, including two Phoenix-area residents, have
turned to Jack Kevorkian to end their suffering. But most say they
would not consider that.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rule, my patients want to live _ sometimes desperately,''
Cwik said.
</P>
<P>
   The national ALS Association neither condones nor disapproves of
assisted suicide for patients, unusual for a mainstream medical
group.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizonans who went to Kevorkian were Nicholas Loving, 27, in
1995, and Shahla Semino, 46. Semino was one of Bosch's patients,
and the first of his patients to take her life that way. He had no
indication that she was going to do it, except that, on her last
appointment, she hugged him and said goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   He later watched a farewell video she left behind, and, with her
family, accepted her decision. ``I don't want to reach the point
when I would not be able to wipe away my own tears,'' she said in
the video.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he shakes his head, saying, ``She had at least two years
to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that those two years can be expensive, sometimes costing
as much as $200,000, Bosch has written letters to Congress urging
changes in Social Security disability and Medicare coverage rules.
The way the law is now written, many ALS patients die before the
eligibility requirements for treatment and benefits are fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to hang on for as long as they can, there
are, in fact, glimmers of hope on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   New promising gene research, for instance, may lead to a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Bosch has been involved in eight studies since 1993, seven
involving experimental drugs. Another test is being planned for
later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Next on Cwik's agenda is a study using a drug that may control
emotions that sometimes are magnified by ALS _ laughing and crying
can be uncontrollable in some patients. Maybe there is a clue
there, she hopes.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, she will measure the effect of exercise on ALS
patients. ``You lose the nerves going to the muscle. We don't know
if more exercise is good, indifferent or damaging.''
</P>
<P>
   ALS patient George Pittman has volunteered to help her find out.
</P>
<P>
   He was recently in an exercise video that ALS patients who also
participate will see. He jokes that he is the Jane Fonda of ALS
exercise tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I volunteer for everything they have,'' he said. ``Bring them
all on. This at least gives you hope.'' &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PINEHURST, N.C. _ Payne Stewart didn't want to spend another summer
hearing about what a great effort he made and what a terrific
competitor he is.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's for losers. He knows that from experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year at the U.S. Open, everybody told me what a great try
it was,'' Stewart said Sunday. ``Well, I didn't want to hear that
again. I didn't want to hear that when I got back home and all my
friends came up and said, `Boy, you sure tried. It was a great
effort. But bad luck.' I didn't want to hear that. And it motivated
me.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the man who has been renowned more for his fashion
statements and penchant for near misses than for his golf game got
it right.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart made sure the 99th U.S. Open would have one of the most
breathtaking finishes in the tournament's history when he dunked a
15-foot putt into the cup on the 72nd hole for a par that gave him
a one-stroke victory over Phil Mickelson at Pinehurst No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to the 18th, Stewart had made a 25-footer on the 16th
for par and a three-footer after a sensational 7-iron for birdie on
the par-3 17th.
</P>
<P>
   He needed every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I putted my little derriere off today,'' Stewart said. ``I
never gave up. I kept playing and kept plugging. I got the job
done. And that means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Mickelson staged a brilliant battle through the
misty, coolish afternoon and evening at Pinehurst. They were the
only players to get under par for the tournament at any point
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's even-par 70 for the final round was matched by
Mickelson. Others _ Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh, in particular _
tried to stay with them. But in the end, it was the final twosome
battling it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``With three holes to go, I felt like I was in control of the
tournament,'' said Mickelson, who had a one-stroke lead as the pair
stepped to the 16th tee. ``I was leading, and it was a difficult
course to make birdies on. It was a little disappointing that the
only bogey came at such an inopportune time.''
</P>
<P>
   If consistency won the award, Mickelson would have been a
runaway champ. His lone bogey of the day came at the 16th. Right
after Stewart had dropped in his par-saving putt, Mickelson could
not get an eight-footer to drop.
</P>
<P>
   When both hit terrific shots to the ticklish 17th, where Woods'
earlier bogey had ended his chances, it came down to a putting
contest. And nobody could beat Stewart at that part of the game
Sunday. His 24 putts were fewer than all but one player (Dudley
Hart with 23) took in the final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that shot where he knocked it in there close on 17
where the realization that he could beat me entered my mind,''
Mickelson said. ``Until then, I thought I was in control, making
pars and playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the last three holes, I just didn't have that little extra
that Payne showed. He came through with that little extra on a
couple of his putts, and I ended up missing mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart made his three-footer at the 17th after Mickelson's
six-footer missed. In two holes, Stewart had made up two shots. But
as was the case all week at Pinehurst, making pars when you needed
them was no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th hole was an adventure for Stewart. He hit what he
thought was a good drive, but it ended up in the right rough. With
the ball buried in wet grass, Stewart knew he had only one option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought that drive was in the fairway,'' he said.
``But I got up there and had no chance to even think about (going
for) the green. So I took my medicine. I didn't compound the
situation by making two mistakes in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart chopped out of the rough with a 9-iron and was left with
75 yards to the pin. Mickelson, sensing that par might be enough to
get him into a Monday playoff, hit a safe shot to the front half of
the green and was left with a 25-foot putt for birdie. Stewart's
lob wedge ended up 15 feet right and slightly short of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I saw Phil hit his shot, I didn't feel that he was going
to make that putt,'' Stewart said. ``So I played my wedge shot
there, and I wanted to be underneath the hole putting back up. I
would have liked it to be a little closer, but I had practiced my
putt earlier in the week. I knew what the line would be, and so I
just went through my routine and told myself to believe that it
needed to be hit just inside-left of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked up, it was about two feet from the hole and it
was breaking right in the center and I couldn't believe it. I
couldn't believe I'd accomplished another dream of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   This now makes three major championships for Stewart, including
his second Open after having won in a playoff over Scott Simpson in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's victory capped a week of many subplots. He won it on
Father's Day while Mickelson's wife was on the verge of going into
labor with their first child. Stewart scattered the ghosts of
previous Opens. He lost a four-shot lead last year when Lee Janzen
shot a closing 68, and faltered in '93, also to Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was Stewart's tournament to win. He had started
with a one-stroke lead and protected it for most of the day until
things got hairy at the end.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the challengers faltered.
</P>
<P>
   First, Tim Herron couldn't capitalize on a rare birdie on the
par-4 fifth, one of only four birdies on that hole Sunday. On the
par-3 sixth, he dumped his tee shot in the left bunker, had his
escape roll back into deep rough and ended up with double bogey to
go 3-over for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Next was David Duval, who put Stewart on alert when he started
the day with birdies at the first two holes. But Duval missed the
green on the sixth and couldn't get up and down, then bogeyed the
eighth and fell to pieces on the 179-yard ninth. He bunkered his
tee shot, hit the blast over the green, had his chip do a U-turn,
put the next shot eight feet past but saved his double bogey.
Nevertheless, he was 4 over par for the tournament and out of the
running. He would shoot 7 over par on his last 13 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson was Mr. Consistency. He parred around until making a
gutsy birdie putt on the seventh to get to 1-under and cut
Stewart's lead in half.
</P>
<P>
   Singh made a 20-footer on No. 8 for birdie and then sank a
five-footer on the par-5 10th to get to even-par for the
tournament. But Singh made a fatal bogey on the 16th when he
couldn't get to the 489-yard par-4 in two and then couldn't get up
and down.
</P>
<P>
   Woods played the front nine in even-par to stay in the chase.
But with Mickelson, Stewart and Singh all covering the first nine
holes in 1 under par, Woods was beginning to run out of holes. When
he three-putted from 10 feet on No. 11, including a miss from 30
inches, Woods had fallen to 2 over par and seemed like a goner. He
fought back. But a missed five-footer at the 17th spelled the end
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Mickelson were left standing. And when Stewart's
putt put a lid on it, he leaped for joy and then spent a moment to
console Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said he's really happy for me that Amy (Mickelson's
wife) and I are expecting our first child and that he's really
excited for us,'' Mickelson said. ``He said being a parent is a
special thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would have made for a cool story for our daughter
to read about as she gets older. But this is still something
special. Becoming a father will be a bigger change in my life than
if I'd won this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   To which most parents, including Stewart, would say: He doesn't
know the half of it.

U.S. CAPITOL STATUES HONOR MANY KNOWN TO FEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Robert E. Lee looks mighty good in bronze, chin up,
sword by his side, standing tall in National Statuary Hall of the
U.S Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   And there's President Andrew Jackson, humorist Will Rogers,
Mormon leader Brigham Young and Sen. Daniel Webster. Tourists
recognize their names, if not their images, easily.
</P>
<P>
   But who is Ephraim McDowell?
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer in abdominal surgery, the Capitol guide will tell you.
This Kentucky physician made a name for himself removing a
gallstone from President James K. Polk in the early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the two Kansas contributions _ Sen. John James Ingalls
and Gov. George Glick _ are not unique in their obscurity. Many of
the 96 statues from the 50 states are of people who cut a much
bigger figure in the Capitol than they ever did in the history
books.
</P>
<P>
   But Ingalls and Glick may be about to make fresh history. They
are on the verge of eviction, possibly the first to be sent home
from these halls.
</P>
<P>
   A committee of Congress is considering a request by the state of
Kansas to replace them with two better-known Kansans: former
President Dwight D. Eisenhower and aviator Amelia Earhart.
</P>
<P>
   Every state is entitled to two statues at the Capitol, and it is
believed that not one has been replaced in the 129 years since the
first statue went up.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Legislature, with some dissension, asked for the
change this spring, and now the flap will be taken up in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nobody who is going to block this,'' insisted U.S.
Rep. Todd Tiahrt, a Wichita Republican who helped lead the push for
a switch.
</P>
<P>
   But the Capitol architect, who oversees the statuary scattered
around the Capitol, believes a switch may take an act of Congress.
On its Web site, the architect's office says a statue becomes
federal property once unveiled and can't be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that a state cannot unilaterally come in and
reclaim its statue without some kind of authority from Congress,''
architect spokesman Herb Franklin said. ``This is a view that is,
shall I say, academic.''
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate committee to whom Capitol Architect Alan Hantman
reports warned him recently not to meddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please do not take any action that prevents the Congress from
properly determining guidelines'' for moving the statues, wrote
Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska and Rep. Bill Thomas of California of
the Joint Committee on the Library in a letter to Hantman.
</P>
<P>
   The committee plans a hearing this summer to talk about Kansas'
request and whether the full Congress must approve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable that states might wish to re-examine the
individuals whose statues represent them,'' Stevens and Young
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Amen, says Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sort of like term limits,'' Ashcroft mused. ``When you
are there long enough, maybe it's time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   If statues start moving, Ashcroft said, he would like to see one
of Harry Truman installed for Missouri, although he has no plans to
initiate a change. Missouri has Thomas Hart Benton and Francis
Preston Blair Jr., who, among other things, were U.S. senators.
</P>
<P>
   Benton, one of Missouri's first two senators, was well known for
his support of western expansion. Blair, a strong ally of Abraham
Lincoln, was key in keeping Missouri, a slave state, in the Union
during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas wanted to change its statues back in the early 1970s but
was ignored in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a precedent many House members didn't want to tackle,''
said Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, who served in the House at the
time. ``I wish the Kansas delegation well. If they can do it, fine.
If not, I understand the precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiahrt said he doesn't think Kansas will set off a stampede of
statue switching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some states will consider it, but those statues are
there for a reason,'' Tiahrt said.
</P>
<P>
   Take John Gorrie. Pursued a patent to make an ice machine, went
broke and died in seclusion, his story goes. But while trying to
figure out how to keep fever patients cool, he accidentally
invented air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   His statue was sent from Florida, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in approving the statue collection in 1864, said
states should decide who is deserving, based on ``distinguished
civic or military'' service. The only stipulation was that the
person be dead.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nationally known figures in the collection include
Jefferson Davis, George Washington, U.S. Grant and James Garfield.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition is from Colorado, astronaut Jack Swigert of
Apollo 13 fame. North Dakota, Wyoming, New Mexico and Nevada have
sent only one statue to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The average statue has been in the hall for 77 years and are
mostly people who made history in the 1800s, explaining their
relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls, standing rather smartly, hand on his hip, in a long
dress coat, has been in Washington since 1905.
</P>
<P>
   Glick was installed in 1914, downstairs in the Hall of Columns.
This first Democrat to be elected to statewide office in Kansas
seems best remembered for helping curb an outbreak of
hoof-and-mouth disease. He is depicted with an open hand by his
side, a pose that seems now to say ``Why me?''
</P>
<P>
   Tiahrt said the statues of Ingalls and Glick would be returned
to the state Capitol in Topeka. Under the current plan, Eisenhower
would replace Glick first, with Earhart replacing Ingalls later.
</P>
<P>
   A committee is being formed in Abilene, Kan., to raise $250,000
to commission an Eisenhower statue, ship it to Washington and
return Glick to Kansas. No efforts have started to raise money for
an Earhart statue.
</P>
<P>
   Updating statues is a public service, Ashcroft thinks. ``The
Capitol of the United States becomes a teaching tool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the folks over there aren't worth learning
about,'' he said. ``But I've been in that hall and we (should not)
say those people are the only ones worthy of recognition.''

SPRINT TO OFFER DIGITAL-AGE PHONE SERVICE FIRST TO KC RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Residential consumers in Kansas City will get
first shot at Sprint Corp.'s ballyhooed Integrated on Demand
Network, a digital-age phone service that will deliver local and
long distance service, and high-speed Internet access through a
single connection to the home, with a single bill.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for the first time, Sprint will offer concrete details on
ION's deployment and announce its plans to roll out the service to
consumers in Denver, Seattle and Kansas City by December.
</P>
<P>
   ``These first three cities are the beginning of a nationwide
rollout,'' said Terri Morrow, a vice president in Sprint's consumer
services group. ``From that point forward, we'll be announcing new
markets every quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic ION package will include four voice lines _ each
equipped with caller ID and voice mail _ two high-speed data
connections, and virtually unlimited domestic long-distance
service.
</P>
<P>
   Family members in different rooms will be able to use all those
connections simultaneously. And with a simple point-and-click
interface on their computer, consumers can control their own
service, adding lines or forwarding calls to their wireless phone
while they are out of the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they deliver, this looks compelling,'' said Jonathan
Haller, an analyst with Current Analysis Inc.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how many customers will be attracted by a
service that will cost between $100 and $150 monthly, plus hardware
and installation costs of $400 to $450.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming they've done their market research,'' said Tony
Ferrugia, an analyst with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. ``If it
doesn't generate the kind of demand they're looking for, they'll
lower the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The convergence vision embodied in ION is one that every
telecommunications provider is chasing. But most carriers have
concentrated their efforts on the more lucrative business market.
Even those with plans to serve residential customers will be
hard-pressed to bring a comparable service in the same time frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sprint gets this out in December, they'll be ahead of any
timetable I've seen at AT&AMP;T,'' Ferrugia said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint faces physical limitations on where it can provide the
service. It plans to deliver ION by souping up the copper phone
lines that run into most homes. That technology is only capable of
reaching customers who live within three miles of a central office
where Sprint has installed its equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Customers interested in the service can sign up to get more
information at www.sprint.com/ioninfo

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Lindy Ruff knew something wasn't quite right, and
mute confirmation of the terrible truth wasn't long in coming.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Buffalo Sabres coach wanted to know why the sort of goal he
had seen waved off so many times before in this controversy-filled
NHL season suddenly had been good enough to decide the last game of
the Stanley Cup Finals. Since commissioner Gary Bettman happened to
be standing nearby, Ruff figured he would go right to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to answer the question: Why is that not
reviewed?'' Ruff said after Brett Hull's shot off a rebound 14
minutes, 51 seconds into the third overtime early Sunday morning
gave the Dallas Stars a 2-1 win in Game 6 and a 4-2 victory in the
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's question was prompted by the fact Hull had a skate in the
crease when he got his decisive shot past Sabres goalie Dominik
Hasek. The response from Bettman?
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, he just turned his back on me,'' Ruff said. ``He
almost looked to me as though he knew this might be a tainted goal
and there was no answer.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's wee hours, well after the final shot was fired in a
game that did not end until about 1:35 a.m. in the East, the NHL
scrambled to explain how this could be.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, supervisor of officials Bryan Lewis attempted to
provide an answer. Essentially, Hull could be in the crease because
he had control of the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there reasons why a guy can have a foot in the crease and
score a goal?'' Lewis said. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about all the goals disallowed this season when an
offensive player had so much as a toe in the crease?
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate here seems to be, Did he or did he not have
possession and control?'' Lewis said. ``Our words from upstairs and
our view was that yes, he did. He played the puck from his foot to
his stick, he shot and scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Hull shot twice. Hasek blocked the first effort, but
Hull lifted the second into the net.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, Lewis insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other component of the debate is, Does the puck change as
a result of hitting the goalie on the glove?'' he said. ``A puck
that rebounds off the goalie, the goal post or an opposing player
is not deemed to be a change of possession. Therefore Hull would be
deemed to be in possession and allowed to shoot and score a goal,
even though the one foot would be in the crease in advance of the
puck.''
</P>
<P>
   In answer to Ruff's request for a review, Lewis said there had
been one, though it wasn't announced. It had been determined,
without fanfare, that the goal was good. And no, the fact the Stars
already were celebrating and the Stanley Cup was in the process of
being presented didn't affect the thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Lewis insisted.
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect, this explanation did little to mollify the
Sabres, who were understandably unhappy with both the process and
the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he was in the crease at first, and then I saw
the replay,'' Hasek said. ``I was about to go back on the ice
because I couldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame. For two months, we've been playing hard, and to
lose like that ''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who joined his father, Bobby (Chicago, 1961), as
father-son Stanley Cup winners, wasn't about to let the controversy
ruin his morning, preferring to lay blame at the heart of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad rule, and they're going to have to work on it this
summer,'' he said. ``If I've got control of it the whole time, it's
my puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going back out there, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the second-longest game in Stanley Cup Finals history _
Edmonton's 3-2 win over Boston in Game 1 of the 1990 Finals lasted
an additional 22 seconds _ hardly anyone was in the mood to go back
out on the ice, least of all Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock revealed that Hull had been bothered
by more than the sore groin the club had announced when the $17
million offseason addition missed most of Game 3 and all of Game 4
of the Finals. In addition to a torn groin, Hull also has a torn
medial collateral ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hid a lot of things,'' Hitchcock said. ``What this man did
to go on the ice, what we did between periods to get him back on
the ice I mean, he might be rehabbed enough to start the (next)
season.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this one, Hull was an extreme case when it came to
playing hurt, but most everyone involved was a little worse for
wear.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Benoit Hogue played with a torn anterior cruciate
ligament. Mike Modano persevered with a fractured left wrist. The
second-oldest team ever to win a Stanley Cup basically played a
doubleheader to seal the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Buffalo is the same way,'' Hitchcock said, ``but I
don't know where this group would have been if we would have had to
play a Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   They won't have to do so now, but Hitchcock's group _ and
certainly Ruff's _ deserved a better way to ring down the curtain
at the conclusion of a long, tense series and a final act that
covered more than five hours and featured 104 shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   When it was done, Dallas' Joe Nieuwendyk was awarded the Conn
Smythe Trophy as Most Valuable Player of the postseason, another
decision (by a small group of veteran hockey writers) that raised a
few eyebrows. Stars goalie Ed Belfour turned back 53 of 54 shots in
the final game and yielded just one goal in the final 208:14 of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   The slight, however, didn't seem to be weighing heavily on
Belfour's mind as he celebrated his first Stanley Cup title. Amid
the champagne, beer and bonhomie of the winning locker room, the
much-maligned 34-year-old was all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest moment of my life,'' he said. ``To be a
part of a great team like this is the best thing that's ever
happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Also high on the list of Stars finding redemption on this night
and early morning was Modano, the center who assisted on Hull's
winning goal. After years of fighting the image of a
one-dimensional player, an emotional Modano was ``our best player
the last two games of this series,'' according to Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike always carries the weight of the world on his
shoulders,'' the coach said. ``Sometimes it's unnecessary, but I
think he's in a position that he feels he's carrying the torch for
the hockey club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been here a long time. He made some significant
adjustments to his game that had to be made for us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would suggest Dallas isn't a worthy winner. The Stars are
two-time President's Trophy winners for best regular-season record
in the league. This year, they added the Jennings Trophy for fewest
goals allowed.
</P>
<P>
   They beat Edmonton, St. Louis and Colorado to advance to the
Finals. Belfour got the best of Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy, a
three-time Stanley Cup champion, in the Western finals, then
outlasted Hasek _ generally considered the best goalie in the world
_ in a memorable Finals showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres graciously conceded those points. In the end, all
they wanted was the courtesy of an explanation. Instead, they were
shown the commissioner's back and the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do?'' Buffalo center Mike Peca said. ``It's over,
and it'll be a story for a long time.''

ELEVATED EMOTIONS FOR GERMAN TEAM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The energy and electricity level dipped on
Sunday. You knew it would, after the dizzying, convention-defying
opening day of the Women's World Cup had Americans on either coast
hyperventilating.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions are like elevators, right? What goes up must come down.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Eleven members of the German national team and
four North Korean players would tell you that's a very bad analogy.
On Sunday morning they got stuck in an Arcadia hotel lift and spent
some 30 minutes in a mounting panic as condensation from their
breath formed on the suffocating glass walls. ``The electricity
broke down, the walls fogged up and it got very, very hot,'' said
German goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg, who was one of the athletes
trapped. ``Some of the players got very panicky.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the stifling pressure that the favored Germans
faced from Italy in the first half of their opening-round match at
the Rose Bowl was quite manageable. Rottenberg let in a header by
Patrizia Panico that took a flukey bounce but was otherwise like a
glass wall as the Germans and Italians played to a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria _ the U.S. team's next opponent _ defeated North Korea
2-1 in the other first-round match, in front of 17,102 spectators.
You were left with the distinct feeling that the crowd, much more
respectful than rowdy, was taking in the day's actions like deep
breaths between fits of U.S.-fed hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the denizens appeared as rooted to their seats
as plants. Oh, wait, those were potted palms occupying a whole row
of prime midfield seats.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there were stretches when it was so quiet you could
almost hear the photosynthesis taking place. As surely as those
fronds were taking carbon dioxide and water and turning them into
sugar in the afternoon sunlight, so were the faultfinders
processing their sour soliloquies on female sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers draw more to a Phil Jackson press conference and all
that.
</P>
<P>
   You want to reply, oh, behave! After all, groovy lies in the
eyes of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the crowd,'' said German coach Tina Theune-Meyer.
``They were very fair and they were very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   To German defender Steffi Jones, the crowd was large enough to
grow goose pimples on her arms despite the 82-degree heat. Jones,
the daughter of an American serviceman, said she was nervous making
her debut on U.S. soil in front of so many people.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is the kind of athlete jingo-istic sports radio hosts
could learn to extol, if only they'd give her a chance. She'll
pleasantly answer the most banal of questions and she even offered
one journalist the shirt off her back in a gesture that underscored
the real difference between male and female footballers.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches, too, are not your ordinary Joe Gibbses. The Italian
coach, Carlo Facchin, looks like Jud Hirsch and drives a point home
like no coach you've heard in L.A. Not since Magic Johnson chased
the erudite Paul Westhead away, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which Facchin dissected his team was the way you
wished Larry Robinson had taken apart the 1998-99 Kings or Kurt
Rambis, the 1999 Lakers. Davey Johnson ought to be so blunt about
his Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't express ourselves with the same creativity,''
Facchin said of the Italians, who lost their 1-0 lead in the 61st
minute on a goal by Bettina Wiegmann. ``We lack courage. We're very
strong, but we have defects. When we have more conviction of being
a team, that's when we'll be a team.''
</P>
<P>
   No stepping around the truth to spare any egos there.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK. You can tell the women are tough. And not just
because they have to be constantly reminded it's a good thing to
fall when fouled.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell they're not the coddling type because more than a
dozen of them stood shoulder-to-shoulder, scared still as statues,
for half an hour, their World Cup dreams and their lives, literally
suspended, and survived not only to tell about it but to take the
very next elevator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel (staff) did everything to get them out and when the
doors opened, (the players) laughed and got right back on an
elevator,'' said Germany's Theune-Meyer, sounding bemused.
</P>
<P>
   Rottenberg, the goalkeeper, could joke about it with a reporter.
But she said she wasn't laughing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed relatively calm on the outside,'' she said. ``But
inside I was not so calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned something today,'' she added, and it wasn't that
flukey goals like Panico's deflection happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more than six people at a time in the elevator.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Chris Holt walked the first batter he faced Sunday and had already
given up a run before his first teammate stepped into the batter's
box.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think you know how this story ends, you're probably
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This time there was no snowball effect, no buzzard's luck. In
other words, it wasn't your typical Holt ending. His
bend-but-don't-break pitching performance, coupled with Carl
Everett's monster day at the plate, highlighted the Astros' 11-3
victory over the Montreal Expos at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, who has a 2.27 ERA over his last five starts, won for the
first time since Aug. 21, 1997, and Everett drove in a career-high
six runs, including four on his fourth career grand slam. It was
his second home run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   What made the day even more meaningful for Holt (1-6) was the
fact his parents, Richard and Nancy, made the trip from Dallas to
attend the game on Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dedicated this game to my dad,'' Holt said. ``I told him
before the game that I was going to get him a win, and I battled
through and was able to do it. I didn't have my best stuff, but it
was good enough to finally get the monkey off my back. The offense
scored a lot of runs, and Carl Everett was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of Everett's home runs were to straightaway center field,
unquestionably the toughest place to hit a home run in the
Astrodome. Not only is it the deepest part of the ballpark, but fly
balls tend to die when they head toward the big wagon gate 400 feet
from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are two of the longest home runs you're going to see hit
to center field at this ballpark,'' Astros interim manager Matt
Galante said of Everett's blasts.
</P>
<P>
   But when you hit them as well as Everett did Sunday, they have a
good chance to leave any yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one was probably the hardest ball I've hit all
year,'' said Everett, whose seven home runs tie Derek Bell for
third on the team. ``They shut me down in the first two series (of
the homestand against San Diego and Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   ``My only theory today was to try to hit the ball hard, and I
did. But this was Chris Holt's day. Everyone embraced him after the
game. There's more to come for him. If he keeps pitching the way
he's been pitching, he's going to win a lot of games, because we're
going to score runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalk up Sunday's offensive explosion to back pay. The 11 runs
the Astros scored equaled their total in Holt's last four losses
combined.
</P>
<P>
   After losing three of four games to the Braves, the Astros took
all three from Montreal for their fourth series sweep of the
season. They open a brief three-game road trip tonight at St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero's fielder's-choice grounder scored a run for
the Expos in the first, and it appeared Holt might be headed for
another one of his infamous opening innings. But third baseman Bill
Spiers helped keep the damage to a minimum with a diving stab of
Jose Vidro's liner down the third-base line with two out. Moments
later, Spiers' first-inning single tied the score at 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy's had an outstanding couple of days at third base,''
Holt said. ``He's been unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio, who was 3-for-4 and scored three runs, had an RBI
single in the second, and the first of Everett's two bombs gave the
Astros a 3-1 lead after three innings. Tim Bogar's third home run
of the season _ all coming in the last 12 days _ upped the Astros'
lead in the sixth inning, and a rare two-run infield single by Alex
Diaz keyed a three-run rally in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos put runners on base against Holt in each of the seven
innings he pitched except the fifth, and they put the leadoff
runner on three times. But the resilient righthander didn't allow
another run until the seventh when Manny Martinez scored on Orlando
Cabrera's two-out double to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few times I made bad pitches, but I was lucky enough
that it didn't end up hurting me too much,'' said Holt, who has
allowed two or fewer earned runs in each of his past five starts.
``I got mad at myself a couple of times, because I know I can make
better pitches. But the bottom line is we got a win, and I'll take
a win any way I can get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt left the game with two out and runners on second and third
with the Astros grasping a 4-2 lead. Trever Miller coaxed a crucial
inning-ending grounder from pinch hitter James Mouton to end the
Expos' threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to get out of that situation,'' said Miller, who
did allow an eighth-inning run, only his fourth in 17 appearances.
``We (the bullpen) have let Chris down a couple of times before,
and it felt nice to be the guy to get him rolling. It also feels
nice that they (the coaches) are getting more confidence in me and
are willing to put me in those situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact they were on the wrong end of a rout, the Expos
wanted to get closer Ugueth Urbina some work in the eighth inning.
Everett's eyes must have lit up. Two of Everett's three career hits
against Urbina have been grand slams, including his last one before
Sunday, which came in 1997 when Everett played for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urbina is basically a slider/changeup pitcher,'' said Everett,
who has six multihomer games in his career. ``He throws a fastball
in the upper 90s, but he really doesn't use it.''

TARZAN'S SWING TOPS AUSTIN'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A new swinger topped a record-setting slate at the
nation's multiplexes as ``Tarzan'' edged ``Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me'' with an estimated $34.1 million at 3,005 theaters
during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan,'' Disney's 37th animated feature, beat the goofy
sequel by slightly more than $2 million as the musical comedy
posted the second-best opening ever for an animated film after
1994's debut of ``The Lion King.'' Strong reviews and a massive
marketing push led to ``Tarzan'' performing well above industry
forecasts, which had been in the $26 million to $28 million range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marketing department did a spectacular job in being able
to convince the public to see a film they already knew,'' said
Disney marketing executive Chuck Viane. ``We had never thought we'd
be able to beat `Austin Powers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Multiplex business was spectacular with ``Tarzan'' and ``The Spy
Who Shagged Me'' at well more than $30 million each, a solid
opening for ``The General's Daughter'' with $22.3 million and an
impressive $17.8 million for ``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom
Menace.'' Estimates showed an overall total of $129 million, a
record for a nonholiday weekend and well above the previous $124
million mark set over July 24-26 when ``Saving Private Ryan''
opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' tapped the family market effectively with that group
composing 65 percent of audiences, with more than 80 percent of
viewers saying they would ``definitely recommend'' the film, Viane
said. ``We saw lots of large families, with grandparents and young
children, going into theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie analyst Arthur Rockwell said ``Tarzan'' is on its way to
becoming another powerful franchise for Disney. ``It was a bold
move by Disney to lock up the rights to the character, which they
can exploit better than anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, said ``Tarzan'' benefited from drawing young teens and
could do as much as $200 million domestically. That would rank it
as the third-largest Disney animated film ever after ``The Lion
King'' at $313 million and ``Aladdin'' at $217 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word of mouth on `Tarzan' is amazing, and it doesn't have
any real competition for families until Disney opens `Inspector
Gadget' on July 23,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The strong opening underscores the ongoing strength of Disney's
core business of animated films at a time when rivals such as
DreamWorks and Paramount have been encroaching on its turf. Disney
traditionally releases a mid-June animated film, but its last four
_ ``Pocahontas,'' ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' ``Hercules,''
``Mulan'' _ have been viewed as slightly disappointing with each
grossing well under $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   New Line's second weekend of ``The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' with
Mike Myers as the swinging British secret agent, lost 42 percent
from its massive opening but still drew impressively with $31.9
million at 3,314 theaters. That brought its total to a stunning
$116.7 million after 11 days, making it the 127th highest-grosser
of all time and giving it a shot at joining the club of 26 films
that have topped $200 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   Also posting solid numbers were Paramount's opening of ``The
General's Daughter'' with $22.3 million at 2,856 theaters as the
John Travolta thriller performed in line with expectations. Studio
executives reported the audience for ``Daughter,'' with Travolta as
a military investigator, was predominantly over 25 as its strategy
of counter-programming toward adults paid off.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The General's Daughter' did very respectable business that
was brought in mostly by Travolta,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth weekend of ``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace''
finished a strong fourth at 3,019 theaters to push its 33-day take
to $327 million, $2.5 million short of ``Forrest Gump'' at the No.
5 spot on the all-time list and $274 million behind ``Titanic'' at
No. 1. The prequel's decline from its fourth weekend amounted to
only 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said most customers seeing ``Phantom Menace'' now are
repeaters and noted that creator George Lucas and distributor 20th
Century Fox made back their investment long ago. ``Everything now
is just gravy for them,'' he added. ``Even though it won't beat
`Titanic,' the numbers are still mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a distant but decent fifth place was Universal's
fourth weekend of ``Notting Hill'' with $7 million at 2,786 sites
to push its total to nearly $80 million. Disney's third weekend of
``Instinct'' continued its fast fade with $3.1 million at 2,129
theaters, edging Universal's seventh weekend of ``The Mummy'' with
$3 million at 2,332 to push its overall take to nearly $142
million.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were a trio of holdovers led by Warner
Bros.' 12th weekend of ``The Matrix'' with $1.4 million at 1,365
screens to push its total past $163 million to 50th place, topping
``The Sound of Music.'' Fox's eighth weekend of ``Entrapment''
followed with $1.2 million at 1,465 theaters and MGM's sixth
weekend of ``Tea With Mussolini'' finished 10th with $625,000 at
273 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's limited opening of romantic comedy ``An Ideal
Husband'' generated strong returns with $195,000 at 10 theaters and
will be expanded in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful box office performance should continue for several
more weeks with a trio of high-profile openings due shortly. Sony's
Adam Sandler comedy ``Big Daddy'' opens Friday, while Warner's Will
Smith vehicle ``Wild Wild West'' and Paramount's ``South Park''
both debut June 30.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ It was five years ago when the Rockets and Knicks
engaged in a lurching, brutish, disjointed, offense-starved affair
in the NBA Finals, and the TV-viewing eyes of the nation grew heavy
with disinterest.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in Houston we either barely noticed or hardly minded
that what we were watching was less than an artistic masterpiece.
To finally put a grip on the long-suffering city's first major
professional sports title, we'd have been content to watch a pair
of bull elephants dance in tutus.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty, after all, is in the eye of the beholder of the
championship trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why there is no complaining these days in San Antonio,
a town that is at long last ready to put aside its reputation as a
place that honors glorious defeat and usher in a new era with the
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Alamo City is filled with tooting car horns and
the music of a basketball fiesta, the sounds of the NBA in just
about every place else from coast to coast are these: Clank! And
Click!
</P>
<P>
   That's Clank! as in all of the missed shots by both teams in
this year's Finals, most notably the 1-for-20 stretch by the Knicks
in the first half of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   That's Click! as in all of those channels changing on all of
those TVs. Nash Bridges on CBS and 20/20 on ABC never had it this
good in the ratings game on Friday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there was no real reason to expect the 1999 Finals to
produce gripping drama in the first place. Consider that the level
of play in the league this year had already plummeted like a
watermelon heaved down an empty elevator shaft thanks to the labor
lockout, the compressed schedule and the first year post-Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Add on the fact that this is a meeting between the No. 1 seed in
all of the league, the absolutely sizzling Spurs, winners of 44 of
their past 50 games, and the No. 8 seed from the Eastern
Conference, the Knicks, a half-lucky, half-gritty Cinderella with
cornrows that is now being exposed for what it truly is:
overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   The result to date has been a pair of San Antonio wins that have
produced the largest 2-0 lead since the Enola Gay flew over
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is more than merely one championship series and one
set of TV ratings that is taking a hit here. It is the
entertainment value of the NBA game itself, which has been
declining for most of the '90s as a result of physical play on the
inside, a decline in fundamental skills from the increasingly young
players who enter the league and _ perhaps most important of all _
the suffocating effect of micromanaging and overcoaching that has
taken away the free-form jazz style of an improvisational sport.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why NBA commissioner David Stern _ years after he first
so cavalierly waved off warnings of impending trouble _ is
gathering a select committee of coaches and assorted executives
here in New York on Tuesday in an attempt to inject offense back
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk of both increasing and decreasing the time
on the shot clock and of moving the 3-point line either closer or
farther away from the basket. There is speculation about changing
the shape of the lane, making it wider at the base to clear out
more room in the middle and open up the game again to the drivers
and slashers who are most creative with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   This is how serious the Joint Chiefs of Points are: They're even
considering sending out a memo that would order referees to call a
foul when a defender is using his forearm like an ax against the
trunk of an oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   It says here that the most effective rule change would be to
eliminate the 3-point line altogether. It has become a cancer
growing wildly and unchecked throughout the body of the sport,
warping the game and giving us the yawning spectacle of players
spotted up along the arc watching one or two teammates work an
isolation play.
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA eliminated the 3-point line _ and the bonus for
long-range heaving _ it would bring motion back into the game. It
would also force players to rediscover the lost art of the 16- to
18-foot jumper that used to be automatic.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Knicks are struggling badly on the championship
stage, having failed to score 20 points in five of the eight
quarters played to date. The Spurs easily won a game when they
scored just 80 points, part of the second-lowest combined offensive
output (147 points) in Finals history.
</P>
<P>
   This is an ugly, sloppy and dull brand of basketball, as it was
five years ago when it was the Rockets and the Knicks. It's just
that from outside the emotional investment, it hits you right
between the eyes.

JUDGE WILL ALLOW WOMAN'S SUIT AGAINST STATE, CITY OF WENATCHEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sarah Doggett, one of 60 Wenatchee children the state
insists were sexually abused in the mid-1990s, has won the right to
sue authorities for allegedly kidnapping her and forcing her into
an Idaho mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpected move Friday, King County Superior Court Judge
Richard Eadie ruled that justice would not be served if procedural
problems prevent Doggett from pursuing her lawsuit against the
state Department of Social and Health Services, former Wenatchee
police Detective Bob Perez and the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   Also named in the suit are Child Protective Service workers Dean
Reiman and Pat Boggess.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett, now 20 and living in California, is the eldest Mark and
Carol Doggett's five children. Her parents were swept up in the
1994-95 Wenatchee child sex abuse cases where 43 adults were
accused of nearly 30,000 counts of rape and molestation involving
60 children.
</P>
<P>
   Perez accused the Doggetts of 1,000 counts each of child sexual
abuse. They were convicted of one count each of child rape and were
sentenced to nearly 11 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was released from prison in June 1998, after an
appellate court ruled the state failed to introduce evidence
showing the reliability of accusations made by one of their
children.
</P>
<P>
   While allowing Chelan County to refile the charges, the court
ruled any new trial may come only after a hearing on whether the
child's statements against her parents were tainted by coercive or
suggestive interview techniques used by police and social workers.
</P>
<P>
   Chelan County Prosecutor Gary Reisen has not said if he will
seek another trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Doggett's suit centers on her claims that her civil rights
were violated when she was ``forcibly removed'' from a foster home
in California on Jan. 4, 1995, by Perez and Boggess, a CPS social
worker. Five days later, the suit contends, she was forced to
accept treatment at Pine Crest, a psychiatric hospital in Coeur
d'Alene, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of Jan. 10, 1995, CPS officials in Wenatchee
invited Doggett in for a talk but almost immediately called a
LifeLine Ambulance to pick up the then-16-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing voluntary about it. They had an ambulance
(crew) come to the DSHS office in Wenatchee, tie me to the gurney
and drive me off to Idaho,'' Doggett told the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer. ``They put me in Pine Crest. The paperwork says
I went there voluntarily, which is not true, not true at all. Since
when does `voluntary' mean handcuffs, restraints and shackles
around my waist to the gurney?'''
</P>
<P>
   Doggett and other teenagers say they were forced into Pine
Crest, even though Washington state law forbids involuntary
commitment of those older than 13 unless they are a proven threat
to themselves or to others.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts on behalf of Doggett and several other Wenatchee
children to sue Pine Crest and its parent company were thwarted
when the hospital's corporation went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The state claims Doggett agreed to treatment, was suicidal and
had an eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those were their concerns,'' she asks, ``why did almost all
my treatment at Pine Crest deal with me having to remember sexual
abuse that never happened? They insisted that I'd stay at Pine
Crest until I admitted that my parents had raped and molested us.
</P>
<P>
   ``That never happened, never,'' she said. ``My parents never
touched us like that and I wasn't going to say that they did.''
</P>
<P>
   She was held at Pine Crest for a month. She never accused her
parents of any charge.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett's suit was filed in February 1997. In September of that
year, Doggett's Spokane lawyer quit, leaving the 19-year-old
without counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mailbox was filled with legal papers but none of them made
any sense to me at all,'' Doggett said. ``I was trying to find
another lawyer, but I was in California, by myself, with only the
money I was making as a cashier in a sports store. No one seemed to
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no way of knowing that if I didn't respond to the
papers, my case would be thrown out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Eadie, having received no response from
Doggett, dropped all charges except one against Chelan County.
</P>
<P>
   However, two weeks after the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
published ``The Power To Harm,'' a series of articles about
misconduct in the Wenatchee investigations and prosecutions,
Seattle lawyers Ronald Meltzer, Mike Rosen and Lynne Wilson agreed
to take Doggett's case and fought to have it reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's ruling, Eadie acknowledged Doggett should have
responded to the court papers. However, the judge said justice
would be better served if he reinstated most of the suits.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the facts at the time Doggett received the 1998 motions
to dismiss: she was young, confused, without counsel and suffering
from depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Eadie did not allow the reinstatement of claims against Cindy
Andrews, a state-hired mental health therapist, and Tim Abby, a
supervisor in the CPS Wenatchee office.

   EASTEUROPE-EU-DOUBTS (Plonsk, Poland) _ The post-communist world
in Central Europe is entering a new phase. After tireless and
largely successful efforts to align their economies with those of
western Europe, countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic are pushing hard for the ultimate badge of acceptance:
membership in the European Union. But at least here in Poland,
Central Europe's biggest country and thus its brightest economic
star, leaders now find that a sizable part of the population is

   MICROSOFT-GAME (New York) _ For most of New York it was a normal
weekend, but mingling among the natives was a group of very unusual
tourists, mostly current and former Microsoft employees, more than
a handful of them millionaires, who for 24 hours turned the city
into a game board. The scavenger hunt, which players call ``The
Game,'' is normally played in Seattle. But this year the game
organizers decided to ``raise the rims'' and bring it to New York
City to add a new level of complexity. At its root the game is a
frivolous adventure, but one fueled by the players' and designers'

   PASADENA, Calif. _ Marvelous Mercy Akide told anyone who would
listen that Nigeria was more than just a song-and-dance sideshow.
She was right, giving Cinderella a whole new look _ one with more
multicolored hair than Dennis Rodman and a goalkeeper (Ann
Chiejine) with more flair than Jorge Campos.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the chosen one did all the talking. Akide, who said
earlier in the week that her team was not afraid of anyone, not
only walked it, she talked it, personally making sure Nigeria's
third Women's World Cup showing was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Akide scored, then notched the game-winning assist as Nigeria
defeated North Korea 2-1 in their opening game of Group A action
Sunday at the Rose Bowl in front of 17,102.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of you know my name by now,'' Akide said. ``You
have to give a lot of glory to God and by the grace of God we will
be victorious again against the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.S. and Nigeria opened Group A with victories. They
meet Thursday in Chicago, with the winner assured a spot in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I don't care if we meet the Brazilian men's
team or the U.S.'s men's team, I believe in attacking football and
that's what we will continue to do,'' said Nigerian coach Ismalia
Mabo, whose team showed typical African speed and touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in football you have to take risks, especially in a
tournament of this magnitude and we will continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Falcons came into the tournament almost unknown
despite their easy road through African qualifying, outscoring
opponents 25-0. Because they rarely travel outside of Africa and
because they were winless in six previous games in Women's World
Cup action since 1991, few experts gave them any chances of winning
a game.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when they arrived in Los Angeles, sending shock
waves throughout the tournament after a 4-3 friendly victory over
China, one of the pretournament favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that victory psyched our girls,'' Mabo said. ``It
was a morale booster. We told the people back home what we had done
and we promised them we wouldn't be intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, they're certainly not afraid of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they (U.S.) are the favorites,'' Mabo said. ``But I
think we sent a message tonight that this team is going to fight to
the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be intimidated, we are going to attack
them and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria scored first as Akide muscled her way past a North
Korean defender along the end line in the 50th minute. She was
looking to thread a cross in front of the goal area, but with no
strikers cutting toward the net, she rifled a right-footed shot to
the near post.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean goalkeeper Jong Hui Ri had the post covered, but
Akides' shot was too strong, bouncing off Ri's arm to the near
netting for a 1-0 lead in the 50th minute.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea tied the match on a beautiful timing pass in the
74th minute. Along the left side, Jong Ran Jo sent a through pass
to a cutting Song Ok Jo, who was able to one-touch from five yards
out to tie the match.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't last long as Akide once again found herself free
down the right side after a pass from Patience Avre. With Ri coming
out to challenge, Akide slipped a pass in front of the net,
allowing Rita Nwadike to finish an easy tap-in to earn the victory
in the 79th minute.

NIGHTMARE OF A COURSE REALLY A DREAM

 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ One of the questions here has been whether
they'll get another one. After what we just saw, a better question
might be, why can't they get every one?
</P>
<P>
   This was a United States Open for the ages, a tense and dramatic
battle of man vs. man that was almost always dwarfed by the even
more intriguing matchup of man vs. course. It is not very often
that the pampered golfers of the PGA Tour covet the same role all
those vanquished Dream Team opponents did seven years ago. That is
to say, the basic players' mantra here was ``Beat me, whip me,
invite me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the tournament started, people said it would prove to be
a tribute to Donald Ross, the man who laid out this course 92 years
ago. As it unfolded, people said it was a tribute to Donald Ross.
And now that it's over, people can reiterate that it was a tribute
to Donald Ross. Never have so many been so humbled so happily.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a competition in which four men had a very reasonable
chance to win with three holes to play, and this quite obviously
has to go down as one of the great Opens of all time. Winning an
Open at any time is a thrill and great achievement. Being the only
man to break par over four days at this particular US Open gives
Payne Stewart an inordinate measure of satisfaction, all the more
so because in order to win his second Open title he needed to sink
a 15-foot putt on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to pretend I was Jack Nicklaus sinking a putt to win
the US Open,'' he confided. ``It's exciting to think someone might
now be out there pretending to be me.''
</P>
<P>
   The final nine holes of this tournament Sunday provided
extraordinary theater. First Tiger Woods, having squandered some
very good birdie opportunities by failing to make putts (turning,
for example, a very good birdie chance into a three-putt), injected
himself back into the hunt with birdies on Nos. 14 and 16. He was
very much in it until he failed to take advantage of a superb sand
shot by blowing a 4-foot putt on 17. As he marched to the 18th tee,
he was heard to take his Maker's name in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking in the bulrushes for the entire tournament was the
mysterious Fiji-born golfing machine known as Vijay Singh. He began
the day three strokes behind the leader, Stewart. By the 10th he
was 2 under for the day, and by the 13th he was only one stroke
behind Stewart and Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Singh was sailing along until the 16th. The golfing machine
began to break down with a drive into the left rough. His second
shot was flat, landing on an embankment about 100 yards from the
green. He got to within 15 feet, but he couldn't nail the putt,
settling for a bogey 5.
</P>
<P>
   The greens at Pinehurst No. 2 are often very close to the next
tee. We are talking verrry close. As Singh was addressing his tee
shot on the par-3, 191-yard 17th, a ball plopped onto the 16th
green and a tremendous roar went up. It was Tiger's second shot.
Vijay responded by nailing his tee shot to within 6 or 7 feet. He
wasn't dead yet. But after waiting for Tiger to putt out on the
hole behind him, Singh missed the putt. Now he really was out of
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Picture stuff was unfolding all the time. As Tiger's
playing partner, Tim Herron, was lining up his putt on 17, there
was a huge groan from the gallery back at 16. That was Mickelson
missing a putt for his only bogey of the day. Seconds later a great
cheer went up from the same people as Tiger was lining up his putt.
That was Stewart ramming home a 25-footer for a critical par.
</P>
<P>
   People would later ask Stewart and Mickelson if either ever felt
in control of the tournament. What nonsense. No one is ever in
control of a tournament at No. 2. The course is in charge. Getting
a birdie here is not cause for celebration. It is a warning. What
it usually means is that retribution is just ahead. There is no
such thing as momentum when you play No. 2. It is as if you're
taking it to the hoop and there is a shot-blocker on every hole.
</P>
<P>
   That's why what Stewart and Mickelson did over the final two
holes will go down in golf history. Tied for the lead after 16
holes of competition, each man hit his tee shot to within 6 or 7
feet on 17. Mickelson missed his putt. Stewart sank his to go one
up with a hole to play.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson drove safely on 18. Stewart caught the left rough. He
took no chances getting out with a 9-iron, and then he delivered a
lob wedge about 15 feet below the hole, even as Mickelson was on in
two with a 20-footer, but a typically diabolical Pinehurst
20-footer.
</P>
<P>
   The rangy lefty had to settle for par. Stewart stood over his
putt, determined it was ``inside left,'' made sure he kept his head
still (a handy tip from his wife), and dropped it in.
</P>
<P>
   Winning this tournament was work. ``I'm fatigued,'' said
Stewart. ``I'm tired. I know I should be hungry, but I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   To win at Pinehurst requires a special combination of skill and
resolve. That's why the good players love playing here. So what if
there were only four subpar rounds in the final three days? This is
a course that, without being tricked up, puts a little hair on your
chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the course,'' saluted Mickelson. ``I'm sure everyone
would tell you this. It's a course that tests all of your shots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the USGA is very pleased with what happened this
week,'' declared Payne Stewart, the new US Open champion. ``The
golf course stood the test.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, Payne. You stood the test. The golf course just
invited you to give it your best shot.

ITALY TIES GERMANY
</HEADLINE>

By JIM BARRERO  
 Staff Writer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Italy coach Carlo Facchin pondered the
question for a moment and was quick and straightforward with his
response. Was Italy pleased with getting a point out of Sunday's
1-1 tie with Germany in a Group B Women's World Cup match in front
of 17,102 at the Rose Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we were,'' Facchin said. ``This was not Mexico (we
played), it was Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Had the opponent been Mexico _ a 7-1 loser to Brazil in the
other Group B match, Saturday at Giants Stadium _ Facchin might
have been a bit more disenchanted with the result. But against one
of the tournament's top four seeds, getting a point after the
team's first match was pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Germany is a good team,'' Italy midfielder Antonella
Carta said. ``I would say they probably have the best players in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so a few American women might beg to differ, but the point
is clear. A tie leaves this group wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every game, we want to win,'' said Germany coach Tina
Theune-Meyer. ``But today I can live with a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which will play Brazil on Thursday in Chicago prior to
the United States-Nigeria match, scored its goal in the first half
on a header by diminutive striker Patrizia Panico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the Germans didn't really consider me because I am not
as tall,'' said a smiling Panico, who stands 5-foot-4 and was wide
open just 10 feet from the goal when she headed Carta's chip past
German goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg. ``I just waited for the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rottenberg and Theune-Mayer said defender Doris Fitschen was out
of position on the play, leaving Panico unmarked for the
36th-minute goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then the ball deflected off (Fitschen's) leg and I didn't
have a chance,'' Rottenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, Italy's counterattack kept Germany on its heels,
drawing numerous fouls and creating several quality chances in its
bid for the upset. The second half, however, was a different story
as Germany began to play the type of game it has shown in the past
to rank it among the best teams in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the first 15 minutes of the second half would be
hell,'' Carta said.
</P>
<P>
   That it was as Germany peppered Italy goalkeeper Giorgia Brenzan
with shot after shot, including one by Maren Meinert on a volley
that hit the crossbar two minutes into the final 45. Carta
countered for Italy on a direct kick just above the arc with her
own crossbar-rattling blast just five minutes later, but the score
remained tied.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans finally cracked Italy in the 61st minute when Birgit
Prinz drew a hard tackle from Roberta Stefanelli on the left wing,
resulting in a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   Bettina Wiegmann scored the equalizer, sending a low shot into
the right corner of the net. Brenzan guessed correctly but didn't
have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team really threatened down the stretch, although
Germany averted a near-disaster when Panico's cross deflected off
defender Kerstin Stegemann, trickling past Rottenberg just by the
left post for a corner kick.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegmann, who with her teammates will play Mexico on Thursday in
Portland, remembers the last time Italy and Germany played to a 1-1
tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the European Championships in 1997 and it was one of
the first games,'' Wiegmann said. ``But in the end, we ended up
champions. If the same result happens here, we'll be happy.''

THE REIGN OF PAYNE 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Payne Stewart, who tasted the sting of defeat
a year ago in the US Open at San Francisco's Olympic Club, said on
the eve of Sunday's final round of the 99th championship over the
storied No. 2 course at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club that
whoever won would do it around and on the greens. He proceeded to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   This may have been the most gutsy performance seen in the
nation's major tournament, culminating when Stewart sank a 15-foot
putt on the 18th hole to win the championship. After all, Stewart
missed the first four greens on the back side in regulation, but he
made perhaps the two biggest putts of his career on the 16th to
save par and on the 18th to save the par that won him the Open for
the second time.
</P>
<P>
   That brought him home in 68-69-72-70_279, 1 under par, to finish
one shot in front of playing partner Phil Mickelson (70_280), who
missed a birdie putt from 25 feet on the 72d hole that would have
forced a playoff Monday. Tiger Woods (70_281) missed a rash of
short putts that cost him his second major championship, and PGA
Championship winner Vijay Singh (69_281) saw his chances dashed on
the 16th, when he endured his only bogey of the round out of the
heavy left rough.
</P>
<P>
   As defender Lee Janzen said Saturday, ``I've been asked many
times what the hardest golf course is I've ever played. Now I have
the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Steve Stricker (73_285) broke par in the third round with a
1-under 69. Singh and Dudley Hart (69_291, tied for 17th) were in
subpar numbers Sunday. The course was applauded, but the USGA's
set-up drew considerable criticism.
</P>
<P>
   It still stood the test and produced a rousingly competitive
show that brought out the best in Stewart, who won a title to go
with the one he won at Hazeltine eight years ago in a playoff with
Scott Simpson. Just a year ago, Stewart shot a closing 74 to
Janzen's 68 to lose by a shot. This was all forgotten Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This championship essentially came down to the final three
holes. Stewart's chip on the 16th, where ``for some reason I felt I
needed to make it,'' went 25 feet past the hole. He made the
par-saving putt. Mickelson pulled a 3-iron into the rough, chopped
it out, hit a 3-iron to 8 feet, and missed for his lone bogey.
Stewart's 6-iron on the par-3 17th settled in within 3 feet of the
pin. Mickelson missed his birdie attempt.
</P>
<P>
   There was the constant presence of Woods, who made a twisting
putt on the 14th for his third birdie of the day but pulled his tee
shot on 17 and ended up missing a putt to save par that he said was
8 feet but seemed a lot closer. When he missed a curling putt for
birdie on the 18th, all he could do was sit and watch. ``I did
everything I possibly could do to hang in there,'' said Woods, who
missed a par putt from inside 3 feet on 11.
</P>
<P>
   So it came down to Stewart, who said his first victory, in 1982
at Quad Cities, will also be his fondest because his father was
able to see it before he died of cancer, and Mickelson, whose wife
Amy is expecting their first child before the end of the month.
Mickelson struck a gorgeous second shot into the 18th hole after
Stewart's tee ball strayed into the right rough. He pitched short
of the trap to the front right of the green.
</P>
<P>
   This is where it seemed there might be an 18-hole playoff. After
Mickelson missed his birdie putt, Stewart stood over his par-saver
from 15 feet and looked up just in time to see it go into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the putting green last night,'' he said, ``and my
wife (Tracey) told me I was moving my head when I putted. I didn't
move it once today. I read the putt. I just knew it was going to go
to the right. I looked up when it was 2 feet from the hole, and
couldn't believe it was going in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt with three holes to go, I was in control of the
tournament,'' said Mickelson ``I was leading, and it's a very
difficult course to make birdies on. It's unfortunate that the only
bogey came on the 16th hole. I felt I still had a very good chance,
even until the last putt. Payne made two exceptional putts on 16
and 18, and I think those putts showed a lot of character. I putted
well, but I pulled the two on 17 and 18 and missed by an inch or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do was give myself a chance,'' said Stewart,
who hit only seven greens in regulation. ``I never gave up. I
didn't hit that many great shots, but I got the job done. I said
yesterday if I won again I was going to enjoy it. If I told you my
emotions, I'd choke up.''

MARTINEZ MASTERFUL AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-RANGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's becoming a hitter's nightmare, the kind that
figures to be repeated a lot this season. It begins with Pedro
Martinez and his 90 mile-per-hour fastball, and it ends with Tim
Wakefield and his dancing knuckleball.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it went Sunday at Fenway Park, where the Red Sox
defeated the Texas Rangers, 5-2, before 31,501. Martinez scattered
six hits and struck out 10 while allowing just one run before
departing after eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   After two Red Sox relievers got one out, Wakefield came into the
game to retire the last two batters, striking out one, as he
notched his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory and a Yankees loss to Anaheim, the Red Sox
pulled to within half a game of first-place New York in the AL
East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing _ again _ is how Pedro pitched,'' said Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams. ``He sets the tone. He really competed out
there. He kept us in the game early when we didn't capitalize on
some situations. He just kept pitching and getting outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the same in every game and every start. To say the
least, he's kept us in every game. He must be pitching pretty darn
good. And we've got some relievers who have picked him up and done
a nice job. When he does pitch, we play good defense behind him.
The pitches that he has and the heart to compete makes him pretty
special.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would have blamed Martinez if he had viewed Sunday's
start with some concern. Texas has a power-packed lineup, but the
Rangers couldn't dent Martinez until the fourth, when Rafael
Palmeiro drove in a run with a sacrifice fly. Boston rallied for
three runs in the bottom of the inning off rookie Ryan Glynn (0-2),
who allowed three runs on eight hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Until the ninth, Texas wouldn't score again. Maybe part of the
reason is because since Martinez lost, 13-1, to Montreal June 9,
he's viewing each opponent with equal respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to fall into that trap,'' he said. ``There is no
one weak team in this league. Everybody here is a big leaguer, and
that's how I take them all. I pitch with the same intensity that I
do with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Rangers? One of the best, you might say. But they're all
good. Montreal knocked me out and stopped my roll after nine (wins)
in a row. They were supposed to be the underdog. (Sunday) I went
out and competed and felt comfortable after the third inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Martinez felt much better after the fourth-inning
rally by his teammates. The inning began as Damon Buford reached on
an error by shortstop Royce Clayton. Trot Nixon brought him home
with the second of his three hits, a triple to the triangle in deep
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to drive the ball up the middle or to the left
side,'' said Nixon. ``It's something I have to work on more and
more. It felt good. I got a pitch where I wanted it and I didn't
try to do much with it. I thought (Roberto) Kelly had a bead on it.
I didn't think I hit it that good. When I saw him stop short of the
wall, I knew that I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to help the team out. I haven't done that much
this year. I just tell myself to keep working, keep battling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon scored on a single by Jose Offerman, who scored from first
on a double by John Valentin. In the eighth, the Sox scored two
more runs after a leadoff double by Jason Varitek and consecutive
singles by Nixon, Offerman, and Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield seemed perfectly at ease with his new role as closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer I do it the more comfortable I feel doing the job
I'm asked to do,'' said Wakefield. ``I handle it the same way as if
I'd been a starter. I'm not going to get beat with my second or
third pitch. I'm going to go out and do what I know best, which is
to throw knuckleballs to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the performance of the Red Sox starter that was on
the minds of the Rangers afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martinez is very, very good,'' said Mark McLemore. ``He was
outstanding. The scary part about it is that he's better than that.
He didn't have his A game. He had his A-minus game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates said his potent team, which has
played 13 of the last 16 games on the road, has been battling
top-notch pitching along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not swinging the bats real well,'' he said. ``You put a
Pedro on the mound and that's not a good mixture for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been struggling for three weeks to get our offense going
the way we know we can. But in the last three weeks, we've faced
the likes of Roger Clemens, David Cone, Randy Johnson, Andy Benes,
and Kevin Brown. That's a pretty good bunch.''

TRINIDAD'S CREDENTIALS NOT OVERWHELMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Quick. Who's the best fighter Felix Trinidad has
beaten?
</P>
<P>
   Thought so. No one comes to mind, which raises this question: Is
the jury still out on the fighter who is expected to give Oscar De
La Hoya the toughest fight of his career on Sept. 18 in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad's most significant victory might be his eighth-round
knockout of Oba Carr in 1994. Beyond that, he beat capable but
forgettable Maurice Blocker to win the IBF welterweight title in
1993 and outpointed fading, 35-year-old Pernell Whitaker in
February.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't the kind of credentials one might expect from a
fighter with Trinidad's reputation. At least that's how Robert
Alcazar, De La Hoya's trainer, sees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who has he fought? Give me one good fighter,'' said Alcazar,
speaking at a news conference on Saturday at Universal Studios to
promote the fight. ``... People think this is the best fighter
Oscar is going to face. I don't see it that way. I think Trinidad
is a good fighter but not the best. Ike Quartey is one of a few
that are better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I see the difference is Trinidad is too weak for De La
Hoya, and De La Hoya is smarter _ smarter and stronger. And I see a
weakness. Trinidad is quick, he hits hard with both hands, he's a
good technician, but that's from the waist up. From the waist down,
he doesn't know how to walk around the ring. No balance, no
nothing. It's much the same as (Rafael) Ruelas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be a big advantage for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, De La Hoya has faced better competition.
</P>
<P>
   He outpointed Quartey, a bona fide star, in February and has
beaten Genaro Hernandez, Miguel Angel Gonzalez, Carr and a younger,
better Whitaker, all of whom were credible opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Trinidad believes De La Hoya is more hype than substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar has done very well marketing himself, but he's not the
boxer people think he is,'' he said through an interpreter. ``I
won't tell you what I think his weaknesses are. On Sept. 18, you'll
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Don King, Trinidad's promoter, admits his fighter has yet to
become one of history's most-revered champions. However, a
convincing victory over the Golden Boy could change that radically.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the fight to the first Roberto Duran-Sugar Ray
Leonard matchup in 1980, in which King promoted Duran, and Bob Arum
(De La Hoya's promoter) handled Leonard. Duran captured the
attention of the world when he won a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly like that fight,'' King said. ``Leonard was the
darling of America, Duran was mine, and Duran took him. It's the
same situation with this fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``... (Trinidad's) a superstar with all of us who recognize his
talents. However, this fight, in one fell swoop, could do more than
reams of stories (about Trinidad) could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight says it all. If he knocks out Oscar as I predict he
will, he'll capture everything De La Hoya has in addition to what
he has.''
</P>
<P>
   What does De La Hoya have to say?
</P>
<P>
   Not much. Of course, he predicts a victory but prefers to let
Trinidad do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``May the best man win,'' he said _ smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Odd couple: The De La Hoya-Trinidad matchup has created strange
bedfellows: arch rivals King and Arum, who have worked side-by-side
only a handful of times over their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Arum was livid that King, Trinidad and Co. were an hour and a
half late for the outdoor news conference, which left hundreds of
De La Hoya fans and members of the media wilting under the hot
afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   However, he didn't complain after the eighth of nine conferences
on the promotional tour. Believe it or not, both Arum and King were
complimentary of one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conduct today was inexcusable,'' Arum said. ``But I must
say it's the first time it's happened on the tour. He has really
worked hard trying to sell the event. Sometimes he gets long-winded
and carried away with himself, but I suppose that's the price you
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a professional. We don't have many professionals as
promoters in this sport these days.''
</P>
<P>
   King was equally magnanimous.
</P>
<P>
   He publicly congratulated Arum on his induction into the
International Boxing Hall of Fame, to which King already belongs,
and said he harbors no grudges in spite of years of bad blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have had our differences, but the man is a
professional,'' King said. ``He was just inducted into the Hall of
Fame. He deserves it. I have no difficulties with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, this fight is of historic proportions. I think, on
Bob's part and my part, we dare not jeopardize history because of
personal idiosyncrasies.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling groovy: De La Hoya seems to be in fine spirits these
days.
</P>
<P>
   He recently fired longtime adviser Mike Hernandez, among others,
and feels he has gained more control over his own destiny, which
gives him what has eluded him for years: peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   That and the excitement of his biggest fight have inspired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time I've noticed myself really focusing even
before training,'' he said. ``I have my game face on already. I
really feel it, it feels different. Since I made my changes outside
the ring, I feel much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge load I was carrying. I dumped the excess baggage.
It's a smooth ride from now on. It's time to take it to another
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Hand injury: De La Hoya said the hand he injured in his last
fight, against Carr last month, is healed.
</P>
<P>
   He strained tendons in his left hand early in the bout and was
in pain the rest of the way. He wore a cast for about week but is
now able to spar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez-De La Hoya vs. Vargas: Raul Marquez, who is scheduled to
challenge IBF junior welterweight champion Fernando Vargas on July
17 in Lake Tahoe, has a secret weapon in his corner: De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who befriended Marquez when both fought for the
United States in the 1992 Olympics, has allowed Marquez to train in
his Big Bear camp and has helped with training expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've supplied sparring partners and helped any way we can,''
De La Hoya said. ``He didn't have training expenses, so we helped
out there, too. He was at every disadvantage. We wanted to make
sure everything was even.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my buddy.... When everyone was losing and going their own
way (in the Olympics), Marquez was right behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad De La Hoya can't get into the ring with Vargas. That's
the help Marquez really needs.
</P>
<P>
   Breath taking?: P.J. Goossen of North Hollywood, who lost a
monumentally one-sided decision to Hector ``Macho'' Camacho on
Friday in Struthers, Ohio, said Sunday that a third-round punch
broke three of his ribs.
</P>
<P>
   That left him gasping for air and unable to fight to his ability
the remainder of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even get quarter breaths,'' said Goossen, who had
X-rays taken in Ohio. ``I looked (lousy) for that reason alone. I
couldn't breath. I basically went into survival mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``... He's a great fighter. I take nothing away from him. But
things would've been a lot different if I could've breathed, if I
could've defended myself and thrown power punches back.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen has had his share of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Among his setbacks, hand injuries have disrupted his career; he
was stabbed at a party, which kept him out of the ring for months;
and he broke his foot four days before he was scheduled to fight

   ``I can't keep saying it's bad luck,'' said Goossen, still
devastated on Sunday afternoon. ``Too many things happen to me in
boxing. I don't know. It's just very upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen, 29, also perforated an eardrum early in the fight.

<P>
   Rabbit punches: Michael Grant's unanimous victory over Lou
Savarese on Saturday was convincing but not particularly
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Many expected a dominating performance, particularly against
such a mediocre opponent, as he tries to bolster his image as the
best young heavyweight in the world. Instead, the 6-foot-7,
256-pounder looked ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that he has a lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, Jeremy Williams was outpointed by journeyman
Maurice Harris in a heavyweight bout....
</P>
<P>
   Cuban defector Joel Casamayor easily outpointed Mexico's Antonio
Hernandez on Saturday night. He is now in line for a title bid
against the WBA's reigning junior lightweight world champion,
Japan's Takanory Hatakeyama.

 WORLD CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They are the world champions _ the holders,
as soccer folks like to say. They played in front of more than
40,000 empty seats at Foxboro Stadium Sunday afternoon, and the
Norwegians thought that was just dandy. The Americans can have
their sold-out houses and their Nike ads and their magazine covers
and all the expectations and pressure that come with them. The
holders won't be insulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their home country, and if people want to give them
attention, that's fine,'' Linda Medalen said breezily, after her
teammates disposed of the Russians in what amounted to
semi-privacy. The Norwegians won't even think about Mia-Mia-Mia and
her friends until Independence Day. They're on the other side of
the draw, and they're going to be on the other side of the country
until they meet in Pasadena. ``We can't beat the US now because we
meet Canada,'' coach Per-Mathias Hogmo said, with Scandinavian
practicality.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Americans were playing Denmark inside filled-up
Giants Stadium Saturday, the Norwegians were practicing. Then they
had dinner and went to see ``The General's Daughter.'` They didn't
even bother punching up SportsCenter for the highlights. ``We know
who their players are because we play them so many times,'' said
Hege Riise. ``We don't have to watch them every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians have played their hosts 22 times in the last 12
years. They've played them in China, in Cyprus, in Portugal, in
Sweden, in Medford. They've played them in both World Cups. They
played them in the Olympic semifinal. They played them in March.
The Norwegians can tell you the names of Joy Fawcett's kids, Mia
Hamm's middle name, and Carla Overbeck's shoe size.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will either be in the Rose Bowl next month or they
won't be. The Norwegians have other things to worry about,
especially after Sunday. They were facing a Russian team that had
never played a Cup match, and for most of the day they had them
bunkered down as if the Russians were defending the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The stats were laughably lopsided _ 15 shots on goal to 2, 12
corner kicks to 1. And yet with a dozen minutes to go, the
Norwegians were trying to protect a 2-1 lead and nail down 3 points
that everybody, including the Russians, had already conceded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 19 chances and score two goals,'' Riise said, shaking
her head in disgust. ``It was more exciting than it has to be. We
have some work to do before we get any further.''
</P>
<P>
   They may be the holders, but this isn't close to the same team
that stunned the Americans in 1995, then humiliated them with a
postgame conga line. Only five of those players are still around.
So the Norwegians won't quibble if you merely label them ``one of''
the favorites this time. ``We are building up a new team,'' Hogmo
said. ``We are an outsider.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians struggled to qualify this time. The Germans beat
them. The Dutch tied them. They had to go down to their final group
match to clinch. They've been riddled with injuries _ Olympic
captain Gro Espeseth is out for the tournament, and Ann Kristin
Aarones, the leading scorer in the 1995 Cup, didn't play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian coach Yuri Bystritski said the Americans are the better
team, and the Norwegians won't argue. ``They are a big favorite,''
conceded Hogmo. ``And much should happen if they don't reach the
final.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Norwegians didn't mind that most of the 40,000 empty
seats Sunday were taking Dad out to dinner or watching Payne
Stewart win the Open or bronzing at the beach. They're not ready
for a full house yet. ``We have OK attention,'' Marianne Pettersen
said. ``It suits us very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians have plenty on their plate before the Yanks are
even on the horizon. They want to get a return ticket to Olympus,
which they can pick up by beating the Canadians in Washington
Wednesday. They've got a date with their Swedish neighbors in San
Jose in the quarters and a nasty semifinal with the Chinese back
here. So the Americans might as well be in another solar system.
``In every top sport, you must think of what is happening now,''
said Hogmo. ``You can't think of what is happening far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway had the Russians tied up and buried 6 feet under Sunday,
got sloppy for 20 seconds, and ended up having to bring in another
midfielder and play kill the clock. So the Americans can have the
hype and the headlines and all the talk about leaving a legacy for
females still unborn. The Norwegians are happy to be outside and
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely fine,'' Medalen was saying. ``We don't need
any more attention. If we do well, we'll get it later _ and then
we'll deserve it.''
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many opportunities were missed Saturday night at The
Theatre at Madison Square Garden and not all by the people throwing
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Michael Grant missed an opportunity to separate
himself from the pack of young heavyweight contenders who are the
short-term future of the division when he easily won a 10-round
decision from former contender Lou Savarese but was unimpressive _
though damaging to Savarese's good looks _ while doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Savarese missed an opportunity to reestablish himself as
a contender rather than confirm he is the fast fading pretender
most observers long ago concluded he was. All he got out of
Saturday night's tiff was a $1.05 million purse and another mugging
by his latest and possibly last opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Without question Jeremy Williams missed an opportunity to make a
case for himself as a legitimate heavyweight, losing a lopsided
decision to a last-second replacement named Maurice Harris, who
seemed to hurt Williams every time he landed flush on his chin,
which was often.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis, the World Boxing Council titleholder, was at
ringside and missed the chance to come away with a viable option to
a rematch with Evander Holyfield. Lewis had flown to New York at
midday to discuss his future and the possibility of substituting
the winner of the Grant-Savarese fight for either Holyfield or
mandatory challenger John Ruiz of Chelsea, but by the time the
fights were over there was nothing more to say on that subject.
Grant was the favorite to assume that role and he did his part by
winning, but he did not do anywhere near enough to make a case for
himself as a replacement for either.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the biggest loser of the night, Ike
Ibeabuchi. The African heavyweight sat at ringside, trying to get
close enough to Lewis to yell at him about a fight. Security kept
him out of ear shot and his own miscalculation kept him out of the
ring and hence out of sight of a chance to make a strong case that
he is ready for both Lewis and Grant.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons only Ibeabuchi and his manager could fathom, he
rejected a $400,000 offer to fight Williams in the semi-main event
Saturday night, which, as it turned out, would have likely resulted
in another smashing victory for him and a chance to increase his
leverage with the top heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasted with Grant's unimpressive victory, the exposure
Ibeabuchi would have received might even have elevated him to the
level he already thinks he's at _ the level where you get paid
seven figures to fight even questionable opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Cedric Kushner was so convinced this would be the
result of a Williams fight on HBO that he agreed to kick in his end
of the purse as well, which meant Ibeabuchi turned down $700,000 to
fight a guy who was slapped silly by a replacement who had four
days to get ready for him. After the fight, Ibeabuchi and his
manager, Texas attorney Steve Munisteri, tried to make their case
but it was weaker than Williams's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should Ike fight someone he feels is clearly inferior to
him?'' Munisteri said. ``You guys should be giving him credit for
that. He wants to fight the best and if Michael Grant is the best
he wants to fight him.''
</P>
<P>
   That is until someone began to pester Munisteri about the price
he would set for such a fight. At first Munisteri refused to
answer, his lawyerly instincts kicking in.
</P>
<P>
   He kept saying, ``We don't want to negotiate in the press,''
even though he was the one who brought Ibeabuchi to press row as
soon as Grant's victory was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the guy who chose not to fight,'' HBO analyst Larry
Merchant finally said to Ibeabuchi in exasperation, which led the
fighter to glare at him but say nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a frustrated Munisteri ignored his own advice and did
negotiate in the press, saying ``We'd fight for $3 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that was like saying he'd fight for $30 million
because Grant, who has a multifight deal with HBO, wants $3.5
million for such a fight and such a match is barely worth that, let
alone nearly double it.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, there were more losers than winners Saturday
night. In fact, on this night at least, they were all losers.

 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It's the big homecoming game for Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   No, there won't be cheerleaders, screaming and building pyramids
Monday afternoon at 2. Nor a band playing the fight song and ``Hail
the Conquering Hero!'' No homecoming queen or even the Queen of
England will blow kisses, although the Duchess of Kent usually
smiles fetchingly as Pete bows dutifully toward the Royal Box.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter. This address _ Centre Court, Wimbledon _ is as
much home as itinerant Pete Sampras has ever wanted. And opening
day of the 122-year-old tennis bash is a homecoming he's
increasingly yearned for as the arid weeks rolled by since July 5,
1998, when he won the last set of the tournament from Goran
Ivanisevic.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Frost wrote that home is the place where they have to
take you in. Although life hasn't gotten that bad yet for Pete, he
has seemed a man overboard and enveloped in a fog since leaving
London. Sure, he's No. 1 again, but only because his challengers
cringe at the thought of life at such an altitude. However, not an
impressive No. 1, winning only one insignificant tournament during
the 50 weeks since his fifth Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
   But Centre Court shines through the fog like a lighthouse. It's
Pete's sanctuary. Grass underfoot once more feels like a life raft.
He's through gasping and treading water _ ``I'll be tough to beat
here. The place brings out something special in me; it's sweet. I
feel more at home here than anyplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see why. Having won 39 of his last 40 matches at the Big
W, Pete begins his quest for a 20th century record sixth
championship in the champion's traditional role: raising the
curtain to reveal himself and the spear carrier, a canny but
erratic Australian lefty, No. 35 Scotty Draper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always feels good to walk out there for the first match,''
says Pete, smiling wide. Pete knows the route better than a cop
knows his beat, and always cuffs his man. Sitting and sunning
beside an outside court now, he contemplates his and Draper's
entry, side by side, into the open-ceilinged green room where
applause from all 13,120 seats will echo throughout the world. The
two will pause, turn and bow slightly at the Royal Box _ an archaic
custom, but part of the Wimbledon time warp _ and then go about
their first-round business.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pressure on me here.'' Pete is loose, congenial, more
relaxed than he's been all year. ``I know how to win on grass. I've
been through it, I've got the game. And if I don't, well, having
five titles is something I never even dreamed of as a kid. Catching
Bjorn Borg? (the Swede whose five spanned 1976-80) I never gave it
a thought. It was too far out of reach. But . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from the testy Sampras who had bristled at
reporters about the lack of American coverage of the year-end ATP
Championships in Germany where, with a respectable showing, he
confirmed No. 1 for a sixth year running. That incredible stretch
of constancy, a singular feat at singles, eclipsed Jimmy Connors's
professional record (1974-78). It also tied a musty mark of the
illustrious Big Bill Tilden in the pre-open era (1920-25).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking a new look at everything,'' Pete says, conceding
that he'd been ``selfish, self-centered in not playing Davis Cup.''
He has reversed that stance by volunteering to join the team in
Boston for the July 16-18 clash with Australia. ``But I knew I
couldn't stay No. 1 and play the Cup, too. I would've burned out.''
</P>
<P>
   His fear of overextending himself may have something to do with
repeated physical crumbles in long matches _ matches that, mostly,
he grittily won anyway. Because of his Greek heritage, he may be
something of a prisoner of a genetic dysfunction causing anemia
called thalassemia. ``Remarkable he's done so well,'' says a
specialist. Pete doesn't want to discuss it, but won't deny it
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been consumed by No. 1.'' Consumed? This is a word I'd
not heard from Sampras. ``Yeah, consumed. I think you have to be to
stay up there that long. It was my first priority _ me and No. 1.
Everything else was secondary. Personal relationships suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Love life? ``Yeah, everything. It was about me. I was a one-man
show. No teammates to take up the slack if I wasn't playing well.
The people around me had to understand that _ when I needed to eat,
to sleep . . . that's when it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all I cared about, every waking minute _ winning matches.
That takes a lot out of you. It's hard to be the man to beat in any
sport year after year. That's what I'm most proud of, that I
handled that pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the others who get close, or do get to No. 1
briefly _ (Marcelo) Rios last year, (Carlos) Moya and (Yevgeny)
Kafelnikov this year _ haven't done.''
</P>
<P>
   They've had their swallow of first cabin fame _ and gagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Pete nods, ``because it sort of explodes on them, and
they find out it's not just forehands and backhands. It's more than
tennis. It's a lot of things, handling the media and the
expectations, the demands on your time, day in and day out. It's
mental, getting up for every match. It's a whole new ball game when
you get there. Connors and (Ivan) Lendl, (John) McEnroe, Borg could
handle it. I got comfortable with it. I think it's a true test, a
sign of character to stay there. I'm proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers being ridiculed by Connors at the 1991 US Open. The
year before, at 19, Sampras had materialized astonishingly at
Flushing Meadow as the tournament's greenest champion ever.
Defending was heavy lifting that seemed to induce brain hernia.
Pete appeared relieved to be defeated in the quarters and go home _
``It's like a monkey off my back'' _ while Connors, at 39, was
grinding his way to the semis.
</P>
<P>
   To the feisty, flamboyant Connors, whose record of stratospheric
longevity Pete would snap seven years up the road, the Sampras
attitude was inconceivably wimpish. ``You have to die out there
defending your title. You can't be happy with that, with winning
once.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete recalls, ``I found I wasn't happy a year after that, the
1992 Open final I lost to (Stefan) Edberg. Up till then I was a
young guy with talent, happy to be one of the guys. Winning some
tournaments, making a lot of money, content to be No. 5. When
Edberg beat me, after I'd got off to a lead, it hurt. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one match changed my career. I wasn't sure I hated to
lose, wasn't sure what I wanted. But that loss stayed with me a
long time. I did hate to lose. I did want to win major titles (10
since) and be No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much to hate after that _ except his woeful busts
at the French _ and in six months he had signed the long-term lease
on the game's penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   But there was the feeling here that, in being consumed, Pete was
taking himself overly seriously, complaining unbecomingly. In a
Dangerfieldian manner that didn't fit an essentially unassuming,
good-natured kid, he whined about not getting enough notice when he
did win the Davis Cup for the US in Moscow in 1995, and for his
extraordinary stay on the pinnacle. Though he had a bully pulpit as
No. 1, he wasn't using it, reaching out enough to help a sport with
problems in his country.
</P>
<P>
   He may be acknowledging that, saying, ``Taking the early part of
the year off I had time to reflect. I thought about (Michael)
Jordan, (Wayne) Gretzky, and (John) Elway retiring after great
careers, really helping their games get more popular, and I
realized I want to do that. I've done No. 1, and if I can win here
or the US Open, maybe I'll stay. But I don't have to. I've got some
years left to play well and do other things, like Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean as much in the US as Ryder Cup, but maybe I
can help change that. I may even,'' he laughs, ``become an
ambassador for the game, become more accessible. Davis Cup had
never done much for me, but when I watched Jim (Courier) and Todd
(Martin) on TV in that wonderful win over Great Britain, I was
inspired. I wanted to be part of it if they'd have me. Play
doubles, do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier, the backbone, wasn't too keen. Pete's earlier refusals
probably cost the US the 1998 Cup, and seemed to doom the team
against Britain. ``Todd and I are the team, the guys who wanted to
play,'' Courier had said after the stunning 3-2 victory at
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim has softened. ``Everybody had practically begged Pete,
and he said no. But later he did call Gully (US captain Tom
Gullikson), and asked if he could help out. I liked that, and the
fact that he didn't expect a singles job, and would be glad to play
doubles. No doubt we're stronger with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been to Boston,'' Pete says. ``They tell me
Longwood's small, and it'll be a madhouse. Sounds great.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a homecoming, but maybe a coming to terms with the
responsibilities of a great champion.

FAST NIGERIANS WIN OVER WWC FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD GONZALEZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Nigerians might fast-talk a good game,
but the group obviously possesses speedy limbs to keep pace with
those jaw muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet-footed Mercy Akide and the rest of the charismatic
Nigerian cast quickly won over support from Sunday's crowd at the
Rose Bowl, emerging as an early crowd favorite in Women's World Cup
'99.
</P>
<P>
   As advertised, speed was the difference. The Nigerians
repeatedly broke free in the attacking third to create pressure
around North Korea's net.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, only the rhythmic fervor exhibited by the dancing
Nigerian faithful in the stands required as much energy.
</P>
<P>
   Days before, Akide served notice the Nigerians would ``shock the
world'' in the coming weeks. Maybe their stunning 4-3 victory over
global-power China in a recent, closed-door matchup was an early
sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, they're a force to be reckoned with,'' Team USA
assistant coach Lauren Gregg said. ``I think they're playing with
confidence off their result with China. They're clearly here to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nigeria, which flashed periodic weakness on its back line,
could have that liability severely exposed against the 4-3-3
formation the Americans will employ in Thursday's Group A matchup.
</P>
<P>
   So who's favored now?
</P>
<P>
   USA dazzled in its opening game to keep the inside track,
overcoming early jitters to thwart Denmark's resolve in a 3-0
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But upstart Brazil's explosive offense (it hammered Mexico 7-1)
joined Nigeria in boasting the tournament's most creative offenses
thus far. Both are obviously aiming to outlast opponents in
wide-open affairs.
</P>
<P>
   China, Norway and Sweden have also fared well, with Italy's
speedy defense making it the early surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico and Germany are on the other end of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans, because of their six-goal loss margin to Brazil,
are staring at an early exit. They must now play a defensive-minded
style in winning group games against Germany (Thursday) and Italy
(next Sunday) since goal differential is a key tie-breaking
criterion in group-play advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Germany lost the majority of 50/50 balls and sometimes seemed
disorganized in the back, although solid play in the middle often
offset its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sunday's sparse Rose Bowl turnout (17,102) was
disappointing, it was hardly unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the day we were worried about,'' said WWC '99
president and CEO Marla Messing, ``because the U.S. had already
played, the Father's Day holiday and the non-local matchups would
keep people away.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, WWC '99 has sold more than 485,000 tickets, easily
ranking as the best-selling women's sporting event in history.
</P>
<P>
   WWC memorabilia was clearly the hottest commodity on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't keep up, we were obliterated,'' vendor Sam Sheikh
said. ``We usually bring $3 per (fan) in inventory for something
like this. Today we tripled that to $9 per head and still almost
sold out.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Trot Nixon's first full season in the big leagues
hasn't been working out the way he had hoped. Mired under .200 for
the early part of the year, Nixon has worked his way toward a more
respectable average, but still the hits haven't fallen in as often
as he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday that changed. In a 5-2 Red Sox victory over the
Rangers, Nixon came through with three hits and two runs batted in,
including his first triple.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who raised his average to .242, has been working hard
throughout the season, taking plenty of pregame batting practice
with hitting coach Jim Rice, who has been tinkering with his
stance. Nixon's most recent change involved taking the bat off his
shoulder as he awaits the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep my swing in place, around the shoulder, at the
chest area, and I just go from there,'' said Nixon. ``It's good to
have a game like this, helping the ball club out, helping the team
win. And it's good for me, too. It keeps my confidence back up
there. It's a battle every day for me, and I'm just going to keep
battling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get out there in the cage, with Ricey and (manager)
Jimy Williams, everything starts to feel a lot better. I can get
frustrated but I just keep working.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start struggling like you are, like I've been, you
keep working every day, keeping that swing that you want, and
that's what I've had to do and that's what I'll continue to do
until playoff time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon drove in the Sox' first run in the three-run fourth
inning, as his drive to center went over Roberto Kelly's head for a
triple to score Damon Buford, who had reached on an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to drive the ball and it felt good,'' said Nixon. ``I
got a pitch where I wanted it and I didn't try to do too much with
it. I thought Kelly had a bead on it. I didn't think I hit it that
good. I saw him stop and I realized that I hit it pretty good. It
was a fastball in the inner half. The Rangers may have thought I
was going to bunt. That was a fun situation.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no one tougher on himself than Nixon. He wants to keep
improving his average, perhaps up to the .310 level, his average
last season with Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you're struggling, you're going to be tough on
yourself,'' Nixon said. ``I'm a competitor. I want to do well and
help the team. I want to do it all. At times, it gets overbearing
with myself. Sometimes it may hurt me and also it drives me to make
myself better.
</P>
<P>
   ``You battle the first time up and you get that hit and it kind
of relaxes you the rest of the way. I want to make contact, do what
you can to help the team, maybe bunt the guy over and make a hit
here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can hit. It's taken a little bit longer this year
than I expected, but I'm working every day, trying to make myself a
better ballplayer. The hits haven't come around but I know it
will.''

KINGS FINALLY ACQUIRE PALFFY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the boldest move of his two-year stint as
general manager, Dave Taylor on Sunday afternoon completed a
long-in-the-works trade with the New York Islanders involving two
draft choices and six players, the most significant of whom is
27-year-old right wing Zigmund Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Kings also acquired center Bryan Smolinski, 27;
journeyman goalie Marcel Cousineau, 26; and the Islanders'
fourth-round selection in Saturday's NHL draft. Smolinski will be a
restricted free agent on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders receive 20-year-old center Olli Jokinen, one of
the NHL's top prospects; 1998 first-round draft choice Mathieu
Biron, a 19-year-old defenseman; 1996 second-round selection Josh
Green, a 21-year-old right wing; and the Kings' first selection
Saturday, the eighth pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a marquee player,'' Taylor said of Palffy, a three-time
40-goal scorer. ``He's one of the most exciting players in the
game. Every time he touches the puck, he does something clever with
it, especially from the blue line in.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the trade should instantly improve the Kings, it
continues a path for the franchise that Taylor had vowed to avoid
since becoming general manager in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's draft will be the 33rd for the Kings since they
entered the NHL in 1967, and the Kings have traded their
first-round selection before using it 22 times. Additionally,
Jokinen and Biron join a long list of first-round selections traded
by the Kings either early in their careers or before their NHL
careers had begun .
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've given up a significant package of young
assets,'' Taylor said. ``But (with) the opportunity to acquire
Palffy and Smolinski and the offense they can bring to the club, we
were happy to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy held out for the first two months of last season, but
still led the Islanders with 50 points in 50 games. The Kings
inherit the five-year, $26-million contract Palffy signed in
December with the fiscally challenged Islanders. The contract also
holds a club option for a sixth season at a reported $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy's addition gives the Kings greater offensive depth and
firepower than they've enjoyed since the early years of the decade,
with such players as Palffy, Smolinski, Luc Robitaille, Jozef
Stumpel, Donald Audette, Glen Murray populating the top two lines.
Smolinski had 40 points in 82 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, Audette and Murray all are right wings, but Taylor said
Palffy and Audette can play on either side of the ice. Palffy and
Stumpel, his Slovakian countryman, played together with Nitra in
the Czech League in 1990-91, and also have been linemates in
international competition.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult aspect of the deal for Taylor was parting
with Jokinen, the third player chosen in the 1997 draft. Jokinen
had 21 points in 66 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL was determined that any trade of Palffy not be perceived
as an effort by the Islanders to dump hefty salaries. Nonetheless,
the trade probably will increase the Kings' payroll by $6 million
once Smolinski signs.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a 2 p.m. Sunday freeze on transactions, Taylor and
Islanders general manager Mike Milbury beat the deadline. The trade
then was reviewed by the NHL, which granted approval late Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an organizational decision,'' Taylor said. ``Without
question, the fact that we were moving into the Staples Center had
an impact.''

<P>
   SEOUL _ The Olympics are meant to promote peace, mutual
understanding, athletic excellence, and good sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   But those ideals were nowhere to be found Sunday at the closing
of the 109th session of the International Olympic Committee, the
first IOC assembly open to the press under new rules to promote
transparency. What could have been a time of gracious
congratulations to the winners of a bid to host the 2006 Winter
Games _ and a chance to reflect on how to improve the Olympic
movement _ instead degenerated into a day of name-calling,
accusations, and veiled threats.
</P>
<P>
   The committee bidding to host the Games in Sion, Switzerland,
had been mum about the Salt Lake City payoff scandal dogging the
IOC for the last half-year _ until its front-running bid went up in
smoke Saturday to rival Turin, Italy. With no fear now of offending
judges or burning bridges, the Swiss took out their disappointment
on an Olympic committee they accused of a vendetta vote against
Switzerland. It was a Swiss IOC member, Marc Hodler, who pulled
back the curtain on a pattern of influence peddling and excess.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the Swiss bodes ill for the difficult task ahead
of rebuilding the Olympics' reputation and integrity, a job that
will require Olympic states to unite and cooperate to promote
reform.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-36 vote for Turin also could make life difficult for the
IOC itself, which is headquartered in Lausanne, a mere 60 miles
from Sion. Already that proximity has taken its toll; on Saturday,
angry supporters of Sion's bid reportedly vandalized a statue at
the IOC offices and spraypainted the letters of the word ``Mafia''
into the five Olympic rings _ an apparent insinuation that Italy
bought the vote for Turin. Anti-IOC banners were strewn around the
garden, and protests were expected.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Swiss government voiced discontent, saying it believed
third-time bidder Sion ``had a very good chance of winning.'' The
Swiss Federal Council also announced, somewhat ominously, that it
should ``carry out an in-depth analysis at all political levels of
the reasons for the failure of Switzerland's candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, regardless of whether certain IOC members voted for
Turin as a backlash against the Swiss for Hodler's whistleblowing,
it could be payback time in the other direction. If the Swiss
government wants to be vindictive, it could wield legal and
monetary weapons against the IOC, which has enjoyed tax-exempt
status there for years.
</P>
<P>
   D'Bernard Comby, a Swiss parliamentarian and member of Sion's
committee, said that as the home of IOC headquarters, his country
has a duty to force the IOC to get its house in order. He cited a
recent decision by the Swiss government not to waive the
value-added tax for the otherwise tax-exempt IOC, and said other
laws may need to be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the IOC released a statement saying it
``understands the disappointment'' of the Swiss, but stressed that
the IOC chose ``freely and democratically between the two
finalists, both of whose bids were excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also chided ``the excessive reactions of certain
people,'' but hoped ``the traditional Swiss sense of calm will soon
prevail once more.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who lives in a luxury
hotel in Lausanne, said he has no plans to move himself or the
headquarters out of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch also defended the revamped temporary selection
process, under which IOC members could not visit bid cities, and
said he would object to reinstating site visits. It was during such
trips that wining, dining, and bribing of IOC members by bid cities
reportedly took place.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who himself has faced criticism of his lavish
lifestyle _ which this week was centered around a highly discounted
$5,460 presidential suite and a police-escorted Mercedes _ bristled
at suggestions from a reporter that he could exercise some
austerity to set an example for the entire IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a bedroom, I need an office, I need a car. That's
all,'' he retorted, adding that the reporter might suggest
appropriate cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC passed a new rule Sunday that members would be allowed
to accept gifts of ``nominal value'' only, down from a previous
$200 limit that was widely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, the IOC warned members traveling to the United
States that they could face questioning by the FBI or subpoenas in
connection with an estimated $1 million in illegal payoffs by Salt
Lake City to get the 2002 Winter Games. IOC director-general
Francois Carrard said the organization will provide members with
legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said the IOC would not resist questioning. ``We will
respect the FBI . . . (and) the Justice Department. We want this
problem to be finished as soon as possible.''

MARTINEZ HAS ALL THE RIGHT MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARTINEZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pedro Martinez breezed through one of the top hitting
lineups in baseball Sunday at Fenway Park. He yielded just six hits
and one earned run in eight innings as he fashioned another
Renoir-like masterpiece, brushing away the Rangers with a palette
full of fastballs, curves, and changeups in assorted hues.
</P>
<P>
   While Jin Ho Cho dedicated his first major league victory to his
late father Saturday, Martinez happily dedicated Sunday's victory
to the man who first handed him a baseball, his father Paullino,
who is in town from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic
visiting his sons. ``I think every game I win is dedicated to
him,'' said Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   He made Sunday's 5-2 victory against the American League West
leaders seem so easy. ``I was very comfortable on the mound,'' said
Martinez. He threw 108 pitches, 71 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez shows no signs of slowing down as spring becomes
summer. He struck out 10, marking the 10th time the AL strikeout
leader has reached double figures this season, the 48th time in his
career. He is on a pace to reach his career high of 18 games, set
in 1997 when he was with the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wanted to talk to Martinez and manager Jimy Williams
about next month's All-Star Game at Fenway, and whether Martinez
would be starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to (Joe Torre),'' Martinez said. ``I thought I could
have been the starter last year and the year before and I wasn't.
One guy gave me an excuse that he was being respectful to the other
guy (Greg Maddux). The other guy told me that a guy who had pitched
a perfect game gave the team a better chance to win. I have no
defense for that. I expect that. This year I just figure I'm going
to be there. I don't know what the excuse might be this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long way off. What is it? Three weeks? I'm not going
to worry about it now. What happens happens.''
</P>
<P>
   If what happened on the mound Sunday continues to happen, there
is no way in the name of Smoky Joe Wood that anyone can deny
Martinez the starting assignment after he took the major league
lead in victories with his 13th.
</P>
<P>
   He was near the top of his game, only yielding a few bloop hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as good as he always is,'' said Texas third baseman
Todd Zeile, who had a rough afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, who had hit safely in six of his last seven games, struck
out his first two at-bats, then grounded out to short.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had that sneaky 90 mile-an-hour fastball, a great curve,
and a heck of a changeup. There is not a lot to report,'' said
Zeile. ``He's a great pitcher. It's not just that he has good
stuff, either. He's a tough competitor. He's a smart pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek had the best view of Martinez.
``He had great stuff. He only made one mistake. Pedro did a
phenomenal job against one of the hardest-hitting teams in
baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What impresses me about Pedro is that when he gets in a tough
situation, he turns his game up a notch and takes it to the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Red Sox wrap up their four-game series against the
Rangers Monday night, Martinez has other games on his mind. He is
interested in watching his older brother, Ramon, pitch Monday night
in Lowell on his first rehab assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go and watch him,'' admitted Martinez. ``But the
Red Sox haven't given me permission yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team is getting excited about Ramon's game. Jimy had
a smile that you rarely see. I can't wait to see that happen and
the reaction we're going to have if he's able to come back here
soon. I know him. His mechanics. I think it will be a great idea if
I can be there.''
</P>
<P>
   You can bet his father, Paullino, will be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having a great time here,'' said Martinez. ``It's hot at
home now and it's much cooler here. He's having a lot of fun
shopping and just hanging around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Martinez brothers take after their father. ``He was a
pitcher, too,'' said the proud son. ``He was a pretty good amateur.
Felipe (Alou) and Manny Mota told me so. They used to play with
him. Unfortunately, I never saw him play. But he loves the game,
even now. Sometimes he'll drive by a field and a game will be going
on. He'll stop and watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   And right now, he's enjoying watching his sons.

SINDEN CONCURS WITH CUP CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden said he
didn't watch the entire third overtime of Saturday night's Game 6
of the Stanley Cup finals, but after looking at the video of Brett
Hull's controversial winning goal, Sinden said he believes the
right call was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I saw, and I didn't really see it like I would look
at it in my office, I thought it was an allowable goal,'' said
Sinden. ``You can't blame Buffalo for being upset. They probably
see it one way and the league sees it another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many goals this year decided by fractions for or
against. That standard should be maintained even though the players
are celebrating the Stanley Cup at the time you're trying to
decide. I can't comment properly on whether it was a good goal or
not. I know for sure they would review it pretty closely. It looked
to me as if he had control.''
</P>
<P>
   The man-in-the-crease rule has been a hot button-issue around
the league and not just for the Bruins (remember Tim Taylor's big
toe nullifying P.J. Axelsson's potential winning goal during
Boston's first-round playoff loss to Washington last year?). The
rule will be on the agenda for Monday's Board of Governors meeting,
which Sinden will attend in New York. Commissioner Gary Bettman
said the NHL braintrust is going to decide whether the rule is
worth keeping or needs modification.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started already,'' said Sinden, referring to the
discussions that have taken place on the subject. ``It should have
some meat to it now. The point of controversy here, as I see it, is
whether or not the player who scored the goal had control while his
foot was in the crease. If in fact the video goal judge deemed he
did have control even though one foot was in the crease, then the
goal should count. It's going to be a very interesting session.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the dilemma of such a rule is restoring the
spontaneity of goal scoring while keeping players out of the
crease. It's difficult to do without the aid of video replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it hurts the game if there were no fans in the
stands, but I don't think they like having these reviews all the
time,'' said Sinden. ``What I see happening is that they're going
to ask a committee to find a way to keep a deterrent that will work
to keep players from interfering with the goaltender but at the
same time, allow goals to be scored if there's absolutely no harm,
like in the Taylor example. This was their biggest fear, that a
Stanley Cup would be decided by the in-the-crease rule one way or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the league is looking at changing the rule to a no-harm,
no-foul concept. Sinden said that promises to open a Pandora's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you one thing, you now open up a discussion as to
what you mean by `No harm.' '' he said. ``What I think is no harm,
you may not. This rule works really good except in my opinion, it
cheats the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euphoria of a goal, especially for the home team, is
removed so often. You have to review these things, I think the
average time is a minute and 30 seconds; it just takes away from
the flow of the game. It may not be necessary to have it even
though 99 percent of the time and the incident (in Saturday's Game
6) might be in the one percent, but 99 percent of the time it's
very, very accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   But is the accuracy more important than the spontaneity? And if
it isn't, is the league prepared to have players push the envelope
at every opportunity?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to have a rule with zero tolerance, this is
the way to do it,'' said Sinden. ``But it spoils so many other
things. If we can find a way to deter the players from going in the
crease, that is what the rule was set up to do, if we can find a
way other than the fear of the video camera exposing them, then we
should look for it.''

REVOLUTION HIT STRIDE ON ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A year ago, France '98 World Cup was going
strong, and the Revolution were halfway into their annual nine-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Revolution have been able to maintain their
confidence and overcome the problems that plagued them last season.
Much of the credit goes to the goalkeeping of player-coach Walter
Zenga. But the Revolution also appear to be developing an
intangible quality of resourcefulness. They continue to display
some self-destructive habits, but they have been able to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are forming an identity as a team that travels
well _ 10 of their 15 points have been earned away from home as
they prepare to visit Dallas next Saturday. And judging by the
productive stretches of midfield play in a 3-2 win at Tampa Bay
Saturday, they have enough depth and versatility to be a viable
playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   There was a quiet confidence about the Revolution after the
match. They seem to be galvanizing at a crucial point in the
season, though there is some latent dissension, especially
regarding the situation of Edwin Gorter, who has been benched after
providing key contributions in victories over Chicago and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution also appear too willing to live dangerously,
squandering advantages through fundamental mistakes. The first two
goals of the game resulted from amateur defensive mistakes,
allowing Joe-Max Moore a simple chance in the fourth minute and the
Mutiny's Musa Shannon a half-field, uncontested run half an hour
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did enough to get the three points,'' midfielder John
Harkes said after the Mutiny game. ``But we make work for
ourselves. We were balanced and we forced an error and it was 1-nil
and we were playing well. But we can't let them back in the game
like we did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an important game for both teams. We want to put some
wins together and get away from the bottom two teams. And it was
important that we kept our level high.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, team morale is the Revolution's top priority. There seem
to be enough leaders to prevent the dissension and doubt that have
hampered the team the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga and assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi were bold and
pragmatic enough to use three different starting lineups as the
Revolution earned four points in three games over seven days. The
team showed the effects of the scheduling, appearing tired toward
the end of the game. But the Revolution remained poised enough to
compensate for errors and exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great sign,'' defender Dan Calichman said. ``If we can
play them in Tampa after we have just played a midweek game and get
a result, we should be able to take them next time, when we have
fresh legs.''

STAR-CROSSED HULL NEW DALLAS HERO 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ A millionaire many times over, his tongue often as
deadly as his stick, Brett Hull showed up at fame's front door
Sunday morning wearing unfamiliar clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Once the NHL's most feared shooter, known for avoiding contact,
drifting effortlessly to open ice, and driving home booming slap
shots, Hull wore the suit of a soldier in the closing moments of
the Stanley Cup finals. Limping and riddled with the pain of a
mangled knee and torn groin muscles, hockey's version of the Spirit
of '76, Hull popped the winning goal over a sprawled Dominik Hasek
to bring the Dallas Stars their first Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the whole world has left me,'' said a somewhat
subdued Hull, sitting beside teammate Guy Carbonneau on top of a
row of lockers amid the mayhem in the Dallas locker room after the
2-1 victory. ``It's done. I did it. And I don't have to answer to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the National Hockey League, no stranger to controversy in
the playoffs, that was left with some explaining to do.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's goal, a two-shot followup off a Jere Lehtinen chance with
5:09 remaining in the third overtime, came with the front half of
the Golden Brett's left skate blade clearly in the crease. By the
league's working standard of the last two seasons, with goals
routinely disallowed under such foot-in-the-crease circumstances,
it appeared the perfect case of a goal that would be wiped from the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   As the Stars rejoiced on the ice, an incensed Lindy Ruff, the
Sabres head coach, bolted from the Buffalo dressing room after
spotting Hull's encroaching skate on video replay.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had some 'splainin' to do, and Ruff was headed to the
top man, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, who stood at ice level for
the ceremonial presentation of the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Bettman to answer the question,'' said Ruff, his club
rubbed out in what was the second longest game in the history of
the Cup finals _ behind only the Boston Garden marathon that ended
when Edmonton's Petr Klima drove home the winner in Game 1 of the
'90 championship. ``Why is that not reviewed?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ruff, the commissioner turned his back on him and
said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He almost looked to me like he knew this might be a tainted
goal and there was no answer for it,'' said Ruff. ``I just wanted
an explanation. Just tell me. Listen, is it a good goal, not a good
goal? There was no answer. No review.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Lewis, the league's supervisor of officials, eventually
was the one left with the final interpretation, which he provided
in a brief news conference at approximately 2:15 a.m., some 45
minutes after the goal.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewis, Hull's foot indeed was in the crease, but
the goal stood because off-ice officials deemed Hull never lost
possession of the puck _ despite it bouncing off Hasek and leaving
the tinted blue crease before he reached out of the restricted area
to gather it in and lift it by a sprawled Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Cup came down to one word: possession.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Lewis and no fewer than three other off-ice
officials, sequestered in a video replay booth at the end of the
press box, Hull never lost control of the puck. As if some
invisible fishing line remained tethered to the end of his stick
and the black rubber disc, Hull followed up the carom off Hasek and
remained one in whole with the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that interpretation, which had Lewis sounding as if he
were trying to explain the mystery of the Immaculate Conception,
the Dallas Stars were the 1999 Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there reasons that a guy can have his foot in the crease
and score a goal?'' said Lewis, setting up his detailed explanation
of Hull's winner with a rhetorical question. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on the street, stunned Buffalo fans quietly streamed to
their cars. Many had tears in their eyes. In a city where their
beloved Bills lost in four straight Super Bowl appearances, this
was one more crushing defeat for Western New York sports fans. The
vast percentage of those who left the building wouldn't learn of
the controversy surrounding the goal until they heard it on their
car radio on the drive home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the drill,'' said one disconsolate fan as she headed
into the night, a sleeping young child cradled in her arms. ``No
one has to tell us when it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   An angry Hasek, who just missed getting a glove on Hull's
forehand lift, wasn't as resolute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me very mad,'' said Hasek, who in the first period
uncharacteristically let in a very soft goal, a Jere Lehtinen
lollipop that squeezed in at the left post. ``It could happen any
time during the season, but if it happens in a Stanley Cup final .
. . I still cannot believe it. I don't understand what the video
judge is doing. Maybe he was in the bathroom. Maybe he was
sleeping. Maybe he doesn't know the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules, said Lewis, are posted for every video replay judge
in all 27 NHL rinks. He added that a clarification of the rules was
sent from his office to all NHL clubs as recently as March 25. The
clarification, stressed Lewis, in part underscored instances when a
player can be in the crease and a goal can be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gutless move,'' was how Sabres forward Joe Juneau, a former
Bruin, summed up the whole affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to put my jersey on and go back out,'' said Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's return-to-action comment was eerily reminiscent of the
first round of last year's playoffs when what appeared to be a
winning goal by Boston's P.J. Axelsson was taken away in a
first-round series with Washington. Capitals netminder Olaf Kolzig,
not for one second believing that it was anything but a goal, took
off for the Washington dressing room at the FleetCenter. He was at
the Caps bench, ready to leave the ice, when a teammate told him to
stop, the goal was under review. Kolzig said following the game,
after the Caps won in OT, that he never noticed that Tim Taylor's
toe was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the game, Bruins president/general manager
Harry Sinden accused the league of a ``coverup'' in regard to its
inconsistency in determining the man-in-the-crease violations. Days
later, NHL headquarters decided to fine Sinden for his comments _ a
league employee went so far as to provide the Globe with a copy of
the league bylaws Sinden violated with his comments _ but the fine
never was levied.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres forced the overtime in Game 6 here when Stu Barnes
drilled home a Wayne Primeau feed with 1:39 to go in the second
period. It was the 26th shot taken on Eddie Belfour and the only
one to beat him of the 54 Buffalo landed on net.
</P>
<P>
   As the third period and three overtimes played out, referees
Terry Gregson and Bill McCreary put their whistles in their
pockets. By and large, play was clean, checking tight, quality
scoring chances few. Counting Hull's winner, Dallas held a 24-22
shot advantage in the overtime after being outshot, 32-26, in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The battered Hull, torn apart by an Alexei Zhitnik hit in Game
3, when he played only three shifts, said after the triumph that he
needed pain-killing shots to his left knee and extensive taping to
the knee and his groin area between every period to keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could have played a Game 7,'' said Hull. He
expected to have an MRI on his knee no later than Monday _ either
before or after the Stanley Cup parade in Dallas. According to
coach Ken Hitchcock, Hull is not a good bet to begin the 1999-2000
regular season, due to the severity of his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story on Brett Hull when the dust settles is going to be
an incredible story,'' said Hitchcock, who repeatedly referred to
his squad as a ``magical team.''
</P>
<P>
   Just prior to popping in the winner, the somewhat frail-looking
Hull told his linemate, Jere Lehtinen, that his leg and groin were
blown out and that Lehtinen would have to cover for him on defense.
He could get to the front of the net and take a shot, but he might
have nothing left, he said to Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Lehtinen unloaded an attempt on Hasek from the
left circle. Hull was in front to pick up the loose puck and
responded with his first shot on Hasek, simultaneously avoiding a
hit by a charging Brian Holzinger. With Mike Modano off to his
side, and his foot in the crease, Hull then reached out to his
right, picked up the rebound beyond the blue paint, and lifted home
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stops all the naysayers,'' said Hull. ``I don't have to
answer to anyone. I don't. Joe (Nieuwendyk) doesn't. Mike (Modano)
doesn't. Eddie (Belfour) doesn't. We won it.''
</P>
<P>
   With one little lift, nothing resembling the countless bombs he
has unloaded in his 12-year career, Hull shook off the seemingly
ceaseless criticisms of his play. The goal put his name on the Cup
and validated his game, and, to an extent, his place in NHL
history. Some six weeks shy of his 35th birthday, he proved himself
a gamer in the biggest game of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dream about it,'' mused Hull, thinking what it meant to
win the Cup. ``I dream about it _ it's just unbelievable.''

NORWAY KICKS OFF DEFENSE ON RIGHT FOOT

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Leaving no doubt that their theme song is
``We Are the Champions,'' the Norwegian national soccer team
dominated Russia Sunday, 2-1, in their first Women's World Cup
match. Though the final score seemed close, it did not reflect just
how overpowering the defending World Cup champions looked to the
14,143 fans at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians, who lost to the US in the World Cup finals in
1991, got the title back in 1995 and have made it clear that they
intend to keep it. So they had no mercy for Russia, which had never
before been to the World Cup. Norway struck early and often; its
players were quick to attack and shadowed the Russians as soon as
they got the ball. Eleven minutes went by, in fact, before the
Russians could get the ball out of their half of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm very pleased with the 19 good chances we had and
the good technical play we had,'' said Norwegian coach Per-Mathias
Hogmo. ``But it was a little more exciting than I like.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement came from forward Marianne Pettersen, who scored
a goal and had an assist, but also had many more opportunities. In
fact, she had 11 shots for the entire game; Russia's whole team
only got off six.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I did have a lot of chances, but I hope to score more in
the next games,'' Pettersen said. ``But I'm happy with the goal I
scored. It's comforting to see we had so many chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway's first goal in the 28th minute was textbook soccer, as
the red jerseys swarmed the Russian goal. Pettersen, at the top of
the box, took a pass from a teammate and headed the ball to Brit
Sandaune, who drilled it in past Russian goalkeeper Svetlana Petco.
Russia would finish the first half with no shots on goal, compared
to six by Norway. Russia's corner kicks were also a virtual
no-show: The team had just one shot, while Norway had 10.
</P>
<P>
   The second half was more of the same, as Russia couldn't put a
play together. Pettersen and Sandaune, meanwhile, paired up again
in the 68th minute. Sandaune lofted the ball in front of the goal,
and though Russian defender Natalia Karasseva tried to clear it
with a header, it landed at Pettersen's feet, and the forward drove
it in from the left side of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 minutes later, Russia finally came alive. Natalia
Barbachina, who was in front of the Norway goal, passed the ball
out to Galina Komarova, who was more than 20 yards out. But
Komarova fired and put it in the back of the net over the hands of
Norwegian goalkeeper Bente Nordby.
</P>
<P>
   That was all Russia would manage in its first World Cup
appearance. The team was held to two shots on goal for the game;
Norway had 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the match was close,'' Hogmo said. ``We played a
lot better than Russia, but we know they are hard to beat and that
it was going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian team insisted on looking at the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I am relatively happy,'' said Russian coach Yuri
Bystritski ``Although we lost the game, we're still students of it,
and we want to focus on the next couple games so that we're second
in our group.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway next faces Canada Wednesday, while Russia will play
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Hogmo said he's not thinking too far ahead, so he's not worried
about the US team or defending the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't beat the United States now, because we meet Canada,''
he said with an exasperated laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, let him take one game at a time. That, so far,
is working quite well.

HULL'S FOOT NOT RELEVANT TO VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ OK, fine, let's have a do-over.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the city that always weeps, the only way to assuage the
broken souls of Sabres fans would be to summon the Stars back from
Dallas, drop the puck, and keep the Cup clock running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe,'' said former Bruin Joe Juneau, after his Sabres
saw the Dallas Stars capture the Stanley Cup here Sunday morning
with Brett Hull's controversial goal, ``everybody will remember
this as the Stanley Cup that was never won.''
</P>
<P>
   The masses that line the parade route in Dallas Monday won't see
it that way. There will be no asterisk next to the long list of
Stars that will be added to the hallowed Stanley Cup in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When Hull's shot popped over a sprawled Dominik Hasek with 5:09
to go in the third overtime, Dallas was the Cup champion, and
forever should be remembered as a proud bunch of aging stars and
role players, festooned around some very talented younger legs, who
won with grit and determination. They shouldn't be remembered for
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   If they are, then shame on the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Hull's foot was in the crease, in truth, had no
bearing on his winning shot going in the net. If there is any
solace here for Sabres fans, it should be that. Up until the league
fell in love with its replay gadgetry, no one ever looked twice at
the kind of goal the Golden Brett scored. Hull also has blue eyes.
In this case, the color of his eyes and the placement of his foot
had the same influence on whether Hasek could stop the shot: none.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Lewis, ex-referee and the NHL's supervisor of officials,
went to great lengths to explain (he doth explain too much) in his
postgame news conference that Hull, in effect, never lost the
handle on the puck. What else could Lewis say? By then, the Cup
already had been handed to the Stars, the building was all but
empty, and hockey-mad Big D was in full gallop over the best little
dang Cup the West ever won.
</P>
<P>
   It stretches credulity beyond all reasonable limits to say that
a player is in control of his shot when it bounces off the
netminder. By that standard, Mike Torrez's right hand must have
sailed over The Wall on Bucky Dent's homer. If that's where
technology has brought us, then the vote here is to bring back
silent movies and the Stanley Steamer.
</P>
<P>
   Far better for the NHL to have told the world that the goal
counted, the Stars were the champions, and that it was dismissing
the niggling technicality that a couple of inches of Hull's skate
blade made it into the badlands. In other words, the truth would
have gone a long way.
</P>
<P>
   The league heavies, either commissioner Gary Bettman or Lewis,
also could have added that the whole mess only proved once more
that the man-in-the-crease rule, though well-intentioned, is
dysfunctional and undermines a lot of the game's great qualities _
speed, spontanaeity, competitiveness, just to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   A good number of fans enter NHL buildings, even in the Original
Six cities, unsure of the game's basic rules. Even those who know
the intricacies of a two-line offside pass can't untangle the
mystery of the man-in-the-crease violation. There is nothing more
mummifying for a crowd of 17,000 to sit and wait while a referee
grabs a telephone along the sideboards and talks goal with the
gods. Bettman is among those who wants those wait-and-see sessions
to come to an end. It can't happen too soon.
</P>
<P>
   The league has seen bad calls before, perhaps none so blatant as
in the deciding game of the 1980 finals, Flyers vs. Islanders.
Early in the action, linesman Leon Stickle didn't whistle an
offside call when a Clark Gillies pass left the attacking zone for
a trailing Butch Goring. Some 2 feet into the neutral zone, Goring
picked up the pass and dished off a relay that Duane Sutter then
knocked by Pete Peeters. The goal stood. It wasn't the Cup-winning
goal, but the Islanders carried on for a 5-4 victory, Bob Nystrom
banging home the winner in OT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I blew it,'' said a chagrined Stickle, one of the
league's best on-ice officials. ``Maybe there was tape on the stick
and it confused me. Maybe I was too close to the play.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, then Flyers coach Pat Quinn said, ``Nothing
should taint their victory. They worked hard for the victory.
What's done is done. It can't be changed, but it should be an
embarrassment to that official.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? We all got over it. A good guy made a bad mistake.
Things were different then, of course, because the world before the
proliferation of cameras, the Internet, and everyone being given a
phone number at birth accepted that no system is foolproof. The
constant bollixing of the man-in-the-crease calls shows that only
fools keep relying on foolproof systems.
</P>
<P>
   There's an easy answer to all this. It's not a perfect,
foolproof answer, but it gets the job done. Leave the
crease-interference infractions up to the referees' discretion, but
keep the replay cameras rolling. If the on-ice ref doesn't like the
look of a goal, thinks a player might have hindered a goalie from
making a stop, he can go to the tape if he feels it's necessary.
The tape then is a backup, not some machine that governs the game
like some Wizard of Oz behind the curtain. A toe in the crease
won't stop a goal from going on the board. That's all anyone should
ask of the whole process.
</P>
<P>
   No one with an ounce of sympathy can like what happened to the
Sabres. Based on where the league is today with its messed-up rule
_ the fact that it remains on the books _ Buffalo should have had
another kick at the can.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a good goal. Hull wasn't cheating. He made a gutsy
play to get to the net and provided a nifty touch to bury it for
the winner. It was a page torn from old-time hockey, and even the
most irate Sabre should be able to appreciate a finishing touch
from a time of old. The old game is fine. It's the new rules that
stink.

GHANA WALTZES WITH MATILDAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It took the Australian team 74 minutes of
ganging up on Ghanaian goalkeeper Memunatu Sulemana to finally open
the scoring in Sunday's first World Cup game at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It took Ghana about 80 seconds to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way their match ended, 1-1, much to the dismay of the
Matildas of Australia and the delight of the Black Queens of Ghana.
Most expect China and Sweden to advance in the tournament from the
group of teams that includes China, Sweden, Australia, and Ghana.
But Australia, preparing to host next year's Olympics and looking
to make its mark in soccer, has other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans suffered a setback Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That the Australians had far better scoring chances _ and that
Ghana was a player down for most of the game after midfielder
Barikisu Tettey-Quao was ejected for tackling from behind in the
26th minute _ didn't make the Matildas feel any better about the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we are disappointed with the result,'' said
Australian coach Greg Brown. ``We were playing against their 10
men. And we created enough chances to win three games. We created
chances, but we didn't put them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Sulemana had much to do with that. She had 11 saves in the game,
many of them outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Australian captain Julie Murray broke away from a
pack just over midfield and won a footrace in on the keeper for a
goal in the 74th minute, Ghana was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Vivian Mensah ran a nice give and go with
Patience Sackey, and when she got the ball back, she blasted a shot
at Australian keeper Tracey Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler got a hand on that one. But the ball bounced away from
her, and Nana Gyamfua, a substitute for about 12 minutes at that
point, pounced and put it in the net, thrilling the loud and lively
Ghanaian followers in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say we're lucky, but that's how we do it,'' said
Ghanaian coach Emmanuel Afranie of having a sub score the decisive
goal. ``She comes in in the second half and scores goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, who got the starting nod in net over Belinda Kitching,
made the first stop and caught a flash of Gyamfua approaching but
could do little about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the white shirt coming out of the corner of my
eye, and I was hoping someone was racing with her as well,''
Wheeler said. ``She still ended up with quite an angle to score the
goal, and she finished well.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was part of Australia's problem. The Matildas had chances
aplenty and had trouble putting them away.
</P>
<P>
   Australia had five corner kicks to Ghana's none. Australia had
26 total shots to Ghana's 13. The Matildas headed shots over the
net and wide of the net. Of those 26 shots, eight went over the
net.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing minutes, each team had a great chance to score.
</P>
<P>
   First, Ghana was awarded a direct kick from about 30 yards out.
Elizabeth Baidu shot, and the ball hit just under the crossbar and
bounced around near the goal mouth before the Australians could
clear it.
</P>
<P>
   Then Murray had the ball down low in the Ghana end, made a move,
and came toward Sulemana. The keeper came out and held her ground
for the save.
</P>
<P>
   ``In World Cup matches, you generally struggle to get chances,''
Murray said. ``We were in front of the goal on numerous
occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australians move on to a huge match with Sweden Wednesday
night at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in Washington. Ghana plays the
same night against China in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did not even think we could play this type of game,''
said Afranie. ``To me, this was good for Ghana and Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without Sunday's tie, the Australians said, they needed
to beat Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came away with 1 point,'' Murray said. ``We're not going to
sit back and think that it's the end of our World Cup. We've beaten
Sweden, we've beaten China, we're not overly concerned about it.
We'll relax tonight and analyze very briefly what happened in this
game. We won't mull over it for two days. We'll get set on what we
have to do against Sweden.''

 OPEN-DALY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Just three days after captivating the crowd
with his flamboyant game and candor, John Daly reemerged Sunday as
the troubled person he is.
</P>
<P>
   Daly was penalized two strokes for hitting a moving ball, scored
an 11 at the 485-yard, par-4 eighth hole, closed with an 83 for a
29-over 309 total, then tore into the United States Golf
Association before storming out of the village of Pinehurst. His
participation in the US Open, he said, is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now know why Bruce Lietzke doesn't play the US Open,'' said
Daly to an impromptu press gathering in front of the Pinehurst
clubhouse. ``What the USGA wants to do is embarrass the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take my penalty and pay my fine, but I'm standing up for
the players. I don't consider the US Open a major anymore. My
majors are the Masters, the British Open, the PGA, and the Tour
Championship.''
</P>
<P>
   At the root of his anger was an annual criticism _ tough pins on
treacherous greens that result in high scores. But what left
observers shaking their heads was the turnaround in Daly's
disposition from Thursday, when he opened with a 2-under 68. After
that round, Daly said, ``I think it's a fun golf course. I think
everybody that's playing in it this week, all 156 say it's a lot of
fun to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many were actually saying Pinehurst No. 2 was ``fun,'' but
neither were they ready to say that Daly's later comments, as he
claimed, were on their behalf. Tom Kite, for instance, managed a
slight smile when asked if Daly's penalty at No. 8 served as a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't interpret it that way,'' said Kite, who was paired
with Daly. ``The only thing I heard from the players was that the
pin placements were exceedingly difficult. Basically, the players
like the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Triplett was also penalized for hitting a moving ball at
last year's Open at the Olympic Club in San Francisco, but that
came in the second round at the 18th hole, and the USGA assumed the
blame for setting a bad pin. In this case, few were rushing to
support Daly's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pins didn't have to be as tough as they are,'' said Lee
Janzen, last year's winner, ``but the course isn't unfair. All
anybody has to do is look at the leaderboard and see the good
golfers who are there. Marginal golf shouldn't win the US Open.
Outstanding golf should.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly played anything but outstanding golf after starting the
tournament with three straight birdies. He made only three birdies
after that and scored three double bogeys, a triple, and whatever a
7 over par is for the disastrous eighth. He said he hit a lot of
good shots but was not rewarded because of the penalizing pins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not play at Pebble Beach next year,'' he said in
reference to the site of the US Open. ``I don't want to see them
ruin another great golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly has a five-year exemption into the US Open for his 1995
British Open triumph, so Pebble Beach would be the end of that
window, unless he were to meet some other criteria. But those who
have been around Daly are more troubled by yet another entry on a
disturbing list of incidents. Three recent examples:
</P>
<P>
   --Two weeks ago in the first round of the Memorial Tournament,
Daly six-putted from 8 feet to conclude a round of 82. He promptly
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   --At the British Open last summer, Daly was going to miss the
cut at Royal Birkdale when he drove into a fairway bunker at the
18th hole in Round 2. He took several swipes at it and hacked it a
few more times around the green. It took several minutes to figure
out his score, which went into the books as a 10.
</P>
<P>
   --Last year at the Bay Hill Invitational in Orlando, Fla., Daly
drove it into the water at the par-5 sixth, went to the drop area,
and proceeded to hit five more into the water. He scored an 18 on
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's battles with alcoholism were recounted following
Thursday's round, and he also told reporters he was in serious
financial trouble, having lost millions gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is with me, I don't know who's showing up tomorrow .
. . I can honestly say that,'' he said. ``And it's a little
scary.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ The scene at the 11th hole Sunday at Pinehurst
No. 2 was beyond deja vu. It was virtually identical to the
scenario that may have cost Payne Stewart the 1998 US Open at the
Olympic Club in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Meeks, the director of rules and competition for the United
States Golf Association, once again was following the final twosome
at the US Open, and once again Payne Stewart was in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had noticed the play was slow for several holes,'' said
Meeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks was in a golf cart trailing the final twosome, stopwatch
in hand, timing the play of Stewart and his partner, this year Phil
Mickelson and last year Tom Lehman. And by the 11th hole, Meeks
sprung into action, telling Dr. Trey Holland of Indianapolis, a
vice president of the USGA, to notify Stewart and Mickelson they
would be ``on the clock'' as of the 12th hole.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th hole. Same as last year. The same hole in the same
major _ the Open _ where Stewart was told his play was dawdling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, you're concentrating so hard on your golf that you're
not paying attention to where the group is in front of you,'' said
Stewart. ``What I'd like to see them do is work a little harder to
speed up the first two days here. The last two days . . . darn . .
. you're trying to win a prestigious golf tournament. You'd hate to
have a penalty affect whether or not you win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on the clock from 12 through 14,'' said Holland, the
rules official assigned to the twosome. Indeed, when Holland
approached Stewart and Mickelson as they left the 11th tee, Stewart
got out the first words before Holland could speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me you're putting us on the clock,'' said Stewart,
and then Stewart strode away piqued when Holland told him that,
indeed, they were. Mickelson took the news more calmly. ``I've been
on the clock all four days here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of deja vu was even more eerie as Stewart approached
the 11th green. Last year Stewart lost his composure when his ball
landed in a sand-filled divot on the 12th hole and he asked for a
ruling on whether he could get relief. Stewart was denied and then
told, for good measure, that he and Lehman were on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Stewart asked for a ruling when his second shot
landed between a bunker and the green, this time on the 11th. Sand
from previous bunker shots was splayed across the grass ``and I
just wanted to know if I could remove the sand or not,'' he said.
But, just as last year, Stewart was on the clock as of the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Being on the clock means a golfer has a certain time to strike
the ball, depending on various circumstances such as whether the
ball is on the tee, on the fairway, or on the green, and whether he
is the first or second player hitting. Golfers rarely are
penalized, but some become upset when told they are being timed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Tiger Woods and Tim Herron, the twosome in front of
Mickelson and Stewart, were already gone from the faraway green of
the 454-yard, par-4 11th hole by the time Stewart and Mickelson
reached the 11th tee, ``that wasn't why we put them on the clock,''
said Meeks.
</P>
<P>
   Being out of touch with the twosome in front of you can
automatically incur the hands of the ticking clock, but not so this
time. Stewart and Mickelson were dallying too much, ``some five
minutes and eight seconds'' behind the pace they should have been
playing, Meeks explained.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at Olympic, on the hole after being put on the clock,
Stewart made bogey. Sunday, he made bogey again. ``I drove in the
rough and took my medicine; I just made some bad swings,'' said
Stewart, refusing to blame Holland's notification.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Stewart reacted differently when he struggled at
the 18th hole. ``I wasn't doubting myself out there at all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he understands the USGA's ``idea of having to play
at a pace, and I think it's all right to come up and inform us that
we're being put on the clock instead of coming up and telling you
you have a bad time because you never realized in the first place
you're on the clock. Still, you're concentrating so hard on your
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 14th hole, Woods and Herron again were visible in the
distance ``and we took them off the clock after the 14th hole,''
said Meeks. ``They were on the clock for three holes.'' So
Stewart's mind now was off the clock and again totally on golf.
</P>
<P>
   And what golf it was. The deja vu ended abruptly on the 16th
hole because, unlike last year, when Stewart lost the Open to Lee
Janzen by a stroke, this time his mental toughness rescued him. At
16, when Stewart's second shot landed short of the green, ``for
some reason I felt like I had to chip it in, and I hit a very poor
chip,'' he said. ``And as it went 25 feet past the hole, I said,
`You didn't need to do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart absolutely needed to do what he did next. ``I stood
up there on that green, I got my line, and went through my
(putting) routine and I made my stroke.'' The absolute snake of a
downhill 25-footer ``went in,'' said Stewart, ``and off I went.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed were two immense scenes of tension and potential
rarely seen except in these finishing holes of major golf
tournaments. On both the 17th and 18th greens, Stewart and
Mickelson stood with a so-small putting stick in their hands, a
little white ball at their feet, and where that white ball went
after being struck would determine the joy of their round, their
day, their year.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, Stewart dropped his putts and twice Mickelson couldn't.
If he tried to express his emotions, said Stewart when it was all
done, ``I couldn't speak.''
</P>
<P>
   But speak he would to Meeks before he left Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell Tom Meeks, `I thought this was a golf
tournament, and not a track meet.' ''
</P>

   LOUDON, N.H. _ Doug Chandler's drought began, of all places,
after a victory two years ago in an American Motorcyclist
Association-sanctioned Superbike event at a venue called Laguna
Seca in Monterey, Calif. Laguna Seca, Spanish for dry lagoon. How
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   After a dry spell that lasted 28 races, Chandler thirsts for
victory no more.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in the featured Superbike event of the 76th Loudon
Classic at New Hampshire International Speedway, the 33-year-old
native of Salinas, Calif., earned the right to stand atop the
podium and quaff a bottle of champagne after riding his Team Muzzy
Kawasaki to victory before an announced crowd of 30,000. Chandler
finished ahead of Vance &AMP; Hines Ducati riders Ben Bostrom,
runner-up for the fourth race in a row and fifth time this season,
and Anthony Gobert, who won the pole and led the first 13 laps
around the 12-turn circuit but had his streak of four consecutive
victories snapped with a third-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's tough, you know, when you have such a long dry
spell,'' said Chandler, who gave a glimpse of his Kawasaki's
strength when he posted the fastest lap (81.433 miles per hour)
during a practice session Sunday morning. ``You kind of get
frustrated. Last year, I didn't mind it really, because of the way
the points were going, so I wasn't too bothered (after finishing
second in the Superbike points race). This year, we struggled with
the bike (with a 13th at Phoenix and an 11th at Rosamond, Calif.),
which put us out of the championship, but the victory is a morale
booster for me but more for the mechanics who work long and hard on
the bikes. They don't give up. This is a reward for that hard
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's triumph boosted Chandler, a three-time Superbike
champion, from sixth to fourth in the points standings with 214.
</P>
<P>
   With four races remaining, Chandler trails leader Matt Mladin by
55 points, while Bostrom and Gobert are tied for second with 264,
five behind Mladin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in the season, that's all I can do; just go for
the wins,'' Chandler said. ``But this really feels great. The guys
gave me a perfect bike all weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident on Lap 14 when Chandler ran down Gobert on
the front stretch and executed a perfect pass on the inside of Turn
1 to take the lead for good. Gobert then fell to third when Bostrom
overtook him in Turn 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to set the quickest pace I could,'' said Gobert,
a 24-year-old Australian. ``At the same time I was trying to save
the tires. But Doug went past me pretty easy in Turn 1 and gapped
me pretty much (on the) straightaway, so I knew he had more than
what I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostrom came to that realization midway through the race when he
bore down on Chandler on the winding backstretch but was unable to
execute a move without endangering himself or other riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was setting a really good pace and I ran really hard trying
to catch up,'' said Bostrom, 25, of Redondo Beach, Calif. ``Then he
caught up to a couple of lappers and carved his way around them
pretty well. But there just comes a point when you say, `I'm not
going to win this one; the other guy's outriding me.' So we'll take
second and go on to the next one and see how we do. But one day
we'll win one of these things.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nicky Hayden of Owensboro, Ky., finished ahead of Aaron Yates
and Tommy Hayden, Nicky's older brother, to win the 600cc
Supersport race . . . Derek King of Charleston, S.C., recorded his
first career victory in the 250cc Grand Prix event, finishing ahead
of Chris Ulrich of Lake Elsinore, Calif., and Jeff Wood of
Mansfield, Mass., who made a spectacular Turn 1 move on Quenni King
to earn his first career podium finish.

M'S SEND MIESKE TO ASTROS FOR CLASS AAA RIGHT-HANDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Over the last few days, Matt Mieske had thought
about talking with manager Lou Piniella about his playing time.
Mieske had just seven at-bats in June.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he did talk with Piniella, and learned he'd been traded
to the Houston Astros for Class AAA right-hander Kevin Hodges.
Piniella told Mieske something the outfielder was pleased to hear:
``If we can get you back in the future when we need an outfielder,
I'd like to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 2{ months with the Mariners, Mieske did what Piniella
asked him to do. In his first at-bat for Seattle, he cracked a
pinch-hit home run, something no Mariner had done in all of '98. He
batted .366 in 41 at-bats, and had a .417 average off left-handed
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   In going to Houston, which has the best record in the National
League, Mieske has a strong chance of returning to the playoffs. He
was a reserve for the wild card-winning Chicago Cubs last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be a winning team,'' Mieske said, ``you've
got to have all the pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Mieske was one of those pieces in his brief Mariners tenure. The
problem was the M's had one piece too many. Counting the injured
Jay Buhner, the Mariners had seven outfielders, which was one too
many for a roster that needs 11 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (Astros general manager) Gerry Hunsicker and told
him he's getting himself a good player,'' Piniella said. ``Matt can
swing the bat, plays a very representative outfield and is a good
guy on the ballclub. We didn't get a chance to use him much, but we
were very happy with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mieske learned of the move about three hours before the
Mariners' game in Cleveland last night. He paged through an Astros
media guide, learning his new teammates as he said goodbye to his
old ones. He watched the game from the press box and will meet with
the Astros Tuesday in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The move ``shocked'' Mieske, who said he knew something had to
happen within the crowded outfield but didn't think he'd be the
player to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed a two-year contract, and you expect to be somewhere
for a while,'' Mieske said. ``We signed a year lease on our
apartment in Seattle. It's part of the game, and when it happens
you've got to roll with it and make adjustments. You've got to be
able to change directions in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mieske figures to get more at-bats on a National League team,
where pinch-hitting opportunities are greater and his skills
against left-handers can be put to use. In his career, Mieske is a
.319 hitter with 31 homers in 540 at-bats against left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like every time I was called upon, I did my job,''
Mieske said. ``That's rewarding and it makes you feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, 26, is in his ninth minor league season, and made it to
Class AAA for the first time this year. He was 1-4 with a 2.94
earned-run average in eight starts for Class AA Jackson, earning a
promotion to Class AAA New Orleans, where he went 1-3 with a 7.24
ERA in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good-sized guy, 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds,'' said Roger
Jongewaard, the Mariners' vice president for scouting and player
development. ``Our report was from double-A, and it said that he
has four average pitches and looks like he's starting to figure it
out. He's not a premium guy, but he's a usable guy who has a
chance. He's an average prospect, and he can come up and be an
average pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges will be sent to Class AAA Tacoma, where he will pitch in
the Rainiers' starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   SETBACK FOR BUHNER: Buhner had hoped to be activated Monday from
his hamstring strain, but Charles Gipson is likely to be recalled
from Tacoma to take Mieske's place. Trainers wanted Buhner to run
the bases successfully for two days, but Sunday's running session
did not go as well as hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to put Jay on the roster until we're absolutely
sure,'' Piniella said. ``He struggled a little bit out there today;
he was still a little sore. I would think he's about 85-90
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Buhner returns, Piniella said, he won't be able to
play every day, which should give Butch Huskey a chance to play
semi-regularly. Huskey, who has hit well in Buhner's absence, can
play first, left and right field and will see time when Piniella
rests players at those positions.
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: The Mariners will meet with No. 1 pick Ryan
Christenson Monday. The club's first offer to the Riverside
(Calif.) high school catcher was $1.1 million, but given what
players near Christenson's draft position signed for last year and
this year, he can command about $1.7-$1.8 million. Once Christenson
signs, his probable destination is Class A Everett. ...
Right-hander Paul Abbott worked seven innings for the second start
in a row at Tacoma last night, and is likely to start the finale of
the Mariners' three-game series with Anaheim on Thursday. ...
Indians right fielder Manny Ramirez suffered a bruised knuckle on
his left index finger when hit by a Frankie Rodriguez fastball in
the first inning last night. The majors' leader in RBIs was taken
to a nearby hospital for X-rays, which found no broken bone.

<P>
   The comic opera element to Russia's post-bombing dash for Kosovo
_ a wheeze that delighted many Russians and Serbs, even as the 200
troops camped defiantly near Pristina airport had to beg supplies
from the very NATO forces they had wanted to upstage _ should not
obscure the seriousness of the rift between Russia and the West.
</P>
<P>
   That rift was not just over the air war, but over the peace
still to be secured.
</P>
<P>
   Others also opposed NATO's air strikes against the Serbs: China,
India and plenty of smaller countries were alarmed that the West
would resort to force to punish a sovereign government for actions
against its own citizens. But Russia is especially incensed at what
it claims is an attempt to exclude it from influence in an unruly
patch of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Are such charges justified? Russia and China, both veto-wielding
members of the U.N. Security Council, portrayed NATO's decision not
to take the Kosovo issue to the council early on as a cynical ploy
to claim rights of intervention for the West at the expense of the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   But their real gripe is less high-minded.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between the major powers is not so much between those
who want to uphold the principle of U.N. authority and those who do
not. It is between those who believe that Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic had the sovereign right to do what he liked to
the Kosovars, and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   As countries with a poor record on minority rights _ think of
Chechnya, or Tibet _ Russia and China would have vetoed the use of
force to stop him. It was regrettable, but hardly surprising, given
the scale of the Serbian ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, that such a
split council was bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia felt excluded from the decision to reverse that ethnic
cleansing, it mostly had itself to blame. Since then, however,
western governments have gone to considerable lengths to bring the
Russians back in.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, many Russians would have liked to support Milosevic,
some just with words, some with weapons. Others may have hesitated
to do so only because Russia is beholden to the West for economic
help.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some Russians _ President Boris Yeltsin still
among them _ who understand that Russia's influence in Europe will
expand only if it works with the European grain, not against it.
</P>
<P>
   They prevailed, and Russia eventually played a useful, if
grudging, role in persuading Milosevic to back down.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that good work, however, may now be undone by Russia's
attempt to obstruct the work of KFOR, the U.N.-mandated but
NATO-led force now trying to restore peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than acting like a still-great power, Yeltsin and his
ministers have shown themselves to be in disarray. The West has
played down the dash for Pristina, even though the Russian troops
involved had unilaterally abandoned their peacekeeping duties in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Many East Europeans, however, are alarmed. Russia's demands for
overflight rights to pour in more troops have revived bad memories
of the fist-banging Soviet days.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to have Russia involved in policing the Kosovo
peace, if only to reassure the Serbs still in the province of
KFOR's impartiality. And it would be no bad thing for Russian
troops to see at firsthand some of the appalling atrocities their
Serb cousins have perpetrated over the past year. But what Russia's
generals really seem to want is a slice of Kosovo to run as they
see fit.
</P>
<P>
   A deal is being worked on to give Russia a part in KFOR
(something that was anyway always on offer), but it should not
compromise either the unity of KFOR's command or the territorial
integrity of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the charge that NATO is getting too big for its
military boots?
</P>
<P>
   For an avowedly defensive alliance, the air war against Kosovo
was a startling new departure _ but one that is likely to prove the
exception, not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   NATO encompasses most of the continent's strongest democracies,
which is the best guarantee that, if it acts, it will do so only to
uphold democratic principles, not to trample on them.
</P>
<P>
   And will NATO now feel emboldened to right every wrong? Hardly.
It was scarcely spoiling for a fight with Milosevic, who had
already unleashed two wars _ in Croatia and Bosnia _ before he set
his forces loose in Kosovo. And now that NATO has been through the
experience of fighting a campaign by 19-nation committee, it is
unlikely to rush to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   This (air-only) war could well have gone badly wrong for NATO.
Moreover, the job of restoring stability to Kosovo will be long and
expensive, as will the reconstruction of the wider region.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty there for Europeans to do _ Russia included _ without
taking on other wars of principle. &QL;

   Those Americans who hope that their ``Goldilocks'' economy
(neither too hot nor too cold) will last forever will have been
delighted by this week's figures showing that, after a sharp jump
in April, consumer prices were virtually unchanged in May.
</P>
<P>
   They may have concluded that the Federal Reserve does not, after
all, need to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting on
June 30. Investors duly pushed the stock market up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Goldilocks is still in grave danger: there are clear signs
that the American economy is getting too hot.
</P>
<P>
   At its May meeting, the Fed's open-market committee (i.e., its
monetary-policy board) decided against a rise in rates but adopted
a ``bias to tighten'' _ presumably, if future evidence confirmed
that inflation was rising.
</P>
<P>
   The latest numbers might suggest that they were wise to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Even after stripping out volatile food and energy prices,
America's core rate of inflation was 2.0 percent in the 12 months
to May, slightly less than a year ago. However, monetary policy
must be forward-looking, and other factors signal that a rise in
interest rates remains overdue.
</P>
<P>
   First, America's domestic demand continues to grow at an
unsustainable pace. Retail sales, for example, rose by almost 8
percent in the 12 months to May, far more than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   America's spending spree is being financed by heavy borrowing by
both households and firms, whose debts are growing at their fastest
rate for a decade. Consumer debt is at record levels relative to
income; firms are issuing huge amounts of debt to buy back shares.
</P>
<P>
   Second, although it is possible that faster productivity growth
is allowing the economy to grow safely at a faster pace, the fall
in unemployment, to a 30-year low of 4.2 percent, suggests that the
productivity gains have not been large enough for that.
</P>
<P>
   America's labor market looks dangerously tight, with increasing
reports of labor shortages. If unemployment falls further, wages
are bound to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   All the evidence points to overheating: an overvalued stock
market, as well as the consumer-spending spree, borrowing binge and
incipient labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers have long warned the rest of the world
against such excesses; so why has the Fed been so slow to respond?
</P>
<P>
   One excuse may have been the fragile state of the rest of the
world economy. Fears of a world recession following Russia's
default last autumn prompted the Fed to cut interest rates three
times, by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   But today the world economy looks healthier. Not only have
emerging economies in East Asia and Brazil picked up sooner than
expected, but also, over the past month, the news from other rich
economies has turned slightly cheerier.
</P>
<P>
   After five quarters of decline, Japan's GDP rose at an annual
rate of 7.9 percent in the first quarter. This figure is distorted
by special factors; GDP may dip back in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy is certainly not about to lurch from bust to
boom; indeed it could yet lurch downwards again. But it is at least
possible that the worst may now be over.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Europe's economies may be less frail than had been
feared: both Britain and Germany, after flirting with recession,
seem to have escaped it.
</P>
<P>
   That commentators greeted a feeble 0.7 percent growth in
Germany's GDP in the year to March as ``good news'' says much about
their expectations, but if the German economy is looking less weak
than it was, that strengthens the case for the Fed to start
reversing last year's easing.
</P>
<P>
   By raising rates now, the Fed could ensure that inflation
remains fairly low. It would also usefully remind investors that
interest rates can rise _ and that shares are not a sure one-way
bet.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving rates unchanged, on the other hand, would continue
dangerously to fuel both the stock market and the consumer-spending
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Americans like happy endings. Unfortunately, they seem to have
forgotten the conclusion of the Goldilocks story: the bears chased
her away. &QL;

<P>
   Those Americans who hope that their ``Goldilocks'' economy
(neither too hot nor too cold) will last forever will have been
delighted by this week's figures showing that, after a sharp jump
in April, consumer prices were virtually unchanged in May.
</P>
<P>
   They may have concluded that the Federal Reserve does not, after
all, need to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting on
June 30. Investors duly pushed the stock market up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Goldilocks is still in grave danger: there are clear signs
that the American economy is getting too hot.
</P>
<P>
   At its May meeting, the Fed's open-market committee (i.e., its
monetary-policy board) decided against a rise in rates but adopted
a ``bias to tighten'' _ presumably, if future evidence confirmed
that inflation was rising.
</P>
<P>
   The latest numbers might suggest that they were wise to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Even after stripping out volatile food and energy prices,
America's core rate of inflation was 2.0 percent in the 12 months
to May, slightly less than a year ago. However, monetary policy
must be forward-looking, and other factors signal that a rise in
interest rates remains overdue.
</P>
<P>
   First, America's domestic demand continues to grow at an
unsustainable pace. Retail sales, for example, rose by almost 8
percent in the 12 months to May, far more than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   America's spending spree is being financed by heavy borrowing by
both households and firms, whose debts are growing at their fastest
rate for a decade. Consumer debt is at record levels relative to
income; firms are issuing huge amounts of debt to buy back shares.
</P>
<P>
   Second, although it is possible that faster productivity growth
is allowing the economy to grow safely at a faster pace, the fall
in unemployment, to a 30-year low of 4.2 percent, suggests that the
productivity gains have not been large enough for that.
</P>
<P>
   America's labor market looks dangerously tight, with increasing
reports of labor shortages. If unemployment falls further, wages
are bound to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   All the evidence points to overheating: an overvalued stock
market, as well as the consumer-spending spree, borrowing binge and
incipient labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers have long warned the rest of the world
against such excesses; so why has the Fed been so slow to respond?
</P>
<P>
   One excuse may have been the fragile state of the rest of the
world economy. Fears of a world recession following Russia's
default last autumn prompted the Fed to cut interest rates three
times, by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   But today the world economy looks healthier. Not only have
emerging economies in East Asia and Brazil picked up sooner than
expected, but also, over the past month, the news from other rich
economies has turned slightly cheerier.
</P>
<P>
   After five quarters of decline, Japan's GDP rose at an annual
rate of 7.9 percent in the first quarter. This figure is distorted
by special factors; GDP may dip back in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy is certainly not about to lurch from bust to
boom; indeed it could yet lurch downwards again. But it is at least
possible that the worst may now be over.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Europe's economies may be less frail than had been
feared: both Britain and Germany, after flirting with recession,
seem to have escaped it.
</P>
<P>
   That commentators greeted a feeble 0.7 percent growth in
Germany's GDP in the year to March as ``good news'' says much about
their expectations, but if the German economy is looking less weak
than it was, that strengthens the case for the Fed to start
reversing last year's easing.
</P>
<P>
   By raising rates now, the Fed could ensure that inflation
remains fairly low. It would also usefully remind investors that
interest rates can rise _ and that shares are not a sure one-way
bet.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving rates unchanged, on the other hand, would continue
dangerously to fuel both the stock market and the consumer-spending
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Americans like happy endings. Unfortunately, they seem to have
forgotten the conclusion of the Goldilocks story: the bears chased
her away. &QL;

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two men stand on a stage. One is the hulking figure of Willy
Loman, gradually becoming smaller in front of the audience's eyes;
the other is his younger and weedier boss, Howard, gradually
downsizing his old employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't eat an orange and throw the peel away,'' roars the
broken salesman. ``A man is not a piece of fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Howard patronizes the old man (who decades before had
helped christen him) by calling him ``kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the muffled sobs from the audience during the current,
heavily Tony-ed version of ``Death of a Salesman'' on Broadway
occur during the final reconciliation between Willy and his useless
son, Biff. But the moment when Howard sacks Willy still stands out
in its viciousness.
</P>
<P>
   When Arthur Miller's play opened in 1949, one conservative
critic called it ``a time bomb expertly placed under the edifice of
Americanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Willy Loman, the relentless competitor, became a symbol of the
dark side of the American Dream that he so firmly believed in.
</P>
<P>
   As his wife, Linda, says to Biff: ``He's not the finest
character that ever lived. But he's a human being and a terrible
thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   But who is paying attention now? At first sight it seems odd
that New Yorkers are flocking to see such a depressing play.
</P>
<P>
   Figures for consumer confidence are sky-high, unemployment at a
29-year low. When people lose their jobs they find new ones pretty
quickly. During the interval, young investment bankers sip
champagne and express their astonishment that America could ever
have been ``like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most modern figure in the play seems to be the ghost of
Willy's brother Ben _ an early version of an Internet entrepreneur
who keeps on telling his brother how he ``walked into the jungle''
at 17, walked out at 21, and ``by God, I was rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow America's chattering classes seem to have forgotten the
much-ballyhooed age of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Those days in the early 1990s, when the New York Times seemed to
have a permanent section on insecurity in the workplace and George
Bush senior was wandering around New Hampshire mumbling ``Message:
I care'' to laid-off workers, seem almost as distant as the days
when salesmen still wore hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current election will be about health care, education,
values,'' one senator says, echoing the views of pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether her boyfriend, who makes his living selling
T-shirt logos around the country, feels insecure, Carol, a fitness
instructor who works just round the corner from the Eugene O' Neill
Theatre, says flatly: ``How should I know? He's playing golf in
Myrtle Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the notion that Willy Loman has left the American political
scene for the 19th hole in the Carolinas is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   To make the obvious point first, as Alan Greenspan, the chairman
of the Fed, made it to Congress this week, ``The rate of growth
cannot increase indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   A nasty stock market correction and slightly higher interest
rates, and many families across America could be looking at their
Visa and MasterCard bills in the same anxious way that the Lomans
fret about the payments on the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   A cyclical downturn would certainly push Willy back to
center-stage.
</P>
<P>
   But the salesman's tragedy was set at the start of America's
postwar boom. As Greenspan has pointed out repeatedly, one reason
why wage inflation remains relatively low is the simple fact that
many Americans are terrified of losing their jobs. And with good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Some 55,231 jobs were shed in May, according to consultants at
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas. The total for job cuts in the first
five months of 1999 was nearly 50 percent higher than the
equivalent figure in 1998. The typical worker changes jobs nine
times before the age of 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Monday morning you can be told you are no longer needed,''
Miller recently told the Los Angeles Times. ``The company is moving
to Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   If you pick up any book about the Internet, you will be told
that ``salesmen'' are the next class of people to be
``disintermediated.'' Instead of sending out Willy and his
suitcase, Howard would only need to set up a website.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, the long-term structural trends about insecurity
are all up.
</P>
<P>
   One poll earlier this year of 500,000 workers showed anxiety
about jobs to be three times higher than it was during the 1980-81
recession. And men of Willy's age seem particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   John Schmitt at the Economic Policy Institute points out that if
you exclude women (whose careers have become slightly more secure),
many of the standard insecurity measures are still worsening.
</P>
<P>
   Even if jobs are easy to find, it is hard to take your pension
and health care with you. And the older you get, the less likely
you are to want to move in search of work.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it just a matter of losing your job; the problem lies in
the whole stress-producing environment of modern corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Miller once thought of calling his play ``The Inside of His
Head.'' It is easy to imagine a modern Willy Loman bemoaning the
passing of seniority, being tormented by group evaluation sessions
and spending half his day arguing with his HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Even Carol, the Manhattan fitness instructor, complains that her
job is now judged on the basis of salesmanship as well as muscle
tone.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in America, it often seems these days, is on
commission and on trial.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in many ways, they should be. Every country in Europe
would kill to have a capitalism that spits out inefficient people
like Willy as ruthlessly as America does.
</P>
<P>
   Willy's frantic desire to compete, his merry recital of the
management cliches of the day (``It's not what you sell; it's how
you sell''), his determination to imitate the legendary Bill: all
these things are what keeps America ahead of its peers. &QL;

   Figures for consumer confidence are sky-high, unemployment at a
29-year low. When people lose their jobs they find new ones pretty
quickly. During the interval, young investment bankers sip
champagne and express their astonishment that America could ever
have been ``like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most modern figure in the play seems to be the ghost of
Willy's brother Ben _ an early version of an Internet entrepreneur
who keeps on telling his brother how he ``walked into the jungle''
at 17, walked out at 21, and ``by God, I was rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow America's chattering classes seem to have forgotten the
much-ballyhooed age of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Those days in the early 1990s, when the New York Times seemed to
have a permanent section on insecurity in the workplace and George
Bush senior was wandering around New Hampshire mumbling ``Message:
I care'' to laid-off workers, seem almost as distant as the days
when salesmen still wore hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current election will be about health care, education,
values,'' one senator says, echoing the views of pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether her boyfriend, who makes his living selling
T-shirt logos around the country, feels insecure, Carol, a fitness
instructor who works just round the corner from the Eugene O' Neill
Theatre, says flatly: ``How should I know? He's playing golf in
Myrtle Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the notion that Willy Loman has left the American political
scene for the 19th hole in the Carolinas is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   To make the obvious point first, as Alan Greenspan, the chairman
of the Fed, made it to Congress this week, ``The rate of growth
cannot increase indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   A nasty stock market correction and slightly higher interest
rates, and many families across America could be looking at their
Visa and MasterCard bills in the same anxious way that the Lomans
fret about the payments on the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   A cyclical downturn would certainly push Willy back to
center-stage.
</P>
<P>
   But the salesman's tragedy was set at the start of America's
postwar boom. As Greenspan has pointed out repeatedly, one reason
why wage inflation remains relatively low is the simple fact that
many Americans are terrified of losing their jobs. And with good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Some 55,231 jobs were shed in May, according to consultants at
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas. The total for job cuts in the first
five months of 1999 was nearly 50 percent higher than the
equivalent figure in 1998. The typical worker changes jobs nine
times before the age of 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Monday morning you can be told you are no longer needed,''
Miller recently told the Los Angeles Times. ``The company is moving
to Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   If you pick up any book about the Internet, you will be told
that ``salesmen'' are the next class of people to be
``disintermediated.'' Instead of sending out Willy and his
suitcase, Howard would only need to set up a website.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, the long-term structural trends about insecurity
are all up.
</P>
<P>
   One poll earlier this year of 500,000 workers showed anxiety
about jobs to be three times higher than it was during the 1980-81
recession. And men of Willy's age seem particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   John Schmitt at the Economic Policy Institute points out that if
you exclude women (whose careers have become slightly more secure),
many of the standard insecurity measures are still worsening.
</P>
<P>
   Even if jobs are easy to find, it is hard to take your pension
and health care with you. And the older you get, the less likely
you are to want to move in search of work.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it just a matter of losing your job; the problem lies in
the whole stress-producing environment of modern corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Miller once thought of calling his play ``The Inside of His
Head.'' It is easy to imagine a modern Willy Loman bemoaning the
passing of seniority, being tormented by group evaluation sessions
and spending half his day arguing with his HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Even Carol, the Manhattan fitness instructor, complains that her
job is now judged on the basis of salesmanship as well as muscle
tone.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in America, it often seems these days, is on
commission and on trial.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in many ways, they should be. Every country in Europe
would kill to have a capitalism that spits out inefficient people
like Willy as ruthlessly as America does.
</P>
<P>
   Willy's frantic desire to compete, his merry recital of the
management cliches of the day (``It's not what you sell; it's how
you sell''), his determination to imitate the legendary Bill: all
these things are what keeps America ahead of its peers. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two men stand on a stage. One is the hulking figure of Willy
Loman, gradually becoming smaller in front of the audience's eyes;
the other is his younger and weedier boss, Howard, gradually
downsizing his old employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't eat an orange and throw the peel away,'' roars the
broken salesman. ``A man is not a piece of fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Howard patronizes the old man (who decades before had
helped christen him) by calling him ``kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the muffled sobs from the audience during the current,
heavily Tony-ed version of ``Death of a Salesman'' on Broadway
occur during the final reconciliation between Willy and his useless
son, Biff. But the moment when Howard sacks Willy still stands out
in its viciousness.
</P>
<P>
   When Arthur Miller's play opened in 1949, one conservative
critic called it ``a time bomb expertly placed under the edifice of
Americanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Willy Loman, the relentless competitor, became a symbol of the
dark side of the American Dream that he so firmly believed in.
</P>
<P>
   As his wife, Linda, says to Biff: ``He's not the finest
character that ever lived. But he's a human being and a terrible
thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   But who is paying attention now? At first sight it seems odd
that New Yorkers are flocking to see such a depressing play.
</P>
<P>
   Figures for consumer confidence are sky-high, unemployment at a
29-year low. When people lose their jobs they find new ones pretty
quickly. During the interval, young investment bankers sip
champagne and express their astonishment that America could ever
have been ``like that.''

<P>
   DES MOINES, IOWA AND CARTHAGE, TENN. _ The curtain is up in the
political theatre of America's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One protagonist, Al Gore, delivers his polished monologue before
an old-fashioned rally in the main street of his hometown in
Tennessee, backed by the red-brick wall of the Smith County
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The other, George W. Bush, stands relaxed amid the hay bales of
Iowa, hesitating a little over his speech. Behind him, the Iowa
cornfields stretch into infinity, an image _ his campaign managers
hope _ of American plenty and potential (for this is June and the
corn is only as high as an elephant's thigh).
</P>
<P>
   But the speech is the same: I am running for president.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, barring upsets, these two announcements will mark
the start of the presidential campaign for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is exceptionally early. At this stage in the contest of 1988,
the presidential aspirants were busy attacking rivals within their
own parties. This time, the electoral timetable is foreshortened.
</P>
<P>
   Now that two giant states, California and New York, have moved
forward primary elections to choose the presidential nominees, the
primary season will effectively be over in March. This means it has
been vital to raise a lot of money early.
</P>
<P>
   Those without money are falling behind; those with it are
already running campaigns not for the leadership of their party,
but of the country.
</P>
<P>
   There is a deeper comparison to be made with the election of
1988. That vote took place against the background of a long
economic expansion, the Reagan boom.
</P>
<P>
   It pitted an incumbent vice president, dull alongside his
charismatic boss, against a governor from a large, successful state
who was regarded by his own party as a moderate. And at this point
in the process, the challenger, Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts,
was far ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   There is a twist to this comparison, of course: the candidate
called George Bush was then the trailing incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   For Al Gore, the comparison is heartening. The main question of
this campaign will be the role played in it by the economic
expansion of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's central claim to the presidency is that since the
Democrats gained the White House in 1992, the economy has put on an
extraordinary performance. At the start of next year, assuming it
continues, the boom will have become the longest in America's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has fallen from 7 percent a year to about 2 percent;
the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 3,300 to over
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech announcing his candidacy, Gore boasted of the 19
million new jobs created during his term in office, and of the
transformation of the federal budget position from record deficit
to record surplus.
</P>
<P>
   It is an immensely powerful appeal (even if the administration
can claim only a small part of the real credit).
</P>
<P>
   Bush can only reply that prosperity isn't everything:
``Prosperity must have a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The force of the appeal has not been tested yet in the public
arena. If the election does prove a referendum on economic
competence, then the huge lead George W. now enjoys in the opinion
polls could well vanish _ as did Dukakis's, though for a whole
bundle of reasons _ and Gore will emulate the feat of President
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Gore may be a stronger candidate than Bush senior
was. He is now in Clinton's shadow, but his party's nomination will
make him the Democrats' central political figure.
</P>
<P>
   And though his dull reputation belies it, he is a tough
campaigner. In 1988 it was he, then a Democratic rival to Dukakis,
who first brought up the charge that Bush subsequently used to
devastating effect: that Dukakis had temporarily released a rapist
and murderer, Willie Horton, who had murdered again while on
furlough.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Gore who, in 1994, had the task of debating free
trade with the independent candidate, Ross Perot, whose
protectionist message was proving attractive. Gore wiped the floor
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning toughness is likely to be vital in this election.
Because there is little to choose between the two candidates'
ideologies, simple gaffes are likely to play an even more important
role than usual.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush's campaigning toughness has not yet been tested by
anything as fierce as a presidential campaign. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a third advantage over Bush. This election is likely to
be fought at the center ground of politics, as most elections are
when a country is prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   Gore not only already occupies the middle (because Clinton has
moved the Democratic Party there), but he is also unlikely to be
knocked from that position during the primary contest with his
challenger, Bill Bradley. Bradley, too, is a centrist.
</P>
<P>
   This is not true of Bush. During the primary season, all his
main challengers will come from the right.
</P>
<P>
   Republican conservatives do not have the influence they once
wielded. They have too many rival leaders, most of whom could not
win a race even if they were the only candidates.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the conservatives still represent about a quarter
of voters in the primary contests. At some point, Bush will have to
confront them if he is to contest the center ground with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is already trying to distance himself: his campaign slogan,
``compassionate conservatism,'' is a clever marketing ploy to be
conservative without looking like Genghis Khan.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that, as president, he would make judicial
appointments without requiring judges to, for example, oppose
abortion in advance (the choice of Supreme Court judges will be one
of the most important jobs of the next president: several posts are
likely to come up soon).
</P>
<P>
   But this is only a start. Gore is already attacking his rival
for being a captive of the right. Bush's ability to distance
himself from conservatives without alienating the base of
Republican support will be one of the biggest challenges of his
campaign. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If an American Edmund Clerihew Bentley were writing the Gore
campaign slogan, it would be: Al's a pal. But George the Second
ain't what he's reckoned.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the balance of advantage lies with Gore. But the
comparison with the 1988 contest suggests this race is more evenly
balanced. For a start, George W. is more ``presidential'' than
Dukakis was _ and at least as much as Al Gore is.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are strikingly similar in background. Both are
scions of America's political aristocracy: Bush the son of a former
president, Gore the son of a Tennessee senator. (This, by the way,
is not unusual: the race includes the wife of a former Senate
leader and the son of a millionaire publisher: name recognition
appears to be helpful.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with a president and two state governors in the family,
the Bushes are on their way to becoming the Kennedys of the
Republican party, though without the glamor.
</P>
<P>
   What is more striking is that both men are making the same
pitch. Both visit mission schools and praise ``faith-based
organizations.'' Both sprinkle their speeches with Spanish
soundbites.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says: ``We must pass this message to our children _ teach
them there are right choices in life and wrong choices. Changing
our culture requires more than laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in the version according to Gore: ``If children aren't
taught right from wrong, no new government program will staunch
that decay.''
</P>
<P>
   Platitudinous, of course, but the same platitude. Sometimes, it
is hard to tell Gush from Bore. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

   DES MOINES, IOWA AND CARTHAGE, TENN. _ The curtain is up in the
political theatre of America's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One protagonist, Al Gore, delivers his polished monologue before
an old-fashioned rally in the main street of his hometown in
Tennessee, backed by the red-brick wall of the Smith County
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The other, George W. Bush, stands relaxed amid the hay bales of
Iowa, hesitating a little over his speech. Behind him, the Iowa
cornfields stretch into infinity, an image _ his campaign managers
hope _ of American plenty and potential (for this is June and the
corn is only as high as an elephant's thigh).
</P>
<P>
   But the speech is the same: I am running for president.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, barring upsets, these two announcements will mark
the start of the presidential campaign for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is exceptionally early. At this stage in the contest of 1988,
the presidential aspirants were busy attacking rivals within their
own parties. This time, the electoral timetable is foreshortened.
</P>
<P>
   Now that two giant states, California and New York, have moved
forward primary elections to choose the presidential nominees, the
primary season will effectively be over in March. This means it has
been vital to raise a lot of money early.
</P>
<P>
   Those without money are falling behind; those with it are
already running campaigns not for the leadership of their party,
but of the country.
</P>
<P>
   There is a deeper comparison to be made with the election of
1988. That vote took place against the background of a long
economic expansion, the Reagan boom.
</P>
<P>
   It pitted an incumbent vice president, dull alongside his
charismatic boss, against a governor from a large, successful state
who was regarded by his own party as a moderate. And at this point
in the process, the challenger, Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts,
was far ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   There is a twist to this comparison, of course: the candidate
called George Bush was then the trailing incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   For Al Gore, the comparison is heartening. The main question of
this campaign will be the role played in it by the economic
expansion of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's central claim to the presidency is that since the
Democrats gained the White House in 1992, the economy has put on an
extraordinary performance. At the start of next year, assuming it
continues, the boom will have become the longest in America's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has fallen from 7 percent a year to about 2 percent;
the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 3,300 to over
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech announcing his candidacy, Gore boasted of the 19
million new jobs created during his term in office, and of the
transformation of the federal budget position from record deficit
to record surplus.
</P>
<P>
   It is an immensely powerful appeal (even if the administration
can claim only a small part of the real credit).
</P>
<P>
   Bush can only reply that prosperity isn't everything:
``Prosperity must have a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The force of the appeal has not been tested yet in the public
arena. If the election does prove a referendum on economic
competence, then the huge lead George W. now enjoys in the opinion
polls could well vanish _ as did Dukakis's, though for a whole
bundle of reasons _ and Gore will emulate the feat of President
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Gore may be a stronger candidate than Bush senior
was. He is now in Clinton's shadow, but his party's nomination will
make him the Democrats' central political figure.
</P>
<P>
   And though his dull reputation belies it, he is a tough
campaigner. In 1988 it was he, then a Democratic rival to Dukakis,
who first brought up the charge that Bush subsequently used to
devastating effect: that Dukakis had temporarily released a rapist
and murderer, Willie Horton, who had murdered again while on
furlough.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Gore who, in 1994, had the task of debating free
trade with the independent candidate, Ross Perot, whose
protectionist message was proving attractive. Gore wiped the floor
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning toughness is likely to be vital in this election.
Because there is little to choose between the two candidates'
ideologies, simple gaffes are likely to play an even more important
role than usual.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush's campaigning toughness has not yet been tested by
anything as fierce as a presidential campaign. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a third advantage over Bush. This election is likely to
be fought at the center ground of politics, as most elections are
when a country is prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   Gore not only already occupies the middle (because Clinton has
moved the Democratic Party there), but he is also unlikely to be
knocked from that position during the primary contest with his
challenger, Bill Bradley. Bradley, too, is a centrist.
</P>
<P>
   This is not true of Bush. During the primary season, all his
main challengers will come from the right.
</P>
<P>
   Republican conservatives do not have the influence they once
wielded. They have too many rival leaders, most of whom could not
win a race even if they were the only candidates.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the conservatives still represent about a quarter
of voters in the primary contests. At some point, Bush will have to
confront them if he is to contest the center ground with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is already trying to distance himself: his campaign slogan,
``compassionate conservatism,'' is a clever marketing ploy to be
conservative without looking like Genghis Khan.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that, as president, he would make judicial
appointments without requiring judges to, for example, oppose
abortion in advance (the choice of Supreme Court judges will be one
of the most important jobs of the next president: several posts are
likely to come up soon).
</P>
<P>
   But this is only a start. Gore is already attacking his rival
for being a captive of the right. Bush's ability to distance
himself from conservatives without alienating the base of
Republican support will be one of the biggest challenges of his
campaign. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   If an American Edmund Clerihew Bentley were writing the Gore
campaign slogan, it would be: Al's a pal. But George the Second
ain't what he's reckoned.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the balance of advantage lies with Gore. But the
comparison with the 1988 contest suggests this race is more evenly
balanced. For a start, George W. is more ``presidential'' than
Dukakis was _ and at least as much as Al Gore is.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are strikingly similar in background. Both are
scions of America's political aristocracy: Bush the son of a former
president, Gore the son of a Tennessee senator. (This, by the way,
is not unusual: the race includes the wife of a former Senate
leader and the son of a millionaire publisher: name recognition
appears to be helpful.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with a president and two state governors in the family,
the Bushes are on their way to becoming the Kennedys of the
Republican party, though without the glamor.
</P>
<P>
   What is more striking is that both men are making the same
pitch. Both visit mission schools and praise ``faith-based
organizations.'' Both sprinkle their speeches with Spanish
soundbites.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says: ``We must pass this message to our children _ teach
them there are right choices in life and wrong choices. Changing
our culture requires more than laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in the version according to Gore: ``If children aren't
taught right from wrong, no new government program will staunch
that decay.''
</P>
<P>
   Platitudinous, of course, but the same platitude. Sometimes, it
is hard to tell Gush from Bore. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Ernest Hemingway once noted that there is no hunting
like the hunting of a man, and those who have hunted armed men long
enough never care for anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the life of American bounty hunters, people who track
down fugitives from the law and are paid only when they get their
man.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters are often thought to be almost as nefarious as
the felons they hunt, but a recent article by John Chamberlin in
the University of Illinois Law Review argues that bail-enforcement
agents (as bounty hunters prefer to be called) play an important
role in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Around 35,000 defendants jump bail every year in America, and a
remarkable four out of five are brought back to justice by bounty
hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters typically work for a bail bondsman, an individual
or firm that lends bail money to defendants awaiting trial (for a
hefty fee, of course). If the defendant skips his court appearance,
as roughly one in seven clients do, then the loan is put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the bounty hunter, who is typically paid 10 percent of the
bail amount if he can catch and return the fugitive within a
predetermined period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are to the police what FedEx is to the post office,'' says
Bob Burton, director of the National Institute of Bail Enforcement
(and technical adviser to Robert de Niro on the film ``Midnight
Run'').
</P>
<P>
   Burton boasts that bounty hunters, responding to
``private-sector incentives,'' have a higher success rate than any
law-enforcement organization in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlin uses assorted Department of Justice statistics to
make the case that the country's estimated 7,000 bounty hunters are
very good at what they do. In fact, they are significantly better
than traditional law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, defendants under the supervision of a bondsman
were more likely to show up in court (85 percent) than all other
released felony defendants, even those who paid their own bail (78
percent).
</P>
<P>
   And when defendants failed to appear in court, those who were
the responsibility of a bondsman were more likely to be returned to
the court (80 percent) than were those who had posted their own
bail and were tracked down by ordinary police (64 percent).
</P>
<P>
   How does a bounty hunter get his quarry? ``Most of the fugitives
are pretty stupid,'' says Burton, who made his first bail arrest in
1959 and now teaches a three-day certification course for
prospective bounty hunters. (The course is strictly voluntary, and
mostly tells a bounty hunter how not to get arrested, plus a few
subtle tricks of the trade.)
</P>
<P>
   A bounty hunter may well find the fugitive watching television
at his girlfriend's house, he says. But the clever hunter may also
set a trap.
</P>
<P>
   One effective ploy is a letter to the fugitive's family from
some bogus organization promising to erase the charges if the
defendant calls a special toll-free number. When the call comes in,
the number is traced and the bounty hunter pounces.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, the bounty hunter may probe family and friends
for a Judas. A well-intentioned spouse or parent may think the
fugitive will be safer in custody; a colleague with less pure
motives might provide valuable information when money is offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take ten people in your life, three love you, three
hate you, and four don't give a damn,'' reflects Burton. ``Someone
will give you up for love or money.''
</P>
<P>
   But bounty hunters have more power than the police, with far
less training and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   A bounty hunter can enter or break into a fugitive's house
without a warrant, pursue a fugitive across state lines without
worrying about extradition, and arrest, detain and transport a
fugitive without many of the restrictions placed on ordinary
law-enforcement officials by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   These powers are not granted by the state; they emanate from the
private contract between the bondsman and the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have consistently found that bond is an extension of
jail; the bondsman, and the bounty hunter as his agent, have the
same powers as a jailer to control the movements of a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters are also virtually unregulated. In most states,
the job requires no qualifications, no training, no background
check, and no license of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   The result, critics say, is that incompetent or brutal bounty
hunters can abuse defendants in their custody or harm innocents.
</P>
<P>
   They can be sued or arrested if things go terribly wrong, but
juries are not sympathetic to injured fugitives and innocents may
find that there is not much to recover from an uninsured bounty
hunter, no matter how egregious the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The call for reform reached a crescendo in 1997 after a group of
masked, heavily armed bounty hunters supposedly broke into the
wrong house in Arizona and shot two people dead. (Prosecutors later
claimed that the men were merely posing as bounty hunters in order
to rob the house.)
</P>
<P>
   Reformers have advocated making bounty hunters subject to the
same constitutional restrictions as the police, or even eliminating
the commercial bail-bond industry altogether, as three states,
including Illinois, have already done.
</P>
<P>
   Both those options are unwise, argues Chamberlin. Curbing the
powers of bounty hunters would make them significantly less
effective and would probably be challenged in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of commercial bondsmen would leave more defendants
awaiting trial in jail at a time when prisons are already
overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chamberlin reckons that the states ought to license
bounty hunters and demand some minimum level of competence.
</P>
<P>
   This would upgrade the quality of the profession without
hampering a bounty hunter's ability to find and return fugitives _
and without much altering one of the most attractive aspects of the
system, that it costs taxpayers nothing. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Burton boasts that bounty hunters, responding to
``private-sector incentives,'' have a higher success rate than any
law-enforcement organization in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlin uses assorted Department of Justice statistics to
make the case that the country's estimated 7,000 bounty hunters are
very good at what they do. In fact, they are significantly better
than traditional law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, defendants under the supervision of a bondsman
were more likely to show up in court (85 percent) than all other
released felony defendants, even those who paid their own bail (78
percent).
</P>
<P>
   And when defendants failed to appear in court, those who were
the responsibility of a bondsman were more likely to be returned to
the court (80 percent) than were those who had posted their own
bail and were tracked down by ordinary police (64 percent).
</P>
<P>
   How does a bounty hunter get his quarry? ``Most of the fugitives
are pretty stupid,'' says Burton, who made his first bail arrest in
1959 and now teaches a three-day certification course for
prospective bounty hunters. (The course is strictly voluntary, and
mostly tells a bounty hunter how not to get arrested, plus a few
subtle tricks of the trade.)
</P>
<P>
   A bounty hunter may well find the fugitive watching television
at his girlfriend's house, he says. But the clever hunter may also
set a trap.
</P>
<P>
   One effective ploy is a letter to the fugitive's family from
some bogus organization promising to erase the charges if the
defendant calls a special toll-free number. When the call comes in,
the number is traced and the bounty hunter pounces.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, the bounty hunter may probe family and friends
for a Judas. A well-intentioned spouse or parent may think the
fugitive will be safer in custody; a colleague with less pure
motives might provide valuable information when money is offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take ten people in your life, three love you, three
hate you, and four don't give a damn,'' reflects Burton. ``Someone
will give you up for love or money.''
</P>
<P>
   But bounty hunters have more power than the police, with far
less training and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   A bounty hunter can enter or break into a fugitive's house
without a warrant, pursue a fugitive across state lines without
worrying about extradition, and arrest, detain and transport a
fugitive without many of the restrictions placed on ordinary
law-enforcement officials by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   These powers are not granted by the state; they emanate from the
private contract between the bondsman and the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have consistently found that bond is an extension of
jail; the bondsman, and the bounty hunter as his agent, have the
same powers as a jailer to control the movements of a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters are also virtually unregulated. In most states,
the job requires no qualifications, no training, no background
check, and no license of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   The result, critics say, is that incompetent or brutal bounty
hunters can abuse defendants in their custody or harm innocents.
</P>
<P>
   They can be sued or arrested if things go terribly wrong, but
juries are not sympathetic to injured fugitives and innocents may
find that there is not much to recover from an uninsured bounty
hunter, no matter how egregious the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The call for reform reached a crescendo in 1997 after a group of
masked, heavily armed bounty hunters supposedly broke into the
wrong house in Arizona and shot two people dead. (Prosecutors later
claimed that the men were merely posing as bounty hunters in order
to rob the house.)
</P>
<P>
   Reformers have advocated making bounty hunters subject to the
same constitutional restrictions as the police, or even eliminating
the commercial bail-bond industry altogether, as three states,
including Illinois, have already done.
</P>
<P>
   Both those options are unwise, argues Chamberlin. Curbing the
powers of bounty hunters would make them significantly less
effective and would probably be challenged in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of commercial bondsmen would leave more defendants
awaiting trial in jail at a time when prisons are already
overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chamberlin reckons that the states ought to license
bounty hunters and demand some minimum level of competence.
</P>
<P>
   This would upgrade the quality of the profession without
hampering a bounty hunter's ability to find and return fugitives _
and without much altering one of the most attractive aspects of the
system, that it costs taxpayers nothing. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For the past three decades, Mexico's six-yearly
change of president has been presaged or followed by upheaval,
either political or economic.
</P>
<P>
   The last occasion, in 1994, saw plenty of both: a guerrilla
uprising in Chiapas, the murder of both the presidential candidate
and the secretary-general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI), and then an economic collapse from which the country
is still recovering.
</P>
<P>
   This time will be different, President Ernesto Zedillo's
government has vowed.
</P>
<P>
   The election is still a year away. Yet for those fearing fresh
intrigue or fragility, recent events have not exactly been soothing
_ and not just this week's earthquake, whose tremors terrified
southern and central Mexico and killed 18 people.
</P>
<P>
   First, newspaper reports in the United States claimed that the
authorities there suspect links to the drug trade by both Zedillo's
chief of staff, Liebano Saenz, and Carlos Hank Gonzalez, a
billionaire businessman and former cabinet minister (both deny the
charges).
</P>
<P>
   Then Francisco ``Paco'' Stanley, a popular television presenter,
was shot dead in his car in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues in Mexico's television stations, known for their
PRI loyalty, raged at the city's chronically high crime rate and at
its mayor, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the most likely presidential
candidate of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   They soon stopped: it emerged that the hapless Stanley had been
carrying cocaine and bore the marks of a habitual drug user. His
death resembled a mob execution, not a common murder.
</P>
<P>
   The next furore involved Carlos Cabal Peniche, a Mexican banker
trying to avoid extradition from Australia for bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he said that he had channelled $25 million in
donations to the PRI, some of it for Zedillo's presidential
campaign (though whether that was illegal under the fast-and-loose
electoral rules of the time is not clear).
</P>
<P>
   And then came Carlos Salinas, Zedillo's predecessor. Shortly
after his term ended, Salinas slunk into exile, as the economy
collapsed and his brother Raul was arrested on suspicion of
planning one of the previous year's political murders (he was found
guilty in January this year).
</P>
<P>
   Though rumored to have made secret visits, he had not been seen
publicly on Mexican soil since 1995 _ until his 48-hour stopover
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, this was only to see his sick father, his jailed
brother and his graduating son. But journalists invited for coffee
and exclusive chats with the ex-president at his boyhood home
turned up to find the place bursting.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas used the opportunity to repeat his well-worn insistence
that the economic crisis was not his fault, despite the belief of
most Mexicans that it was.
</P>
<P>
   By his denial of responsibility, he implied that the blame was
Zedillo's, who instead of counterattacking kept quiet.
</P>
<P>
   That, says Jorge Castaneda, a political scientist, suggests this
is a discussion that Zedillo does not, for some reason, want to
have _ a victory, however small, for Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Zedillo has been busy ensuring that he does not end
up as reviled as his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Next year Mexico's economy will be much more strongly placed
than it was in 1994, with less debt falling due, a smaller
current-account deficit, and a floating currency instead of a fixed
one. These should ensure there is no repeat of the capital flight
and eventual devaluation of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But, this being Mexico, further intrigue seems certain between
now and the election, and investors may yet be scared into staying
away.
</P>
<P>
   So the government is taking no chances. This week it announced
that it was asking the IMF for a $4.2 billion standby credit which,
together with existing loan agreements and contingency facilities,
would mean that it could call on $24 billion in loans over the next
18 months if it really needed to.
</P>
<P>
   That, economists say, should cover it in the worst of
circumstances. Except, perhaps, an even stronger earthquake. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS AND NEW YORK _ This week the world's most famous consumer
brand became embroiled in its worst-ever health scare, when around
100 people in Belgium, many of them children, and 88 people in
France suffered nausea, headaches and diarrhea, some of them
seriously enough to be admitted to hospital.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14 Coca-Cola's soft drinks were banned in Belgium.
Luxembourg and France followed suit, and the firm itself eventually
withdrew its products from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola seemingly forgot the cardinal rule of crisis
management _ to act fast, tell the whole truth and look as if you
have nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Coke cannot seem to do anything right at the moment. The
American giant's ambitious plans for expansion have already
strained relations with governments in several European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Its attempt to buy the international soft-drinks brands of
Cadbury Schweppes was slapped down by several regulators and scaled
back. It is still trying to overcome objections to its purchase of
Orangina in France.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Coke done much to please investors recently, with its
failure to increase either volumes or its share price as fast as
might have been expected in the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the company needed was what Jennifer Solomon, a
drinks analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, calls ``a public-relations
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sufferers fell sick as early as May 20. They later
reported that their drinks smelt funny and tasted unusually sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Only now has Coke identified what was wrong _ two separate
failures in its huge bottling system, which is controlled in
Belgium by Coca-Cola Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   As the firm eventually explained, those who fell ill were
victims of some ``bad'' carbon dioxide used in a batch of bottled
Coca-Cola at a factory in Antwerp, near the Dutch border. The
company voluntarily withdrew all bottles with defective gas.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem affected canned drinks from a plant in
Dunkirk, across the border in France. The outside of some cans from
this plant, which supplies two-thirds of Coke's products drunk in
Belgium, as well as much of the French market, appeared to have
picked up traces of a fungicide used to treat the wooden pallets on
which packages of cans are moved around.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's public-relations error is to have seemed keener to
protect its own back than to allay the understandable fears of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon after Belgians had suffered from a food scandal
involving contaminated meat, the firm's legal-sounding insistence
that there were ``no health or safety issues,'' and that the drinks
``might make you feel sick, but are not harmful'' were hardly going
to reassure people.
</P>
<P>
   One crisis-management specialist argues that, although Coca-Cola
is right to worry about being sued in the long term, it could
suffer just as much from any unfavorable judgments that consumers
form about the drink right now.
</P>
<P>
   A statement on June 16 from Douglas Ivester, the firm's
chairman, expressing his ``regret,'' arrived hopelessly late.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Coca-Cola's brand is unlikely to suffer the damage
that, say, Perrier sustained when in 1990 the French group was
forced to recall every bottle of its sparkling water, after some
had been contaminated by traces of benzene.
</P>
<P>
   As Raymond Perrier (sic) at Interbrand, Newell &AMP; Sorrell, a
London-based brand consultant, points out: ``The image consumers
had of peasants filling empty bottles from gushing springs was
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, there is no doubt in people's minds that Coke is
entirely artificial. And, fortunately, it hasn't killed anyone,
unlike a batch of Johnson &AMP; Johnson's Tylenol tablets that had been
tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   However, Coca-Cola has made a big mess of what should have been
a small public-relations problem. That looks clumsy from the
guardians of the world's best-known brand. &QL;

Coca-Cola at a factory in Antwerp, near the Dutch border. The

<P>
   The second problem affected canned drinks from a plant in
Dunkirk, across the border in France. The outside of some cans from
this plant, which supplies two-thirds of Coke's products drunk in
Belgium, as well as much of the French market, appeared to have
picked up traces of a fungicide used to treat the wooden pallets on
which packages of cans are moved around.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's public-relations error is to have seemed keener to
protect its own back than to allay the understandable fears of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon after Belgians had suffered from a food scandal
involving contaminated meat, the firm's legal-sounding insistence
that there were ``no health or safety issues,'' and that the drinks
``might make you feel sick, but are not harmful'' were hardly going
to reassure people.
</P>
<P>
   One crisis-management specialist argues that, although Coca-Cola
is right to worry about being sued in the long term, it could
suffer just as much from any unfavorable judgments that consumers
form about the drink right now.
</P>
<P>
   A statement on June 16 from Douglas Ivester, the firm's
chairman, expressing his ``regret,'' arrived hopelessly late.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Coca-Cola's brand is unlikely to suffer the damage
that, say, Perrier sustained when in 1990 the French group was
forced to recall every bottle of its sparkling water, after some
had been contaminated by traces of benzene.
</P>
<P>
   As Raymond Perrier (sic) at Interbrand, Newell &AMP; Sorrell, a
London-based brand consultant, points out: ``The image consumers
had of peasants filling empty bottles from gushing springs was
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, there is no doubt in people's minds that Coke is
entirely artificial. And, fortunately, it hasn't killed anyone,
unlike a batch of Johnson &AMP; Johnson's Tylenol tablets that had been
tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   However, Coca-Cola has made a big mess of what should have been
a small public-relations problem. That looks clumsy from the
guardians of the world's best-known brand. &QL;

<P>
   In the land of the wealthy, dirt is king.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll through Jupiter Island, Fla., for instance. A
one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of waterfront fetches between
$2 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The house sitting on that dirt might be palatial, but that
hardly matters: On this island of exclusivity, houses come and go
with alarming speed. ``There are a number of houses going up right
now, and every single one of them will eventually be knocked
down,'' says Gene Albarelle, a local broker who deals in high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a speculator paid $1.65 million for an acre of ground
with a five-bedroom house on it. The house was immediately torn
down, and though its replacement has not yet been finished, the
owner is now asking $4.4 million for this small parcel of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jupiter Island is prime territory, removed by 574
feet of bridge from the strip-malled Florida mainland and situated
just 20 miles north of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 525 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy
decision. The Maloneys of Greenwich bought a waterfront house in
nearby Riverside (No. 62) for $2.3 million and struggled with the
decision of whether to renovate or level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy
Maloney. ``And philosophically, they're not people to tear things
down. There's something that really bothers me about just razing
the place, and I keep asking, `Can't we use anything?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband and their architect finally convinced her
that building around the elements she liked would be more expensive
than replacing them, she hopes to salvage what she can: She
mentions a porthole window and a favorite faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Some architectural details, like the staircases, would not meet
current building codes even if they could be saved. ``You just
can't get away with some of these things anymore,'' she says
wistfully, ``even if you like them.'' &QL;

<P>
   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the market shows few
signs of slowing down. California has 76 towns on our list this
year, and next year looks just as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are initially forecasting an 8 percent decrease in home
sales,'' says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist with the
California Association of Realtors. ``And I hate to change a
forecast, but I think that sales this year are going to be
extremely strong. The biggest constraint on the market is supply.
When the market is this hot, there just isn't that much
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, says Bockman, the NAR economist, ``our numbers are
actually coming out ahead of where we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting the beginning part of the year to be strong
and then the second part of the year to tail off a little bit. We
expect to settle in for 1999 right around the same levels that we
had for 1998, and we may even end the year a little bit higher,
depending on how things go over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our forecasts is that mortgage rates are going to drop

<P>
   In the land of the wealthy, dirt is king.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll through Jupiter Island, Fla., for instance. A
one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of waterfront fetches between
$2 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The house sitting on that dirt might be palatial, but that
hardly matters: On this island of exclusivity, houses come and go
with alarming speed. ``There are a number of houses going up right
now, and every single one of them will eventually be knocked
down,'' says Gene Albarelle, a local broker who deals in high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a speculator paid $1.65 million for an acre of ground
with a five-bedroom house on it. The house was immediately torn
down, and though its replacement has not yet been finished, the
owner is now asking $4.4 million for this small parcel of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jupiter Island is prime territory, removed by 574
feet of bridge from the strip-malled Florida mainland and situated
just 20 miles north of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 525 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy
decision. The Maloneys of Greenwich bought a waterfront house in
nearby Riverside (No. 62) for $2.3 million and struggled with the
decision of whether to renovate or level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy
Maloney. ``And philosophically, they're not people to tear things
down. There's something that really bothers me about just razing
the place, and I keep asking, `Can't we use anything?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband and their architect finally convinced her
that building around the elements she liked would be more expensive
than replacing them, she hopes to salvage what she can: She
mentions a porthole window and a favorite faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Some architectural details, like the staircases, would not meet
current building codes even if they could be saved. ``You just
can't get away with some of these things anymore,'' she says
wistfully, ``even if you like them.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the market shows few
signs of slowing down. California has 76 towns on our list this
year, and next year looks just as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are initially forecasting an 8 percent decrease in home
sales,'' says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist with the
California Association of Realtors. ``And I hate to change a
forecast, but I think that sales this year are going to be
extremely strong. The biggest constraint on the market is supply.
When the market is this hot, there just isn't that much
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, says Bockman, the NAR economist, ``our numbers are
actually coming out ahead of where we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting the beginning part of the year to be strong
and then the second part of the year to tail off a little bit. We
expect to settle in for 1999 right around the same levels that we
had for 1998, and we may even end the year a little bit higher,
depending on how things go over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our forecasts is that mortgage rates are going to drop
shortly, and if this happens, we expect to see another glut of home
buyers hitting the market. All of those people who missed out on
the last opportunity will finally get off the fence and make that
purchase.'' &QL;

Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL;

   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL;

   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL;

   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL;

   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy
decision. The Maloneys of Greenwich bought a waterfront house in
nearby Riverside (No. 62) for $2.3 million and struggled with the
decision of whether to renovate or level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy
Maloney. ``And philosophically, they're not people to tear things
down. There's something that really bothers me about just razing
the place, and I keep asking, `Can't we use anything?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband and their architect finally convinced her
that building around the elements she liked would be more expensive
than replacing them, she hopes to salvage what she can: She
mentions a porthole window and a favorite faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Some architectural details, like the staircases, would not meet
current building codes even if they could be saved. ``You just
can't get away with some of these things anymore,'' she says
wistfully, ``even if you like them.'' &QL;

   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the market shows few
signs of slowing down. California has 76 towns on our list this
year, and next year looks just as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are initially forecasting an 8 percent decrease in home
sales,'' says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist with the
California Association of Realtors. ``And I hate to change a
forecast, but I think that sales this year are going to be
extremely strong. The biggest constraint on the market is supply.
When the market is this hot, there just isn't that much
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, says Bockman, the NAR economist, ``our numbers are
actually coming out ahead of where we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting the beginning part of the year to be strong
and then the second part of the year to tail off a little bit. We
expect to settle in for 1999 right around the same levels that we
had for 1998, and we may even end the year a little bit higher,
depending on how things go over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our forecasts is that mortgage rates are going to drop
shortly, and if this happens, we expect to see another glut of home
buyers hitting the market. All of those people who missed out on
the last opportunity will finally get off the fence and make that
purchase.'' &QL;

   Higher home prices? Smaller lots? Bigger houses? It takes a
historian to put these trends into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Jackson is a former chairman of Columbia University's
history department and an expert on suburbia who lives in Rich Town
No. 163 (Chappaqua, N.Y.). He makes the point that no matter how
expensive houses may seem ``they're still cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similar dwellings in Japan, Germany, France, or Switzerland
would almost certainly be more expensive, if they were available at
all _ and most likely they wouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have space,'' he explains. ``Both our land and our
construction costs are less expensive in the United States than
elsewhere. An acre of land in Japan would be an undreamed-of
luxury: nothing in San Marino (No. 72), Greenwich (No. 23), or even
Atherton (No. 3) could compare to it. In world terms, a million
dollars an acre is not an expensive price to pay.'' &QL;

   RACA, SOUTHEASTERN SERBIA _ It was a medieval exodus. The
gypsies of Kosovo fled their homes in their thousands down the
narrow mountain road, leading horses that strained at the ropes of
great wooden carts piled high with bedding and carpets and children
and old women.
</P>
<P>
   They left in their thousands, their horses and ponies and wooden
trailers weaving between Serbian battle tanks and armored personnel
carriers, a whole people on the move.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of Kosovo's 50,000 gypsies have thrown in their
lot with the 100,000-strong Serbian minority, taking Serb names and
saints' days, their bands playing Serbian songs and their people
speaking Serbian as well as Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   But they also appear to have been involved in some of the
destruction of Albanian homes; residents of Djakovica say that Serb
police used gypsy children to light the fires that destroyed the
Kosovo Albanian area of the city in mid-May. Albanians in Pristina
now say that gypsies helped to loot their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But on the mountainside above Raca Friday, they made a
heartbreaking sight, stumbling down the road between the better-off
Serb refugees in their tractors and cars, their dark-skinned
children wide-eyed with fear, holding the reins of white and brown
ponies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps half the Serbs of Kosovo have now abandoned their
homeland. But the gypsies have no homes in Serbia to go to.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav police were preventing many gypsy carts from pressing
on into Serbia although on the highway to Belgrade, a pathetic
trail of Serbs continued to drive their tractors up the hard
shoulder towards Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on Serb television last Wednesday night _ the
same television service that NATO bombed as a ``legitimate target''
during the war _ General Sir Michael Jackson, the KFOR commander,
tried to persuade Kosovo's minorities to stay in the province.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a lacklustre performance; General Jackson was
obviously exhausted and slumped so low in his chair that his
general's epaulettes were hanging over his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the much-publicized kidnapping of a Serb named
Ivan Celic, he admitted he had never heard of him.
</P>
<P>
   Even fewer outsiders have heard of the gypsies of Kosovo. They
came from India to the Balkans when it was part of the Byzantine
Empire and there are records of their presence here in the late
1300s; by the 19th century, several thousand had settled around
Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   They were largely Muslim but a small Serb Orthodox minority
still exists.
</P>
<P>
   During the Second World War, they were the second victims of the
Holocaust _ many thousands were murdered by Hitler's Croatian
``Ustashi'' allies in Yugoslavia and up to a million were shipped
to Auschwitz from Hungary and Romania. There is no memorial to
their wartime catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   And amid the revelations of torture and executions coming out of
Kosovo, another minority ethnic group associated with the Serbs _
however innocent _ will not elicit the world's sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   The American journalist John Reed _ whose story was told in the
film ``Reds'' _ recorded in 1915 how ``every (Serb) regiment has
two or three gypsies, who march with the troops, playing the
Serbian fiddle or the bagpipes...''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the gypsies of Kosovo were accompanying Serb regiments
in their retreat from Kosovo, carts beside artillery pieces, ponies
beside tanks. &QL;

CLERGY STRIVE TO MAINTAIN SPIRITUAL MEANING OF BAPTISM
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of a minister baptizing a baby 
 By DEBRA LESTER AND MARY LOFTUS 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baptism is one of the most significant rites of the Christian
church, whether recited as part of a formal church ceremony where a
baby is welcomed into the fold or outside by a pond as a minister
lowers an adult believer into the symbolic waters.
</P>
<P>
   But some clergy and religious scholars are afraid that baptism
is becoming trivialized, a social ritual detached from its deeper
spiritual meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Curtis, a Presbyterian minister and professor of biblical
studies at Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pa., and an Old
Testament specialist, says the sacrament of baptism is much more
than just a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people decide, 'Let's get the kid done, here's $25 for
the priest.' That's a great abuse. We're fighting to restore
baptism as a distinctive honor within the believing community of
Christians, to reclaim this sign so that it's truly distinctive,
not just a cultural accouterment,'' Curtis says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Elle Macpherson's year-old son, Arpad Flynn
Alexander Busson, was baptized in Italy this year, what the
supermodel wore _ a tight, mink-trimmed beige suit designed by
Valentino _ garnered more attention than the ceremony itself.
</P>
<P>
   While Macpherson's motives may have been pure, the paparazzi
surrounding the church didn't allow the ceremony much sanctity.
</P>
<P>
   Baptism today is sometimes misunderstood, agrees Gayle Felton, a
Duke Divinity School assistant professor who took part in a study
that produced: ''By Water and the Spirit: A United Methodist
Understanding of Baptism.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our confusion has resulted in a feeble appreciation of
baptism, which often reduces it to a sentimental service of
thanksgiving for a child or a ceremony of 'joining the church' on
the part of an adult,'' Felton says.
 &UR; WITHIN THE CHURCH &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, in his role as a minister, has baptized infants. ''But
not any infant,'' he says. ''If a person is a member within the
visible church, attempting to live a life of faith within the grace
of God, this person's children I will happily baptize. If a person
comes without a commitment to the church of Jesus, I ask them to
become committed. I routinely do a fair amount of instruction about
it. There is a general sense that the sacrament is important, a
blessing from God, but often people didn't understand the
theological details.''
</P>
<P>
   Confusion is understandable, since the ritual and its meaning
can vary by denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the use of water is common to almost all
baptisms. Water is a powerful religious symbol that expresses
cleansing, washing away of sin, immorality or impurity, and also
death and rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Baptist, charismatic and Pentecostal denominations usually
practice believer's baptism or immersion, while Presbyterian,
Episcopal, Catholic and United Methodist churches practice infant
baptism or sprinkling.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Orthodox Church combines both rites, baptizing infants
by immersion. The priest holds the nose and keeps the mouth sealed
as he immerses the baby three times, in the name of the Father, Son
and Holy Ghost.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Barrett, religion professor at Wofford College in
Spartanburg, S.C., notes that the Greek word for ''baptism'' means
immersion. But as Christianity moved into the Middle East and other
arid climates, water in amounts large enough for immersion was not
always available. Pouring water over the person being baptized gave
way to sprinkling.
 &UR; COMPETING THEOLOGIES &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the contemporary church, the two styles of baptism _ baptism
by immersion, or ''believer's baptism,'' and baptism by sprinkling,
or infant baptism _ represent differing theologies. Believer's
baptism is done in response to salvation already obtained, while
infant baptism is a declaration of God's grace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Infant baptism is based on the idea that God loves us before
we can love him,'' said Barrett. ''It's the supreme example of
grace _ God's acting to save us before we can save ourselves.''
Infant baptism is a primary sacrament in many churches.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't do anything that's more important than the baptism of
our children,'' said the Rev. Mickey Fisher, pastor of Trinity
United Methodist Church in Spartanburg. One family in his
congregation, just after baptizing their infant son, described the
ceremony as a vital first step in providing their children with a
firm foundation of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important to have our children grow up in church,''
Rena Fowler, the mother of the baptized baby, said. ''A baptism
ceremony is just as important as a wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gregory D. Goolsby, a priest at the Catholic Church of
St. Monica in Duluth, Ga., says the Catholic church also performs
infant baptisms, the key to becoming an ''adopted child of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a pitcher of water that I dump over the infant's head
three times. I tend to use a gracious amount of flowing water. In
some Catholic churches, the baby will be set down in a bowl of
water, and water will be poured over his head,'' Goolsby says.
</P>
<P>
   Most children are baptized in the Catholic church between two to
three weeks to six months after birth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deacon prepares parents for the sacrament, and sometimes
the godparents as well,'' according to Goolsby. ''It's a good time
to re-evangelize. Often, this is the time families will return to
the church.''
 &UR; REBORN IN WATER &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Believer's baptism, on the other hand, is performed on older
children or adults, usually through full immersion. In the Baptist
tradition, the ritual is a confirmation of salvation, which is
something that can happen only when the person can understand what
it means.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing wrong with sprinkling,'' says the Rev. Hub
Blankenship Jr., of Spartanburg Community Church. ''But as a baby,
it's not a conscious decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, 21 people were baptized by Blankenship in a lake near
the church. All were considered by the Southern Baptist
congregation to be old enough to already have experienced
salvation. The youngest to be immersed in the warm waters was 6
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Some churches that baptize by immersion have baptistery pools
(usually behind the altar) that resemble huge bathtubs, complete
with spigots. Other churches use ponds, lakes or rivers, or even
swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Sacraments such as baptism, says Curtis, ''do not in themselves
save. But they do encourage and help a life of salvation. Baptism
is how Jesus places his mark of blessing upon all those who are
included in the visible church _ the community who does believe,
striving for the justice of God in the midst of a fallen world.''

VOLUNTEERING YOUR VACATION WITH EARTHWATCH
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes a color photo of two volunteers in a boat with a sea
turtle) 
 By JENNIFER BOGO 
 c.1999 E-the environmental magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, Muriel Horacek spent two weeks camping in a cave in
China as she monitored an endangered species of monkey. She has
also radio-tracked cheetahs by airplane over Namibia, taken water
samples from a rowboat in a German lake, and in St. Croix caught
the eggs of nesting sea turtles in her bare hands.
</P>
<P>
   This was all after she turned 70.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 expeditions Horacek has been on over the last six years
have been as diverse as the habitats she's visited, but the common
thread is Earthwatch, an international nonprofit organization
dedicated to joining scientists and ordinary people in building a
sustainable future.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1972, Earthwatch has sponsored more than
2,000 projects in 118 countries and 38 states. The research
contributed by its over 50,000 volunteers has resulted in 12 new
national parks and reserves, over 2,000 new species discovered,
dozens of endangered species rescued from extinction, and health
services and sustainable agriculture brought to remote villages in
more than 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The belief that fuels this success, according to Earthwatch
president Roger Bergen, is that ''almost every problem can be
solved with the right blend of expertise and caring, knowledgeable
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipping away at global environmental problems from different
angles and disciplines, Earthwatch investigators develop projects
in seven research areas: World Oceans, World Forests, Biodiversity,
Cultural Diversity, Learning from the Past, Monitoring Global
Change, and World Health.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are teamed with people like Horacek, who donate
their vacation dollars to work side-by-side with distinguished
field scientists. The tax-deductible cost of the one- to four-week
expeditions, which range from $695 to nearly $3,000, goes directly
to funding the research.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Chmuhalek, whose research at the University of Manitoba
has led to a patent on natural dye extraction and production,
previously had the aid of only one graduate student at $8 an hour.
Her concern is that ''eventually the petroleum industry will be
gone and the textile and apparel industries have been very slow to
recognize this.''
</P>
<P>
   Chmuhalek's project, recently approved for the next field
season, will use six teams staggered over the summer to find an
ecologically sustainable, non-petroleum based method of coloring
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Paladino from Indiana-Purdue University, an
investigator funded by National Geographic and the National Science
Foundation, says those grants have allowed him to actually do the
science, but not to pursue it on a long-term basis. For the last 10
years, his Earthwatch-sponsored project on Costa Rican sea turtles
has collected nesting data which, when shared with South American
officials, resulted in the designation of a new national park.
</P>
<P>
   Paladino's project also piqued the interest of an Earthwatch
volunteer, Allison Leslie, who then went on to become his Ph.D.
student and return with an Earthwatch project of her own. Leslie's
team in St. Lucia National Park, South Africa, researched
temperature-dependent sex determination in the declining Nile
crocodile population.
</P>
<P>
   The team discovered that a foreign plant species shading croc
nests actually lowers the incubation temperature, resulting in eggs
of only one sex. This may have some far-reaching implications,
offering a possible explanation for dinosaur extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Fouts, author of ''Next of Kin'' and renowned primate
specialist, hopes to use Earthwatch-generated data to change
federal animal welfare regulations, which he says are ''not in tune
with reality.'' Volunteers for his recent project worked with
chimps at the University of Washington to determine what
combination of elements create the most stimulating captive
environment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fouts, ''Earthwatch projects are where the rubber
meets the road.''
</P>
<P>
   And that road is a winding one. Volunteers may interview poor
farmers in the Mississippi River delta, teach Indonesian villagers
to cook with a solar oven, or measure the deposition of an
Icelandic glacier. At night, they may return to a roaring campfire,
a college dorm room, or a condo overlooking the ocean. The tasks
and accommodations are as varied as the volunteers themselves, who
last year came from 46 countries and all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Cassidy-Gilbert, an economist from New York City who
just went on her first Earthwatch trip, points out that it's easy
to live life thinking you can't make a difference. Tracking
bottlenose dolphins in Queensland, Australia, she found herself
''in absolute paradise...learning how quickly populations can
disappear. Earthwatch makes you aware an individual person needs to
try and get something done.'' She's already planning her next
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as Horacek will testify, ''Earthwatch has opened a
whole new world for me.''

 &HT;    Doom may not follow Greenspan's gloom
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan peers through
his thick glasses, he sees a bright and blossoming economy. Because
of new technologies, such as computers, scanners, satellites and
more, ``something special has happened to the American economy in
recent years,'' the central banker told the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
   But when Greenspan looks into the next century, his view seems
to darken. ``The rate of growth of productivity can't increase
indefinitely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the nation's central bank during the 1990s, Greenspan
has gotten a great deal of the credit for the eight-year economic
expansion. But his place in history is not yet firmly set. Someday,
economic historians may look back at his comments about
productivity and put him in the same class as poor Henry Ellsworth,
the nation's commissioner of patents more than 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before Congress in 1843, Ellsworth remarked: ``The
advancement of the (industrial) arts, from year to year, taxes our
credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when
human improvement must end.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, his comment about human improvement ending has
been wildly embellished. Twisted versions of his quote, sometimes
attributed to other patent commissioners, typically turn up in
business speeches about shortsighted thinking.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how Ellsworth's words get mangled, the point is
the same: The patent commissioner was a dunderhead for not seeing
that inventors were about to unleash a torrent of new goods from
light bulbs to tractors to airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Greenspan has set himself up to provide the punchline for
untold numbers of Rotary Club speeches in the next century.
Business leaders may find themselves chuckling again and again over
the silly notion that 1999's rate of productivity growth could not
be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity is a measure of the amount of goods and services
workers turn out per hour. When productivity rises, factories can
make more cars, refrigerators or other goods with the same number
of employees. That holds down costs and boost profits so that
bosses can afford to give workers raises. A rising productivity
rate suggests an improving standard of living for both workers and
employers.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, productivity, outside of agriculture,
has grown at an annual rate of about 2 percent, roughly double what
it was in the 1970s and 1980s. Most economists think this boost is
the byproduct of new equipment such as bar-code scanners, cellular
phones, hand-held computers that transmit package-tracking
information and other sophisticated tools.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to productivity in the next century, the bulls on
Wall Street believe we ain't seen nothin' yet. As the Internet
pulls together more information and speeds up transactions,
productivity gains could be enormous. Just as the Industrial Age
took a few decades to pick up steam and broadly boost living
standards, so too will the Information Age need a little more time
to get its traction.
</P>
<P>
   But once the typical home has a high-speed Internet connection
and businesses are tapping the information resources created by the
Internet, productivity will skyrocket, pushing average Americans to
previously unimaginable levels of affluence, at least according to
believers in the ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out they are right, Greenspan, who today is known as
a brilliant economist, may someday take his place alongside
Ellsworth in the pantheon of very smart men who never saw it
coming.
</P>

Marilyn Geewax on issues raised by the coming of 2000.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Lightning's power finally hits home
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lightning in cartoons and children's drawings always looks like
a jagged dagger, issuing in a single point from burnt-marshmallow
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way I imagined it when as a kid I first heard the
story about a great-uncle who was hit by lightning. He was bent
over the engine of a stalled pickup truck at the edge of a field. I
thought of lightning as a deadly finger tapping him on the shoulder
as he cursed Ford Motor Company.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else, though, reality turns out to be more
complicated. Lightening forks and dances about. Half the bolts hit
the ground at more than one place.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that after spending a week staring into trees and
trying to figure the path of the lightning bolt that struck my
house. I gave this up as an idle exercise. It seemed to have been
everywhere, all at once.
</P>
<P>
   It hit the place like a bomb. Instead of experiencing the
familiar, reassuring gap between hearing thunder and seeing light,
I heard an explosion and saw instantaneous light, as though stadium
lights were being switched on and off by pranksters outside of the
window. The house smelled liked barbecued robot.
</P>
<P>
   I am no lightning wimp. I cannot be. I live in central Florida,
The Thunderstorm Capital of the Nation.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, this designation is on no license plate,
T-shirt or bumper sticker. Nowhere on I-4 is a sign saying:
``Welcome to Central Florida -- The USA's Thunderstorm Capital!''
We could have lightning death-count signs the way New Hampshire has
injury signs with moose-related accident numbers on them.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why we try to hide our awesome, busy skies. Our
thunderstorms constitute a natural wonder. Not only in intensity
but in number. We experience 70-100 thunderstorm days a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to Central Florida and watch the lightning strikes!''
would be a dandy slogan bidding to the more adventuresome traveler.
Eco-tourists from places with tame, white-bread, boring old weather
could come here to experience the full-bore natural drama of a
ground-shaking, wind-making, Book of Revelations-style,
day-turns-to-night-and-the-seas-boil-and-rage variety of
thunderstorm. People ashamed of their lightning fears could come
here to face them down.
</P>
<P>
   These storms take my breath away every summer. Even when they
aren't trying to burn my house down.
</P>
<P>
   I eventually found the place where the lightning bolt struck. It
hit a high-up limb of a large oak tree and left a narrow, blackened
path of ripped bark as it sought the ground. Some of the leaves
were withering.
</P>
<P>
   How the lightning moved from tree to downspout is unclear to me.
It baked and discolored the metal spout, popped its rivets and tore
it halfway off the house. Nearby, it took two shallow scoops out of
the driveway for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Was this the same bolt that burned the air conditioner, charred
phone lines and escaped out the television cable, bursting
insulation and popping connectors? That seems like a lot of places
for a rogue electrical charge to be. Was it more than one hit?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could say. ``Lightning's funny,'' summed up one repair
guy.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the mystery purely electrical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is God punishing you,'' suggested my eighth-grade
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is God telling you to get off the phone once in a
while,'' I suggested right back. Angry-deity theology is a game two
can always play. And angry deities with lightning predate
Christianity and the written word. We were engaged in speculation
of an most ancient kind.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of your theology, there is something awe-inspiring
and enlarging about having a billion volts of electricity visit
one's home. Nature turbulent and random is no respecter of persons.
We think we can make summer go away because we have air
conditioning. Even though a single summer lightning storm can
dispatch any air-conditioning unit in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   And sitting in the home without the telephone ringing and the
televisions disabled, I figured this was just as well. For the
first time of the summer, I listened to tree frogs outside
celebrating the damp.

 &HT;    Student/teacher protests aren't what they used to be
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Since my days on the ``outside'' are
assuredly numbered, I've
</P>
<P>
   decided to confess and throw myself on the mercy of public
opinion before ``they'' come to take me away. It's not a pretty
story, but it needs to be told.
</P>
<P>
   It all began on a fine spring day at a small, private school set
down in the gently rolling hills of west central Georgia. As the
bona-fide soccer moms went about their benign business of
fingernail transplants and making sure they had shoes to match all
of their outfits, I, with knowledge and aforethought (I'm not sure
that fits here, but I've always wanted to write it) did willfully
promote civil disorder and incite an entire student body to revolt.
On that grim day an anarchist was born.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, don't blame me. I told you it wasn't a pretty story. Blame
it on the passion of youth _ I was only 45. And I only did it once.
</P>
<P>
   My desk was in the high school's central hall. I was a
volunteer. My recognized job included answering the phone, ordering
lunch, and convincing visiting parents that the escalating dialogue
they heard coming from the Latin room was not student unrest, but
rather the Platonic method of teaching employed by this particular
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, due to the location, my desk was the unofficial
student center. During a free period, Billy would stop by, write
the morning announcements (frequently in dialect), and share his
dreams for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to ace the SATs and become a brain surgeon.'' (He
did both.) Suzy would often stop to share her latest hat _ usually
a '50s model she'd liberated from her grandmother's cedar chest.
April wanted to talk about Tom.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, I was the complaint department: ``Our bus driver
passes gas. Gross!'' or, ``Somebody's gotta tell Danny to get some
odor-eaters for his Docksiders.''
</P>
<P>
   But on this particular spring morning, we began playing with the
big boys. No time for piddling complaints about Tommy throwing
Ginny's shoes on the roof (after he'd forcibly removed them from
her feet), or the 'possum who'd been raiding the student lounge. In
the blink of an eye, the situation became grave and my unofficial
occupation switched from oracle to activist.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation approached from the west hall. Billy was the
spokesperson. ``Mrs.
</P>
<P>
   Wofford is leaving at the end of the year, and we don't want her
to go. Everything we know about history we've learned from her.
Besides, she lets us sit on the floor if we want to. What can we do
to make her stay?''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what happened, folks. That's how I came to organize
my first (and only) foray into civil disobedience. By lunchtime, at
my instigation, 40 kids circled the high school carrying
hand-lettered protest signs and chanting, ``No go, Mrs. Wo!'' Sadly
for all of us, the beloved teacher (and my personal friend) left at
the end of the year anyway, to join her husband who'd been
transferred out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, I've felt no remorse over the years, nor have I been
troubled by urges to turn myself in and confess to heretical
behavior. Truth is, I thought I was home free, what with the
statute of limitations and all. But now I'm not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Have you read about the 15-year-old kid in Oregon who spent a
night in jail and is now under house arrest for his alleged role in
a protest outside a Nike store? Police investigators with drawn
guns and brandishing a battering ram, swarmed onto his family's
front porch with a search warrant that turned up over 350
potentially subversive items including a cereal box and an Emma
Goldman (radical and feminist; early advocate of free speech, birth
control, and the eight-hour work day) poster.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, I'm not too impressed with either the kid's attitude
(shooting birds at traffic cops) or his hairstyle (somewhere
between dreadlocks and early Mixmaster), but arrest? Confinement?
</P>
<P>
   And if the constabulary can do this to a 15-year-old kid, just
imagine what they might dream up for a grown woman who should have
known better.

 &HT;    Crisis embroils soft drink giant Coca-Cola in European politics
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The European health scare over tainted Coca-Cola Co.
soft drinks has thrust the Atlanta-based beverage company into a
politically charged thicket over who's in charge of food safety
regulations on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke stepped right into the middle of it,'' said Joseph
Greenwald, a Washington-based trade consultant who was U.S.
representative to the European Union from 1972-75.
</P>
<P>
   First, the issue of food safety is politically sensitive, dating
to the 1996 scandal over Britain's ``mad cow disease'' that split
the 15-nation European Union and still lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian Health Minister Van den Bossche, who ordered Coke
products off the shelves last week, had just replaced a minister
who resigned in the ``chicken-gate'' scandal over the tainting of
animal feed, chicken breasts and eggs with cancer-causing dioxin.
The main infraction was failure to report the findings to the
15-nation European Union. Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene
was voted out of office the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem faced by Coke as it tries to repair the damage
is the fact that regulations appear to be a moving target. While
one country bans some Coke products, another issues a warning and
yet another allows sales of some products but not others.
</P>
<P>
   Despite much attention to the emergence of a single European
economy with a common currency, food safety regulations are still
largely left to the member states.
</P>
<P>
   No single authority
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, no single entity has the authority within the
community to restrict drinks or food with safety problems,'' said
Greenwald. ``The European Community does not have the equivalent of
the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration), and that's one of
the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   William Long, a professor at the Sam Nunn School of
International Affairs at Georgia Tech, compared the European system
to federal-state jurisdictions over some matters in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission in Brussels will adopt health and
sanitation directives, but it's up to each country to put them into
effect by enacting national laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's confusing,'' Long said. ``You're operating in one market,
but 15 countries. You're subject to directives coming out of
Brussels, but each national authority will carry out the
implementation. So it could amount to a pulling off the shelves in
Belgium, but a warning from Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Weintraub, a political economist at the Washington-based
Center for Strategic and International Studies, added: ``You have a
mixture of national responsibility, but commission authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with President Clinton on Thursday, French President
Jacques Chirac said a ``worldwide high scientific council for food
safety'' was the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are increasingly concerned, worried,'' he said. But
Clinton urged Chirac to press for a European FDA, a course
considered likely by many European-based experts.
</P>
<P>
   However, such a body might not be able to resolve what Greenwald
called ``fundamental differences'' between Americans and Europeans
on food safety issues that could be figuring in the Coke dispute.
</P>
<P>
   He cited continuing trade disputes between the United States and
European Union over U.S. exports of hormone-treated beef and
genetically modified American crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans want 100 percent risk-free,'' he said. ``But
most Americans are willing to accept some risks.''

the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration), and that's one of
the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   William Long, a professor at the Sam Nunn School of
International Affairs at Georgia Tech, compared the European system
to federal-state jurisdictions over some matters in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission in Brussels will adopt health and
sanitation directives, but it's up to each country to put them into
effect by enacting national laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's confusing,'' Long said. ``You're operating in one market,
but 15 countries. You're subject to directives coming out of
Brussels, but each national authority will carry out the
implementation. So it could amount to a pulling off the shelves in
Belgium, but a warning from Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Weintraub, a political economist at the Washington-based
Center for Strategic and International Studies, added: ``You have a
mixture of national responsibility, but commission authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with President Clinton on Thursday, French President
Jacques Chirac said a ``worldwide high scientific council for food
safety'' was the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are increasingly concerned, worried,'' he said. But
Clinton urged Chirac to press for a European FDA, a course
considered likely by many European-based experts.
</P>
<P>
   However, such a body might not be able to resolve what Greenwald
called ``fundamental differences'' between Americans and Europeans
on food safety issues that could be figuring in the Coke dispute.
</P>
<P>
   He cited continuing trade disputes between the United States and
European Union over U.S. exports of hormone-treated beef and
genetically modified American crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans want 100 percent risk-free,'' he said. ``But
most Americans are willing to accept some risks.''

 &HT;    A world of ways to goof off _ only a mouse click away
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you ignore the horoscopes and advice columns when you read
the newspaper? Do you rush right past the comics to get to the
heavy news?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. And it's much the same on the World Wide Web.
While there is enough practical information to suit the most dour
Web surfer, there also are plenty of light features that are just
plain fun.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with horoscopes. While it would probably be foolish
to plan your company's next public stock offering based on the fact
that next Thursday looks good for your Libra sign, most of us give
our horoscopes an occasional glance. One of the best horoscopes on
the Web comes from an astrologer in the United Kingdom called
Jonathan Cainer. You'll get both daily and weekly forecasts there,
along with a look at the entire year. Just follow the stars to
stars.metawire.com.
</P>
<P>
   Advice columns abound on the Web. You don't have to rely on Dr.
Laura when there's a chance to visit a page called Ask Great Granny
at www.mbnet.mb.ca/crm/granny/granny.htmltoc. You'll be able to
browse the answers or post your own question. You'll find things
organized according to categories, including areas for advice about
children, parents, your love life or even your mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, while the idea is amusing, the advice is far from a
joke. You'll find plenty of lighthearted questions and answers but
also some like this one:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a 47-year-old man looking after an 82-year-old mother in
fragile health. I really have no support from anyone else. I have a
brother, but even after repeated attempts to get him to help, he
sloughs it off and leaves it on my shoulders. I'm not sure where to
go from here. I love my mother and she is still reasonably mobile
and alert, although she has chronic and limiting problems. I want
to care for her at home and will continue to do so, but my own
health seems to be suffering. I'm not sure what lies ahead nor
which way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The next site offers you a chance to win money playing games
online. It's called the Free Games Gallery, and you'll find it at
www.nukingdom.com
</P>
<P>
   /games.htm. You'll find a number of games listed on this page _
just click on one and you are on your way. For instance, there's
WinDough, where you can win $15,000 or so just for playing. No
skill is involved here: This game works much like the lottery. You
leave a tiny window open as you go about your business, maybe even
do some work. Winners are notified if their lucky number comes up.
Then, perhaps, you can quit your job and start cruising the Web on
your own time.
</P>
<P>
   Web cameras are a creation of the Internet. Here's how they
work. Someone _ or some institution _ will install a video camera
and transmit the live video, or still photos that are freshened on
a regular basis, on the Web for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Web camera sites aren't for family viewing. All kind
of folks use them. But some of the cameras are G-rated. There is,
for instance, the camera at Sunrise Beach in Hawaii. You'll see the
surf there without leaving your desk. Just go to
www.satlab.hawaii.edu/satlab/sunset.html.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best time-waster of all is to simply enter your own
name in one of the search engines such as AltaVista or Yahoo! and
then click through the list. You may find that your 15 minutes of
fame have already arrived somewhere on the Web.

 &HT;    Home theater can be created on modest budget
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is it the startling appeal of new theaters with
stadium seating and razzle-dazzle surround sound _ or maybe the
never-ending quest for affordable popcorn? For whatever reason, the
idea of creating a little theater of your own, in your house,
continues to grow and build.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to employ big-screen video to fight your own Star Wars,
right there in the family room, or plant yourself in the backfield,
ready for a handoff, has become the order of the day. Plenty of TV
and stereo dealers will be happy to accommodate you with systems _
for $10,000 to $25,000 or more, or even as little as $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly people are looking for the excitement they now find in
new theaters, with the high-quality sound that is common,'' said
Don Burns, a video and audio salesman in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Doing a home theater on a budget is a practical idea, said Burns
and others, provided you are willing to forgo one of the fancy
high-definition televisions that retail for $5,500 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, most people already have one or more of the
components of a decent home theater system,'' said Buck Brown,
audio video sales manager at a Circuit City in Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The main parts of a home theater include a good TV set, a stereo
VCR, a Dolby digital receiver/amplifier and a six-speaker
surround-sound system. As a source of programming, most experts say
a DVD player is needed. That's the machine that plays movies,
together with superb sound.
</P>
<P>
   The fun of home theater starts with a program source. That could
be a quality videotape, a DVD movie that is deciphered by a DVD
player, a satellite broadcast or, increasingly, a digital broadcast
or programs from digital cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people already have a TV that could be usable,'' said
Brown. ``And that could be any set from 27 inches and up, depending
on the size of the room. Lots of people already have stereo VCRs
that could work in a system.''
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists like Rawland Simmons, video department
supervisor at an Atlanta Best Buys store, say the budget-minded
buyer might even consider skipping the DVD player for now and
starting with a satellite system instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're brand new to DVD,'' said Simmons, ``it means you
need to buy the player and start to build a library. It might be
just as well to spend $300 for a DirecTV or other satellite setup
and get immediate access to a variety of programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, especially purists, point out that DVD is about
the clearest and most attractive picture, and has the flexibility
of interactivity, meaning the viewer can browse the movie easily,
picking out favorite scenes and gathering information about the
movie's background.
</P>
<P>
   It is a unique new way to enjoy movies _ even better than the
commercial theater, because of the flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   DVD, short for digital video disc, has been on the streets only
since mid-1997, but got a burst of sales during the past holiday
season and seems well on the way to denting the videotape sales
market. DVDs were practically launched with the movie ``Twister,''
where the furious tornado pictures and sounds highlighted the new
medium's power to convey excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Starting totally from scratch, the home theater builder would
need to pick up the following:
</P>
<P>
   1. Television set, with cost ranging from nothing, if you have
one you like, to a range of $500 to about $2,200 for a full-blown
60-inch set.
</P>
<P>
   2. A DVD player, from $250 to $500, depending on the extra
features preferred.
</P>
<P>
   3. A Dolby digital receiver, from $300 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   4. A speaker system, from $1,000 to $1,500, including three
front speakers, two rear speakers and a self-powered sub-woofer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another component, often overlooked, is high-quality cables to
connect the system while still maintaining good audio,'' said
Circuit City's Brown. ``If you don't already have the cables and a
good surge protector, it could set you back anywhere from $200 to
$300.''
</P>
<P>
   The sources of good digital programming are considerable, and
eventually will be numerous. In addition to the DVD sources, which
include a library of movies that grows virtually every day, as well
as growing rental collections, don't forget satellite programming.
Eventually, many of us will be able to tap into suitable
programming from upgraded cable service and ``wireless cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people already have laser disc players and a collection of
movies that could be a good program source for home theater. But
the laser disc technology, which was always superior in quality to
videotapes, has been overtaken by DVD. Whether you prefer laser
discs or DVD, the fact is that the library of programming will grow
faster for DVD, video specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest sales in home theater equipment are from October
to January, during the holiday season,'' said Burns. But he and
others say there is a steady flow of sales through the summer, too,
when youngsters are home from college.
</P>
<P>
   The main importance of the home theater is that it's the heart
of a family entertainment center with something for everybody. The
components allow video viewing beyond compare, as well as
facilities for playing music with excellent reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Because the system is divided into components, it allows for
continuous upgrading for new technologies or to accommodate
changing tastes.

 &HT;    Mix schoolwork into summer fun
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA Summer at my house is the season for a camp or two, the
pool, car trips and leisure. And, most importantly, no school.
</P>
<P>
   But as the boys have gotten older, I've come to realize that
complete withdrawal from all schoolwork is not good.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, come fall, we all pay as they struggle initially with
subjects they knew prior to summer's hot, lazy interlude. So this
year, we're mixing some schoolwork with our leisure, and we're
using technology to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys have been using the Internet increasingly to help with
schoolwork, so it won't seem unusual when we go there for some
summer tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, tutoring is one of the things computers do well. As an
impassive, unemotionally involved machine, it has endless patience
with monotonous drill work such as multiplication and division.
</P>
<P>
   Yahooligans, Yahoo!'s kid-oriented search engine, has an
excellent homework page (www.yahooligans.com/SchoolBell) that links
to several good math sites
(www.yahooligans.com/SchoolBell/Math/HomeworkHelp/).
</P>
<P>
   At MegaKids, www.meganova.com/megakids/flash.htm, you do drills
in multiplication, addition, subtraction and division. At the end
of the drill, you're told your completion time and the number of
errors. In the course of the drill, you are retested on problems
you answer incorrectly. When you're done, you are presented with a
printable certificate stating the results.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, Edu4kids (www.edu4kids.com/math/) allows you to
set the number of problems, the level of difficulty, as in ``Easy,
no negatives; Complex, up to 10 numbers,'' as well as the size of
numbers (0-9), (0-99).
</P>
<P>
   Both sites tell you immediately if your answer is right or
wrong. However, Edu4kids only says if it is incorrect, while
MegaKids gives you the correct answer. I found this feature to be
more helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The other area of schoolwork for which I was able to find useful
sites was grammar. Guide to Grammar and Writing
(cctc.commnet.edu/HP/pages/darling/original.htmlogs) has a long
address, but it's worth it. You also can use its name with a search
engine to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you ever wanted to know about grammar is here, from
sentence and word parts to clauses and phrases and punctuation and
more.
</P>
<P>
   There are explanations for each rule of grammar:
</P>
<P>
   Use a comma and a little conjunction (and, but, for, nor, yet,
or, so) to connect two independent clauses, as in ``He hit the ball
well, but he ran toward third base.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules include hyperlinks for further instruction. In the
example above, the phrase ``independent clauses'' is hyperlinked to
its definition.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each section is an interactive quiz. In the quiz
on ``that, which and who,'' you're asked to fill in blanks in
sentences with the correct answer. For example:
</P>
<P>
   ``1. People live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you do, you find out immediately if your answer is correct.
You also can get the explanation for the correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   These sites are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to
online tutorial help. Use the keywords Family Education Network to
find help on America Online as well as the kids channel.
</P>
<P>
   But remember, keep the summer schoolwork in proportion, which
would be a ratio of 3:7, or is that 0.3 of 100 percent ... ?

 &HT;    Doll House's activities fun for young girls
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From the Fisher-Price Time to Play series, Doll House
is girls-only activity software that is kid-friendly and full of
fun, said 4-year-old Rebekah Farris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' said the youngster from suburban Atlanta, who
reviewed the game with the help of her mother, Joy Farris. ``I like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting started with a little help from mom, Rebekah was
able to use the mouse and play with Doll House on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It told me everything to do,'' she said of the easy-to-use
program.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of this role-playing program is to select one of four
multicultural dolls and complete activities in each of five rooms,
with different themes. With the help of Glitter, the fairy guide,
girls do everything from decorate a cake to clean and polish a
room. By completing each activity, girls collect items needed to
hold a first-birthday party for little brother.
</P>
<P>
   Rebekah's favorite activity was playing `dress up' in big
sister's room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to dress up the doll,'' said Rebekah, who got to choose
from a closet full of outfits to dress for any occasion. Or, if she
didn't like what was available, she could create her own outfits
and leave them on the screen or print them out.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever she can wrestle one of two family computers from her
bigger brothers, Rebekah likes to navigate the full-of-surprises
virtual mansion, which resembles the 3-D doll house she owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``She plays it as much as any other program she has,'' Joy
Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   Doll House gets high marks from Rebekah and her mom. They said
the graphics, animation and soundtrack were adequate, though not
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cute and a definite girl thing,'' Joy Farris said.
``It's really good for the 4- to 7-year-old age group it was meant
for.''
</P>
<P>
   DOLL HOUSE

 &HT;    Nisus Writer stacks up well with Microsoft Word, at a bargain
price
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Need a word processor but don't want to pay $300 for Microsoft
Word, the industry standard? Check out Nisus Writer, which you can
now buy online for $42.
</P>
<P>
   That's a heck of a deal when you consider that Nisus Writer can
do nearly anything Word can. Nisus also has some features not yet
included in Word.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say Word 98, the latest version, is a bad
program. It's probably the best word processor for the Mac that
Microsoft has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Word remains the only Mac word processor that lets you
create an outline and then turn it into a finished book, study or
thesis.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Word is that it demands a steep price in terms
of internal memory and disk space. The latest version runs
sluggishly on anything but Power Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to Nisus Writer, developed by a small software
company in Solana Beach, Calif. Nisus Writer will run on just about
any Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The program is fast and responsive. Its working motif is clean
and easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Like Word, Nisus will let you write anything from letters to
books. You can also design newsletters and Web pages, and include
graphics, pictures and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus also has a few useful features not yet included in Word.
For one, Nisus has a great built-in thesaurus. Just highlight a
word and hit the command key and the letter _ up pops the
thesaurus, which includes both a short definition of the word and a
list of suggested alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Another novel Nisus feature is multiple clipboards, which let
you save up to 10 different things at once.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a feature that lets you select and edit various
parts of a document at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus is easy to program for power users. For non-power users,
it comes with a vast library of macros. For example, the library
includes macros that will automatically find and remove empty
spaces and paragraphs in a document.
</P>
<P>
   Where Nisus falls short is in outlining and the making of
tables. You can format Nisus to outline, but it's a royal pain.
Don't even try to use the program's table feature. It's that bad.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find Nisus Writer in stores, and the program is hard
to find in catalogs as well. The best place to order and learn more
about Nisus Writer is at the company's excellent Web site. You'll
find it at www.nisus.com.

 &HT;    Don't kiss off idea of online dating
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, I
ventured into the world of online matchmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't all those stories of people who found love online
fascinating? Don't you single folks wonder if it could happen to
you? Think about it: People who, in the normal course of human
events would never, ever find each other, yet were perfect for each
other, were connecting on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   I shared my idea with the editor of the newspaper I was writing
for at the time. She asked me just one thing in that cold, clipped,
impatient voice that has made her something of a legend in that New
York media whirl that keeps Brill's Content and New York magazine
columnist Michael Wolff in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``So have you tried this dating thing for yourself?'' she asked
in her typical, icy tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, well, no,'' I stammered. The idea was for happy couples to
talk about their happy experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``First person or nothing,'' she commanded into the phone. Then,
as her way, she hung up, probably to take calls from Princess
Diana, Gywnneth Paltrow, Oprah Winfrey or whoever it is she talked
to when she wasn't wasting her time with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   So this was the deal: Go out on dates with guys I met on the
Internet, or seriously consider a part-time job selling pretzels on
a street corner. I had no choice. I had to tell an online community
of desperate single men that I was a desperate single woman, then
tell the whole world about it in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   So I ventured on to a Web site called Match.com, although there
are a million sites that offer similar ``dating, mating and
relating'' services. I chose Match, because it gave me a two-week
trial period (they're down to just one week now) and after that if
your online social life is hopping, you can pay about $14 a month
to join the service and browse potential boyfriend or girlfriend
material indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these online romance sites ask you to fill out a
questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   A very cynical girlfriend of mine refers to personal ads as
``lowest common denominator dating.'' Let me tell you, the online
personals are no different. You fill out questionnaires asking you
to describe your height, weight, hair color, religion and so forth.
There's a little room to talk a little about yourself, but here's
where writer's block of epic proportions sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Guys love to talk about how outdoorsy they are. The online
gentleman writes about hiking, basketball, working out at the gym
and the ever-popular ``cuddling up on a cold night with a special
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   We women aren't much better. We invariably describe ourselves as
``petite, smart, beautiful, educated and professional.'' We like
movies, going out to dinner and ``taking in the best the city _
whatever city that might be _ has to offer.'' When it comes to
personals, even Shakespeare would probably be reduced to writing
about long walks on the beach and candlelit dinners. Something
about a personal ad makes you focus less on who you really are and
more on who you think you ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   From my two weeks with Match.com, I learned a couple of things:
There are all kinds of men out there, which is nice to know. I also
learned that men like fresh meat. I posted my profile on a
Wednesday, and before the week was out I was flooded with requests
from an amazing array of men all dying to meet me. However, this
avalanche slowed to a trickle by the second week. I was a leftover
by then.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite note was from the married French
businessman who comes to the States only once a month and is always
looking for a ``good time.'' I could practically hear his smooth
French accent seeping through his message. Candace Bushnell's
infamous ``Sex in the City'' gals would have jumped at this one,
but I decided to pass on the idea of Internet dating in the fast
lane.
</P>
<P>
   I did meet some nice guys through Match.com. I met a very funny
advertising executive who took me to swank restaurants and hip
parties. However, when the repartee ran down, so did our
relationship. I also met a sweet, shy real estate lawyer who sent
me flowers and took me to sci-fi book festivals. Then I met
possibly the nicest guy of all, a nice homebody who still lived in
his parents' neighborhood, organized community events, and loved
sushi and going fishing with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I couldn't possibly consider him because he seemed
too normal. This may be one of the bigger mistakes in my brief
online dating career. We're all looking for Prince Charming, when
sometimes the Duke of York can make you just as happy. Now I know
that the happy couples who met online saw through all the purple
prose and looked for the real people behind the profiles. I also
learned you have to do the same thing in the offline world, too,
with almost everyone you know.
</P>
<P>
   In the end what I learned from my online dating experience was
the comforting knowledge that women pushing 30 can still meet nice
guys. I also found out that women pushing 30 can meet enough online
jerks, wise guys, philanderers and weirdos to make Ally McBeal's
social life look normal.
</P>
<P>
   Online dating, if you know what you're getting into, can be an
interesting week, if not a lifelong commitment.

 &HT;    Microsoft Office 2000 evaluated in depth
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The inside scoop on the latest version of Microsoft Office,
released last week, is available in the July issue of PC World. An
article examines Office 2000's strengths and weaknesses. One major
weakness the magazine found is that complex Web pages made with
Office 2000 often can't be viewed by other browser applications,
such as Netscape Navigator. The good news, according to the
magazine, is that Office 2000 will recognize documents and
spreadsheets made in earlier versions.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World, there's a buyer's guide that
lists recommendations for everything from computers to printers to
software. Among the magazine's recommendations are the Dell
OptiPlex GX1p 500 as the best desktop computer; the Quantex M400 C
as the best budget desktop; the Dell Latitude CPi A366XT as the
best laptop; and the MaxTech XPV56P NetPacer as the best modem.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   With the PalmPilot becoming increasingly commonplace, there are
scores of new software packages for this hand-held computer. You
can now use the PalmPilot to organize your thoughts, write outlines
and track travel expenses. Most of the Palm applications are
available online directly from developers. Here's a look at three
popular programs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Quicksheet, which retails for $50, lets you create
spreadsheets on a PalmPilot and export them to Excel. You can also
export Excel spreadsheets to the PalmPilot through Quicksheet.
</P>
<P>
   _ ThoughtMill, which retails for $18, lets you organize projects
that involve multiple tasks over time.
</P>
<P>
   _ BrainForest is an outliner. Retailing for about $50, this
program lets you create and export to your desktop sophisticated
outlines.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that, if you have the right plug-in, the Web is a
great way to listen to the radio? Dozens of sites now stream live
radio broadcasts. One of the recent additions to this genre is
Webradio.com. Through a Java-based technology, the site offers
access to 27 radio stations that are broadcast via the Internet.
The great thing about Webradio.com is that you don't need a plug-in
such as RealPlayer to listen to the site's stations. You'll find
Webradio.com at www.webradio.com.

 &HT;    Britannica a great reason to upgrade to DVD drive
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If any single piece of software can make it mandatory to include
a DVD drive in every computer, it is the DVD version of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica.
</P>
<P>
   Warts and all _ and it has enough of them to need the services
of a good dermatologist _ the DVD version of the best print
encyclopedia now takes its rightful place as the best electronic
encyclopedia for adults.
</P>
<P>
   I say adult not because of any particularly racy content, but
because the siren song of multimedia has still not totally
convinced the publishers. No erupting volcanos, no roaring tigers
here. Just more and better information than any other electronic
encyclopedia offers.
</P>
<P>
   It was good to see that the 1999 version of the EB no longer
uses Netscape as its search engine, but this was quickly allayed by
seeing that it simply dropped Netscape and picked up Microsoft
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   However, the change was greater than that. The user no longer
feels as though the computer is constantly online, and the
interface is really just as slick as anyone else's. Not quite as
gadgety as Encarta's, but attractive and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is quite a lot of video included on this
wonderful disc. The videos tend to be of satisfying length and
range from views of a herd of elephants going about its daily
business to extremely technical clips depicting the procedure for
making DNA comparisons. Most of it is soundless except for
occasional narration and the insertion of generic bird sounds into
some of the nature films.
</P>
<P>
   Audio clips are limited to the national anthems of the world's
nations and the sounds of individual musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, while you won't get a few bars of Haydn's
``Surprise'' symphony, you get a long, comprehensive biography and
appreciation of his work written by H.C. Robbins Landon, the
foremost Haydn scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The article on flamenco is by far the most intelligent and
detailed I have seen in any encyclopedia; unfortunately, the author
is not listed.
</P>
<P>
   There are brief biographies on many of my favorite folks who are
ignored by every other encyclopedia. The Dalton brothers and Bill
Doolin are here, although the little article on the latter contains
an error _ the deputy U.S. marshal who killed him was Heck Thomas,
not Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Linkage from a subject to related items is splendid, drawing the
casual browser deeper and deeper into the study of a specific area.
I didn't see a single article that didn't have at least one
Internet link.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the other encyclopedias, EB now includes ``features'' _
specially organized areas.
</P>
<P>
   The only one comparable to its peers is the timeline, and this
is very well-done, allowing the user to pick any two of a number of
general subjects for a timeline study.
</P>
<P>
   Most amazing is the Analyst, which allows a student to compare
general statistics of two countries. You can get these comparisons
as written reports or in table form. How else could you learn that
Australia has 20,300 percent more sheep than Canada?
</P>
<P>
   For younger folks, there is a splendid feature called full-text
search, which allows one to ask a question.
</P>
<P>
   I typed in ``Why does a cow chew a cud?'' and got a long list of
responses, the first and most immediately relevant of which was a
definition of ruminant mammals.
</P>
<P>
   The Spectrum feature presents 10 general areas which,
altogether, cover virtually every aspect of human knowledge. These
are basically outlines, and clicking on anything not only provides
a discussion of that topic but offers many related topics, drawing
you deeper and deeper. It's almost addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about the warts. The worst of them will bother only users
of Peter Norton's CleanSweep utility.
</P>
<P>
   With CleanSweep running in the background, every time you click
the mouse the program thinks you are about to install a program and
asks if you want it monitored. Annoying, but for EB I can live with
it.
</P>
<P>
   If you are running Windows 98, some of the features won't work
unless you make a change to your computer's file structure. Making
the change is quite simple; the ramifications of it, however, are
not yet clear.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD version of Encyclopaedia Britannica 1999 carries a list
price of $129. If you have a DVD drive, I have to urge you to get
the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't, then I'll urge you to get the DVD drive and then
get the encyclopedia.

 &HT;    TECHNOBUDDY: Remember MP3 _ it's a pioneer
 &HT;    (Eds: The following column moved June 12 as a bonus Technobuddy
column. It is being repeated this week.)
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year or so before Apple introduced its palm-sized Newton you
were told that almost everyone would want to own one of those
little gadgets that let you write on the screen instead of type on
a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make a person go out and buy stock in Apple.
Those who did were soon sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The Newton is literally history. It had a few flaws: Most
notable was the fact that its handwriting recognition technology
didn't work any more often than your laziest uncle.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when it seems I work in the hysteria industry
covering a world that changes too fast to follow. When an arguably
important technology comes along, the press is tempted to scream
loud and fast rather than take the chance of missing something.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that we were wrong about the Newton, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   It truly did make history. It was a pioneer, the first breeze
that told us a storm was coming. The news wasn't that Newton was
the product of the century. Instead it was tangible proof that
smart people at a big technology company were trying to satisfy the
public desire for computing on the go.
</P>
<P>
   The itch was a real one and you won't have to look hard today to
find the successor to the Newton. Sooner or later, a company really
did make palm-sized computing practical and nowadays the Palm Pilot
scatches that itch nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Smart people at big companies are making the same sort of bets
on a technology called MP3 right now. MP3 is being touted as a
technology that will replace CDs as the way you buy music. Instead
of dropping in at the music store, you'll download your music from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it, or against it. Instead, learn from the history
of technology. You'll find dozens of pioneering products that were
important as predictors of a basic change. In many cases, the
products fell by the wayside ... that's always been the risk that
pioneers take.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are that you don't know Mosiac from monosodium glutamate.
It was one of the earliest computer programs used to browse the
Internet's World Wide Web, introduced back in the days before most
of you knew or cared what the Web was.
</P>
<P>
   It got rave reviews and _ unlike the Newton _ it actually
worked. But nowadays Microsoft and Netscape own the market for
browsers. Mosiac's place was as a pioneer. Just as the Conastoga
wagons paved the way for Interstate highways to the West, Mosiac
made it possible for you to show off your kids on your own personal
Web page. It wasn't the wagon that ended up being a big deal, the
important thing was in opening up a way to move West.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes we forget that when working in the hysteria
industry. When a Newton or a Mosiac comes along, the temptation _
both in the public and in the press _ is to focus on the product
itself and not on the need that it was created to fill. Important
products _ and Newton and Mosiac fit that definition _ are created
to solve a problem.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about MP3 _ a technology with a name so unwieldly
that we must call it by its initials instead of Motion Picture
Coding Experts Group-1, audio layer-3 _ it would be a mistake to
focus on today's technology or even on MP3.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 may end up being the best thing since sliced bread. But, it
is not that yet. Try this experiment, even now after it has been
written about extensively. Stand in the mall and ask the next 10
people what MP3 is. My guess is that two of them will think it's a
new Army tank and at least one person thinks you're trying to get
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Then take another survey, this time among your friends who have
a computer and access to the Internet. Ask them if they regularly
download files _ and that's what you must do if people are to make
money peddling music on the Net using MP3.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 may some day represent a technology as simple and as
all-pervasive as the telephone. But _ other than to the companies
that are betting big bucks on it _ that's almost immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   What is important is that the wind is blowing again. Now that
we've sampled how easy it is to order merchandise using the
Internet, there is a growing desire to be pampered even more. We
want the Net to deliver that merchandise ... in this case music.
And, by MP3 or some technology that you've never heard of, it will
happen.

 &HT;    A world of ways to goof off _ only a mouse click away
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you ignore the horoscopes and advice columns when you read
the newspaper? Do you rush right past the comics to get to the
heavy news?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. And it's much the same on the World Wide Web.
While there is enough practical information to suit the most dour
Web surfer, there also are plenty of light features that are just
plain fun.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with horoscopes. While it would probably be foolish
to plan your company's next public stock offering based on the fact
that next Thursday looks good for your Libra sign, most of us give
our horoscopes an occasional glance. One of the best horoscopes on
the Web comes from an astrologer in the United Kingdom called
Jonathan Cainer. You'll get both daily and weekly forecasts there,
along with a look at the entire year. Just follow the stars to
stars.metawire.com.
</P>
<P>
   Advice columns abound on the Web. You don't have to rely on Dr.
Laura when there's a chance to visit a page called Ask Great Granny
at www.mbnet.mb.ca/crm/granny/granny.htmltoc. You'll be able to
browse the answers or post your own question. You'll find things
organized according to categories, including areas for advice about
children, parents, your love life or even your mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, while the idea is amusing, the advice is far from a
joke. You'll find plenty of lighthearted questions and answers but
also some like this one:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a 47-year-old man looking after an 82-year-old mother in
fragile health. I really have no support from anyone else. I have a
brother, but even after repeated attempts to get him to help, he
sloughs it off and leaves it on my shoulders. I'm not sure where to
go from here. I love my mother and she is still reasonably mobile
and alert, although she has chronic and limiting problems. I want
to care for her at home and will continue to do so, but my own
health seems to be suffering. I'm not sure what lies ahead nor
which way to go.''

   The next site offers you a chance to win money playing games
online. It's called the Free Games Gallery, and you'll find it at
www.nukingdom.com
</P>
<P>
   /games.htm. You'll find a number of games listed on this page _
just click on one and you are on your way. For instance, there's
WinDough, where you can win $15,000 or so just for playing. No
skill is involved here: This game works much like the lottery. You
leave a tiny window open as you go about your business, maybe even
do some work. Winners are notified if their lucky number comes up.
Then, perhaps, you can quit your job and start cruising the Web on
your own time.
</P>
<P>
   Web cameras are a creation of the Internet. Here's how they
work. Someone _ or some institution _ will install a video camera
and transmit the live video, or still photos that are freshened on
a regular basis, on the Web for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Web camera sites aren't for family viewing. All kind
of folks use them. But some of the cameras are G-rated. There is,
for instance, the camera at Sunrise Beach in Hawaii. You'll see the
surf there without leaving your desk. Just go to
www.satlab.hawaii.edu/satlab/sunset.html.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best time-waster of all is to simply enter your own
name in one of the search engines such as AltaVista or Yahoo! and
then click through the list. You may find that your 15 minutes of
fame have already arrived somewhere on the Web.

 &HT;    Mix schoolwork into summer fun
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA Summer at my house is the season for a camp or two, the
pool, car trips and leisure. And, most importantly, no school.
</P>
<P>
   But as the boys have gotten older, I've come to realize that
complete withdrawal from all schoolwork is not good.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, come fall, we all pay as they struggle initially with
subjects they knew prior to summer's hot, lazy interlude. So this
year, we're mixing some schoolwork with our leisure, and we're
using technology to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys have been using the Internet increasingly to help with
schoolwork, so it won't seem unusual when we go there for some
summer tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, tutoring is one of the things computers do well. As an
impassive, unemotionally involved machine, it has endless patience
with monotonous drill work such as multiplication and division.
</P>
<P>
   Yahooligans, Yahoo!'s kid-oriented search engine, has an
excellent homework page (www.yahooligans.com/SchoolBell) that links
to several good math sites
(www.yahooligans.com/SchoolBell/Math/HomeworkHelp/).
</P>
<P>
   At MegaKids, www.meganova.com/megakids/flash.htm, you do drills
in multiplication, addition, subtraction and division. At the end
of the drill, you're told your completion time and the number of
errors. In the course of the drill, you are retested on problems
you answer incorrectly. When you're done, you are presented with a
printable certificate stating the results.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, Edu4kids (www.edu4kids.com/math/) allows you to
set the number of problems, the level of difficulty, as in ``Easy,
no negatives; Complex, up to 10 numbers,'' as well as the size of
numbers (0-9), (0-99).
</P>
<P>
   Both sites tell you immediately if your answer is right or
wrong. However, Edu4kids only says if it is incorrect, while
MegaKids gives you the correct answer. I found this feature to be
more helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The other area of schoolwork for which I was able to find useful
sites was grammar. Guide to Grammar and Writing
(cctc.commnet.edu/HP/pages/darling/original.htmlogs) has a long
address, but it's worth it. You also can use its name with a search
engine to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you ever wanted to know about grammar is here, from
sentence and word parts to clauses and phrases and punctuation and
more.
</P>
<P>
   There are explanations for each rule of grammar:
</P>
<P>
   Use a comma and a little conjunction (and, but, for, nor, yet,
or, so) to connect two independent clauses, as in ``He hit the ball
well, but he ran toward third base.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules include hyperlinks for further instruction. In the
example above, the phrase ``independent clauses'' is hyperlinked to
its definition.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each section is an interactive quiz. In the quiz
on ``that, which and who,'' you're asked to fill in blanks in
sentences with the correct answer. For example:
</P>
<P>
   ``1. People live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you do, you find out immediately if your answer is correct.
You also can get the explanation for the correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   These sites are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to
online tutorial help. Use the keywords Family Education Network to
find help on America Online as well as the kids channel.
</P>
<P>
   But remember, keep the summer schoolwork in proportion, which
would be a ratio of 3:7, or is that 0.3 of 100 percent ... ?

 &HT;    Doll House's activities fun for young girls
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From the Fisher-Price Time to Play series, Doll House
is girls-only activity software that is kid-friendly and full of
fun, said 4-year-old Rebekah Farris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' said the youngster from suburban Atlanta, who
reviewed the game with the help of her mother, Joy Farris. ``I like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting started with a little help from mom, Rebekah was
able to use the mouse and play with Doll House on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It told me everything to do,'' she said of the easy-to-use
program.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of this role-playing program is to select one of four
multicultural dolls and complete activities in each of five rooms,
with different themes. With the help of Glitter, the fairy guide,
girls do everything from decorate a cake to clean and polish a
room. By completing each activity, girls collect items needed to
hold a first-birthday party for little brother.
</P>
<P>
   Rebekah's favorite activity was playing `dress up' in big
sister's room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to dress up the doll,'' said Rebekah, who got to choose
from a closet full of outfits to dress for any occasion. Or, if she
didn't like what was available, she could create her own outfits
and leave them on the screen or print them out.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever she can wrestle one of two family computers from her
bigger brothers, Rebekah likes to navigate the full-of-surprises
virtual mansion, which resembles the 3-D doll house she owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``She plays it as much as any other program she has,'' Joy
Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   Doll House gets high marks from Rebekah and her mom. They said
the graphics, animation and soundtrack were adequate, though not
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cute and a definite girl thing,'' Joy Farris said.
``It's really good for the 4- to 7-year-old age group it was meant
for.''
</P>
<P>
   DOLL HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Developer: Fisher-Price
</P>
<P>
   Price: $19.95
</P>
<P>
   Format: PC and Mac
</P>
<P>
   Rebekah's grade: A

 &HT;    Nisus Writer stacks up well with Microsoft Word, at a bargain
price
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Need a word processor but don't want to pay $300 for Microsoft
Word, the industry standard? Check out Nisus Writer, which you can
now buy online for $42.
</P>
<P>
   That's a heck of a deal when you consider that Nisus Writer can
do nearly anything Word can. Nisus also has some features not yet
included in Word.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say Word 98, the latest version, is a bad
program. It's probably the best word processor for the Mac that
Microsoft has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Word remains the only Mac word processor that lets you
create an outline and then turn it into a finished book, study or
thesis.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Word is that it demands a steep price in terms
of internal memory and disk space. The latest version runs
sluggishly on anything but Power Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to Nisus Writer, developed by a small software
company in Solana Beach, Calif. Nisus Writer will run on just about
any Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The program is fast and responsive. Its working motif is clean
and easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Like Word, Nisus will let you write anything from letters to
books. You can also design newsletters and Web pages, and include
graphics, pictures and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus also has a few useful features not yet included in Word.
For one, Nisus has a great built-in thesaurus. Just highlight a
word and hit the command key and the letter _ up pops the
thesaurus, which includes both a short definition of the word and a
list of suggested alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Another novel Nisus feature is multiple clipboards, which let
you save up to 10 different things at once.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a feature that lets you select and edit various
parts of a document at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus is easy to program for power users. For non-power users,
it comes with a vast library of macros. For example, the library
includes macros that will automatically find and remove empty
spaces and paragraphs in a document.
</P>
<P>
   Where Nisus falls short is in outlining and the making of
tables. You can format Nisus to outline, but it's a royal pain.
Don't even try to use the program's table feature. It's that bad.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find Nisus Writer in stores, and the program is hard
to find in catalogs as well. The best place to order and learn more
about Nisus Writer is at the company's excellent Web site. You'll
find it at www.nisus.com.

 &HT;    Don't kiss off idea of online dating
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, I
ventured into the world of online matchmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't all those stories of people who found love online
fascinating? Don't you single folks wonder if it could happen to
you? Think about it: People who, in the normal course of human
events would never, ever find each other, yet were perfect for each
other, were connecting on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   I shared my idea with the editor of the newspaper I was writing
for at the time. She asked me just one thing in that cold, clipped,
impatient voice that has made her something of a legend in that New
York media whirl that keeps Brill's Content and New York magazine
columnist Michael Wolff in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``So have you tried this dating thing for yourself?'' she asked
in her typical, icy tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, well, no,'' I stammered. The idea was for happy couples to
talk about their happy experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``First person or nothing,'' she commanded into the phone. Then,
as her way, she hung up, probably to take calls from Princess
Diana, Gywnneth Paltrow, Oprah Winfrey or whoever it is she talked
to when she wasn't wasting her time with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   So this was the deal: Go out on dates with guys I met on the
Internet, or seriously consider a part-time job selling pretzels on
a street corner. I had no choice. I had to tell an online community
of desperate single men that I was a desperate single woman, then
tell the whole world about it in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   So I ventured on to a Web site called Match.com, although there
are a million sites that offer similar ``dating, mating and
relating'' services. I chose Match, because it gave me a two-week
trial period (they're down to just one week now) and after that if
your online social life is hopping, you can pay about $14 a month
to join the service and browse potential boyfriend or girlfriend
material indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these online romance sites ask you to fill out a
questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   A very cynical girlfriend of mine refers to personal ads as
``lowest common denominator dating.'' Let me tell you, the online
personals are no different. You fill out questionnaires asking you
to describe your height, weight, hair color, religion and so forth.
There's a little room to talk a little about yourself, but here's
where writer's block of epic proportions sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Guys love to talk about how outdoorsy they are. The online
gentleman writes about hiking, basketball, working out at the gym
and the ever-popular ``cuddling up on a cold night with a special
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   We women aren't much better. We invariably describe ourselves as
``petite, smart, beautiful, educated and professional.'' We like
movies, going out to dinner and ``taking in the best the city _
whatever city that might be _ has to offer.'' When it comes to
personals, even Shakespeare would probably be reduced to writing
about long walks on the beach and candlelit dinners. Something
about a personal ad makes you focus less on who you really are and
more on who you think you ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   From my two weeks with Match.com, I learned a couple of things:
There are all kinds of men out there, which is nice to know. I also
learned that men like fresh meat. I posted my profile on a
Wednesday, and before the week was out I was flooded with requests
from an amazing array of men all dying to meet me. However, this
avalanche slowed to a trickle by the second week. I was a leftover
by then.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite note was from the married French
businessman who comes to the States only once a month and is always
looking for a ``good time.'' I could practically hear his smooth
French accent seeping through his message. Candace Bushnell's
infamous ``Sex in the City'' gals would have jumped at this one,
but I decided to pass on the idea of Internet dating in the fast
lane.
</P>
<P>
   I did meet some nice guys through Match.com. I met a very funny
advertising executive who took me to swank restaurants and hip
parties. However, when the repartee ran down, so did our
relationship. I also met a sweet, shy real estate lawyer who sent
me flowers and took me to sci-fi book festivals. Then I met
possibly the nicest guy of all, a nice homebody who still lived in
his parents' neighborhood, organized community events, and loved
sushi and going fishing with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I couldn't possibly consider him because he seemed
too normal. This may be one of the bigger mistakes in my brief
online dating career. We're all looking for Prince Charming, when
sometimes the Duke of York can make you just as happy. Now I know
that the happy couples who met online saw through all the purple
prose and looked for the real people behind the profiles. I also
learned you have to do the same thing in the offline world, too,
with almost everyone you know.
</P>
<P>
   In the end what I learned from my online dating experience was
the comforting knowledge that women pushing 30 can still meet nice
guys. I also found out that women pushing 30 can meet enough online
jerks, wise guys, philanderers and weirdos to make Ally McBeal's
social life look normal.
</P>
<P>
   Online dating, if you know what you're getting into, can be an
interesting week, if not a lifelong commitment.

 &HT;    Microsoft Office 2000 evaluated in depth
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The inside scoop on the latest version of Microsoft Office,
released last week, is available in the July issue of PC World. An
article examines Office 2000's strengths and weaknesses. One major
weakness the magazine found is that complex Web pages made with
Office 2000 often can't be viewed by other browser applications,
such as Netscape Navigator. The good news, according to the
magazine, is that Office 2000 will recognize documents and
spreadsheets made in earlier versions.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World, there's a buyer's guide that
lists recommendations for everything from computers to printers to
software. Among the magazine's recommendations are the Dell
OptiPlex GX1p 500 as the best desktop computer; the Quantex M400 C
as the best budget desktop; the Dell Latitude CPi A366XT as the
best laptop; and the MaxTech XPV56P NetPacer as the best modem.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   With the PalmPilot becoming increasingly commonplace, there are
scores of new software packages for this hand-held computer. You
can now use the PalmPilot to organize your thoughts, write outlines
and track travel expenses. Most of the Palm applications are
available online directly from developers. Here's a look at three
popular programs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Quicksheet, which retails for $50, lets you create
spreadsheets on a PalmPilot and export them to Excel. You can also
export Excel spreadsheets to the PalmPilot through Quicksheet.
</P>
<P>
   _ ThoughtMill, which retails for $18, lets you organize projects
that involve multiple tasks over time.
</P>
<P>
   _ BrainForest is an outliner. Retailing for about $50, this
program lets you create and export to your desktop sophisticated
outlines.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that, if you have the right plug-in, the Web is a
great way to listen to the radio? Dozens of sites now stream live
radio broadcasts. One of the recent additions to this genre is
Webradio.com. Through a Java-based technology, the site offers
access to 27 radio stations that are broadcast via the Internet.
The great thing about Webradio.com is that you don't need a plug-in
such as RealPlayer to listen to the site's stations. You'll find
Webradio.com at www.webradio.com.

 &HT;    Britannica a great reason to upgrade to DVD drive
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If any single piece of software can make it mandatory to include
a DVD drive in every computer, it is the DVD version of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica.
</P>
<P>
   Warts and all _ and it has enough of them to need the services
of a good dermatologist _ the DVD version of the best print
encyclopedia now takes its rightful place as the best electronic
encyclopedia for adults.
</P>
<P>
   I say adult not because of any particularly racy content, but
because the siren song of multimedia has still not totally
convinced the publishers. No erupting volcanos, no roaring tigers
here. Just more and better information than any other electronic
encyclopedia offers.
</P>
<P>
   It was good to see that the 1999 version of the EB no longer
uses Netscape as its search engine, but this was quickly allayed by
seeing that it simply dropped Netscape and picked up Microsoft
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   However, the change was greater than that. The user no longer
feels as though the computer is constantly online, and the
interface is really just as slick as anyone else's. Not quite as
gadgety as Encarta's, but attractive and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is quite a lot of video included on this
wonderful disc. The videos tend to be of satisfying length and
range from views of a herd of elephants going about its daily
business to extremely technical clips depicting the procedure for
making DNA comparisons. Most of it is soundless except for
occasional narration and the insertion of generic bird sounds into
some of the nature films.
</P>
<P>
   Audio clips are limited to the national anthems of the world's
nations and the sounds of individual musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, while you won't get a few bars of Haydn's
``Surprise'' symphony, you get a long, comprehensive biography and
appreciation of his work written by H.C. Robbins Landon, the
foremost Haydn scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The article on flamenco is by far the most intelligent and
detailed I have seen in any encyclopedia; unfortunately, the author
is not listed.
</P>
<P>
   There are brief biographies on many of my favorite folks who are
ignored by every other encyclopedia. The Dalton brothers and Bill
Doolin are here, although the little article on the latter contains
an error _ the deputy U.S. marshal who killed him was Heck Thomas,
not Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Linkage from a subject to related items is splendid, drawing the
casual browser deeper and deeper into the study of a specific area.
I didn't see a single article that didn't have at least one
Internet link.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the other encyclopedias, EB now includes ``features'' _
specially organized areas.
</P>
<P>
   The only one comparable to its peers is the timeline, and this
is very well-done, allowing the user to pick any two of a number of
general subjects for a timeline study.
</P>
<P>
   Most amazing is the Analyst, which allows a student to compare
general statistics of two countries. You can get these comparisons
as written reports or in table form. How else could you learn that
Australia has 20,300 percent more sheep than Canada?
</P>
<P>
   For younger folks, there is a splendid feature called full-text
search, which allows one to ask a question.
</P>
<P>
   I typed in ``Why does a cow chew a cud?'' and got a long list of
responses, the first and most immediately relevant of which was a
definition of ruminant mammals.

   The Spectrum feature presents 10 general areas which,
altogether, cover virtually every aspect of human knowledge. These
are basically outlines, and clicking on anything not only provides
a discussion of that topic but offers many related topics, drawing
you deeper and deeper. It's almost addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about the warts. The worst of them will bother only users
of Peter Norton's CleanSweep utility.
</P>
<P>
   With CleanSweep running in the background, every time you click
the mouse the program thinks you are about to install a program and
asks if you want it monitored. Annoying, but for EB I can live with
it.
</P>
<P>
   If you are running Windows 98, some of the features won't work
unless you make a change to your computer's file structure. Making
the change is quite simple; the ramifications of it, however, are
not yet clear.

   The DVD version of Encyclopaedia Britannica 1999 carries a list
price of $129. If you have a DVD drive, I have to urge you to get
the encyclopedia.
</P>

   If you don't, then I'll urge you to get the DVD drive and then
get the encyclopedia.

 &HT;    TECHNOBUDDY: Remember MP3 _ it's a pioneer
 &HT;    (Eds: The following column moved June 12 as a bonus Technobuddy
column. It is being repeated this week.)
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year or so before Apple introduced its palm-sized Newton you
were told that almost everyone would want to own one of those
little gadgets that let you write on the screen instead of type on
a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make a person go out and buy stock in Apple.
Those who did were soon sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The Newton is literally history. It had a few flaws: Most
notable was the fact that its handwriting recognition technology
didn't work any more often than your laziest uncle.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when it seems I work in the hysteria industry
covering a world that changes too fast to follow. When an arguably
important technology comes along, the press is tempted to scream
loud and fast rather than take the chance of missing something.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that we were wrong about the Newton, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   It truly did make history. It was a pioneer, the first breeze
that told us a storm was coming. The news wasn't that Newton was
the product of the century. Instead it was tangible proof that
smart people at a big technology company were trying to satisfy the
public desire for computing on the go.
</P>
<P>
   The itch was a real one and you won't have to look hard today to
find the successor to the Newton. Sooner or later, a company really
did make palm-sized computing practical and nowadays the Palm Pilot
scatches that itch nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Smart people at big companies are making the same sort of bets
on a technology called MP3 right now. MP3 is being touted as a
technology that will replace CDs as the way you buy music. Instead
of dropping in at the music store, you'll download your music from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it, or against it. Instead, learn from the history
of technology. You'll find dozens of pioneering products that were
important as predictors of a basic change. In many cases, the
products fell by the wayside ... that's always been the risk that
pioneers take.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are that you don't know Mosiac from monosodium glutamate.
It was one of the earliest computer programs used to browse the
Internet's World Wide Web, introduced back in the days before most
of you knew or cared what the Web was.
</P>
<P>
   It got rave reviews and _ unlike the Newton _ it actually
worked. But nowadays Microsoft and Netscape own the market for
browsers. Mosiac's place was as a pioneer. Just as the Conastoga
wagons paved the way for Interstate highways to the West, Mosiac
made it possible for you to show off your kids on your own personal
Web page. It wasn't the wagon that ended up being a big deal, the
important thing was in opening up a way to move West.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes we forget that when working in the hysteria
industry. When a Newton or a Mosiac comes along, the temptation _
both in the public and in the press _ is to focus on the product
itself and not on the need that it was created to fill. Important
products _ and Newton and Mosiac fit that definition _ are created
to solve a problem.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about MP3 _ a technology with a name so unwieldly
that we must call it by its initials instead of Motion Picture
Coding Experts Group-1, audio layer-3 _ it would be a mistake to
focus on today's technology or even on MP3.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 may end up being the best thing since sliced bread. But, it
is not that yet. Try this experiment, even now after it has been
written about extensively. Stand in the mall and ask the next 10
people what MP3 is. My guess is that two of them will think it's a
new Army tank and at least one person thinks you're trying to get
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Then take another survey, this time among your friends who have
a computer and access to the Internet. Ask them if they regularly
download files _ and that's what you must do if people are to make
money peddling music on the Net using MP3.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 may some day represent a technology as simple and as
all-pervasive as the telephone. But _ other than to the companies
that are betting big bucks on it _ that's almost immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   What is important is that the wind is blowing again. Now that
we've sampled how easy it is to order merchandise using the
Internet, there is a growing desire to be pampered even more. We
want the Net to deliver that merchandise ... in this case music.
And, by MP3 or some technology that you've never heard of, it will
happen.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: As recent transplants to Texas, we have two questions. A
friend who lives in Colorado recently had a baby. Her husband is a
University of Texas graduate. Where can I go in Austin to buy
infant/toddler clothes with UT logos _ hats, T-shirts, sweatshirts,
jackets, etc.? What is the rhyme or reason (if any) to the numbers
and letters used on Texas license plates? _ D.R.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: License plate numbers are allocated to Texas counties in
blocks. There is no discernible pattern to the allocation, although
the Texas Department of Transportation keeps records of where the
plates are. The current system (as of fall 1998) is letter, number,
number, letter, letter, letter; the previous, letter, letter
letter, number, number, letter. No vowels are assigned on these
regular issue plates, so about 12 million combinations are
possible, says Texas DOT's Mike Viesca. These numbers should keep
Texans in license plates until 2004 or 2006. Another difference on
the new plates? The Texas flag is on the right, not the left of the
sequence. For your friend's little Longhorn, pick up all things UT
at Bevo's Bookstore in Dobie Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to find out how to purchase Thurber bricks. They
were used in a piece of the flooring at the new airport. My wife's
maiden name is Thurber and we visited Thurber earlier this year. We
would like to obtain a brick for each grandkid. _ J. Sturm
</P>
<P>
   A: Wish I could unearth one or more for you. These pavers were
taken up when Congress Avenue was refurbished years ago. At the
time the City sold some bricks ($5 a pop as I recall) and stored
others. None are for sale currently. The bricks are called Thurber
because they were manufactured in Thurber in the northwest corner
of Erath County (west of Fort Worth). Named for New Yorker H.K.
Thurber, it began as a company coal mining town. The brick plant
opened in 1897 and closed in 1930. An interesting Thurber-ism? It
was one of the first cities with electricity _ in 1895. The
remaining pavers will show up in various city projects like the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a little weather watch radio that picks up continuous
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather reports,
and we can get the same thing on cable TV with graphics. Why isn't
the same thing broadcast over one (or several) radio stations with
the same call letters all over the country? Driving through
Oklahoma years ago we were warned of an approaching tornado on our
weather radio. But car radios are more powerful, so using
conventional radio for continuous weather information seems to make
safety sense. _ John N.
</P>
<P>
   A: The National Weather Service has investigated using AM bands
as well as parts of FM bands for NOAA radio, but ``there is not
enough space on these bands to send all the information out
specific to each area and ensure none of the broadcasts interfered
with each other,'' says Larry Eblen, NWS warning and coordination
meteorologist. Now, when you pick up weather information on weather
radio, it is applicable to your area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend recently sent an article about the Joan of Arc TV
special with a note asking if I knew that Joan was really not from
``Arc.'' He said that in fact there is no ``Arc'' in France, and
that her name was actually Jeanne Darc, which in time became Jeanne
d'Arc and eventually Jeanne of Arc. _ John N.
</P>
<P>
   A: There is a town called Arc in France (just east of Dijon) so
the appellation may be based on the place, hometown to father
Jacques d'Arc. However, says Mary Lou Gibson, columnist for
``Catholic Spirit,'' names were also based on occupation. Jeanne's
father, a peasant farmer, could have been a good archer (arc means
bow in French). The saint is also known as ``la Pucelle,'' the
virgin or maid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My VCR malfunctioned and did not tape the final leg of the
Triple Crown. Is there any place to purchase a copy of the
television broadcast? Is there a viewer who has a copy I can copy?
Help! _ K. Gray
</P>
<P>
   A: A viewer may pop up, but if not, contact Belmont Park to
purchase a copy _ $25 per race for any at the 430-acre site. Lemon
Drop Kid pulled off an exciting victory. Owned and operated by the
New York Racing Commission, Belmont Park racetrack is the largest
in the country. The track is 1.5 miles long and the grandstand, at
1,266 feet, is longer than the Empire State building is tall. Races
are often held in front of capacity crowds (85,000 fans).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have cotton baby dresses (circa 1938) and woolen sweaters
ready for storage. Where can I find acid free tissue paper and
boxes? Also, is there something (not moth balls) that I can include
in the packaging that will help keep down the musty odor? _ J.
Harris
</P>
<P>
   A: Pick up acid-free boxes and paper at The Container Store.
Consider also purchasing zippered storage containers. Clean clothes
can be free of insect larvae if placed in strong sunlight for one
to two hours, spun in a dryer for approximately 45 minutes or
popped in the freezer for a few days . You be the judge of which is
correct for the item and the fabric. Place the clothes in the paper
and then the zippered storage bag to protect from moths and
silverfish. Keeping fresh air out is important. Many people find
the repellent cedar an acceptable odor. Oil of cedar is available
at many hardware stores. Other herbal treatments that do not
wrinkle noses? Lavender, rosemary or lemon grass.

 &HT;    Harry Potter casts new spell
 &HT;    By Theresa Walsh Giarrusso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Potter is back for his second year at Hogwarts School for
Witchcraft and Wizardry _ and already he's in trouble! A spirit
named Moaning Myrtle, who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the
unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's sister are minor problems
compared to someone turning students into stone! ``Harry Potter and
the Chamber of Secrets,'' the second book in the series, was
released three months early in the United States. Check libraries
and bookstores now ($17.95, Scholastic Press). Stay tuned to NFK
for more about ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.''

 &HT;    The physics of rollercoasters
 &HT;    By Kelly Milner Halls
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Six Flags Over Georgia unveiled the Georgia
Scorcher _ its rockin' new, 54-mph, 2.5-minute stand-up roller
coaster _ this spring, one thing was on the minds of would-be
riders. Fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love to be afraid,'' says Six Flags spokeswoman Terrie
Ward. ``We love the anticipation that goes along with riding a
roller coaster like the Scorcher.''
</P>
<P>
   What we love, according to Atlanta psychologist Michael White is
the illusion of danger. ``Because of safety regulations, we know
roller coasters are not really dangerous,'' he says. ``The perfect
blend of fear and safety makes roller coasters especially
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're adrenaline junkies. Roller coasters, scary movies, even
real danger, give us a rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining that balance between scary and safe depends upon the
magic of physics _ the science of matter and energy and how they
interact.
</P>
<P>
   That science is at work with every lift and loop, every
camelback and corkscrew of the Scorcher. For each danger, there is
a safeguard. And for every safeguard, there seems to be an element
of risk.
</P>
<P>
   T h e i n c l i n e
</P>
<P>
   Like most roller coasters, the Scorcher relies on that first,
agonizing hill to propel the car through the rest of the ride. As
the car inches up the incline, it stores energy to use on the way
down. The scientific name for stored energy is ``potential
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaster car saves energy produced by the motor that pulls
the car to the top of the hill, says Jeff Templon, professor of
nuclear physics at the University of Georgia. That potential energy
will be used to power it through the rest of the ride.
</P>
<P>
   The first hill on a roller coaster has to be perfect. Too much
height and the coaster might descend too quickly and jump the track
when it turns. Too little height, and it won't pick up enough speed
to stay safely on the curves.
</P>
<P>
   T h e d r o p
</P>
<P>
   That built-up potential energy turns into kinetic energy as the
coaster zooms down the first 101-foot hill. Kinetic energy is the
energy of movement. A rubber band snapping back, a swing flying
through the air and a skier swishing down a mountain are all
examples of objects (and people) using kinetic energy.
</P>
<P>
   As each car descends, gravity hurls it down the coaster tracks.
</P>
<P>
   I n c l i n e d l o o p
</P>
<P>
   The roller coaster picks up enough speed from heading down the
first hill to push the car through the first loop. The kinetic
energy used coming down the hill is converted back to potential
energy as it climbs the first half of the loop, says Templon. When
it descends the other side of the loop, the stored energy converts
again to kinetic.
</P>
<P>
   As long as designers make sure the rest of a track is lower than
the first hill, the coaster will have enough energy to complete it,
Templon says.
</P>
<P>
   S p i r a l v e r t i c a l l o o p
</P>
<P>
   Even though George Lucas didn't invent centripetal force, you
may have heard of it. When you go upside down on a coaster, it
feels like there's a force pushing you into the seat, preventing
you from falling out. Actually, there's not an invisible force _
it's only your seat, or, on this ride, the floor, pushing against
you, Templon says.
</P>
<P>
   Your body wants to move in a straight line, but the coaster
track curves. The seats in the car follow the track and force your
body into following that track as well. If the seat was not there
pushing you around the loop, you would fall out.
</P>
<P>
   H i g h - s p e e d c a m e l b a c k
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to this two-humped bump, physics is required to
prevent physical injury. The makers of restraints _ the straps and
harnesses that hold bodies inside roller-coaster cars _ know their
products will work. The humps can be especially rough because the
shifts are so sudden. When the ride is heading up a hill, the seats
are pushing your body up just as centripetal force does. But when
the track drops suddenly, your body still may be moving up while
the seats and your restraints are headed down.
</P>
<P>
   C o r k s c r e w
</P>
<P>
   Even though gravity never changes, it sometimes feels stronger.
That feeling is measured in G-forces. When your body changes
direction at high speeds, it will feel like gravity is pulling
harder at you. Pilots feel G-forces when they flip or dive in their
jets, and so will you when a roller coaster heads through a
corkscrew loop. The Scorcher claims forces as high as four Gs (four
times the ordinary pull of gravity on the human body) as well as
zero Gs (that sense of floating or weightlessness).

 &HT;    NEWS FOR KIDS: Evidence of brutality
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peacekeepers in Kosovo believe that large numbers of Kosovar
Albanians were brutally treated by Serbs. Officials estimate that
at least 10,000 people were killed in Serb attacks on the province
in Yugoslavia during the last three months. Troops found torture
equipment and graves with many bodies buried together. They also
heard violent stories from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now the peacekeepers are afraid that the Kosovars will take
revenge by hurting Serb residents and Serb holy sites. The
peacekeepers will try to protect the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Kosovo, a part of Yugoslavia, are ethnically and
religiously different from the Serbs. The Kosovar Albanians want
their independence from the government of Yugoslavia, which is run
by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Koreas plan to meet
</P>
<P>
   Talks between rival countries North Korea and South Korea are
scheduled to begin today in Beijing, China. Wealthy South Korea has
promised 200,000 tons of fertilizer to poorer North Korea. In
exchange, North Korea must let families who were separated by war
nearly 50 years ago return to the South. Floods and drought have
devastated North Korea's farms since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the talks would actually happen. The two
countries fired on each other in the Yellow Sea last week over
fishing rights. Two North Korean warships were sunk.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean Peninsula was divided into Communist North Korea and
capitalist South Korea in 1945. Their border is the world's most
heavily armed, with nearly 2 million troops on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Respect your teacher
</P>
<P>
   If you live in Louisiana and your parents don't make you say
``yes, sir'' and ``yes, ma'am'' to adults, the state will. A bill
is about to be signed into law that will require public school
students to answer their teachers with those respectful phrases.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the ``sir'' and ``ma'am'' bill requires only elementary
school students to use the terms. Higher grades will be phased in
one year at a time.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier versions, the bill was even stricter. It would have
forced students to stand every time a principal entered the room,
and teachers would have addressed students as ``Mr.'' and ``Ms.''

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: As recent transplants to Texas, we have two questions. A
friend who lives in Colorado recently had a baby. Her husband is a
University of Texas graduate. Where can I go in Austin to buy
infant/toddler clothes with UT logos _ hats, T-shirts, sweatshirts,
jackets, etc.? What is the rhyme or reason (if any) to the numbers
and letters used on Texas license plates? _ D.R.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: License plate numbers are allocated to Texas counties in
blocks. There is no discernible pattern to the allocation, although
the Texas Department of Transportation keeps records of where the
plates are. The current system (as of fall 1998) is letter, number,
number, letter, letter, letter; the previous, letter, letter
letter, number, number, letter. No vowels are assigned on these
regular issue plates, so about 12 million combinations are
possible, says Texas DOT's Mike Viesca. These numbers should keep
Texans in license plates until 2004 or 2006. Another difference on
the new plates? The Texas flag is on the right, not the left of the
sequence. For your friend's little Longhorn, pick up all things UT
at Bevo's Bookstore in Dobie Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to find out how to purchase Thurber bricks. They
were used in a piece of the flooring at the new airport. My wife's
maiden name is Thurber and we visited Thurber earlier this year. We
would like to obtain a brick for each grandkid. _ J. Sturm
</P>
<P>
   A: Wish I could unearth one or more for you. These pavers were
taken up when Congress Avenue was refurbished years ago. At the
time the City sold some bricks ($5 a pop as I recall) and stored
others. None are for sale currently. The bricks are called Thurber
because they were manufactured in Thurber in the northwest corner
of Erath County (west of Fort Worth). Named for New Yorker H.K.
Thurber, it began as a company coal mining town. The brick plant
opened in 1897 and closed in 1930. An interesting Thurber-ism? It
was one of the first cities with electricity _ in 1895. The
remaining pavers will show up in various city projects like the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a little weather watch radio that picks up continuous
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather reports,
and we can get the same thing on cable TV with graphics. Why isn't
the same thing broadcast over one (or several) radio stations with
the same call letters all over the country? Driving through
Oklahoma years ago we were warned of an approaching tornado on our
weather radio. But car radios are more powerful, so using
conventional radio for continuous weather information seems to make
safety sense. _ John N.
</P>
<P>
   A: The National Weather Service has investigated using AM bands
as well as parts of FM bands for NOAA radio, but ``there is not
enough space on these bands to send all the information out
specific to each area and ensure none of the broadcasts interfered
with each other,'' says Larry Eblen, NWS warning and coordination
meteorologist. Now, when you pick up weather information on weather
radio, it is applicable to your area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend recently sent an article about the Joan of Arc TV
special with a note asking if I knew that Joan was really not from
``Arc.'' He said that in fact there is no ``Arc'' in France, and
that her name was actually Jeanne Darc, which in time became Jeanne
d'Arc and eventually Jeanne of Arc. _ John N.
</P>
<P>
   A: There is a town called Arc in France (just east of Dijon) so
the appellation may be based on the place, hometown to father
Jacques d'Arc. However, says Mary Lou Gibson, columnist for
``Catholic Spirit,'' names were also based on occupation. Jeanne's
father, a peasant farmer, could have been a good archer (arc means
bow in French). The saint is also known as ``la Pucelle,'' the
virgin or maid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My VCR malfunctioned and did not tape the final leg of the
Triple Crown. Is there any place to purchase a copy of the
television broadcast? Is there a viewer who has a copy I can copy?
Help! _ K. Gray
</P>
<P>
   A: A viewer may pop up, but if not, contact Belmont Park to
purchase a copy _ $25 per race for any at the 430-acre site. Lemon
Drop Kid pulled off an exciting victory. Owned and operated by the
New York Racing Commission, Belmont Park racetrack is the largest
in the country. The track is 1.5 miles long and the grandstand, at
1,266 feet, is longer than the Empire State building is tall. Races
are often held in front of capacity crowds (85,000 fans).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have cotton baby dresses (circa 1938) and woolen sweaters
ready for storage. Where can I find acid free tissue paper and
boxes? Also, is there something (not moth balls) that I can include
in the packaging that will help keep down the musty odor? _ J.
Harris
</P>
<P>
   A: Pick up acid-free boxes and paper at The Container Store.
Consider also purchasing zippered storage containers. Clean clothes
can be free of insect larvae if placed in strong sunlight for one
to two hours, spun in a dryer for approximately 45 minutes or
popped in the freezer for a few days . You be the judge of which is
correct for the item and the fabric. Place the clothes in the paper
and then the zippered storage bag to protect from moths and
silverfish. Keeping fresh air out is important. Many people find
the repellent cedar an acceptable odor. Oil of cedar is available
at many hardware stores. Other herbal treatments that do not
wrinkle noses? Lavender, rosemary or lemon grass.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Posting Ten Commandments is a cynical non-solution
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even God can be absent-minded. God forgot _ just flat forgot _
to clue Moses to the 11th Commandment: Thou shalt not bow down to
the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Because the deity was woolgathering way back then, the House of
Representatives could vote the other day to have public schools
post the Ten Commandments as a way to cool youth murder while
giving firearms a bye. And never mind that the one thing the eight
boy shooters had in common in the schoolhouse bloodbaths of the
last two years was that it was no trick for them to get guns.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the NRA has tutored us, guns don't cause massacres, boys
do.
</P>
<P>
   Surely only a cynic would suspect any relationship between the
vote and the fact that, as Public Campaign reports, the NRA spent
$15.5 million funding federal candidates, parties and politics
since 1991. Or that, as Common Cause points out, $8.4 million of
that went just to congressional candidates _ and 78 percent of that
to Republicans, who provided the bulk of the bipartisan votes to
substitute pseudo gun controls for the real ones the Senate had
adopted and then to scrap new controls altogether.
</P>
<P>
   It no doubt would be even more cynical to note that most members
who piously voted to install the Ten Commandments in public schools
know perfectly well the proposal violates church-state separation.
The Supreme Court has said so clearly.
</P>
<P>
   This is the old political trick of tossing a bone to a confused
public and then blaming an arrogant judiciary when judges, as they
will have no conscionable alternative to doing in this case, snatch
it away.
</P>
<P>
   The House neatly dodged the question of which Ten Commandments.
The versions held sacred by Jews, Catholics and most Protestants
have large areas of overlap but are subtly different in
particulars. Some of the differences have serious theological
implications that may strike the superficially religious as
unimportant but are precisely the specifics by which, cumulatively,
real faith is defined.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many religious Americans do not subscribe to the
Ten Commandments. The commandments' principles, for instance, are
imbedded in the Koran but are not separately listed as in Torah or
the Christian bibles. There are 8 million Muslim Americans, and
their numbers are growing rapidly. Posting any version of the Ten
Commandments in public schools would, at best, distance Muslim kids
from their Christian and Jewish classmates. It's just that sort of
sectarian pestering that the Constitution's First Amendment tells
us to forgo.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution's Second Amendment, however, does not tell us
we can buy any gun any time anyone wants to. It does not bar the
kind of good-sense measures President Clinton has pressed for. None
of those would confiscate a single firearm or forbid a single
lawful citizen from owning firearms.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder how many more school kids must be shot before
Congress wakes up and smells the gunpowder.

 &HT;    Storm chasers rely on speed, high-tech gear
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boiling black and gray clouds have a sinister spin as they
slide east, hanging low over the lonesome West Texas outback.
Surface winds from the south feed the storm, kicking up dust as
they rush to the dark belly of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   A khaki-colored column of dust rises toward the cloud, slowly at
first, then with a great rush as if being sucked up with a
celestial Shop-Vac.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' shouts an excited Matt Crowther. ``This is it. A
tornado is imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bits of the Permian Basin soar skyward for 20 seconds or so.
Then as suddenly as it formed, the column begins to fall apart. The
updraft dies without ever demonstrating the rotation Crowther
expected. This will not be a tornado after all. That chance lost,
Crowther and his partners jump into an idling Honda CRV and speed
southeast, blasting down empty roads to again get ahead of the
strengthening storm, to again get a chance to witness the birth of
a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Crowther and his wife, Betsy Abrams, are storm chasers, driving
hundreds of miles a day to get beneath storms that send most folks
to their basements. Each May, they take time off from their jobs as
meteorologists at the Marietta-based Weather Channel and drive west
to the Plains. For two or three weeks they zigzag across the
flatlands between the Ozarks and the Rockies, grabbing meals at
convenience stores in places like Elida, N.M., and Alva, Okla. Well
after dark, they stop at budget motels in Lubbock, Texas, or Dodge
City, Kan., where, more often than not, they will find the rigs of
fellow storm chasers Nick Nicholson of Lilburn and Mike Phelps of
Paulding County.
</P>
<P>
   They all endure days of seat-numbing driving and the
frustrations of the uncertain pursuit of moments when skill and
luck collide like two weather fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Moments like a June afternoon in northwestern Kansas, where
Phelps watches a tornado three-quarters of a mile wide tear up the
rolling ranchland for half an hour. Or the night Nicholson is
driving north of Alva and sees a tornado moving through the
darkness, illuminated by lightning flashes. Or historic May 3, when
Abrams and Crowther spot nine tornadoes near Oklahoma City during
the outbreak that killed more than 40 people in Oklahoma and
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Christmas morning,'' says Phelps, who has seen 103
twisters in a decade of storm chasing. ``The heart is pounding, the
adrenalin is rushing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a feeling of victory, Phelps says, knowing that your
work in the past 24 hours has put you in the right place and the
right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also fear, wonder, excitement,'' Phelps says.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia storm chasers are members of a growing fraternity.
Every spring, longtime chasers say, a few more people are running
the back roads, some chasing a lifelong dream, many others inspired
by the the 1996 movie ``Twister.'' It is a trend that concerns
Crowther and other longtime storm chasers. More people chasing the
same storms increases the risks of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 way to get killed storm chasing is in an auto
accident,'' says Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, chasers say, it is common to see scores of cars
chasing the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon,'' says Crowther, ``you'll have to take a number
to get on a storm.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no such troublesome crowds outside Portales, N.M., in
late May as hail rattles the vehicles making up a small caravan of
chasers. The line of vehicles includes the Honda hauling Abrams,
Crowther and friend Jim Williams; a battered 1986 Ford Taurus wagon
driven by Phelps; and Nicholson's 1992 Ford Explorer topped with
four antennas and an anemometer to measure wind speed.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson's red four-door is the most elaborately outfitted of
the bunch. A custom-crafted console contains a citizens band radio
used to talk with other chasers, a short-wave radio and a scanner
to pick up police and weather reports. Like all chasers, Nicholson
also has a cell phone. There is a monitor on the dash linked to
instruments on the roof that give the temperature, wind speed and
wind direction. There is a dash mount for a camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   A laptop computer on a special mount in the back seat is linked
to the global positioning satellite system, allowing navigator Rick
Davis of Dalton to track the vehicle's position on a series of
detailed computer maps. Davis can also use the computer's DVD drive
to watch movies, including ``Twister,'' while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   While not everyone uses them to watch movies, every chaser totes
a laptop computer. Storm chaser science is done online in motel
rooms. Every night after checking in and every morning before
checking out, Crowther spends hours online collecting weather data
and running through forecasting models. Many others are doing the
same. The switchboard of the Super 8 motel in Lubbock was jammed
one May morning because so many chasers were logged on.
</P>
<P>
   A good forecast is critical to defining the playing field, and
Crowther ``is one of the best forecasters out there,'' says
Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Storm chasers use the morning to figure out where
tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms are likely to pop up by
late afternoon, and the rest of the day driving to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Once a storm chaser arrives in the area determined by the
forecast, science takes a back seat to experience and instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of art to chasing as well as science,'' says
Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   While Crowther may use his cell phone to call buddies at the
Weather Channel for radar information, most decisions are based on
what he sees in the skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do the driving when we're in chase mode,'' Abrams says.
``There is a reason for that. Matt is looking up out the window
instead of looking at the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowther and other chasers are able to pick out all sorts of
details in clouds that may be 50 to 75 miles away. Where most folks
just see the big picture, they see the brush strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been chasing since 1990,'' Crowther says, ``and I've
only learned storm structure in the last three years. You just have
to see storm after storm after storm after storm after storm after
storm. And in all different situations.''
</P>
<P>
   But all situations depend on the formation of big thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to get a supercell every day,'' says Crowther.
``If you get a supercell every day, you're going to get your share
of tornadoes.''
</P>
<P>
   While Crowther likes to gather data until checkout time and
beyond, Phelps gets an earlier start driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to get to the target area early,'' says Phelps, who
is also a meteorologist at the Weather Channel. ``Then you have
time to get more data and move out if the target area changes. The
key is to be right there when the storms go up.''
</P>
<P>
   But staking out a supercell doesn't guarantee you'll see a
tornado. Only 10 percent to 20 percent of supercells produce a
tornado, Crowther says.
</P>
<P>
   When looking for thunderstorms, forecasters seek what is called
the triple point: the collision of warm moist air, cooler dry air
and a destabilizing low pressure system that mixes it all up.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe for tornadoes, however, requires additional
ingredients, and the most important is called wind shear.
</P>
<P>
   To get a storm turning, the winds need to be blowing in
different directions, and at progressively higher speeds, at
various levels of the atmosphere. Imagine a wind sock as the minute
hand on a clock. Ideally, the wind sock is on the four on the
surface, the eight at 10,000 feet and the 10 at 30,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Once a storm is rotating, it still needs another element to
spawn a twister: strong updrafts and downdrafts. And brisk surface
winds must be blowing into the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Many storms have all that, chasers say, but don't produce
tornadoes. The identification of the magic ingredient is the focus
of intense research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is one of those great puzzles of nature that will
never be solved,'' says Phelps. ``And, frankly, that would suit me
just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   If science develops pinpoint forecasts for tornadoes, Phelps
says, ``storm chasing wouldn't be fun anymore.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The injustice of selective enforcement
 &HT;    (For release June 6, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One of society's great problems is selective
enforcement. Rules that were meant for everyone often are applied
only to certain people.
</P>
<P>
   When first I saw in the crime report of my Sunday newspaper that
four people in a Miami district, within five hours of each other on
a Wednesday afternoon, had been arrested for drinking from cans of
beer in public, I chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   What made it amusing was that the brand of beer each was
drinking curiously was reported in the newspaper story: one with a
can of Mickey's malt liquor and three with cans of Old Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to that huge market share of Budweiser, I
asked myself in a jesting moment. Doesn't anyone get busted for
slurping a Bud in public?
</P>
<P>
   As the day went on, I kept coming back to that crime report. The
humor I first saw in it was waning. Some things about it were
beginning to bother me.
</P>
<P>
   The area of crime-weary Miami where all this took place is
Coconut Grove, a trendy section of the city that always has
positioned itself as being on a page different from the rest of the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Its central section is awash with watering holes, many of them
outdoors, or with outdoor patios. The streets of the central
section are lined with sidewalk cafes. Yuppie-types eat dinner in
these places, as well as down beer and wine at the least. It's sold
as a fun place to be, to party _ but apparently only in designated
areas and, perhaps, only with certain brands or, this is where I
worry, with certain people.
</P>
<P>
   No insult intended, but Old Milwaukee is not exactly a
premium-priced beer; folks who need to watch their pennies more
closely are most likely to be buying it rather than, say, Michelob
or Heineken.
</P>
<P>
   Coconut Grove's central section stirs at mid-morning and goes on
well into the night, in fact into the early morning _ loud, brash
and often drunk. So why were four people, all on the nearest
fringes of the party neighborhood, singled out for drinking beer in
public on a Wednesday afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to figure out. These were suspicious types,
eh? All were over 40. They likely were not dressed well; in fact,
their clothes probably were a bit grubby. And they were drinking
Old Milwaukee, not the premium stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for society, Miami newspapers some two decades ago
stopped indentifying most arrests by race so I have no idea of
whether the arrested were black or white, but I can guess. Or, if
they were white, they conceivably were drifter-types.
</P>
<P>
   A guy with a coat and tie sipping a Bud in a 7-Eleven parking
lot is less likely to get busted than a disheveled guy guzzling an
Old Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Selective enforcement has been a disease of police work
everywhere. I don't know how we're ever going to overcome it, but
it continues to be a huge irritant to resident minorities and
indigents, as well it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Until these four balmy beer busts came along, a most vivid
equivalent is a still-held belief that until recent decades, blacks
had to have a special identification to be on the streets of Miami
Beach after dusk, there being a law that said so.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it was a nasty example of selective enforcement.
Indeed, there was a law but it required all persons involved in any
tourism business (that includes cleaning slop out of hotel
kitchens) to have an official identification card with photo and
fingerprint.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the selective enforcement came in. While whites
rarely were stopped by police and asked to produce their ID, blacks
were _ so much so that it has been passed down to this very day as
a law written solely against blacks.
</P>
<P>
   There probably is a similar one in Miami about drinking in
public, but it obviously depends on what you're drinking and who
you are.

THAT-HNS  
 &HT;    SHE'S NOT BRIDGET 
</HEADLINE>
 FIELDING AUTHOR OF `BRIDGET JON-ES' INSISTS (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Author Helen Fielding hates having to keep answering the same
dumb question: Is she Bridget Jones, her most popular creation?
</P>
<P>
   It's just so obvious she's not _ though she is funny, sexy,
single, British and over 30 (well, 40).
</P>
<P>
   Fielding is on a tour promoting the paperback version of her
surprise bestseller, ``Bridget Jones's Diary'') with not a chink in
the ironic humor that protects her privacy (she's single, and
that's all she'll say about that). Oh, and she's sober, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget would surely have smears of her favorite Milk Tray
chocolates around her mouth, be smoking furiously, have a dreadful
hangover or be on the phone checking her messages for the 33rd time
in case the latest object of her obsessions had called. At the same
time, she'd be keeping track of herself in her diary, promising
daily to start that diet, cut down on the ``alcohol units'' or
develop ``inner poise'' _ tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   She's the sitcom-type, 30-something professional single woman _
singleton, in Fielding's coinage _ who's got grand ambitions, and
it's an open joke that she never lives up to them. She's the one
who says, ``I'm never going to sleep with him again,'' and then in
the next scene, is in bed with him.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she's spectacularly human _ and you can't help
liking her.
</P>
<P>
   Is she the real ``Bridget Jones''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what Bridget is _ it's the bit of you that's inside
and worried and unsure and confused. I think there's that bit in
most people. And the people that haven't got that bit _ I think I
don't like them very much,'' said Fielding, serious for a rare
second, explaining why Bridget's become such a phenom not only in
England but in the United States, Japan, Italy, France and most of
the rest of the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose what it's doing is taking that bit and exaggerating
and blowing it up and really having a good look at it and laughing
about it,'' said Fielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridget'' in hardback (Viking Penguin) spent most of last year
on the best-seller list. Now she's back in paper, just in time for
beach reading season.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding's also well along on a sequel, as yet untitled. This
time Bridget's in a relationship _ at the start anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we see what really happens when you go off into the sunset
with the guy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the movie, in development by the British
production company Working Title _ of ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding wrote two drafts of the screenplay, with help from
ex-beau and good friend Richard Curtis, who wrote ``Notting Hill''
from the office they share in that London neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Now the screenplay's being overhauled by Andrew Davis, who wrote
the BBC's ``Pride and Prejudice'' screenplay. Perfect, Fielding
says, since she stole Jane Austen's plot outright for ``Bridget.''
</P>
<P>
   Casting will start soon. Such names as Helena Bonham Carter,
Kate Winslet and Minnie Driver are floating around as possible
Bridgets. Fielding says she'd love to find someone new _ but in any
case, ``I think she shouldn't be too young or too thin.''
</P>
<P>
   If all this seems a little much for some single-girl comedy,
consider this: Fielding, single-handedly, has been credited with
launching a whole new genre of books (Melissa Bank's ``The Girls'
Guide to Hunting and Fishing,'' Kate Christensen's ``In the
Drink,'' Suzanne Finnamore's ``Otherwise Engaged,'' to name just a
few), TV shows (``Sex and the City,'' ``Ally McBeal'') _ a whole
new world of over-30 single women who live in the real world. No
longer tragic barren spinsters, they are sexy, out-there, always on
the trail of self-improvement and laughing at their foibles.
</P>
<P>
   Serious cultural critics have latched onto Bridget's
superficiality to wonder if she's another sign of feminism's
demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my favorite lines in the book is when Bridget goes,
`There is nothing so unattractive to a man than strident feminism.'
She's just so provocative,'' Fielding says. But she adds: ``Surely
we can laugh at ourselves, or we're not very equal. And why can't
we have female comic heroines? You know, nobody says that P.G.
Wodehouse's heroes are an insult to the state of manhood and going
to lead everyone astray.''
</P>
<P>
   For herself, Fielding will admit only to picking up on the
cultural zeitgeist and getting lucky.
</P>
<P>
   What became her bestseller started as a column in the London
Independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I thought the column would last just six weeks and
then I'd be sacked for being trivial _ and so did everyone else,''
Fielding contends. Instead, it snowballed, Fielding rewrote the
columns into the book and hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   She was especially surprised that American women _ and some of
the men who love them _ took to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in the U.K. thought it would work in America. There was
even an open letter in one of the papers saying, `Don't go there,
they don't understand self-deprecation and irony,''' Fielding
recalled, adding, ``That's so not true.''
</P>
<P>
   She never thought Bridget would conquer Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, even identifying with the dieting, when they're all so
thin and they just eat little bits of fish. That was a complete
surprise to me,'' Fielding said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy was a worry. I don't know what happened in the
translation, but the journalists there took it terribly seriously.
One asked me if it was a `transcendental study of existential
despair.' So of course I said yes. I was delighted. I've never been
taken so profoundly in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She thought Californians would be turned off by Bridget's
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, if you ask if you can smoke it's like, `Why
don't you urinate on our children?''' Fielding said. Wrong again.
The Bay Area has been one of Bridget's biggest fans, according to
Penguin.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget's popularity has meant nonstop travel for Fielding,
answering the same questions over and over, subjecting herself to
magazine photographers who keep trying to force her into skimpier
and sexier clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants her to be Bridget.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she counted calories in her diary when she was at Oxford
(carrot, 10, Milk Tray, 3,848).
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often, people expect me to be blind drunk and fall off
the chair giggling and then try to smoke and then try to snog them
and, you know, be constantly eating chocolate _ and there's
actually nothing could be further from the truth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Skillful as she is in using humor to deflect any personal
probing, it's hard to know what to make of that.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Bridget's fame, Fielding said, ``The good thing about
being a writer is that you're not really a celebrity. Nobody
recognizes you in the street. So you have the best of both
worlds.''

AUTHOR OF `BRIDGET JONES' INSISTS THAT SHE'S NOT BRIDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Author Helen Fielding hates having to keep answering the same
dumb question: Is she Bridget Jones, her most popular creation?
</P>
<P>
   It's just so obvious she's not _ though she is funny, sexy,
single, British and over 30 (well, 40).
</P>
<P>
   Fielding is on a tour promoting the paperback version of her
surprise bestseller, ``Bridget Jones's Diary'') with not a chink in
the ironic humor that protects her privacy (she's single, and
that's all she'll say about that). Oh, and she's sober, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget would surely have smears of her favorite Milk Tray
chocolates around her mouth, be smoking furiously, have a dreadful
hangover or be on the phone checking her messages for the 33rd time
in case the latest object of her obsessions had called. At the same
time, she'd be keeping track of herself in her diary, promising
daily to start that diet, cut down on the ``alcohol units'' or
develop ``inner poise'' _ tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   She's the sitcom-type, 30-something professional single woman _
singleton, in Fielding's coinage _ who's got grand ambitions, and
it's an open joke that she never lives up to them. She's the one
who says, ``I'm never going to sleep with him again,'' and then in
the next scene, is in bed with him.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she's spectacularly human _ and you can't help
liking her.
</P>
<P>
   Is she the real ``Bridget Jones''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what Bridget is _ it's the bit of you that's inside
and worried and unsure and confused. I think there's that bit in
most people. And the people that haven't got that bit _ I think I
don't like them very much,'' said Fielding, serious for a rare
second, explaining why Bridget's become such a phenom not only in
England but in the United States, Japan, Italy, France and most of
the rest of the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose what it's doing is taking that bit and exaggerating
and blowing it up and really having a good look at it and laughing
about it,'' said Fielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridget'' in hardback (Viking Penguin) spent most of last year
on the best-seller list. Now she's back in paper, just in time for
beach reading season.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding's also well along on a sequel, as yet untitled. This
time Bridget's in a relationship _ at the start anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we see what really happens when you go off into the sunset
with the guy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the movie, in development by the British
production company Working Title _ of ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding wrote two drafts of the screenplay, with help from
ex-beau and good friend Richard Curtis, who wrote ``Notting Hill''
from the office they share in that London neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Now the screenplay's being overhauled by Andrew Davis, who wrote
the BBC's ``Pride and Prejudice'' screenplay. Perfect, Fielding
says, since she stole Jane Austen's plot outright for ``Bridget.''
</P>
<P>
   Casting will start soon. Such names as Helena Bonham Carter,
Kate Winslet and Minnie Driver are floating around as possible
Bridgets. Fielding says she'd love to find someone new _ but in any
case, ``I think she shouldn't be too young or too thin.''
</P>
<P>
   If all this seems a little much for some single-girl comedy,
consider this: Fielding, single-handedly, has been credited with
launching a whole new genre of books (Melissa Bank's ``The Girls'
Guide to Hunting and Fishing,'' Kate Christensen's ``In the

SAN FRANCISCO'S KRON-TV IS UP FOR GRABS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What if one day you turned on your TV and went
to KRON Ch. 4, searching for the news of the day, and you got
stories about wacky strippers or fluffy lifestyle stories instead
of anchor Pete Wilson talking about Mayor Willie Brown?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a long shot, but it could happen. Tabloidization is
just one of many possible scenarios being spun since the owners of
KRON-TV and the San Francisco Chronicle last week authorized the
sale of ``all or some of'' Chronicle Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the underdogs panting to get a bite of KRON-TV is Barry
Diller's USA Networks. Diller owns a Miami station called,
appropriately, WAMI, and it delivers some of the weirdest
non-traditional news you're likely to see this side of KBWB Ch. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Could Diller and USA Networks (the most-watched cable channel,
by the way) make a play for KRON-TV and turn Gary Radnich into a
juggler rather than a sportscaster? Sure they could. But they
aren't likely to win the best-offer lottery that will land some
bidder a prime television station in the country's fifth-largest
media market.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner and likely buyer is NBC, not only because KRON
is an affiliate but because it simply can't afford to lose San
Francisco. It's not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC wants it real bad _ for obvious reasons,'' said Don
Fitzpatrick, a media analyst based in San Francisco. NBC would be
loath to switch dial positions and force Bay Area viewers to
rethink where they need to go to find ``Friends'' and other popular
fare.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Fitzpatrick said, both of NBC's stations in New York
and Los Angeles are also at the Channel 4 position and it's easier
to market.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into this fray utterly disinterested in how things fit
together so nicely is Rupert Murdoch, owner of News Corp., which
owns the Fox Network. Although KTVU Ch. 2 is a Fox affiliate,
showing ``The Simpsons'' and ``The X-Files'' and other hits, the
station is owned by Cox Broadcasting. That means Murdoch, an
acquirer of anything he pleases, doesn't have a TV station in San
Francisco to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   Consider him the wild card. A very wild card.
</P>
<P>
   And with sources close to the NBC-KRON affiliate agreement
saying NBC does not have the right of first refusal on a sale,
Murdoch may come into the market and at the very least jack the
price up and cause General Electric, owner of NBC, serious
financial pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not beyond that,'' Fitzpatrick said. ``He's a ruthless
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also some precedent to Murdoch having an interest in
KRON. About five years ago, Fitzpatrick said, the families that run
the Chronicle Publishing Co., which owns KRON, were dangling the TV
station for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murdoch was making more of a splash than NBC was,'' Fitzgerald
said, adding that this upset Cox and KTVU.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Australian media giant made a trip to San
Francisco and met with the families in charge of KRON's fate, but _
as usual at the time _ they were bickering and couldn't come up
with a deal.
</P>
<P>
   These days the families are ready to sell but O'Brien is playing
it calm, believing that Fox has no interest in switching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced it's NBC,'' he said. ``But either way, if it's
Fox, and I don't think it is, KTVU will be in fine shape.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Murdoch might not be willing to get involved
_ other than to raise the bidding price _ is that some in the TV
industry think KRON could go for as high as $900 million, and why
would Murdoch want to spend that much just to switch two dial
positions and have to make loyal Fox viewers get used to seeing
their shows where ``Frasier'' and ``ER'' once resided?
</P>
<P>
   Station swapping generally has caused a precipitous drop in
ratings for those involved, but Fitzpatrick believes that if
Murdoch really wants KRON, he's not going to care about the
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this boils down to ownership of stations. All they want
is more. They're not worried about dial positions. I'm sure if
(Murdoch) had his druthers, he'd rather buy KTVU, but I don't think
Cox is putting it up for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives at KRON were not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   This is all speculation, of course. Nobody knows what's going to
happen. And although there are many allegedly interested buyers,
smart money says NBC spends whatever is necessary not to lose its
San Francisco jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would change if that were the case, except a potential
switch in call letters. KNBC is already taken in Los Angeles and
KRON may be meaningless post-sale, but familiarity has merit and
perhaps NBC could just keep the same letters.
</P>
<P>
   If there is some surprise and Murdoch does buy KRON, there would
be a major shake-up of the on-air look. KRON likely would be molded
into a flashier, more modern operation and there certainly would be
more bells and whistles in its newscast (which would drive Wilson
and others serious about the news insane).
</P>
<P>
   KTVU _ which most likely would become the NBC affiliate by
default _ would have to restructure its news department, adding as
many as two early news broadcasts of its own, fit in ``NBC Nightly
News'' and then dismantle its powerhouse ``10 O'Clock News,'' which
no longer would be viable because of NBC's need for the 10 p.m.
hour for prime-time programming.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a fairly revolutionary idea and nearly unthinkable
because Cox, which owns KTVU, would be reluctant to change anything
at the station because it's a cash cow. Would that mean that NBC,
suddenly on the outs, would have to feverishly pursue a smaller
station up in the dial _ KBWB or KBHK _ all the while dealing from
a position of weakness?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. And such a dial position virtually would kill any chances
of NBC's prime-time lineup getting watched, which ought to answer
the original question of whether NBC will do anything to buy KRON.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, there will be all kinds of ludicrous
scenarios presented _ yes, even Diller turning KRON into a
cotton-candy news operation _ but they are all exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrous. NBC can't afford to not buy KRON.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will change. Pete Wilson and company can sleep easy.

ONE CADET'S LOSING BATTLE WITH MILITARY SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE JARBOE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nancy Ruth Mace recently became the first woman
to graduate from The Citadel, the military college in South
Carolina that prides itself on being where the tough-as-nails go to
get a little bit tougher.
</P>
<P>
   It took a real tussle several years ago for women to get into
The Citadel, and initially their presence on campus caused what a
country boy might call hell among the yearlings. The first one,
Shannon Faulkner, had a shelf life as a ``knob'' (a Citadel
freshman) of just a matter of days before she bowed out.
</P>
<P>
   I felt for Shannon when she decided she'd had enough. But I also
realized she'd exercised a lot more sense than I had. I actually
finished my first year of college as one of the worst specimens
ever to disgrace a corps of cadets.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons far too complicated to explain _ reasons that
included a war, financial aid, a war, heavy recruiting, a sweet
deal involving ``only'' six years of reserves duty, a war and a war
_ I began my post-high school academic career at Pennsylvania
Military College (PMC). People who know me have a hard time
believing this, but it's a fact.
</P>
<P>
   PMC was a dying school in the hard-knocks town of Chester, Pa.,
that prided itself on nearly 150 years of turning out young
warriors. Many of them had died on battlefields, from Gettysburg to
the Argonne to the Mekong Delta.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more were dying while I was there. We had muffled-drum
formations in the morning every time a grad lost his life in
Vietnam, and listened to stories from the professors and
upperclassmen who had known him.
</P>
<P>
   I can't speak for how things are in military colleges these
days. But I can safely assume that it's no picnic, just as it was
no picnic when I went to one.
</P>
<P>
   There was suffering aplenty at PMC, at least on my part.
Push-ups were the penalty for most transgressions against this odd
society. There was an entire book of ridiculous factoids about the
college to memorize, and there was the devil to pay if you drew a
blank when asked to recite any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the bells in Old Main dedicated to? Albie Filoreto
(whoever the heck he was).
</P>
<P>
   How's the cow? Sir, she walks, she talks, she's full of chalk,
sir; the lacteal fluid extracted from the female of the bovine
species is highly prolific to the Nth degree, sir.
</P>
<P>
   What's the unloaded weight of an M-14 rifle? Sir, 9.5 pounds,
sir.
</P>
<P>
   So my nights were spent filling my head with claptrap like that
while my books gathered dust, and I slept off all the push-ups
during my professors' lectures.
</P>
<P>
   There were punishments for every infraction imaginable; I was
issued demerits for having too many books on my shelves, and once
was forced to squat endlessly, holding a fire extinguisher in my
outstretched arms, for the crime of having cut across a corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally the punishment was the officially banned practice
of ``bracing,'' which basically involved pushing your shoulder
blades together, pulling your chin in as far as possible, and in
effect turning yourself into a twitching, sweating human ramrod.
Quite painful _ especially bad on a simmering day, standing in the
latrine, with hot water turned on in all the showers.
</P>
<P>
   The coup de grace to my sad-sack career came in June, when
during a particularly giddy moment (due to, no doubt, a few too
many push-ups) I dropped a water balloon on the head of a yahoo who
was serving on some sort of pointless guard detail. Push-ups were
not punishment enough in this case; I had to put on a nice, tight
West Point-type heavy wool jacket and slacks and march for hours
(15, over the course of several days) up and down a sidewalk in the
stifling, smelly Chester air carrying a rifle (M-14, unloaded, 9.5
pounds, sir).
</P>
<P>
   I emerged, somehow, from my freshman year strong as hell
(push-ups), tough as hell (push-ups), mad as hell (push-ups) and
with a grade point average that didn't even average out to 1 (more
push-ups). And colleges tend to frown on GPAs that begin with zero
before the decimal point. But I could put one heck of a shine on a
pair of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   So I left Pennsylvania Military College, complete with an
honorable discharge from the Army Reserve. And off I went on the
Grateful Dead tour for a few years, where it took me a lot fewer
push-ups to learn one heck of a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Hoo-ah.

   As for PMC, despite the jillion years of ``proud tradition,'' it
folded up like a waterlogged tent as soon as I fled the front gates
and was renamed Widener College (now Widener University). If in
some small part I was responsible for its demise, I have indeed
done a wee bit of good in this world.

you missed the Grateful Dead tours.

THE GHOST OF REPUBLICANS PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The bulk of political operatives and commentators
complained about George W. Bush's vagueness on national issues as
he opened his campaign for the Republican nomination for president
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was taken to task even though conventional
political wisdom prescribes that a front-running candidate keep
policy options open so as not to antagonize committed backers or
close the door to attracting other supporters. That's where Bush
finds himself as he scans the field of actual and potential
contenders for the nomination, who, apart from himself, are several
but unimpressive. His critics and observers think that Bush is
simply pushing the tactic too far for his own good.
</P>
<P>
   I disagree. For my part, the man who is the Republicans' great
hope for recapturing the White House has already said too much. And
it is scary.
</P>
<P>
   There was the New York Times report that Bush, in a campaign
swing through New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential
primary, made what every alert citizen should regard as a most
telling political commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Bush said that if elected,'' the Times wrote, ``his first
two priorities would be pushing through a tax cut and increasing
military spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Now some might wish to consider these priorities as no more than
conventional oratory intended to assure people that they could eat
their cake and have it. Another famous promise was to ``put a
chicken in every pot.'' It was made during the hard times of the
Great Depression in the '30s, when chickens were scarce, and so
were pots.
</P>
<P>
   Soberly assessed, raising defense spending while cutting taxes
is a prescription for national misfortune. If Bush meant what he
said, it would undo the unprecedented economic prosperity the
American people have the good luck to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   You only have to look back to the election in which Ronald
Reagan was campaigning for the same job. When he advanced that same
notion, his then primary opponent, George Herbert Walker Bush,
described it as ``voodoo economics.''
</P>
<P>
   George the Elder later abandoned that acute description in his
successful effort to become Reagan's running mate, going on to
serve as vice president for eight years, and president for four.
</P>
<P>
   George the Younger, however, should attend to what his father at
first said, rather than to what he later did on behalf of political
ambition. Those early words were entirely on the mark, as
subsequent facts and figures conclusively showed.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the madness of raising spending while reducing
revenue, the Reagan presidency's legacy was huge deficits in the
budget and trade, not to mention a weakened dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The chief economist for Merrill Lynch and Co., Donald
Straszheim, was prophetic in 1988 when he said the immediate impact
on the president who came after Reagan would be ``a one-term
presidency. ... On the budget, all the easy cuts have been made. On
the tax side, the public has had hammered home to them over the
last few years the message that tax rates always go down, they
never go up.''
</P>
<P>
   When, as Reagan's successor, George the Elder subsequently felt
compelled to contradict his pledge not to raise taxes (the famous
``read my lips'' statement) he, indeed, wound up serving only one
term.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the act that probably cost him his second term, also began
the process that enabled the nation from then on and through the
Clinton presidency, to go from enormous budget deficits to
surpluses. From that has flowed the present long-lived prosperity
that also has shaped the country's improved circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, it is highly cavalier for Bush W. Bush to even
trifle with the notion of reviving the Reagan policy, all in a bid
for votes. He should remember that Reagan managed in seven years to
almost triple the national debt that he inherited from the 39 chief
executives who had served before him. Now that was history-making.
</P>
<P>
   Another consequence of implementing two basically contradictory
policies was to turn the United States, which had been the world's
biggest creditor nation, into the biggest debtor.
</P>
<P>
   George the Younger needs to reflect on the ghosts of the
not-so-distant past. He is halfway right in his policy: Kosovo
revealed serious deficiencies in the U.S. defense capacities. Dicey
relations with Russia and China call for reassuring the country
that it remains an effective deterrent power.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history should have educated George W. Bush, as well as
the public, to recognize that platitudes about tax cuts, always
popular, are tempting but false illusions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush should do his candidacy a great favor by revisiting his
priorities, and explain to the people how these policies would work
today when they failed so miserably a decade ago.

A CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Peering at a photo of my father and me that was
taken last autumn, a good friend said, ``God, you look so much like
your dad, it's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   I knew what she meant. The resemblance isn't scary-frightening,
like ``Silence of the Lambs,'' it's scary-breathtaking, like the
first plunge in a roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   After all, boys are supposed to be a chip off the old male
block; girls are supposed to look like their moms. As Billy Bigelow
sang in ``Carousel,'' a daughter should be ``a kind of neat and
petite little tintype of her mother _ what a pair!''
</P>
<P>
   If my dad sang, it would be about how his daughter looks like
him in drag.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, I tend to forget the physical similarity because I
think and behave so much like my mom that it often feels as if she
is standing right behind me instead of in Indiana, 2,000 miles
away. Every cell and nerve ending in my body tells me I am her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   What, besides my face, tells me I am my father's daughter?
</P>
<P>
   Products of our Eisenhower-Kennedy times, Dad and I were never
free to be best pals. We didn't go fishing or shoot hoops or build
dog houses together because dads and daughters just didn't do
things like that back then.
</P>
<P>
   Gender roles were clearly delineated, especially in the cookie
cutter suburbs. There was little cross-pollination.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think about how lonely my dad had to be all those
years in a house of females (my mom, my sister and me). Although he
often joked about ``living in a nylon jungle,'' he never complained
or sulked or gave the slightest hint that _ once in awhile _ he
wished he'd had a son.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was a little easier for him because he never knew that
sort of fathers-playing-catch-with-sons companionship in his own
childhood. My Grandpa Salter went to work in the coal mines of
southern Indiana when he was 9 years old and pretty much stayed in
them until black lung disease killed him at 63.
</P>
<P>
   At least times changed enough for my dad to reap some benefit
from women's liberation. My sister's youngest daughter came along
after Title IX and the relaxation of gender lines. A photo of her,
at age 5, watching intently as my dad shows how to bait a fishhook,
never fails to bring tears to my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Dad and I ever came to pal-ing around was when I was
a senior at Purdue and his business had him on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Every few weeks he'd come up to West Lafayette and take me out
for dinner at a place called Sarge Biltz's. I'd order a Manhattan,
he'd get a beer and we'd both have filet mignon.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember a single conversation we shared during those
meals, but when I see us in my head, we're having a hell of a good
time.
</P>
<P>
   A man friend once hazarded an observation that he meant as a
compliment but wasn't sure I'd take as such: ``You give off a lot
of male energy.''
</P>
<P>
   I like to think that quality is the subtler companion to my face
_ evidence that I am my father's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Feminist though I've been since age 19, I have always felt at
ease in the company of men. I like drinking with them and trading
stories, laughing and making them laugh.
</P>
<P>
   More times than I can remember, I've looked up in the middle of
a delightful social occasion and realized I was the only woman at
the table. Partly this is because I spent about a decade covering
sports for a living. But I believe that it is also partly my dad's
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow _ maybe by modeling masculinity in such a healthy,
approachable way _ he imparted the joy of being ``one of the boys''
to me, his elder daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Dad also managed to pass along some of his ferocious work ethic
and his unflagging curiosity about the world and its current
events.
</P>
<P>
   From him I learned how to shine my shoes properly, wash a car
and whistle whole songs, not just a bar or two. Because he taught
me better, I never leave the garden hose pulled out and lying in
the yard, and I don't let the gas tank of my car get down to where
``it's running on fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   When I was little and my dad was young, I never doubted that he
loved me. But, times being what they were and he being a fairly
typical American male, he wasn't all that verbal about it.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, has changed with the years. Now when we talk, after
exchanging headlines and offering our solutions to international
and domestic crises, my dad always signs off the same way: ``I love
you.''
</P>
<P>
   I can see his face every time.

BLUE WILLOW WARE STEEPED IN TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Photo available on Wieck database; Web address is CQ.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Blue willow ware employs a chinoiserie design in
the decoration of ceramics, by transfer printing in a blue
underglaze. English potter Thomas Minton is the reputed inventor of
the blue and white willow porcelain dating to around 1780.
</P>
<P>
   It's believed to be the oldest blue and white pattern made, was
copied from early Chinese patterns, and is probably the most famous
blue and white pattern made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the blue denim of its day,'' said Shelia Chefetz, owner
of the Country Dining Room Antiques in Great Barrington, Mass. ``It
was heavily copied. Just about every factory in England made a
version of blue willow. One factory alone made more than 40
variations. In the 1930s and 1940s it was in almost every Chinese
restaurant around the world. You could even get willow-ware dishes
in soap boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon to mix and match pieces from different
factories. But the essential components are a stylized willow tree,
a Chinese temple, a bridge with three figures on it, a little
house, a boat, a distant island and two turtle doves.
</P>
<P>
   Several fanciful stories have been associated with the pattern
to explain its significance.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Antiquing for Dummies,'' by antiques specialists
and dealers Ron Zoglin and Deborah Shouse (IDG Books 1999), the
pattern is based on an ancient Chinese legend and there are some
200 variations.
</P>
<P>
   The most common is about a Mandarin's daughter who falls deeply
in love and runs away with her lover.
</P>
<P>
   In their escape, the couple runs across the bridge to hide in a
small house until they can escape by a small boat to a distant
island the next day.
</P>
<P>
   After several years the Mandarin finally catches up with the
couple, and just as they are about to be beaten to death, they turn
into a pair of turtle doves to live happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   During the Victorian era, you could also find willow ware in
black, yellow and green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willow ware is relatively well priced because so much of it
was made,'' Chefetz said. ``You can pick willow ware up at good
prices, getting you more value for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   A 16- to 18-inch willow-ware platter costs approximately $365 to
$395. As with any antique, the price depends on age, condition and
rarity.

DANCE LINEUP FEATURES A WORLD OF DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRESCA WEINSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BECKET, Mass. _ At the end of the millennium, Jacob's Pillow
director Ella Baff has programmed a season of dance that shows just
how small the world has become.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers from the United States, Cuba, Brazil, Peru, Tibet,
China, Russia, Angola, Puerto Rico and Bosnia-Herzegovina will be
converging on the Pillow's bucolic grounds in Becket, Mass., this
summer. As they share the diversity of their cultures and
traditions through performances, workshops, lectures and
demonstrations they will also be celebrating the universality of
the creative force.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention is to bring a very wide view of dance to the
public,'' said Baff, who replaced former director Sali Ann
Kriegsman in the spring of 1998. ``For the people who come here and
for the artists themselves, it creates an atmosphere of cultural
exchange that's very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pillow's 67th season opens at 8 p.m. Wednesday with the
Brazilian dance/theater troupe Grupo Corpo. The Doris Duke Studio
Theatre opens its season on July 1 with Pepatian, presenting a new
work, ``Pasaporte,'' set to live salsa music.
</P>
<P>
   This year's schedule also includes works by modern American
masters Paul Taylor, Mark Morris and David Parsons, as well as
appearances by new sensations like dancer, juggler and illusionist
Michael Moschen and Irish-American choreographer Sean Curran. This
season the Pillow also emphasizes dance for families and children.
</P>
<P>
   The Pillow will present a number of pieces that Baff specially
commissioned for the festival. ``It's very exciting and very
anxiety-producing to commission new works,'' she said. ``You don't
know exactly what's going to happen. Sometimes collaborations that
look like marriages made in heaven fall apart. That's the roller
coaster part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   World premieres of commissioned work include Trisha Brown's
first dance that's set to a jazz score by composer and trumpeter
Dave Douglas; Doug Varone's ``Democracy,'' which draws inspiration
from Bauhaus art; and Ronald K. Brown's ``Water,'' a series of
contemporary rituals created in collaboration with a poet and
visual artist.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest tickets of the season is an exclusive,
Pillow-produced performance by prima ballerina Nina Ananiashvili
and principal dancers of the Bolshoi Ballet. ``This will not happen
anyplace else in the world,'' Baff said.
</P>
<P>
   Three works on the schedule a new evening-length work by Martha
Clarke, a new dance/theater piece by 33 Fainting Spells, and Jane
Comfort and Company's Bessie Award-winning ``Underground River''
were begun during residencies at the Pillow. ``Many things we end
up presenting had their very conception here,'' Baff said. ``It's
satisfying to see things grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Child-friendly companies appearing this summer include Teatro
Hugo and Ines, combining mime, dance and puppetry, and the
Harlem-based children's troupe Batoto Yetu, which creates dances
based on traditional African movement, song, and folktales. To
encourage more families to attend performances, the Pillow now has
2 p.m. matinees on both Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also trying to present more live music with dance,''
Baff said. ``The experience of live music with dance is so much
richer, and there's so much more to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of the performances on the schedule will be
accompanied by live music _ including the Cuban troupe Los
Munequitos De Matanzas and Indonesian-influenced compositions for
Empty Tradition/City of Peonies, which is inspired by Chinese dance
and Tai Chi.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baff said 57,000 people visited Jacob's Pillow last season for
performances as well as free lectures, art and photography
exhibits, demonstrations, workshops, and Inside/Out performances on
the Pillow's outdoor stage. The Pillow's outreach also includes
year-round education programs at schools and a Web site,
www.jacobspillow.org, which will begin showing live dance clips
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite record-breaking ticket sales last year, the Pillow, like
most dance venues and dance companies, balances on a precarious
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Pillow is healthy _ we have no debt and a small cash
reserve _ we are in great need,'' Baff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching the dance world since the Ford Foundation
started supporting dance in the 1960s, and dance still struggles.
For some people, it's a completely alien form. The effort the
Pillow makes to be informative and to provide a knowledge base in a
welcoming environment helps encourage people to enter into the
world of dance and come back for more.''

DIVX FORMAT FALLS BY THE WAYSIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The death of DIVX last week wasn't a surprise,
even though the movie-rental disc format wasn't a bad idea at its
heart. So what happened? Did consumers make a mistake, a la
choosing VHS over the technologically superior Betamax video format
in the 1980s?
</P>
<P>
   In a word, no.
</P>
<P>
   DIVX, for those who missed it, was the controversial alternative
DVD format designed to make it easy to rent high-quality digital
movies. This week, its owners finished off what indifferent movie
studios and electronics retailers started, closing down the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   DIVX's creators had a clever enough concept: Plunk down $4.50
and you'd get a DIVX-encoded version of a DVD movie. Put the disc
in your specially outfitted DVD player and you'd have 48 hours to
watch the movie, as many times as you wanted in that period.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the two-day watching period ended, the DIVX
encryption software would lock up the disc until you called up and
bought another 48-hour viewing period (or bought the disc
outright).
</P>
<P>
   The concept _ developed by a Los Angeles entertainment law firm
that partnered with the Circuit City electronics chain to bankroll
the idea _ had one great quality: You could rent DVD movies and
never have to return the disc.
</P>
<P>
   That meant the discs could be sold in a wide array of new
venues, such as grocery stores and pharmacies, that otherwise don't
want the hassles of running a movie rental business.
</P>
<P>
   The discs themselves were far cheaper at $4.50 for an initial
rental than the cost of buying a full DVD, which usually costs
between $20 and $35.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the DIVX discs were stripped-down, pan-and-scan products,
with none of the cinephilic goodies piled onto normal DVDs. But
really, who needs to hear the director's commentary on
``Caddyshack''? Or watch it in widescreen?
</P>
<P>
   But what looks good in a vacuum looks less appealing wrapped in
the context of reality.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, DIVX-compatible DVD players cost an extra $50 to
$100 because of the extra circuitry and built-in modem needed for
the system. With DVD prices still a tad high for many consumers,
that front-end premium meant most chose cheaper regular players.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the cost difference between DIVX and DVD discs wasn't
that big, particularly when the extra hardware is considered.
</P>
<P>
   And the format wasn't around long enough for DIVX discs to be
available in grocery stores and the rest, so another possible
advantage of the format never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem, however, was that DIVX wasn't developed in a
vacuum. After almost 20 years, consumers are used to going to the
video store for a couple of movies. When the format changed, many
video retailers did, too, and customers just starting picking up a
couple of DVDs instead.
</P>
<P>
   And renting those regular DVDs meant they had access to all the
goodies on those discs, at a cheaper rental price and with a far
broader selection of titles. Given that, the minimal advantage DIVX
still had wasn't enough to change consumer habits.
</P>
<P>
   The good news out of all this: If you bought a DIVX machine
(despite what I recommended last winter), you still have a fine DVD
player that can run all the thousands of movies and other
interesting digital odds and ends that are coming out now.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll be able to get a $100 rebate from Digital Video
Express, the venture that ran DIVX. That's just about enough to buy
four DVDs or rent about 30 of them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Phantoms in the Machine
</P>
<P>
   The digital screenings of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace'' _ going on for the next month at specially outfitted
theaters in Chatsworth and Burbank and two theaters in New Jersey _
look great.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Star Wars'' wizards are already at work on the next
one, said Rick McCallum, who produced ``Episode I'' and will have
the same job with ``Episode II.'' In town on Thursday to tout the
digital screenings, McCallum said he was leaving the presentation
in Burbank to come to Panavision's Woodland Hills operation, where
the camera company is creating the special lenses that will go on
Sony-built high-definition digital video cameras that will be used
in ``Episode II.''
</P>
<P>
   Those digital cameras should arrive at Skywalker Ranch by late
September or early October, when the Lucasfilm people expect to
begin test shooting, McCallum said.
</P>
<P>
   While it's too soon to know exactly what to expect from the
cameras, McCallum said the film's production team hopes to
dramatically increase the number of scenes it can shoot in a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the same shooting schedule as `Episode I,' but
we're going to go from 32 setups a day to 40 or 45. That's unheard
of,'' McCallum said.
</P>
<P>
   The much faster set-up time is attributable to the much smaller
and easier-to-handle digital cameras.

   ``They only weigh 21 pounds,'' McCallum said. ``It's a
camcorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, a really, really expensive and high-resolution camcorder,
but you get the idea. And the digital revolution rolls on. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Full effect
</P>
<P>
   If you somehow didn't get enough in the way of special effects
during the recent Festival of Visual Effects, the upcoming ShowBiz
Expo should slake any leftover thirst for the whiz-bang.
</P>
<P>
   The folks who sponsored the festival, the Visual Effects
Society, are joining with expo sponsor Variety to create an
80-person theater in the center of the show floor, where attendees
can get themselves digitally inserted into a scene from films such
as ``Godzilla'' and ``The Fifth Element'' (you, too, can be blue
and have a six-octave singing range).
</P>
<P>
   The fine folks from Jim Henson's Creature Shop will give a
presentation on its amazing animatronic animals and puppets; so,
too, will Mannex, which did the ground-breaking effects in ``The
Matrix.'' Other seminars and demo areas will show such effects
tricks as matte painting, as well as preview several upcoming
effects-heavy films and television shows.
</P>
<P>
   One highlight, however, will come on Friday afternoon, with a
panel discussion on what technology changes will do to efforts to
keep entertainment jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Panel speakers include such luminaries as former Screen Actors
Guild president Barry Gordon; U.S. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Panorama
City; state Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale; and Cody Cluff,
president of the Los Angeles County Entertainment Industry
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 exhibitors will show off virtually every gizmo you can
imagine that's used in the making of movies. The show will run from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
on Sunday, at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Tickets for the
exhibition hall are $35; conference sessions are another $45. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Only Connect &UR; ! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A little program I liked recently is OneStep Connect from
OneStep LLC (at www.onestep.com). It's a personal organizer program
that also links up nicely with your Palm Pilot (no support yet for
Windows CE handhelds, though).
</P>
<P>
   The $49 program has a clean, effective interface; works well
with everyone else's e-mail and browser programs; does a great job
producing a wide variety of electronic and print documents; and
nicely handles the organizational basics such as contacts, to-do
lists and the like. Well done, especially for a startup putting out
version 1.0. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Having a ball
</P>
<P>
   These may not count as technology, but I like 'em anyway. Patch
Products, a Wisconsin company that also makes several computer
games and other kinds of toys, has embedded flashing lights and
sensors in a variety of foam balls and flying discs.
</P>
<P>
   The series of toys go by the name Zoam Light Tracker balls, and
they have footballs (some with the little fins on one end that make
perfect spirals easy to throw), basketballs, soccer balls, super
bouncy balls and a flying disc.
</P>
<P>
   On a summer evening, they're pretty cool to play catch with. And
thus does technology march ever onward. For more information, go to
Patch's Web site at www.patchproducts.com.

CRANK IT UP: A RADIO FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   No battery, no electricity? No problem, at least not if you've
got the Freeplay radio. The device, seemingly designed to appeal to
Y2K phobics and boaters, operates without the need for external AC
power or a disposable battery.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it runs on solar energy or via wind-up power. Turn the
crank on the back for 45 seconds and the AM/FM radio will run for
up to an hour; exposure to sunlight automatically switches the
power source from crank to solar. Equipped with jacks for an AC
adapter and headphone, the Freeplay comes in an impact-resistant
and splash-proof plastic case, in colors including black,
translucent blue and clear. It costs $100.
</P>
<P>
   MANAGING: Our favorite recent book, the one we keep on our desk
and on the back of the toilet for snippet reading, is ``What's In
an Age? Who Did What When, From Age 1 to 100,'' written by Andrew
Postman and illustrated by Nick Galifianakis.
</P>
<P>
   The author says not to use the book to bum yourself out by
comparing others' accomplishments with yours at particular ages.
Don't fret, for example, that the Steves (Jobs and Wozniak) were 21
when they introduced their first Apple computer or, as bitter
humorist Tom Lehrer noted, at age 37, ``When Mozart was my age, he
had been dead for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, simply read for fascination. Alfred Hitchcock was 60
when he made ``Psycho.'' Lee Harvey Oswald 24 when he assassinated
JFK. Leopold Stokowski signed a six-year conducting contract at age
94. And so on. Find the volume, for $10, in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   CANDELABRA-CADABRA: A trio of wacky guys in Los Angeles (Matt
Mogol and the brothers Duffy and Seamus Culligan) have created
Aromapharmacy, or candles with names like popular drugs that are
packaged in amber glass jars resembling prescription-pill
containers.
</P>
<P>
   While there's no scientific evidence for the claims of magical
results, the makers say their candles will ``help remedy specific
conditions or set a desired mood.'' The four flavors are: Niagara,
``sexually charged (with) ylang-ylang and patchouli (and) ... an
aphrodisiac''; Valiumello, to ``soothe and relax ... using vanilla
and sandalwood''; Lozac, an ``antidepressant (with) sage and
geranium''; and Ritalert, alleged to ``help the mind stay alert and
focused'' with grapefruit and cinnamon.
</P>
<P>
   The candles, which cost $15 each, can be ordered by visiting
http://www.aromapharmacy.com.

COMPUTER-GENERATED CHARACTERS MOVING TO FOREFRONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Note use of italics in grafs 2 and 3) 
 
 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; A lithe young Jack Nicholson cartwheels across
the screen, tucks into a somersault then explodes into an
eye-popping kung fu kick that catches a muscled-up Humphrey Bogart
across the chin, sending him sprawling over a table where three
gungans chat about the next ``Star Wars'' episode with a geriatric
Helen Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL START)This(ITAL END) is as good as it gets?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. But it (ITAL START)is(ITAL END) where movies
are heading in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Special-effects wizards have been using computers for some years
to create increasingly realistic images of creatures, places and
events that never existed in real life.
</P>
<P>
   But they really haven't had the digital tools that would allow
them to create compellingly lifelike, computer-generated characters
that are central to a film and can interact convincingly with live
actors and their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change _ and with it, the very fabric of acting
and movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is doing here is hinting at the immediacy of it and
the creativity of it,'' said Andre Bustanoby, visual effects
supervisor for Digital Domain, at a recent seminar on
motion-capture and related techniques at the American Film
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, a series of companies were showing off the powerful,
increasingly inexpensive tools they've created to capture human
motions and map them flawlessly to a computer-generated creature on
a screen and from there to a film.
</P>
<P>
   And they're far from the only ones out there trying to create
the new tools.
</P>
<P>
   Special effects pioneer Douglas Trumbull of ``2001: A Space
Odyssey'' fame has been tinkering in his home studio in
Massachusetts' Berkshire Mountains with systems that will allow him
to plunk a live actor into a computer-generated set and costumes in
real time. Instead of ``blue-screening,'' where actors emote in
front of a blue or green background that is later replaced in
costly post-production, it all will be tied together at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtual set technology, to allow you to insert live
actors in real time,'' Trumbull said in a recent Los Angeles
appearance. ``It's not like laborious blue screening. All you need
to do is edit (the tape you generate).''
</P>
<P>
   What counts as a digital special effect and what is real already
are impossible to differentiate in many films, such as ``The Truman
Show,'' which was part of the annual Academy Awards nominations
``bake-off'' contest between special effects movies, said Tom
Atkin, executive director of the Visual Effects Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't even tell where the effects left off, they were
so seamless in that movie,'' Atkin said. ``And there will be more
and more work where, especially if it's not a science-fiction film,
you're not going to be able to tell. You'll see more and more
movies where you're not going to be able to spot huge effects work,
unless it's because of the plot.''
</P>
<P>
   In both ``The Mummy'' and ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' digital characters were strongly integrated in the films,
impossible to differentiate from live actors, and to some extent
judged just as harshly for their acting as were the humans.
</P>
<P>
   And soon enough, the powerful new tools being created by
Trumbull, companies at the AFI seminar and others will be available
to low-budget enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with other cheap digital technology and the
distribution power of the Internet, those newcomers will be able to
create and show a wide variety of new works, said Bustanoby, who
has worked on films such as ``Titanic'' and ``The Fifth Element.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's stuff on these desktops that a couple of years ago
cost 10 to 20 times as much,'' said Bustanoby. ``A lot more people
at home are going to be taking this technology and kicking (the
results) out on the Internet, where you've got a worldwide
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   And decreasing equipment costs, coupled with increasingly
powerful hardware and software, mean that digital special-effects
work is creeping into all kinds of areas where it previously hadn't
been because of cost, time and other considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two areas where I think there's great potential are the games
business and the Internet,'' said Atkin. ``I think over time, some
of our folks will get involved in the games business and see how we
can take our technology to those platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The gaming business is exploding, with sales this year expected
to rival those of the movie business's domestic box office.
</P>
<P>
   And the machines that run the latest and greatest games, from
high-end PCs and Power Macs to next-generation gaming consoles from
Sega, Sony and Nintendo expected to hit U.S. stores in the next 18
months, are providing the kind of processing power that can rival a
DVD player's crisp and gorgeous graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Between the massive market and the amazing machines, game
developers are increasingly mixing digital creations and effects
together to liven up their interactive offerings.
</P>
<P>
   And you can expect to see more eye candy of all sorts on the
Internet, particularly as broadband technologies such as cable
modems and DSL give Joe and Jane Sixpack high-speed digital
connections that will support video quality close to that of
television.
</P>
<P>
   Combine those kinds of media with increasingly powerful computer
systems and software, creative writers, animators and directors and
new kinds of performers, and here's the kinds of fascinating new
cinematic techniques and experiences you can expect:
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL MAKEUP. Computers are being used to transform the way
performers look, making them appear older or younger or putting
them through digital transformations (such as turning into a
werewolf or alien) that otherwise might require excruciating hours
in the makeup chair each morning.
</P>
<P>
   With such digital techniques, it's pretty easy to make Helen
Hunt go from spritely to unsightly. And if the face of Jack has
gone slack, a digital tuck can have him looking better than any
Brazilian or Brentwood scalpel slinger could ever manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to create hyper-realistic kinds of characters,
digital actresses with close-ups where you can't tell it's
digital,'' said Mark Sager, vice president of research and
development at Pacific Title/Mirage, an effects house in Venice.
</P>
<P>
   His company had originally created technology designed to help
doctors in virtual surgery, Sager said. But the technology's
ability to virtually age or revivify someone on screen soon found
other applications in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sager said, about 80 percent of the people who watch scenes
generated by their software can't tell if the performer is digital.
In the future, the digital character will be indistinguishable from
a real person on screen.
</P>
<P>
   SUPER STUNTS, EVEN FOR OLD GUYS. Jackie Chan's mid-40s martial
arts pyrotechnics aside, most aging action stars will appreciate
the assist they'll soon routinely get in performing eye-popping
stunts, even if they're past their physical _ but not box-office _
prime. Think ``The Matrix'' on, believe it or not, steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a good actor, a good performance, you can leverage
that,'' said Bustanoby. ``Say someone is not as physical as they
were in their 20s _ they can still do stunts. At that point, the
palette is so much wider. I have new stories I want to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL CHARACTERS. ``The Phantom Menace'' and ``The Mummy'' are
two films that prominently feature a new kind of performer, the
digital actor.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, a human actor provided a living armature upon
which computer gurus constructed the digital character. Other new
technologies don't even require someone on screen, instead using an
off-screen performer's body movements to animate a digital
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like real camera-based media, but all the cameras are
virtual,'' said Dave Blackburn, president of Virtual Ventures, a
Manhattan Beach company that provides packages of computer hardware
and software to studios wanting to create those digital performers.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, an actor with 10 sensors attached to his main joints
makes various movements that are exactly mimicked by an animated
cactus in a pot on a nearby computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get it in real time and on the fly,'' Blackburn said.
``You can see if you get it the way you wanted it, and if you do it
wrong, it's easy to do it over.''
</P>
<P>
   The motion-capture computer systems he sells cost around $85,000
these days, a 10th or 20th of what they used to cost, and now it
comes with the software to do what was just being demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there's a first blossoming of this kind of software,''
which will make it much easier for more companies to use the
technology, Blackburn said. In the past, they had to write their
own programs, a laborious process with no guarantee of success.
</P>
<P>
   The new power of these tools also means that digital performers
will increasingly have central roles in film, as opposed to the
peripheral roles of the digi-dinos in ``Jurassic Park'' or the
doomed crowds of ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Phantom Menace,'' for instance, director George Lucas has
created a computer-generated character named Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar
may have annoyed the heck out of many critics and adult fans, but
the key is that people accept the digital construct as just another
performer, a peer of sorts with Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``The Mummy,'' the mummy is completely digital for big
chunks of the film, said Seth Rosenthal, who worked on ``Phantom
Menace'' and ``The Mummy'' as a motion-capture supervisor for
Industrial Light &AMP; Magic, the George Lucas-owned special-effects
house in San Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   Though both digital characters have limitations _ requiring in
the mummy's case some real-world workarounds _ that won't be the
case soon, Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short to medium term _ some people would debatably say
now _ it will be possible to make believable characters on film,''
Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   BRINGING BACK THE DEAD. At the Virtual Humans III conference
held last summer in Universal City, participants showed off digital
Dietrichs and W.C. Fieldses.
</P>
<P>
   Just as with the AFI demos, the Fields impersonator is strapped
to special sensors connected with a computer. As the impersonator
talks and moves, the sensors key actions by the digital Fields'
representation in real time, allowing the character to answer
questions and react to an audience.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the start, some say, as they excitedly talk
about a future where the computer skins they've created are
inhabited more fully by a virtual personality distilled from a
performer's movements, actions, beliefs and words into an
artificial intelligence that guides the on-screen performance.
Think Max Headroom for the formerly living.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's hard is characters that autonomously generate
performances,'' said Rosenthal. ``A lot of the hype is pushing the
notion that we're going to have these characters and they'll just
act.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't count on AI actors happening soon, or even more
problematically, having them work well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a much harder problem and, to my mind, a much less
interesting problem,'' Rosenthal said. ``There's something about
performance that you just can't expect. You're going to have to
bring (Dietrich) back in a way that surprises you. Otherwise, it's
not going to work. Does (the digital performer) ever really
surprise you with its performances?''
</P>
<P>
   Some actors have expressed fears that virtual performers will
supplant them, with notables such as Screen Actors Guild president
Richard Masur declaring that it can never happen. Something gets
lost in translation, notably the serendipity that can enliven a
living person's performances.
</P>
<P>
   But enthusiasts for the new world say that, if anything, the
digital possibilities of the future will create new opportunities
and possibilities, extending what actors can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we're not replacing anything,'' said Paul Charette, a
vice president of research and development at Pacific Title/Mirage.
``We're opening up a lot of possibilities. We're giving the
animator more tools.''
</P>
<P>
   And it will change the very definition of what an actor is _ and
who gets paid for what, as the talents of computer animators,
puppeteers and actors are merged in ways never before possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, who authors that digital performance?''
Bustanoby asked.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the actor whose face is digitally scanned and pasted onto
the on-screen body, the performer whose body is used for real-time
motion capture, or the animator who merges it all together and
makes it work in a film?
</P>
<P>
   Charette's company's new digital-character software has been in
testing with producers of several upcoming movies, including a
remake of ``The Incredible Mr. Limpet,'' starring Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actors we talk with about this technology, it doesn't
leave anyone indifferent,'' Charette said. ``Some people think it
will cost them work. Big-name actors see it as a way to extend
their careers. Jim Carrey's reaction was, `You mean, I can just
stay home and you guys can do all the work for me?' '' &QL;

SMALL VINEYARD EMPHASIZES QUALITY OVER QUANTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Brounstein built Standard Drug Distributors from
scratch. He founded the Los Angeles-based pharmaceutical company in
1951 by borrowing $300, taking a used car and hitting the road.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a decade he had a $1 million business with
a warehouse and 15 employees. What he didn't have was peace of
mind, or a labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   Brounstein would find both in a small corner of California's
wilderness, at the northern end of Napa Valley near Calistoga. In
1966, at age 46, he bought an 80-acre mountain plot and mostly by
himself cleared 20 acres of hillside in order to pursue his dream
with a passion _ to create a vineyard of superior quality.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades and three years later, Brounstein is the proud
owner of one of the most highly regarded wineries in the world,
Diamond Creek.
</P>
<P>
   His is a riches-to-rags-to-riches story that Brounstein, a
balding, white-haired man whose wry humor is affected not at all by
a dozen years of Parkinson's disease, shared recently in Manhattan
at an invitation-only wine tasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost money with the winery for the first 15 years,'' he
recalled. ``It's called negative cash-flow, and that doesn't sound
as bad as losing money, so I called it that.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't drop out of the business world without knowing a
little bit about what he was getting into. While he ran the
successful pharmaceutical company, Brounstein took night classes at
the University of California at Los Angeles. He studied French, and
then took a course in wine tasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the course, when I'd learned about Lafite and
Latour and other tremendous French wines, I said to my instructor,
`Gee, I'd like to have my own vineyard. Just raise grapes and pay
the taxes. Have a nice, quiet, easy life.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Don't do it. You'll never make any money.' For a
long time I thought I probably should have listened to him, because
it took us quite a few years to make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't heard of Diamond Creek, don't worry: You're not
alone. Although the winery has received rave reviews in the Wine
Spectator and other publications, it is hardly high-profile. It's
open to visitors only four days a year, by invitation from the
winery's mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Creek produces such a tiny amount (3,000 cases a year,
compared with the 160,000 cases so-called small wineries turn out)
that it is indeed rare to spot one of Diamond Creek's four Cabernet
Sauvignon labels in a store.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the wine is sold directly to individuals who are avid
collectors of Diamond Creek, to appointed distributors, and to
restaurants. And all of the recipients are folks with deep pockets,
because these intense, purpley cabernets retail for between $100
and $300 per bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Brounstein's cabernet-sauvignon-only winery _ which
at age 79 he continues to supervise, with six employees doing the
farm work and four in the office doing book work _ is the grapes.
</P>
<P>
   He told the 200 or so at the wine-tasting in New York about how
he was able to circumvent U.S. Customs by smuggling in first-growth
cuttings from a prestigious vineyard in the Bordeaux region of
France, a winery whose identity he has vowed to keep secret. It was
1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised that I would never reveal who I got the cuttings
from,'' he said. ``Then everybody and his brother would be out
asking for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brounstein flew the cuttings into Tijuana, Mexico, and from
there picked them up personally in his own private plane. His
girlfriend at the time accompanied him during the illegal pickup.
She was thrilled by the risk Brounstein was taking, bringing in a
product the U.S. Department of Agriculture would consider
contraband.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought it was so much fun that we should try it again,
this time with marijuana,'' Brounstein recalled. ``That was when
she stopped being my girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   He was at that time a widower. He later remarried, and his wife,
Adele (her friends know her as ``Boots''), helps him run Diamond
Creek. He also employs a wine maker, Phil Steinschriber, a
California native who was working for a winery in the Golan Heights
in Israel when he met Brounstein, who was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The original French budwood was taken to nurseries, where for
two years it flourished and developed a sound root system before
being transplanted to Diamond Creek. It took another four years to
raise the vines to a respectable level where the grapes produced a
salable wine. The first 15 cases, from 1971, were used to top off
the 1972 wines, the first vintage Brounstein would put on the
market. It didn't become available until 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasizes quality, not quantity. He thins his crop at least
one more time every season than most other growers, he said,
ensuring that the grapes that remain will get as ripe as they
possibly can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel if we make a real quality product people will be
willing to pay for it,'' he explained. ``They don't get this kind
of wine from every Tom, Dick and Harry. Most wineries have their
interest in other varieties besides the one that interests us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Creek does grow a small amount of both merlot and
Cabernet Franc, which are blended in, in small portions, during the
production of the winery's Cabernet Sauvignons. A typical Diamond
Creek wine contains 88 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 8 percent merlot
and 4 percent Cabernet Franc.

<P>
   Brounstein uses a trusted panel of tasters during the
preparation of Volcanic Hill, Red Rock Terrace, Gravelly Meadow,
and Lake, the four distinct soil types his grapes grow on at
Diamond Creek and the names of the four Cabernets he produces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in on all of the tastings,'' he insisted. ``We have
capable people, but I still overrule them. If I feel it's a great
wine or not a great wine, I'll make the call.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to argue with Brounstein's palate. During an
international competition in France two years ago, only four U.S.
wineries, including Diamond Creek, were invited to participate
among the 100 most prestigious wines of the world. Diamond Creek
received seventh place, the best among U.S. wines. (Top prize went
to La Romanee-Conti.) Not surprisingly, Brounstein has fielded
numerous offers to sell his winery. He has resisted with a
determination that does not bode well for the big guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10 years ago, I had a guy phone me up from Mitsubishi
who said he was willing to pay $20 million for a prestigious
winery, and I said, `What would I do with the money that would give
me more pleasure than I'm getting now?' I told him to call me back
in 300 years' time. I might be interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kendall-Jackson tried to buy us, my wife, Boots, said,
`Call us in 100 years' time.' But then, she's more generous than I
am.''

FORENSIC SCIENTISTS FACE MAJOR TEST IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Forensic science has always had a ghoulish
glamour, epitomized by the television programs ``Quincy'' and
``Picket Fences,'' as well as Thomas Noguchi, the Los Angeles
coroner who performed autopsies on Marilyn Monroe, Janis Joplin and
Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Now the world's forensic scientists are uniting to investigate
the grizzly crime scene in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   These scientists are accustomed to the human wreckage of urban
crime. But the war-torn province of Yugoslavia will present a vast
tableau on which to deploy their forensic skills and tools.
</P>
<P>
   They will use satellites that spot mass graves and gadgets that
sniff for buried bodies in an attempt to unearth hundreds of
corpses, and then identify them. And, with luck, to find the
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Reid, a spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington,
said the mission of the more than 300 forensic scientists expected
to go to Kosovo is bring to justice ``these vile guys'' who
slaughtered ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The team members will come
from some of the most prestigious law enforcement agencies,
including the FBI, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Scotland
Yard in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Using science to capture killers in politically troubled
countries around the world has been a chief goal of Physicians for
Human Rights, a Boston-based group that helped pioneer forensic
human rights in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us are a little idealistic and hope that this will say
to the people who perpetrate these kinds of things: `You can't get
away with this _ so don't do it again,''' said one researcher long
associated with the group, archaeologist Douglas Scott of the
Midwest Archaeological Center at the National Park Service in
Lincoln, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo marks the first time such a large-scale forensic
investigation has been ordered by several governments acting on
behalf of a global authority, the international war crimes tribunal
at The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports indicate that Serbians, who were the brunt of
the police and military in Yugoslavia, frantically tried to destroy
evidence of the killings before fleeing as NATO troops rolled into
occupy Kosovo. But evidence tampering is tougher now with the
advanced skills of forensic scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to get rid of a body. Bones and teeth and hair
_ they last almost forever,'' said Clea Koff, a Stanford
University-educated anthropologist who has participated in numerous
forensic investigations of human rights crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the killers toss a body onto a funeral pyre and soak it
with lighter fluid, she said, often some tooth will still survive,
and the characteristic grooves or fillings of the tooth might
reveal the person's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists investigate mass graves in the same way
archaeologists unearth ruins: very slowly and carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Artifacts ranging from bullets to buttons, and their precise
position when unearthed, can prove crucial in uncovering evidence.
Besides being a painstaking process, it can be trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dead bodies don't affect me. Mass graves don't affect
me,'' said University of Chicago pathologist Robert Kirschner, a
veteran investigator of human rights crimes. ``What is disturbing
to me is talking to survivors _ listening to survivors' and
witness' stories. I don't think anybody can be unmoved by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirschner, the former deputy chief medical examiner for Cook
County, Ill., warned Kosovo-bound forensic investigators to
remember that ``the scale of this thing is so enormous that it's
just going take many more people, and much more time, than you
think. ... You need to use people who have a lot of street
experience dealing with homicides and crime investigations.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I don't think people are that interested in models
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So proclaimed Calvin Klein _ the man who virtually invented the
supermodel.
</P>
<P>
   Klein unveiled his fall CK Jeans and CK Calvin Klein ad
campaigns, and sure enough, there's not a Christy or Kate in sight.
Instead, the new ads feature individual portraits of musicians and
young actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, if I had a feeling about a particular model, I
showed them to Kelly (Klein), Marcy (his daughter) and Fran
(Leibowitz). Now, when I touch base with my daughter, just a pretty
face isn't enough. It's an indication of how lots of people are
thinking,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great moment for the modeling industry,'' the
designer continued, although he noted that agencies are now
representing all kinds of celebrities. ``It says a lot about our
society, and I think it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's no secret that famous celebrities have usurped models
as cover girls on many fashion magazines, Klein isn't even that
interested in showing famous faces _ although a few musicians in
his campaign are practically household names _ depending on one's
household, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And while everyone's all hyped up about the Internet, Klein's
heading in a different direction. He's looking to do a big radio
buy for fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are listening to music, whether they're driving
their own cars or are passengers,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wall Street estimates, the CK Jeans business, owned
by Warnaco, is expected to generate in excess of $600 million in
wholesale volume this year throughout its junior, women's, men's
and kids' divisions. That's up from $400 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Warnaco generally spends in excess of 5 percent of sales on
advertising _ which would amount to more than $30 million in
advertising for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wachner, chairman of Warnaco, declined to specify the fall
budget, but said, ``We're spending 50 percent more than last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will run in 45 magazines and outdoors, in addition
to radio.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion's connection to musicians and actors obviously is
nothing new _ remember Marky Mark in his Calvins? But for the past
few years, Tommy Hilfiger has been at the vanguard of featuring
up-and-coming rock stars and famous progeny in both his ad
campaigns and store appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Klein acknowledges that other jeans companies have featured rock
stars and up-and-coming artists in their ad campaigns, and now he's
ready to give it his own interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many (companies) are involved with featuring musicians,''
Klein said. ``And we had to figure out, how does it apply to us? I
like to take a risk early on, like what we did with Marky Mark _
what he represented, his music and his ability to write his own
music. It goes back to that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted musicians and young actors who are not necessarily
that well known, and they all have their own look,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a bit more on the edge, not ones who are played on the
radio all around America. They're not so mass. They're all
acclaimed by critics and other musicians and most of them are the
cool ones,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's lineup includes musicians Foxy Brown, Liz Phair, Shirley
Manson of Garbage, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, Melissa Auf Der Maur
of Hole, Moa (a 25-year-old singer from Iceland), Jon Spencer,
Butch of Marvelous 3 and Ryan Shuck of Orgy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also includes Julia Stiles, a young actress who
stars in ``Ten Things I Hate About You,'' as well as actors Vincent
Kartheiser, who appeared in ``The Other Side of Paradise,'' and
Justin Chambers, who's featured in the Contradiction ads and has a
new film coming out, ``Liberty Heights,'' with Carolyn Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are some famous progeny such as actor Ben
Taylor, son of James Taylor and Carly Simon; actor Scott Caan, son
of James Caan, as well as musician Leona Naess, the stepdaughter of
Diana Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Where did Klein come up with this list?
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter,'' the designer revealed, referring to Marcy
Klein, who's a producer at ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the spreads shows a horizontal shot of Foxy Brown in her
CK Jeans, while another shows a heavily tattooed Butch of Marvelous
3 wearing CK jeans. Vincent Kartheiser is photographed in his CK
Jeans licking a spoonful of peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads carry the musician or actor's name and what
they're wearing, such as ``Deconstruction Denim,'' ``Pewter Denim''
or ``The Original Calvin.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were photographed by Steven Klein at Silvercup Studios
in Long Island City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who attended the three-day shoot, said he worked
with Steven Klein to determine who the artists would be and that
they'd do portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also spent a great deal of time with my daughter discussing
who the talent would be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his criteria, Klein said, ``A few of the artists have
albums coming out this summer. Some of them are all over MTV and
are hot now, and this is their moment. Others are cool and edgy and
not so new, but something's happening at this moment or is going to
happen real soon,'' said Klein, who's created more than a few stars
in his day.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said he asked the musicians and actors to choose their own
CK clothes to wear in the shoot, and Jon Spencer, who ``only wears
black,'' had no problem finding an outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were incredible,'' said the designer, about the assembled
group. A few were big fans of some of the others, he added. ``They
were so happy to do this. I was shocked. Ben Taylor was singing
while we were doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall campaign encompasses the junior, women's, kids' and
men's CK Jeans lines (owned by Warnaco), as well as CK Calvin Klein
women's and men's collections (owned by Calvin Klein Inc.).
</P>
<P>
   And while Klein might feel right at home in the studio, he
acknowledged that media planning has become a lot more difficult
these days, with so many choices of magazines, cable and network TV
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Klein recalled how he was the first to run multiple-page
portfolios in magazines in the late '70s, but doesn't want to go
that route anymore. Instead, he said, he prefers to run spreads in
a greater number of publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the story is multiple pages in a magazine. The
magazines may not be thrilled to hear this. But the spreads say
what I want to say. I'd rather say it through different photographs
of different people in unexpected places. I don't think the story
is multiples pages in a book. When I look at those, it's not
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the core fashion and lifestyle magazines, Klein
has also selected some ``edgier'' publications such as Nylon,
Raygun, Contents, Notorious, Alternative Press and Trace. The ads
will run in the United States, Asia, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many new magazines. I have a stack of them. I
chose many of the new ones. They're small audiences and you can
target them. I like the idea of supporting them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the media business becomes increasingly complex
and there's so much discussion about the Internet, Klein's excited
about placing his ads on an old format, radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try radio in a strong way. I want to hear what they (the
musicians and young actors) have to say. It's more about saying
something,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm clearly going after a young audience, and music is a
primary thing in their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who's no stranger to controversial ad campaigns, said he
doesn't think he'll run into any trouble this time, even though
some of the artists' lyrics may be questionable. And now that he's
associating his name with many artists, he's hopeful none of them
will do anything to embarrass the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the risk. We were careful, with the way everyone tends
to scrutinize what we do. Some of the lyrics are edgy. I'm not sure
everything they sing is going to be agreeable, but there's nothing
offensive. They're not killing people or advocating murder,'' Klein
said. ``In the end you have to take certain risks. Not everyone
will love what you're doing. In all the work, there's nothing
anyone would find offensive. Some people won't even get it, and
others will say, `Who are these people?''' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Leave all the predictions about computer
consciousness, interplanetary colonization and 200-year-old people
to Kreskin and his cronies. The following is a spot-check of those
operating in the here and now _ advertising, marketing and industry
executives _ on what's the next big thing in media.

<P>
   The next big thing is convergence, where the Web, cable and the
PC all converge in one set box in your office or home. The most
important part of it will be content. Here's where magazine
publishers will be able to go into the millennium as big content
providers for all the new media. Major publishers with megabrand
titles will be the biggest producers of the content. The other
element will be e-commerce, and there are big opportunities for
smart publishers. Magazines will sell products from the pages, and
smart publishers will take a portion of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Janine Lopiano-Misdom, partner in Sputnik Inc., a trend
forecaster: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing in media is already happening today:
interactive Web sites. What we mean by interactive is online,
real-time, soon-to-be-video-streamlined ``gatherings'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will marketers be competing with the hundreds of TV
stations already on cable, but with the millions of Web sites and
interactive sites that will exist. The winners will those who
deliver the engaging, entertaining, interactive and informative
experience that immerses consumers. Web sites will no longer be
digital catalogs or e-commerce vehicles; they will become the next
Hollywood.

   &UR; Sam Shahid, owner of Shahid &AMP; Co. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone will surprise us, but it might not be a magazine; people
are reading less and less. It'll be the Internet. Instead of
carrying pocketbook novels, it'll be a new Walkman that's
battery-operated, where you can see and read everything you want in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ingrid Sischy, editor in chief of Interview: &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   I think the idea of psychographics will be more important than
demographics.

   Fully integrated media and marketing programs. Companies will
put together packages that include a magazine element, TV element,
trade element, in-store events and a data base.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Peter Arnell, chairman of The Arnell Group: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will be really big is specific-frequency AM
broadcasting. The big usage will be on billboards, so when you're
passing a billboard and see the station, you turn on that
particular radio station and it'll talk to you. In a retail
environment, you walk into a Macy's and you have something in your
ear, and then you can hear a broadcast from Macy's radio station
about sales and what's going on in the store.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rebecca Shafer, creative director of Tse: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing will be the Internet, without a doubt, along
with interactive media like live billboards. Also, more niche
marketing to the young, like young luxury. The connection will have
to be immediate from the brand to the consumer. You can't take five
years to develop and hit your target. Also, there will be more
magazines like Talk that can be targeted to the young as well as
older.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Steven LaGuardia, creative director of Louis Boston: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Magazines are moving to be more lifestyle and attitude-based,
rather than gender-based. Look at Wallpaper, Surface and I-D. It's
not so much segregating men from women. We're seeing that kind of
media becoming much more important.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stefani Greenfield, co-owner of Scoop: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I definitely think that in the millennium, communication is
going to be driven by the Internet. From a fashion standpoint,
shopping online is the way of the future. It's not enough to have a
store now. You have to have a Web site. Now you have an opportunity
to reach the public at large, and it's a lot more cost-effective
than opening up a store. You're going to see the Internet as the
new focus group. We're going to take what's happening in fashion
globally and see it at our fingertips and communicate on that
level.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Irma Zandl, president of The Zandl Group, market researcher: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think it's going to be totally about customized media and
magazines will deliver these things via the Internet. People who
feel like they've been inundated will want to filter things out. I
see this as being more of a guy thing because guys are more
focused, whereas girls have more of a gathering mentality. This has
a lot of applications. For example, a Playboy kind of person who is
into blondes only. He'll say, ``Don't send me any of those
redheads.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marc Balet, principal of Balet &AMP; Albert Advertising: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I believe that the next big thing in media will be back to
basics: storytelling to groups of six or 12. Someone brings the
marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Madonna Badger, president and creative director of Badger Worldwide
Advertising: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will definitely be the Internet. Right now, it's estimated
the Internet will capture 50 million users in just five years. It
took TV 13 years and radio 38 years. The Internet demographic is
really a marketer's dream. They're young, they're smart, they're
educated and they have a decent household income. This is quite
simply a great way to increase brand awareness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Charles DeCaro, partner at Laspata/DeCaro: &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Mini fashion magazines on the Web. They will offer a lot of

little time to read lengthy articles.

   &UR; Richard Martin, curator of the Costume Institute at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think the next thing will be HDTV (high-definition
television). People really want to see runway shows as vividly as
they would by being there. Once they see high-resolution TV, it
will be like it was between 1951-54, where everyone had to go out
and buy a TV set.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I don't think people are that interested in models
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So proclaimed Calvin Klein _ the man who virtually invented the
supermodel.
</P>
<P>
   Klein unveiled his fall CK Jeans and CK Calvin Klein ad
campaigns, and sure enough, there's not a Christy or Kate in sight.
Instead, the new ads feature individual portraits of musicians and
young actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, if I had a feeling about a particular model, I
showed them to Kelly (Klein), Marcy (his daughter) and Fran
(Leibowitz). Now, when I touch base with my daughter, just a pretty
face isn't enough. It's an indication of how lots of people are
thinking,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great moment for the modeling industry,'' the
designer continued, although he noted that agencies are now
representing all kinds of celebrities. ``It says a lot about our
society, and I think it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's no secret that famous celebrities have usurped models
as cover girls on many fashion magazines, Klein isn't even that
interested in showing famous faces _ although a few musicians in
his campaign are practically household names _ depending on one's
household, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And while everyone's all hyped up about the Internet, Klein's
heading in a different direction. He's looking to do a big radio
buy for fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are listening to music, whether they're driving
their own cars or are passengers,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wall Street estimates, the CK Jeans business, owned
by Warnaco, is expected to generate in excess of $600 million in
wholesale volume this year throughout its junior, women's, men's
and kids' divisions. That's up from $400 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Warnaco generally spends in excess of 5 percent of sales on
advertising _ which would amount to more than $30 million in
advertising for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wachner, chairman of Warnaco, declined to specify the fall
budget, but said, ``We're spending 50 percent more than last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will run in 45 magazines and outdoors, in addition
to radio.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion's connection to musicians and actors obviously is
nothing new _ remember Marky Mark in his Calvins? But for the past
few years, Tommy Hilfiger has been at the vanguard of featuring
up-and-coming rock stars and famous progeny in both his ad
campaigns and store appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Klein acknowledges that other jeans companies have featured rock
stars and up-and-coming artists in their ad campaigns, and now he's
ready to give it his own interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many (companies) are involved with featuring musicians,''
Klein said. ``And we had to figure out, how does it apply to us? I
like to take a risk early on, like what we did with Marky Mark _
what he represented, his music and his ability to write his own
music. It goes back to that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted musicians and young actors who are not necessarily
that well known, and they all have their own look,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a bit more on the edge, not ones who are played on the
radio all around America. They're not so mass. They're all
acclaimed by critics and other musicians and most of them are the
cool ones,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's lineup includes musicians Foxy Brown, Liz Phair, Shirley
Manson of Garbage, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, Melissa Auf Der Maur
of Hole, Moa (a 25-year-old singer from Iceland), Jon Spencer,
Butch of Marvelous 3 and Ryan Shuck of Orgy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also includes Julia Stiles, a young actress who
stars in ``Ten Things I Hate About You,'' as well as actors Vincent
Kartheiser, who appeared in ``The Other Side of Paradise,'' and
Justin Chambers, who's featured in the Contradiction ads and has a
new film coming out, ``Liberty Heights,'' with Carolyn Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are some famous progeny such as actor Ben
Taylor, son of James Taylor and Carly Simon; actor Scott Caan, son
of James Caan, as well as musician Leona Naess, the stepdaughter of
Diana Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Where did Klein come up with this list?
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter,'' the designer revealed, referring to Marcy
Klein, who's a producer at ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the spreads shows a horizontal shot of Foxy Brown in her
CK Jeans, while another shows a heavily tattooed Butch of Marvelous
3 wearing CK jeans. Vincent Kartheiser is photographed in his CK
Jeans licking a spoonful of peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads carry the musician or actor's name and what
they're wearing, such as ``Deconstruction Denim,'' ``Pewter Denim''
or ``The Original Calvin.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were photographed by Steven Klein at Silvercup Studios
in Long Island City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who attended the three-day shoot, said he worked
with Steven Klein to determine who the artists would be and that
they'd do portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also spent a great deal of time with my daughter discussing
who the talent would be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his criteria, Klein said, ``A few of the artists have
albums coming out this summer. Some of them are all over MTV and
are hot now, and this is their moment. Others are cool and edgy and
not so new, but something's happening at this moment or is going to
happen real soon,'' said Klein, who's created more than a few stars
in his day.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said he asked the musicians and actors to choose their own
CK clothes to wear in the shoot, and Jon Spencer, who ``only wears
black,'' had no problem finding an outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were incredible,'' said the designer, about the assembled
group. A few were big fans of some of the others, he added. ``They
were so happy to do this. I was shocked. Ben Taylor was singing
while we were doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall campaign encompasses the junior, women's, kids' and
men's CK Jeans lines (owned by Warnaco), as well as CK Calvin Klein
women's and men's collections (owned by Calvin Klein Inc.).
</P>
<P>
   And while Klein might feel right at home in the studio, he
acknowledged that media planning has become a lot more difficult
these days, with so many choices of magazines, cable and network TV
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Klein recalled how he was the first to run multiple-page
portfolios in magazines in the late '70s, but doesn't want to go
that route anymore. Instead, he said, he prefers to run spreads in
a greater number of publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the story is multiple pages in a magazine. The
magazines may not be thrilled to hear this. But the spreads say
what I want to say. I'd rather say it through different photographs
of different people in unexpected places. I don't think the story
is multiples pages in a book. When I look at those, it's not
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the core fashion and lifestyle magazines, Klein
has also selected some ``edgier'' publications such as Nylon,
Raygun, Contents, Notorious, Alternative Press and Trace. The ads
will run in the United States, Asia, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many new magazines. I have a stack of them. I
chose many of the new ones. They're small audiences and you can
target them. I like the idea of supporting them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the media business becomes increasingly complex
and there's so much discussion about the Internet, Klein's excited
about placing his ads on an old format, radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try radio in a strong way. I want to hear what they (the
musicians and young actors) have to say. It's more about saying
something,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm clearly going after a young audience, and music is a
primary thing in their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who's no stranger to controversial ad campaigns, said he
doesn't think he'll run into any trouble this time, even though
some of the artists' lyrics may be questionable. And now that he's
associating his name with many artists, he's hopeful none of them
will do anything to embarrass the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the risk. We were careful, with the way everyone tends
to scrutinize what we do. Some of the lyrics are edgy. I'm not sure
everything they sing is going to be agreeable, but there's nothing
offensive. They're not killing people or advocating murder,'' Klein

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I don't think people are that interested in models
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So proclaimed Calvin Klein _ the man who virtually invented the
supermodel.
</P>
<P>
   Klein unveiled his fall CK Jeans and CK Calvin Klein ad
campaigns, and sure enough, there's not a Christy or Kate in sight.
Instead, the new ads feature individual portraits of musicians and
young actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, if I had a feeling about a particular model, I
showed them to Kelly (Klein), Marcy (his daughter) and Fran
(Leibowitz). Now, when I touch base with my daughter, just a pretty
face isn't enough. It's an indication of how lots of people are
thinking,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great moment for the modeling industry,'' the
designer continued, although he noted that agencies are now
representing all kinds of celebrities. ``It says a lot about our
society, and I think it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's no secret that famous celebrities have usurped models
as cover girls on many fashion magazines, Klein isn't even that
interested in showing famous faces _ although a few musicians in
his campaign are practically household names _ depending on one's
household, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And while everyone's all hyped up about the Internet, Klein's
heading in a different direction. He's looking to do a big radio
buy for fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are listening to music, whether they're driving
their own cars or are passengers,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wall Street estimates, the CK Jeans business, owned
by Warnaco, is expected to generate in excess of $600 million in
wholesale volume this year throughout its junior, women's, men's
and kids' divisions. That's up from $400 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Warnaco generally spends in excess of 5 percent of sales on
advertising _ which would amount to more than $30 million in
advertising for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wachner, chairman of Warnaco, declined to specify the fall
budget, but said, ``We're spending 50 percent more than last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will run in 45 magazines and outdoors, in addition
to radio.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion's connection to musicians and actors obviously is
nothing new _ remember Marky Mark in his Calvins? But for the past
few years, Tommy Hilfiger has been at the vanguard of featuring
up-and-coming rock stars and famous progeny in both his ad
campaigns and store appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Klein acknowledges that other jeans companies have featured rock
stars and up-and-coming artists in their ad campaigns, and now he's
ready to give it his own interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many (companies) are involved with featuring musicians,''
Klein said. ``And we had to figure out, how does it apply to us? I
like to take a risk early on, like what we did with Marky Mark _
what he represented, his music and his ability to write his own
music. It goes back to that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted musicians and young actors who are not necessarily
that well known, and they all have their own look,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a bit more on the edge, not ones who are played on the
radio all around America. They're not so mass. They're all
acclaimed by critics and other musicians and most of them are the
cool ones,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's lineup includes musicians Foxy Brown, Liz Phair, Shirley
Manson of Garbage, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, Melissa Auf Der Maur
of Hole, Moa (a 25-year-old singer from Iceland), Jon Spencer,
Butch of Marvelous 3 and Ryan Shuck of Orgy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also includes Julia Stiles, a young actress who
stars in ``Ten Things I Hate About You,'' as well as actors Vincent
Kartheiser, who appeared in ``The Other Side of Paradise,'' and
Justin Chambers, who's featured in the Contradiction ads and has a
new film coming out, ``Liberty Heights,'' with Carolyn Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are some famous progeny such as actor Ben
Taylor, son of James Taylor and Carly Simon; actor Scott Caan, son
of James Caan, as well as musician Leona Naess, the stepdaughter of
Diana Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Where did Klein come up with this list?
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter,'' the designer revealed, referring to Marcy
Klein, who's a producer at ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the spreads shows a horizontal shot of Foxy Brown in her
CK Jeans, while another shows a heavily tattooed Butch of Marvelous
3 wearing CK jeans. Vincent Kartheiser is photographed in his CK
Jeans licking a spoonful of peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads carry the musician or actor's name and what
they're wearing, such as ``Deconstruction Denim,'' ``Pewter Denim''
or ``The Original Calvin.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were photographed by Steven Klein at Silvercup Studios
in Long Island City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who attended the three-day shoot, said he worked
with Steven Klein to determine who the artists would be and that
they'd do portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also spent a great deal of time with my daughter discussing
who the talent would be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his criteria, Klein said, ``A few of the artists have
albums coming out this summer. Some of them are all over MTV and
are hot now, and this is their moment. Others are cool and edgy and
not so new, but something's happening at this moment or is going to
happen real soon,'' said Klein, who's created more than a few stars
in his day.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said he asked the musicians and actors to choose their own
CK clothes to wear in the shoot, and Jon Spencer, who ``only wears
black,'' had no problem finding an outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were incredible,'' said the designer, about the assembled
group. A few were big fans of some of the others, he added. ``They
were so happy to do this. I was shocked. Ben Taylor was singing
while we were doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall campaign encompasses the junior, women's, kids' and
men's CK Jeans lines (owned by Warnaco), as well as CK Calvin Klein
women's and men's collections (owned by Calvin Klein Inc.).
</P>
<P>
   And while Klein might feel right at home in the studio, he
acknowledged that media planning has become a lot more difficult
these days, with so many choices of magazines, cable and network TV
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Klein recalled how he was the first to run multiple-page
portfolios in magazines in the late '70s, but doesn't want to go
that route anymore. Instead, he said, he prefers to run spreads in
a greater number of publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the story is multiple pages in a magazine. The
magazines may not be thrilled to hear this. But the spreads say
what I want to say. I'd rather say it through different photographs
of different people in unexpected places. I don't think the story
is multiples pages in a book. When I look at those, it's not
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the core fashion and lifestyle magazines, Klein
has also selected some ``edgier'' publications such as Nylon,
Raygun, Contents, Notorious, Alternative Press and Trace. The ads
will run in the United States, Asia, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many new magazines. I have a stack of them. I
chose many of the new ones. They're small audiences and you can
target them. I like the idea of supporting them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the media business becomes increasingly complex
and there's so much discussion about the Internet, Klein's excited
about placing his ads on an old format, radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try radio in a strong way. I want to hear what they (the
musicians and young actors) have to say. It's more about saying
something,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm clearly going after a young audience, and music is a
primary thing in their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who's no stranger to controversial ad campaigns, said he
doesn't think he'll run into any trouble this time, even though
some of the artists' lyrics may be questionable. And now that he's
associating his name with many artists, he's hopeful none of them
will do anything to embarrass the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the risk. We were careful, with the way everyone tends
to scrutinize what we do. Some of the lyrics are edgy. I'm not sure
everything they sing is going to be agreeable, but there's nothing
offensive. They're not killing people or advocating murder,'' Klein
said. ``In the end you have to take certain risks. Not everyone
will love what you're doing. In all the work, there's nothing
anyone would find offensive. Some people won't even get it, and
others will say, `Who are these people?''' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Leave all the predictions about computer
consciousness, interplanetary colonization and 200-year-old people
to Kreskin and his cronies. The following is a spot-check of those
operating in the here and now _ advertising, marketing and industry
executives _ on what's the next big thing in media.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Pecker, president and chief executive officer of American
Media: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing is convergence, where the Web, cable and the
PC all converge in one set box in your office or home. The most
important part of it will be content. Here's where magazine
publishers will be able to go into the millennium as big content
providers for all the new media. Major publishers with megabrand
titles will be the biggest producers of the content. The other
element will be e-commerce, and there are big opportunities for
smart publishers. Magazines will sell products from the pages, and
smart publishers will take a portion of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Janine Lopiano-Misdom, partner in Sputnik Inc., a trend
forecaster: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing in media is already happening today:
interactive Web sites. What we mean by interactive is online,
real-time, soon-to-be-video-streamlined ``gatherings'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will marketers be competing with the hundreds of TV
stations already on cable, but with the millions of Web sites and
interactive sites that will exist. The winners will those who
deliver the engaging, entertaining, interactive and informative
experience that immerses consumers. Web sites will no longer be
digital catalogs or e-commerce vehicles; they will become the next
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sam Shahid, owner of Shahid &AMP; Co. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone will surprise us, but it might not be a magazine; people
are reading less and less. It'll be the Internet. Instead of
carrying pocketbook novels, it'll be a new Walkman that's
battery-operated, where you can see and read everything you want in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ingrid Sischy, editor in chief of Interview: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think the idea of psychographics will be more important than
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dan Brewster, president and ceo of American Express Publishing
Co. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fully integrated media and marketing programs. Companies will
put together packages that include a magazine element, TV element,
trade element, in-store events and a data base.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Peter Arnell, chairman of The Arnell Group: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will be really big is specific-frequency AM
broadcasting. The big usage will be on billboards, so when you're
passing a billboard and see the station, you turn on that
particular radio station and it'll talk to you. In a retail
environment, you walk into a Macy's and you have something in your
ear, and then you can hear a broadcast from Macy's radio station
about sales and what's going on in the store.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rebecca Shafer, creative director of Tse: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing will be the Internet, without a doubt, along
with interactive media like live billboards. Also, more niche
marketing to the young, like young luxury. The connection will have
to be immediate from the brand to the consumer. You can't take five
years to develop and hit your target. Also, there will be more
magazines like Talk that can be targeted to the young as well as
older.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Steven LaGuardia, creative director of Louis Boston: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Magazines are moving to be more lifestyle and attitude-based,
rather than gender-based. Look at Wallpaper, Surface and I-D. It's
not so much segregating men from women. We're seeing that kind of
media becoming much more important.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stefani Greenfield, co-owner of Scoop: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I definitely think that in the millennium, communication is
going to be driven by the Internet. From a fashion standpoint,
shopping online is the way of the future. It's not enough to have a
store now. You have to have a Web site. Now you have an opportunity
to reach the public at large, and it's a lot more cost-effective
than opening up a store. You're going to see the Internet as the
new focus group. We're going to take what's happening in fashion
globally and see it at our fingertips and communicate on that
level.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Irma Zandl, president of The Zandl Group, market researcher: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think it's going to be totally about customized media and
magazines will deliver these things via the Internet. People who
feel like they've been inundated will want to filter things out. I
see this as being more of a guy thing because guys are more
focused, whereas girls have more of a gathering mentality. This has
a lot of applications. For example, a Playboy kind of person who is
into blondes only. He'll say, ``Don't send me any of those
redheads.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marc Balet, principal of Balet &AMP; Albert Advertising: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I believe that the next big thing in media will be back to
basics: storytelling to groups of six or 12. Someone brings the
marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Madonna Badger, president and creative director of Badger Worldwide
Advertising: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will definitely be the Internet. Right now, it's estimated
the Internet will capture 50 million users in just five years. It
took TV 13 years and radio 38 years. The Internet demographic is
really a marketer's dream. They're young, they're smart, they're
educated and they have a decent household income. This is quite
simply a great way to increase brand awareness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Charles DeCaro, partner at Laspata/DeCaro: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mini fashion magazines on the Web. They will offer a lot of
snippets. They will be the Cliff Notes of magazines. People have so
little time to read lengthy articles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Richard Martin, curator of the Costume Institute at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think the next thing will be HDTV (high-definition
television). People really want to see runway shows as vividly as
they would by being there. Once they see high-resolution TV, it
will be like it was between 1951-54, where everyone had to go out
and buy a TV set.

   I think the next thing will be HDTV (high-definition
television). People really want to see runway shows as vividly as
they would by being there. Once they see high-resolution TV, it
will be like it was between 1951-54, where everyone had to go out
and buy a TV set.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I don't think people are that interested in models
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So proclaimed Calvin Klein _ the man who virtually invented the
supermodel.
</P>
<P>
   Klein unveiled his fall CK Jeans and CK Calvin Klein ad
campaigns, and sure enough, there's not a Christy or Kate in sight.
Instead, the new ads feature individual portraits of musicians and
young actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, if I had a feeling about a particular model, I
showed them to Kelly (Klein), Marcy (his daughter) and Fran
(Leibowitz). Now, when I touch base with my daughter, just a pretty
face isn't enough. It's an indication of how lots of people are
thinking,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great moment for the modeling industry,'' the
designer continued, although he noted that agencies are now
representing all kinds of celebrities. ``It says a lot about our
society, and I think it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's no secret that famous celebrities have usurped models
as cover girls on many fashion magazines, Klein isn't even that
interested in showing famous faces _ although a few musicians in
his campaign are practically household names _ depending on one's
household, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And while everyone's all hyped up about the Internet, Klein's
heading in a different direction. He's looking to do a big radio
buy for fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are listening to music, whether they're driving
their own cars or are passengers,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wall Street estimates, the CK Jeans business, owned
by Warnaco, is expected to generate in excess of $600 million in
wholesale volume this year throughout its junior, women's, men's
and kids' divisions. That's up from $400 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Warnaco generally spends in excess of 5 percent of sales on
advertising _ which would amount to more than $30 million in
advertising for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wachner, chairman of Warnaco, declined to specify the fall
budget, but said, ``We're spending 50 percent more than last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will run in 45 magazines and outdoors, in addition
to radio.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion's connection to musicians and actors obviously is
nothing new _ remember Marky Mark in his Calvins? But for the past
few years, Tommy Hilfiger has been at the vanguard of featuring
up-and-coming rock stars and famous progeny in both his ad
campaigns and store appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Klein acknowledges that other jeans companies have featured rock
stars and up-and-coming artists in their ad campaigns, and now he's
ready to give it his own interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many (companies) are involved with featuring musicians,''
Klein said. ``And we had to figure out, how does it apply to us? I
like to take a risk early on, like what we did with Marky Mark _
what he represented, his music and his ability to write his own
music. It goes back to that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted musicians and young actors who are not necessarily
that well known, and they all have their own look,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a bit more on the edge, not ones who are played on the
radio all around America. They're not so mass. They're all
acclaimed by critics and other musicians and most of them are the
cool ones,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's lineup includes musicians Foxy Brown, Liz Phair, Shirley
Manson of Garbage, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, Melissa Auf Der Maur
of Hole, Moa (a 25-year-old singer from Iceland), Jon Spencer,
Butch of Marvelous 3 and Ryan Shuck of Orgy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also includes Julia Stiles, a young actress who
stars in ``Ten Things I Hate About You,'' as well as actors Vincent
Kartheiser, who appeared in ``The Other Side of Paradise,'' and
Justin Chambers, who's featured in the Contradiction ads and has a
new film coming out, ``Liberty Heights,'' with Carolyn Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are some famous progeny such as actor Ben
Taylor, son of James Taylor and Carly Simon; actor Scott Caan, son
of James Caan, as well as musician Leona Naess, the stepdaughter of
Diana Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Where did Klein come up with this list?
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter,'' the designer revealed, referring to Marcy
Klein, who's a producer at ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the spreads shows a horizontal shot of Foxy Brown in her
CK Jeans, while another shows a heavily tattooed Butch of Marvelous
3 wearing CK jeans. Vincent Kartheiser is photographed in his CK
Jeans licking a spoonful of peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads carry the musician or actor's name and what
they're wearing, such as ``Deconstruction Denim,'' ``Pewter Denim''
or ``The Original Calvin.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were photographed by Steven Klein at Silvercup Studios
in Long Island City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who attended the three-day shoot, said he worked
with Steven Klein to determine who the artists would be and that
they'd do portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also spent a great deal of time with my daughter discussing
who the talent would be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his criteria, Klein said, ``A few of the artists have
albums coming out this summer. Some of them are all over MTV and
are hot now, and this is their moment. Others are cool and edgy and
not so new, but something's happening at this moment or is going to
happen real soon,'' said Klein, who's created more than a few stars
in his day.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said he asked the musicians and actors to choose their own
CK clothes to wear in the shoot, and Jon Spencer, who ``only wears
black,'' had no problem finding an outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were incredible,'' said the designer, about the assembled
group. A few were big fans of some of the others, he added. ``They
were so happy to do this. I was shocked. Ben Taylor was singing
while we were doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall campaign encompasses the junior, women's, kids' and
men's CK Jeans lines (owned by Warnaco), as well as CK Calvin Klein
women's and men's collections (owned by Calvin Klein Inc.).
</P>
<P>
   And while Klein might feel right at home in the studio, he
acknowledged that media planning has become a lot more difficult
these days, with so many choices of magazines, cable and network TV
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Klein recalled how he was the first to run multiple-page
portfolios in magazines in the late '70s, but doesn't want to go
that route anymore. Instead, he said, he prefers to run spreads in
a greater number of publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the story is multiple pages in a magazine. The
magazines may not be thrilled to hear this. But the spreads say
what I want to say. I'd rather say it through different photographs
of different people in unexpected places. I don't think the story
is multiples pages in a book. When I look at those, it's not
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the core fashion and lifestyle magazines, Klein
has also selected some ``edgier'' publications such as Nylon,
Raygun, Contents, Notorious, Alternative Press and Trace. The ads
will run in the United States, Asia, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many new magazines. I have a stack of them. I
chose many of the new ones. They're small audiences and you can
target them. I like the idea of supporting them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the media business becomes increasingly complex
and there's so much discussion about the Internet, Klein's excited
about placing his ads on an old format, radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try radio in a strong way. I want to hear what they (the
musicians and young actors) have to say. It's more about saying
something,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm clearly going after a young audience, and music is a
primary thing in their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who's no stranger to controversial ad campaigns, said he
doesn't think he'll run into any trouble this time, even though
some of the artists' lyrics may be questionable. And now that he's
associating his name with many artists, he's hopeful none of them
will do anything to embarrass the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the risk. We were careful, with the way everyone tends
to scrutinize what we do. Some of the lyrics are edgy. I'm not sure
everything they sing is going to be agreeable, but there's nothing
offensive. They're not killing people or advocating murder,'' Klein
said. ``In the end you have to take certain risks. Not everyone
will love what you're doing. In all the work, there's nothing
anyone would find offensive. Some people won't even get it, and
others will say, `Who are these people?''' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leave all the predictions about computer
consciousness, interplanetary colonization and 200-year-old people
to Kreskin and his cronies. The following is a spot-check of those
operating in the here and now _ advertising, marketing and industry
executives _ on what's the next big thing in media.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Pecker, president and chief executive officer of American
Media: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing is convergence, where the Web, cable and the
PC all converge in one set box in your office or home. The most
important part of it will be content. Here's where magazine
publishers will be able to go into the millennium as big content
providers for all the new media. Major publishers with megabrand
titles will be the biggest producers of the content. The other
element will be e-commerce, and there are big opportunities for
smart publishers. Magazines will sell products from the pages, and
smart publishers will take a portion of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Janine Lopiano-Misdom, partner in Sputnik Inc., a trend
forecaster: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing in media is already happening today:
interactive Web sites. What we mean by interactive is online,
real-time, soon-to-be-video-streamlined ``gatherings'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will marketers be competing with the hundreds of TV
stations already on cable, but with the millions of Web sites and
interactive sites that will exist. The winners will those who
deliver the engaging, entertaining, interactive and informative
experience that immerses consumers. Web sites will no longer be
digital catalogs or e-commerce vehicles; they will become the next
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sam Shahid, owner of Shahid &AMP; Co. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone will surprise us, but it might not be a magazine; people
are reading less and less. It'll be the Internet. Instead of
carrying pocketbook novels, it'll be a new Walkman that's
battery-operated, where you can see and read everything you want in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ingrid Sischy, editor in chief of Interview: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think the idea of psychographics will be more important than
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dan Brewster, president and ceo of American Express Publishing
Co. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fully integrated media and marketing programs. Companies will
put together packages that include a magazine element, TV element,
trade element, in-store events and a data base.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Peter Arnell, chairman of The Arnell Group: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will be really big is specific-frequency AM
broadcasting. The big usage will be on billboards, so when you're
passing a billboard and see the station, you turn on that
particular radio station and it'll talk to you. In a retail
environment, you walk into a Macy's and you have something in your
ear, and then you can hear a broadcast from Macy's radio station
about sales and what's going on in the store.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rebecca Shafer, creative director of Tse: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing will be the Internet, without a doubt, along
with interactive media like live billboards. Also, more niche
marketing to the young, like young luxury. The connection will have
to be immediate from the brand to the consumer. You can't take five
years to develop and hit your target. Also, there will be more
magazines like Talk that can be targeted to the young as well as
older.

   Magazines are moving to be more lifestyle and attitude-based,
rather than gender-based. Look at Wallpaper, Surface and I-D. It's
not so much segregating men from women. We're seeing that kind of

   I definitely think that in the millennium, communication is
going to be driven by the Internet. From a fashion standpoint,
shopping online is the way of the future. It's not enough to have a
store now. You have to have a Web site. Now you have an opportunity
to reach the public at large, and it's a lot more cost-effective
than opening up a store. You're going to see the Internet as the
new focus group. We're going to take what's happening in fashion
globally and see it at our fingertips and communicate on that
level.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Irma Zandl, president of The Zandl Group, market researcher: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think it's going to be totally about customized media and
magazines will deliver these things via the Internet. People who
feel like they've been inundated will want to filter things out. I
see this as being more of a guy thing because guys are more
focused, whereas girls have more of a gathering mentality. This has
a lot of applications. For example, a Playboy kind of person who is
into blondes only. He'll say, ``Don't send me any of those
redheads.''

   It will definitely be the Internet. Right now, it's estimated
the Internet will capture 50 million users in just five years. It
took TV 13 years and radio 38 years. The Internet demographic is
really a marketer's dream. They're young, they're smart, they're
educated and they have a decent household income. This is quite
simply a great way to increase brand awareness.

and buy a TV set.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leave all the predictions about computer
consciousness, interplanetary colonization and 200-year-old people
to Kreskin and his cronies. The following is a spot-check of those
operating in the here and now _ advertising, marketing and industry
executives _ on what's the next big thing in media.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Pecker, president and chief executive officer of American
Media: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing is convergence, where the Web, cable and the
PC all converge in one set box in your office or home. The most
important part of it will be content. Here's where magazine
publishers will be able to go into the millennium as big content
providers for all the new media. Major publishers with megabrand
titles will be the biggest producers of the content. The other
element will be e-commerce, and there are big opportunities for
smart publishers. Magazines will sell products from the pages, and
smart publishers will take a portion of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Janine Lopiano-Misdom, partner in Sputnik Inc., a trend
forecaster: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing in media is already happening today:
interactive Web sites. What we mean by interactive is online,
real-time, soon-to-be-video-streamlined ``gatherings'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will marketers be competing with the hundreds of TV
stations already on cable, but with the millions of Web sites and
interactive sites that will exist. The winners will those who
deliver the engaging, entertaining, interactive and informative
experience that immerses consumers. Web sites will no longer be
digital catalogs or e-commerce vehicles; they will become the next
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sam Shahid, owner of Shahid &AMP; Co. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone will surprise us, but it might not be a magazine; people
are reading less and less. It'll be the Internet. Instead of
carrying pocketbook novels, it'll be a new Walkman that's
battery-operated, where you can see and read everything you want in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ingrid Sischy, editor in chief of Interview: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think the idea of psychographics will be more important than
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dan Brewster, president and ceo of American Express Publishing
Co. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fully integrated media and marketing programs. Companies will
put together packages that include a magazine element, TV element,
trade element, in-store events and a data base.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Peter Arnell, chairman of The Arnell Group: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will be really big is specific-frequency AM
broadcasting. The big usage will be on billboards, so when you're
passing a billboard and see the station, you turn on that
particular radio station and it'll talk to you. In a retail
environment, you walk into a Macy's and you have something in your
ear, and then you can hear a broadcast from Macy's radio station
about sales and what's going on in the store.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rebecca Shafer, creative director of Tse: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing will be the Internet, without a doubt, along
with interactive media like live billboards. Also, more niche

to be immediate from the brand to the consumer. You can't take five

WORLD CUP SPONSORS HELP SHAPE IMAGE OF WOMEN IN TEAM SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For generations, throngs of sports fans have cheered for men
playing team sports. Are they now ready to cheer for women?
</P>
<P>
   The three-week-long Women's World Cup soccer tournament is
under &UR;  &LR; way across the country, providing women who play team sports
with a huge and rare opportunity to capture the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors and licensed manufacturers, through marketing
and retail campaigns, will play key roles in determining whether
women will now reap some of the popular acclaim and commercial
success long enjoyed by men's professional sports. So far,
businesses like what they see in the emerging image of women in the
plucky, demanding sport of soccer, and they are promoting the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's no question that an event that's strictly
women athletes, that's sold over a half-million tickets, and which
1 billion viewers will watch on television worldwide, has the
potential to set a new standard for women's sports,'' said Dean
Stoyer, who helped design Nike's multimillion-dollar marketing
campaign that features Mia Hamm, the star of the US team.
</P>
<P>
   While individual women competing in golf, tennis, and figure
skating have struggled for years to claim some of the spotlight
from men, only the Women's National Basketball Association and the
playing of the Women's World Cup in the United States have provided
significant financial opportunities in the team sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, women athletes had been almost untouchables when it
came to things like endorsing products,'' said Bob Williams,
president of the Burns Celebrity Sports Service, a Chicago-based
company that links advertisers and athletes. ``In the mid-'90s
there was an explosion, but it was figure skaters like Nancy
Kerrigan or tennis stars like Martina Hingis and the Williams
sisters, Venus and Serena. Only now are we getting any action for
team sport players, like Cheryl Swoopes in basketball and, now, in
a very large way, Mia Hamm in soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer has endured growing pains, striving to become a major
sport in this country. But observers say it might be different for
the women. For one thing, unlike the men's national team, the women
win. They took the first Women's World Cup in 1991, the gold medal
at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and they are favored to win this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``America likes winners and big events _ and we like being
identified with them as a company,'' said Bruce Hudson, director of
international sports marketing for Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc.
``We were the first out of the box with a commercial during the
men's World Cup last year that had lots of action footage, and
helped create an image for a group of women players who clearly
have become more and more popular with a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The image is becoming so popular that Mattel is selling Women's
World Cup Barbie dolls at prominent store displays around the
country. Gillette Co. has clamored to position its stadium signs in
prominent spots for the international television exposure. And the
Allstate Insurance Co. decided to be an official sponsor of the
tournament, the first time in the 67-year history of the company
that it has sponsored athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about it because it clearly helps us with a
target audience of younger women with families,'' said Raleigh
Ford, a marketing spokesman for Allstate.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the intersection of two significant demographic
trends makes the current Women's World Cup attractive to
corporations: Women and girls are participating in team sports in
greater numbers than ever, with big increases in this decade, and
women continue to be the pre-eminent decision makers on retail
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is what you might call the children of the Title
IX generation causing a huge leap in participation levels by women
and girls in sports that were long the preserve of male athletes.
The question becomes, will that translate in the next generation,
the grandchildren of Title IX, to popularity among spectators and
television viewers,'' said Robert Madrigal, of the University of
Oregon's Warsaw Sports Marketing Center. Passed into law in 1972,
Title IX mandated equitable opportunities to play sports for girls
attending schools that receive federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Women's World Cup could be a hugely important development
_ especially if the US women do well _ and if the companies that
were smart enough to get involved are smart with their marketing,''
Madrigal said.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the importance of a sports event is whether
Adidas and Nike fight over sponsorship _ and they are fighting over
the Women's World Cup. Adidas, the largest manufacturer of soccer
shoes and equipment in the world, has joined 10 other companies in
paying $6 million to be an official sponsor. Adidas is using the
trademarks of the tournament in its advertising, along with
pictures of members of the US women's team, like Kristine Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   However, Nike has refused to be eclipsed, embracing the event by
financing a national tour of the US team that began last year. Nike
also has launched the sort of marketing campaign featuring Hamm
that it once used to make Michael Jordan a national icon, even
using Jordan in some of the spots with Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   In one TV commercial, Hamm and Jordan challenge each other in a
variety of sports from sprinting to fencing while a woman's voice
sings, ``Anything you can do, I can do better. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always sold casual footwear well to women and girls,
but this is a battle for the performance footwear market, which is
really growing among female consumers,'' Nike's Stoyer said. ``From
1991 to 1998, there's been an 86 percent growth rate in the number
of girls participating on soccer at the high school level and a 120
percent increase in college. We want those new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked with Mia since 1994, and I can tell you that if
Mia Hamm wants to wear it, you can be pretty sure that a lot of
14-year-old girls are going to want to wear it, too,'' Stoyer said.
``Once, they wanted to be like Mike. Now, they want to be like
Mia.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm now appears as a spokeswoman for at least 15 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other women players on the US soccer team who have garnered
endorsement contracts with various companies include Briana Scurry,
Brandi Chastain, Tiffeny Milbrett and Tisha Venturini.
</P>
<P>
   As Nike's Jordan commercials proved, such marketing benefits not
only the company, but it helps create the image and mythology of
the sport. Basketball was still in recovery from the drug scandals
of the 1970s and early 1980s when the Jordan commercials began to
air, and they helped revitalize the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of women's sports are hoping for something of the same for
women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new is the sense that this has never happened for women
in team sports,'' said Lucy Danzinger, editor of Women's Sports &AMP;
Fitness. ``This girl gang of passionate soccer players is being
allowed to compete in a way that only men have competed before.
And, well, it's about time. We're thrilled!''

WAS IT WRONG TO PLAY IT SAFE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a woman, 81, married and in good health. During the last
10 years or so I've received cash gifts, which I have saved, so I
was able to purchase three T-bills in the amounts of $95,000,
$17,000, and $10,000. Recently I received an inheritance of
$75,000, with which I opened a money market account at our local
bank. I have avoided the stock market completely, because while
growing up ``stock market'' were bad words in our family _ my
mother and some of her friends suffered in the 1929 crash. For
peace of mind I decided to make less interest and invest in sure
things. Am I correct in having gone this route? Now I can say no,
but 10 years ago or more, who could foretell the future? I'm
heavily criticized by friends, but I'm happy enough with what I
have. The interest has helped with living expenses and in helping
members of the family, although it really hasn't been all that
great. I could have used it in the early years raising a large
family _ more then than now. I'm very grateful today and it's
appreciated more because everything we have was hard to come by. I
would appreciate your thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   A. B., Panorama City, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To be perfectly honest, my first thought upon finishing your
letter was: God bless you _ both for your generosity of spirit as
well as your solid decision to value peace of mind over the
prospect of monetary gains.
</P>
<P>
   My parents, too, lived through the 1929 crash and the Great
Depression, and while it didn't entirely scare them off the stock
market, it certainly gave them a vivid awareness that Wall Street
runs two ways.
</P>
<P>
   You are doing just fine, and you'll continue to do well by
leaving the stock market to people who have the inclination to risk
their money there.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there's not a change which will benefit you
and improve your income stream. Keeping that inheritance in a
bank's money market fund is a big mistake. Banks typically pay only
about half of the interest on money market accounts that mutual
fund companies do in their money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   They're not identical, of course. The money on deposit in a
bank's money market account is insured just as other savings and
bank deposits are. Money in a mutual fund money market is not
insured _ but it is invested extremely cautiously, typically in
government securities, overnight loans to banks, and short-term
corporate loans called ``commercial paper.''
</P>
<P>
   When you buy shares in a money market fund, the net asset value
is always calculated at $1 per share, and the daily interest rate
changes to reflect changes in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically such a fund could lose money on an investment and
be compelled to ``break the buck,'' which is to say, to report a
net asset value of less than $1.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long history of money market funds, no fund offered
to the public has ever done so; in the few cases in which managers
have invested in bad assets, the parent company decided the loans
were imprudent, and voluntarily made good their manager's losses.
</P>
<P>
   It's not entirely altruism: If a fund were to break the buck, it
would generate reams of bad publicity, which would redound to the
sponsoring company as well as the fund itself.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the yields on money market funds runs 4 to 4.6
percent. And you can get check-writing privileges with most money
market funds, so your funds will be just as liquid as at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 82 and my wife is 75. I am retired from the Postal
Service and have dabbled in stocks for the past 15 years _ and I
have lost in most of them, with the exception of the Vanguard Index
500 fund. However, I sold that holding to make home improvements,
selling at $86 per share. It is now about $123. I got out of the
market for safety's sake and put what I had in CDs, since I was
using my retirement money. A month ago a friend of mine came over
and was telling me about how great Dell Computers were, and I
bought 147 shares at $47.50. In the past month they have dropped to
about $34 per share. Did I buy a dead horse? I am worried and
concerned. Should I get out and take the loss?
</P>
<P>
   E.S., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You certainly would have done better had you stuck with the
CDs or the Standard &AMP; Poor's Index fund. But Dell Computer is a
very solid company with a terrific position in its market and
well-esteemed products.
</P>
<P>
   What you've done is demonstrated two things _ first how buying a
single stock can be a lot more dangerous than owning shares in a
mutual fund with a diversified portfolio, and second how the sexy
sectors of the market carry a higher degree of risk than the market
at large.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is now trading at only 60 percent of its 52-week high, but
also at a similar premium to its 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tumble, I would hang on. I think the long-term
picture for Dell is very solid, and if you're willing to be patient
with the stock it will eventually reward you.
</P>
<P>
   I think the old saw about IBM _ nobody ever got fired from their
corporation by buying IBM _ has now become true of Dell, which not
only sells solid machines but has an envied record of supporting
its customers.
</P>
<P>
   So yours is the old tale, of the speculator who stayed in to
become a long-term investor. But after this, I suggest you leave
your retirement money in more stable vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Over the years since 1985 I have held a goodly sum of
Franklin California Tax-Free fund, Class A shares. Since my
purchase I have made no additions and the balance has appreciated,
but the dividend has not. It seems like each year they cut the
dividend enough to make an impact on my income. For instance, from
1994 to the present it has fallen from .037 per share to .029. The
question is that none of my other tax-free funds have cut their
dividends, so why has Franklin? Is there a reason?
</P>
<P>
   H.N., Oceanside, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you look at the total returns from the various tax-free
funds you own, I think you'll see that Franklin California Tax-Free
fund has been holding up very nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, in a period of declining interest rates _ which is
certainly a fair characterization of the 1994 to 1999 period _
managers for fixed-income funds such as this have only a few
options when it comes to arranging their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   They can, as the managers of the Franklin fund have done,
maintain their portfolios in a consistent manner, seeking to
maintain a stable net asset value and letting the yield simply
represent the realities of the interest rate climate.
</P>
<P>
   Or a manager can pay premium prices for older, higher-yielding
bonds, which would serve to prop up the yield, but, reflecting the
premium paid for the holdings, would eventually eat into the
principal value.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a manager can stretch further in terms of risk, holding
somewhat riskier securities that will command a higher yield.
</P>
<P>
   The net result of all these moves can be found in the total
return, which not only reflects the yield but also changes in the
net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, Franklin California Tax-Free fund
fares a little above average in this measure, with a five-year
total return of 39.05 percent compared with a 38.32 percent average
for its peer funds, according to the May 31 report from Lipper
Analytical Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That result ranked your fund 32d among 67 peer funds with
results for that period. Using shorter-term measures the same
pattern holds: Over a year Franklin's 4.60 percent total return
compared with a peer average 3.81 percent; over three years its
total return of 23.06 percent compared with a 22.77 percent average
for its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back further, its 10-year total return of 100.88 percent
compared with a peer average of 98.45 percent, according to
Lipper's figures.
</P>
<P>
   If you want further confirmation of the strength of the fund,
consider the summary from Morningstar Mutual Funds, which accords
to the fund its highest five-star rating: ``California muni
investors will be hard-pressed to find a better all-around
option.'' In short, what you're seeing is the general effect of
declining interest rates and not an underperformance on the part of
your fund.

CELL-PHONE PLAN: BILL THE CALLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, Robin Richards signed up for a wireless phone,
but within months got rid of it because she got sick of paying huge
bills for incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   Now federal regulators are moving toward a revolutionary change
in the way US cell phone calls are billed _ charging incoming calls
to the person calling _ that could lead to a boom in the ranks of
cell phone users, now estimated to exceed 70 million. Once they do,
Richards plans to get another phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have a portable phone now, but I can't afford
it,'' said Richards, 26, who works for the Discover Boston trolley
tour line. ``Every time someone calls, you wind up paying for that
call, and what good is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission board
unanimously approved a proposed rule dubbed ``calling party pays''
under which the price of all incoming calls to cell phones would be
charged to the caller, not the person who owns the phone. Most
European, Latin American, and Asian telephone systems use this
billing method.
</P>
<P>
   FCC chairman William Kennard has said he hopes to make the rule
final by late this year or early in 2000, after public hearings.
Kennard predicts cell phone use ``would increase dramatically'' and
overall calling prices could drop.
</P>
<P>
   Under the most likely scenario being considered by the FCC,
someone dialing a wireless phone would hear a recording warning
that he must pay extra to complete the call, and the caller would
then hit the pound key to complete it. (A possible option is that
wireless phone owners could designate a handful of numbers, such as
those of parents or children, for which they would pay incoming
fees.)
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of delay, hassle, and as-yet unknown extra costs
for completing such calls concerns some consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entire proposal has tremendous potential to create a
great deal of confusion for the consumer,'' said David Butler, a
spokesman for Consumers Union in Washington, the group that
publishes Consumer Reports magazine. He sees FCC approval getting
bogged down by controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Facilitating wireless use could also bring other downsides,
analysts note, such as more proliferation of eyesore antenna towers
to serve them and more public disturbance from chirping telephones
and people chatting.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule change has strong support from the wireless
industry. And Adam Zawel, a wireless industry analyst with the
Yankee Group in Boston, said he thinks local phone companies would
move quickly to add a calling plan under which calls to wireless
phones would automatically be connected for a flat fee of, say, 10
cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Zawel's reasoning is that companies that are frequently calling
sales representatives or employees who have cell phones, as well as
residential customers whose family members or friends carry one,
would hate hearing the recording every time they called and would
happily pay a premium to skip over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think certain customers would demand it,'' Zawel said,
adding that he shares the perception that it would greatly increase
the market. ``It would bring wireless one step closer to being your
only phone.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lacey, a spokesman for Cellular One in Massachusetts, an
SBC Corp. unit, said his company ``does not oppose'' the plan but
wants to be sure the FCC adopts uniform notification and billing
procedures to make it work smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted by the Yankee Group in Boston last month
found that 70 percent of US cellular phone owners agree that
per-minute charges (including incoming call fees) limit their
overall usage of the phone, and 60 percent would be somewhat or
very willing to tell more people their wireless number if callers
paid for calling them.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, only 64 percent of people said they know their wireless
phone number, indicating a large minority are using it only for
outgoing calls.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is Buster Bradway, 49, a personal assistant to a
high-tech executive whose business card has his beeper number _ but
a blank space for him to write in the cell phone number, which he
has to copy from a card he carries in his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only put it on for the people I want calling me,'' said
Bradway, a bass drummer in the Boston Crusaders drum and bugle
corps who is often coordinating gatherings and performances by the
South Boston-based group.
</P>
<P>
   Bradway said if callers had to pay the price for reaching him on
his cell phone, he would be inclined to give more people his
number, but he admits: ``I don't want everyone to know my cell
phone number, if you know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as average calling prices have dropped by 60 percent since
1994, wireless telephoning has boomed to $32 billion-a-year
business in the United States, counting 68 million subscribers at
the end of 1998 and an estimated 70 million today.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Kennard told an industry convention that he thinks
``it's time for us to find a way to implement a `calling party
pays' system in this country,'' noting that only 5 percent of all
calls are now made on mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate at which local competition has been established in
this country has been too slow,'' said Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   Some cell companies are offering calling party pays as a local
option, but no more than 10 percent of subscribers use it,
estimates Thomas Wheeler of the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   One example is a Bell Atlantic Mobile subsidiary that operates
systems using the Cellular One brand name in Albuquerque, Phoenix,
and Tucson, and began offering calling party pays 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, up to 50 percent of subscribers took advantage of it,
said Greg Klinek, president of the subsidiary, Soutwesco Wireless
L.P. But in 1995, Klinek said, problems with an elaborate scheme
that used an out-of-state ``dial-back'' number for people to cheat
on the cost of local calls led his company to limit it to ``local
calling party pays.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, about 20 percent of subscribers use the system, even
though they have to pay for incoming calls from out-of-state
callers. Klinek thinks usage would jump back up to its original 50
percent or higher if the FCC adopts the new plan.

WHEN GEORGE W. WAS THE STICKBALL KING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDOVER, Mass. _ Looming above the reunion talk last weekend of
Zoloft and late fatherhood, of enlarged prostates and erectile
dysfunction, was the yawning absence of George W. Bush, the High
Commissioner of Stickball 35 years ago at Phillips Academy.
</P>
<P>
   George couldn't make it because he was playing presidential pied
piper to a few hundred media in Iowa. It turns out that citizens of
the most powerful nation on earth are seriously considering him to
be their next leader, prompting many of us who graduated with him
in the Class of 1964 to ask: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
</P>
<P>
   It all depends, really, when you start rolling the videotape.
While he has ably acquitted himself as governor of Texas, our
collective Andover memory of him, and ourselves, is arrested at the
slob stage of development _ somewhere between crustacean and
amphibian. That's why the mere thought of him in the Oval Office is
appalling.
</P>
<P>
   Life at Andover during the early '60s was defined by sports,
academic stress and gamey attire, usually in that order. The place
was not yet coed, which meant that students had no better idea how
to talk to a woman than a Ford Falcon. It was a time of cigarette
smoke, pool, hall hockey, and the bullying of the weak. The
hallmark was a coruscating sarcasm that led Life to focus on
Andover in an article on prep school negativism. For most of us, it
was great fun.
</P>
<P>
   The salient point about George at Andover is that he was neither
distinguished nor a disaster in the classroom or on the playing
field. He was neither weird nor particularly creative. Like Trent
Lott and Chad Cochran at Ol' Miss, he was a cheerleader _ an
activity that often precedes a career in marketing. He cruised the
surface like a water bug. But at the end of the day, his uncommon
social skills made him a major player without excelling in
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Still, George was a creature of the intellectual middle. It is
precisely this specter of the average elevated to the extraordinary
in the White House that some find so terrifying. If George has a
serious shot at it, why not the guy cradling a Mount Gay and tonic
over by the shrimp?
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that, to be president, you've got to be
brighter than me,'' says class secretary Tom Seligson. George
doesn't appear to be. This would not be an issue if he remained
with the Texas Rangers organization, or even governor of the Lone
Star state. But the White House, one hopes, requires something
more. So his Andover performance makes us wonder: HAS IT REALLY
COME TO THIS? And yet some of the most successful leaders in later
life underachieve with brio as youths. Years ago, one Harvard dean
gave this group a name: the happy bottom quarter. They knew
instinctively that one's early years should not be ruined by too
serious an approach to life. There is, after all, plenty of time
for that later. This logic is not without merit. And these people
go on to run brokerage houses, law firms, governments. Henry L.
Stimson did not graduate with his class from Andover. (Neither did
Humphery Bogart who, legend has it, was canned for throwing a
master in Rabbit's Pond.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, George walked a tightrope at Andover with
dexterity, melding echt preppieness with Texas roots. He came from
Houston, not Greenwich, but favored exquisitely ratty tweeds. He
fused two wildly different cultures and made a hard act look easy.
Another thing: George was unembarrassable.
</P>
<P>
   As the booze left the starting gate last weekend, the talk among
the Class of 1964 was actually not about George. The hottest
no-show was Dick Wolf, whom few remembered but who now earns large
money as the creator of ``Law and Order,'' the hit television
drama. Wolf is mysterious. George is not.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made about George's tenure as High Commissioner of
Stickball. It probably should. Besides being an urban street game,
stickball was a classic prep school ritual, arcane and insular. The
game was retro chic _ played with a broomstick and a tennis ball.
Every dormitory had a team. Every swath of lawn where the games
were played on spring evenings had a name. Stickball had nothing to
do with the rest of life, but it occupied a special place within
the school. It was a system within a system, and George ran it,
accompanied by another student in a white medical coat with the
title of league psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   About half of George's classmates raised their hands when polled
at dinner Saturday night if they had been contacted by the media.
Some, like Seligson, have been called half a dozen times or more.
Most harbor no love for reporters and would probably not divulge
anything yeasty, even if they despise George, because they feel
it's no one's damned business what he was like at Andover. There
exists within this class an intimacy that will not be violated
lightly. Then, too, there's not that much to say about George
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So the media should weigh carefully what they get from this
group about George. Caveat emptor. To wit: One classmate told a
reporter that George tried to persuade everyone in the spring term
of senior year to pour out the contraband from their liquor bottles
after Headmaster John Mason Kemper warned that college dreams would
be dashed for anyone caught with alcohol. Everyone else remembered
no such thing and concluded the classmate fried too many brain
cells or else wants a job.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, another classmate passed out cassettes of
a telephone interview he gave last April to a reporter from The
Washington Post extolling George's virtues. (He taped it without
her knowledge. Take that, media.) The man wants in the worst way to
run the CIA for George and is not shy about saying so. George does
have his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner Saturday night, Tom Seligson read the list of
positions that George has meted out to those classmates who showed
up for the reunion. Seligson purportedly got it from Clay Johnson,
Bush's appointments secretary and another classmate. Everyone got
something, from ambassador to Kosovo to director of the Bureau of
Prisons and, of course, drug czar. The idea was a hit. If nothing
else, George was great reunion glue.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening wore on and couples lurched to Martha and the
Vandellas Motown classics and the Beach Boys' ``Pet Sounds,'' some
classmates vowed to attend his inaugural. There was talk of renting
rooms, a bus, a ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Someone said that the Torques should play at one of George's
inaugural balls. The Torques was a rock band of stunningly modest
talents that subsisted during senior year. It had its own
subspecies called clappers, who were supposed to clap to their
music, and screamers who, surprise, were supposed to scream. There
is no evidence that either group did anything.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. George was remembered last weekend as a screamer. So
forget his position on East Timor, the only question that matters
is this: Will he scream at his own inauguration?

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a moment of deja vu, you might glimpse him on the street, a
blur of fair skin, reddish-brown hair, eyes of steel. And you might
wonder ``Who is that guy?'' as strains of a bittersweet 1980s pop
song swell in the back of your mind. ``Don't you . . . forget about
me . . .'' And before long your memory, that quicksand of celebrity
has-beens and will-bes and woulda-coulda-shoulda-beens, will
convulse and explode and, finally, give it up: He's Anthony Michael
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Once the rail-thin jester of the 1980s Brat Pack, once the geek
icon who brought his wiry energy to ``The Breakfast Club'' and
``Sixteen Candles,'' Anthony Michael Hall is now a vaguely familiar
face on a city street. His features thickened, his jacket more
Brooks Brothers than ``Miami Vice,'' he is 15 long, strange years
away from his reign as the hottest teen actor on all of planet
Hollywood. Unlike fellow Brat Packer Demi Moore, who overcame drug
and alcohol abuse to enjoy a boffo career in the '90s, Hall has
struggled through many seasons of bad press and bad movies. But
unlike tragic child stars such as the late Dana Plato, he has
survived the trials of a youth lived in the glare of the public
eye, the psychological twists of too much fame, too much money, and
way too much candy.
</P>
<P>
   Now a calmer 31, Hall is in Boston as part of a promotional tour
for a cable-TV movie that he hopes will usher his career into a
better future. Called ``The Pirates of Silicon Valley,'' it's a
dramatized chronicle of the race between Apple Computer and
Microsoft, with Noah Wyle of ``ER'' as Steve Jobs, and Hall doing
the geek thing all over again as Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very excited about this project because it allows me an
opportunity to start again as an adult,'' he says. ``It's really
kind of funny how that works out. I'm 31 right now. Most actors
don't get started until they're in their 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the name of starting over, Hall is wearing a pressed
blue suit, a white shirt, and a contained, businesslike manner that
would probably win him the respect of even the stiffest of Silicon
bazillionaires. There's not a hint of brattiness in sight.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Brat Pack lives
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before you can understand the history of Anthony Michael Hall,
you have to understand the Brat Pack, the grouping of young actors
associated with mid-'80s hits by writer-director John Hughes and
the movie ``St. Elmo's Fire.'' After the label was used by reporter
David Blum in a 1985 New York magazine article, it stuck to them
like Krazy Glue, winding up in every review and celebrity profile,
and it's now destined to appear in their obituaries. These actors _
including Rob Lowe, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Molly
Ringwald, and Andrew McCarthy _ were linked not only by their
ability to portray teen alienation and early 20-something angst,
but by tales of their romantic and alcoholic misbehavior behind the
scenes. Hall and Ringwald were five years younger than the others,
but that didn't appear to stop them from keeping up.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the '80s, most of the Brat Pack careers had
derailed, thanks to the passing of trends, the strains of substance
abuse, and the blinding light of the always troublesome ego. But
the buzz about the Pack didn't die with the Bush administration,
when a grungier gang of young actors took over the limelight. Brat
Pack movies have become beloved cult objects in the '90s for those
who were raised on them, and recent references include an April
People magazine cover and a ``Breakfast Club'' goof on last week's
MTV movie awards. In an homage to Hughes's teen movies, Kevin
Smith, the director of ``Chasing Amy,'' has even based his new
film, ``Dogma,'' on a quest for the fictional Chicago suburb where
many of Hughes's classics were set. Just as children of the 1950s
harbor affection for ``Rebel Without a Cause,'' and just as today's
youth will look back at ``Dawson's Creek,'' Generation X will
always be curious about the Brats.
</P>
<P>
   Proof that the Brat Pack lives greeted Hall during his visit to
Boston, the city where he was born in 1968. Amid the clatter of the
Hard Rock Cafe, he lunched with 10 women culled from a KISS radio
contest, one of whom actually asked him to sign her underwear. ``I
asked her what her husband's name was, and I wrote `Sorry, Jim' on
the underwear,'' Hall says with a laugh.

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes corporation
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does Hall resent his Brat Pack notoriety? ``I don't really
obsess about it,'' he says, following the comment with an
inscrutable half-laugh that recurs many times during our interview.
``To be mentioned as a part of a period of young actors emerging or
working together, that's fine. . . . It's a gift to have been able
to contribute to some funny movies that people still refer to. As
an artist, that's what you want to do, you want to contribute and
be remembered. So it was a great place to start. It put me on the
map and changed the course of my young life. It gave me a career.''
</P>
<P>
   He lavishes praise on Hughes, with whom he had his three biggest
hits _ ``Sixteen Candles,'' ``The Breakfast Club,'' and ``Weird
Science.'' Hughes paved the way for the current popularity of teen
movies, as he grabbed '80s teen audiences by the throat with his
heartfelt insights and his shrewd use of pop music. ``During the
time we made those films, the focus was just to enjoy ourselves,''
Hall says. ``He was empowering as a writer and director because he
was very much a collaborator. He empowered the actors to make
choices and to take chances with him, and to come to him with
suggestions, to embellish scenes. He was very inspired to that
extent. It was a work in progress. It was never: `The door is
shut.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What Hall brought to the table with Hughes was his own wacky
personality, the kind of unstoppable clowning that had him doing
shows for his family as a kid. ``It was exciting to know that I was
his protege, and that he was very much looking to me for humor and
for ideas as well,'' he says. But once Hall graduated from Hughes
High School, he had to work with directors who had other ideas
about his performances, and his life changed. ``It's like after I
did the John Hughes films is when I had to become an actor,'' he
says. ``It was at that point it got hard.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was then
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hall fell into a post-Hughes rut of mediocre movies (with the
exception of small parts in ``Edward Scissorhands'' and ``Six
Degrees of Separation'') that he is still trying to climb out of.
He was Hughes's protege, but their fruitful relationship
deteriorated in the years after 1985's ``Weird Science.'' Hall says
he's been leaving phone messages for Hughes, but that Hughes hasn't
responded. Why not? ``He's become a Hollywood mogul,'' Hall says,
``and ironically he has kind of a Howard Hughes streak in him.''
But in 1992, Hall was more open about his falling out with Hughes:
``I can't call him up anymore,'' he told the Baltimore Sun.
``There's a lot of pain in that.''

OPENING UP WILDE

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attending a West End theater production of Oscar Wilde's ``An
Ideal Husband'' in London a few years ago, Oliver Parker listened
intently to Wilde's wonderful, witty prose. Parker, a filmmaker,
had an immediate reaction to the audience's enthusiastic response
to this comic concerto of blackmail, friendship, and romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a very bad idea, actually, for a film,''
Parker said. ``It seemed so theatrical, I had no idea how we would
get it off the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the end of the play, Parker found himself ``sort of going
into a corner and scribbling out a few ideas.'' Within a few weeks
he had written a quick first draft, which would evolve into his
screen adaptation of ``An Ideal Husband,'' opening Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really came away from it thinking, `Well, I don't think we
should do it,' '' said Parker, during a recent publicity stop in
Boston. ``But there were so many curious elements to it that hooked
me
</P>
<P>
   somewhere, more subconsciously than I was aware.''
</P>
<P>
   Set during the Victorian era, the film stars Jeremy Northam as
Sir Robert Chiltern, whose white-hot political career and marriage
to Lady Gertrude (Cate Blanchett) are jeopardized when a mysterious
schemer, Mrs. Cheveley (Julianne Moore), tries to blackmail him by
threatening to expose a past indiscretion. Attempting to help
Robert is Arthur (Rupert Everett), a charming rogue who may prove
to be a better friend to Robert than a potential husband to Mabel
(Minnie Driver), Robert's lovesick sister.

   While Parker liked the story, at first he wasn't sure how it
would transfer from stage to screen. But he knew what he didn't
want _ a static, claustrophobic play on film. The only way it would
work, he believed, was to expand the play beyond the confines of
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Parker began ``a process which could make it much more
cinematic. It was like detective work going through the play and
finding all the references which related to things happening
outside the arena of the stage,'' he said. ``Then I became
intrigued by the challenge of delivering something which, apart
from its relevance, had something compassionate to say about our
nature. The relevance of many of the themes seemed so glaring that
my mind kept running over it like a tongue over a sore tooth.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A familiar scenario &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The relevance to which Parker referred concerns the play's basic
premise _ a promising politician whose professional and personal
life may unravel because of a selfish, stupid act concealed from
his wife and closest friends. (Sound familiar?) Although the play
is set in 1895, it's a story Parker believes contemporary audiences
can relate to.
</P>
<P>
   An actor before making his directorial debut with a 1995 screen
adaptation of William Shakespeare's ``Othello,'' Parker, who lives
in London, was familiar with Wilde's plays. He performed in ``The
Importance of Being Earnest,'' and learning Wilde's words gave him
a better appreciation of the man who is often reduced to a series
of witty observations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I acted in his plays, I thought of him as a bit of a
smart aleck, always with something clever to say about something.
And I thought it all seemed a little brittle, harsh and cynical,''
Parker said. ``It seemed Wilde was very happy to sacrifice a
reasonable plot line for a better gag line. And this is one of the
things which made me believe (Wilde's play) would be so difficult
to put on-screen because there needs to be more of a satisfying
narrative.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Parker believes, Wilde's plays have not
received the recent popular attention Hollywood has lavished on
novels by Jane Austen and Edith Wharton, and all things
Shakespearean. Some have been straightforward adaptations, but
others have been updated. Austen's ``Emma'' was transformed into
``Clueless,'' and ``Romeo and Juliet'' has inspired everything from
``West Side Story'' to Baz Luhrmann's 1996 music-pumped urban drama
starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. But it's a safe bet
that Hollywood isn't planning a Wilde film adaptation called
``Bein' Earnest'' with James Van Der Beek as Jack, Freddie Prinze
Jr. as Algernon, and Katie Holmes as Gwendolen _ although Parker
briefly considered modernizing ``An Ideal Husband.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting idea, but I think you have to be very
aware of why you're updating a piece,'' he said. ``For me, this
story was all the more alluring because locating it in its original
time allowed perspective. The modern parallels, in terms of the
political scandals, if you actually made them specific and modern,
you would just go, `So what?' Part of the joy for me is showing
this happened 100 years ago, and it works almost on a metaphorical
level.''
</P>
<P>
   While keeping much of Wilde's original play, Parker did not shy
from injecting his own touches. One is an ode to the playwright,
showing several characters attending a performance of ``The
Importance of Being Earnest,'' with an appearance by Wilde (Michael
Culkin) for a curtain call. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Disservice to Wilde'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to offend somebody, but I think you do a
disservice to Wilde if you didn't do alterations, because he wasn't
writing for the screen,'' Parker said. ``I wanted to give Oscar as
much rein as possible, even if that meant tinkering with the lines.
He had some very specific agendas in his time. Some remain, some
are no longer as valid. For me it was about capturing the spirit,
and whatever it took, that's what you should be prepared to do. If
you don't do that, you can deliver something flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge was the language, which, while lovely to the
ear, sounds like nothing in contemporary culture. Parker said he
needed to reduce the ``linguistic complexity'' of the sentences
that were built like ``pyramids, with all these clauses which are
beautifully structured, but you can only get away with so many of
those.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language is perfect, so perfect it's almost at times
unpalatable for an actor to say on-screen. My intention was to
nudge it toward naturalism, without being obsessed with it,''
Parker said. ``I was keen to find a way to deliver the language
which became spontaneous, and I worked with the performers to make
sure we had a house style. The challenge was to sustain the
language without being throttled by it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, much has been said and written about the
Irish-born Wilde, considered by some to be the first true
celebrity. Last year, two New York plays, Moises Kaufman's ``Gross
Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' and David Hare's
``The Judas Kiss,'' dealt with Wilde's downfall after he was
convicted of ``gross indeceny'' for his then-scandalous affair with
a young nobleman, Lord Alfred Douglas. Wilde died at age 46 in
1900, a few years after completing a two-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   With this adaptation of ``An Ideal Husband,'' Parker hopes to
turn the attention from Wilde the martyr back to Wilde the
playwright and novelist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was inherently modern, a great satirist, and a rousing
rebel. He was turning convention on its head. He was on the bridge
between the end of one century and the beginning of the next, and
he was pointing the direction like a signpost,'' Parker said. ``He
was hugely compassionate, and there's a general plea for tolerance
in everything he does. He dares you to accept the inconsistencies
of life, and its complexities and ambiguity. He challenges you not
to see the world in black and white. That's something people always
kind of need reminding of, and it's hardly been better expressed
than in Oscar's works.''

A COURSE ON VALUES IS REASON TO SHUDDER

   The good people at Brown University have decided they're going
to teach their students values.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean, for example, instructing a freshman as to
where he or she can go to get a really good buy, or value, on a
textbook. This means teaching and discussing what kinds of
principles we, as a nation, should tout. Brown will insert such
instruction into next fall's coursework.
</P>
<P>
   This is a most slippery of slopes, especially so when a faculty
member is quoted as worrying about the ``decline of personal
virtue'' among our leaders and ``the collective horrors in our
world.'' Right away, I am worried.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because personal virtue has been in decline for quite some
millennia now. Nor are horrors, be they personal or collective,
anything new on the face of the well-worn planet. We know more
about both because our information gathering and dispensing systems
are so much better than when somebody yodeled to somebody else from
one mountaintop to another.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that reality the insatiable appetite that radio and
television talk shows and the tabloid press have for the
pecadilloes of every politician, entertainer, sports figure, and
who-knows-who-else, and we are lulled into believing that integrity
has deteriorated from some historic reference point.
</P>
<P>
   It always has been unclear to me when that point was. Could it
have been during our ethnic cleansing of Native Americans? During
slavery and Jim Crow laws? How about those antiimmigration riots of
the 19th century? Labor-management warfare in the streets? The Wild
West? The right-wing McCarthy Era witch hunts of the 1950s?
Left-leaning students preventing other students from attending
their classes in the 1960s?
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to virtue, one could look at pretty much every
president, for example, and find some measure of scandalous, or, at
least, questionable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Let us take one of our own, John Adams. If ever there was a
local boy who made good, it was Adams. A giant figure in our
nation's birth. Second president of the United States. We learn in
our history books that he was a man of great integrity and
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   One supporter said of him, ``You stand nearly alone in the
history of our public men in never having had your integrity called
in question or even suspected.'' Not bad.
</P>
<P>
   But a critic said, ``Whether he is spiteful, playful, witty,
kind, cold, drunk, sober, angry, easy, stiff, jealous, cautious,
confident, close, open, it is always in the wrong place or to the
wrong person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well, who among us is the embodiment of personal integrity?
Indeed, as Brown prepares to teach values, it will offer a
discussion of philosopher Henry David Thoreau and his belief that
self-sufficiency was life's secret. Is this not the same Thoreau
who had some unpleasant remarks to make about Irish immigrants who
were doing their best to practice self-sufficiency? Is it not the
same ``independent'' fellow who depended on Ralph Waldo Emerson to
come to his aid in time of travail?
</P>
<P>
   Well, I wish Brown much luck, though, when you think about it,
the task of teaching values is not that difficult. It all comes
down to one rule, as it always has: Do unto others, as you would
have them do unto you. The rest? Academic commentary.

CELL-PHONE PLAN: BILL THE CALLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, Robin Richards signed up for a wireless phone,
but within months got rid of it because she got sick of paying huge
bills for incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   Now federal regulators are moving toward a revolutionary change
in the way US cell phone calls are billed _ charging incoming calls
to the person calling _ that could lead to a boom in the ranks of
cell phone users, now estimated to exceed 70 million. Once they do,
Richards plans to get another phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have a portable phone now, but I can't afford
it,'' said Richards, 26, who works for the Discover Boston trolley
tour line. ``Every time someone calls, you wind up paying for that
call, and what good is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission board
unanimously approved a proposed rule dubbed ``calling party pays''
under which the price of all incoming calls to cell phones would be
charged to the caller, not the person who owns the phone. Most
European, Latin American, and Asian telephone systems use this
billing method.
</P>
<P>
   FCC chairman William Kennard has said he hopes to make the rule
final by late this year or early in 2000, after public hearings.
Kennard predicts cell phone use ``would increase dramatically'' and
overall calling prices could drop.
</P>
<P>
   Under the most likely scenario being considered by the FCC,
someone dialing a wireless phone would hear a recording warning
that he must pay extra to complete the call, and the caller would
then hit the pound key to complete it. (A possible option is that
wireless phone owners could designate a handful of numbers, such as
those of parents or children, for which they would pay incoming
fees.)
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of delay, hassle, and as-yet unknown extra costs
for completing such calls concerns some consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entire proposal has tremendous potential to create a
great deal of confusion for the consumer,'' said David Butler, a
spokesman for Consumers Union in Washington, the group that
publishes Consumer Reports magazine. He sees FCC approval getting
bogged down by controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Facilitating wireless use could also bring other downsides,
analysts note, such as more proliferation of eyesore antenna towers
to serve them and more public disturbance from chirping telephones
and people chatting.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule change has strong support from the wireless
industry. And Adam Zawel, a wireless industry analyst with the
Yankee Group in Boston, said he thinks local phone companies would
move quickly to add a calling plan under which calls to wireless
phones would automatically be connected for a flat fee of, say, 10
cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Zawel's reasoning is that companies that are frequently calling
sales representatives or employees who have cell phones, as well as
residential customers whose family members or friends carry one,
would hate hearing the recording every time they called and would
happily pay a premium to skip over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think certain customers would demand it,'' Zawel said,
adding that he shares the perception that it would greatly increase
the market. ``It would bring wireless one step closer to being your
only phone.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lacey, a spokesman for Cellular One in Massachusetts, an
SBC Corp. unit, said his company ``does not oppose'' the plan but
wants to be sure the FCC adopts uniform notification and billing
procedures to make it work smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted by the Yankee Group in Boston last month
found that 70 percent of US cellular phone owners agree that
per-minute charges (including incoming call fees) limit their
overall usage of the phone, and 60 percent would be somewhat or
very willing to tell more people their wireless number if callers
paid for calling them.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, only 64 percent of people said they know their wireless
phone number, indicating a large minority are using it only for
outgoing calls.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is Buster Bradway, 49, a personal assistant to a
high-tech executive whose business card has his beeper number _ but
a blank space for him to write in the cell phone number, which he
has to copy from a card he carries in his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only put it on for the people I want calling me,'' said
Bradway, a bass drummer in the Boston Crusaders drum and bugle
corps who is often coordinating gatherings and performances by the
South Boston-based group.
</P>
<P>
   Bradway said if callers had to pay the price for reaching him on
his cell phone, he would be inclined to give more people his
number, but he admits: ``I don't want everyone to know my cell
phone number, if you know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as average calling prices have dropped by 60 percent since
1994, wireless telephoning has boomed to $32 billion-a-year
business in the United States, counting 68 million subscribers at
the end of 1998 and an estimated 70 million today.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Kennard told an industry convention that he thinks
``it's time for us to find a way to implement a `calling party
pays' system in this country,'' noting that only 5 percent of all
calls are now made on mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate at which local competition has been established in
this country has been too slow,'' said Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   Some cell companies are offering calling party pays as a local
option, but no more than 10 percent of subscribers use it,
estimates Thomas Wheeler of the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   One example is a Bell Atlantic Mobile subsidiary that operates
systems using the Cellular One brand name in Albuquerque, Phoenix,
and Tucson, and began offering calling party pays 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, up to 50 percent of subscribers took advantage of it,
said Greg Klinek, president of the subsidiary, Soutwesco Wireless
L.P. But in 1995, Klinek said, problems with an elaborate scheme
that used an out-of-state ``dial-back'' number for people to cheat
on the cost of local calls led his company to limit it to ``local
calling party pays.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, about 20 percent of subscribers use the system, even
though they have to pay for incoming calls from out-of-state
callers. Klinek thinks usage would jump back up to its original 50
percent or higher if the FCC adopts the new plan.

MODERN-DAY `SCHINDLERS' SAVED NEIGHBORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ Zhivko Martinovic had a dank, cramped,
concrete woodshed next to his home. It was the best he could offer
_ 5 by 7 feet, cluttered with chopped wood, paint cans, old soda
bottles, hammers, shovels.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three months, the Serbian man's shed served as
sanctuary for his two ethnic Albanian neighbors, a refuge from the
terrors of Serb paramilitary attacks and NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He opened his door and helped us,'' said 75-year-old Zymber
Buqaj at the doorway to the shed, ``because he knew they were doing
massacres.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians call Serbs such as Martinovic the ``Schindlers,''
friends of theirs before the war who went out on a limb to become
their saviors when the ``ethnic cleansing'' began. Nicknamed after
Oskar Schindler, who saved Jews from Nazi slaughter, these Serbs
risked their own lives to protect Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Some warned Albanian families of a coming Serbian military
attack. Others appealed to Serbian soldiers to release men the Serb
militiamen were trying to pull out of a column of fleeing
Albanians. The bravest of Serb civilians offered their basements or
woodsheds as hiding places, hoping that the soldiers would not
search a Serbian home.
</P>
<P>
   Martinovic began helping his next-door neighbors by knocking
down a part of the stone wall between their houses, enabling the
Buqajes to sneak back in and out of their home at times without
detection from the street.
</P>
<P>
   While providing the shed, Martinovic had apologized for not
being able to take Buqaj and his wife into the comfort of his
house, saying that they might be seen by the Serb paramilitary,
``and if they saw you, they would kill you,'' Buqaj recounted.
</P>
<P>
   In a war that pitted neighbor against neighbor, both Albanians
and Serbs found their character tested. And the Schindlers were not
alone in crossing ethnic divides. So, too, were Albanians who
cooperated with the Serbian regime. Their ethnic brothers have a
nickname for them, too: ``Shiptar Te Shitur'' _ ``sellouts,''
roughly translated.
</P>
<P>
   These are the ethnic Albanians who decided long ago that it was
more profitable to cooperate with, or even assist, Serb
authorities, instead of suffering repression and, later, savage
attacks from Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   In the region surrounding Djakovica, Albanians speak with hatred
of one such family: the clan of Mush Ibrahimi, commonly called
``Mush Jakupi,'' or the children of Mush.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were friendly with the Serbs. Serb police and
paramilitary would hold meetings here,'' said Blerim Saraqini,
gesturing toward the clan's office, next door to Saraqini's cobbler
business.
</P>
<P>
   The family ran an organization called the Popular Party of
Kosovo, once threatening to kill Saraqini if he did not make them a
leather sheath for a knife, Saraqini said.
</P>
<P>
   After the war began, Saraqini and others here said the Mush
Jakupi, who spoke Albanian, lured targeted Albanians into opening
their doors to Serb attackers.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary ``used them. They called out in Albanian, and
when they answered the door, they were killed,'' said Zeja
Bejtullahu, a local resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were mercenaries!'' screamed Linda Nikolici, 26, whose
family's home was burned. ``We all knew all of them. If I saw them
now, I would massacre them, the way they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Albanians were deeply disappointed to learn that some of
their Serb neighbors, people the Albanians thought were their
friends, turned on them in anger over the NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best friend was Serbian, and he threw a grenade into my
house, because I had had a Serb girlfriend,'' said Talat Nuhim, a
resident of Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Blerim Hasi used to share meals regularly with a Serb friend at
a favorite restaurant in Djakovica. The friend, whom Hasi called by
the nickname of Qile, burned the restaurant himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shot at me five times when I tried to stop the fire,'' Hasi
said, shaking his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these Serbs, along with their ethnic Albanian
sympathizers, are believed to have fled Kosovo, fearing retribution
by the Kosovo Liberation Army and civilian Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The rogue army, which under the peace agreement is not
technically supposed to be operating as an army, has been rounding
up low-level Albanian co-conspirators for questioning, a KLA
soldier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're investigating'' the Mush Jakupi and others, added KLA
vice commander Mehmetali Perolli. Most people here believe the clan
has fled to Montenegro or upper Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Schindlers are welcome here now, but many of them,
fearing an unpredictable future, have also fled from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Prizren, the Bruti family had rented office space
from Serbs who lived upstairs. When the Serb soldiers were coming,
the Serbian family, headed by a man the Bruti family would identify
only as Stanislav, gave them advance warning.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified, the Brutis considered running to Albania. Then
Stanislav's wife interrupted: ``Why are you going to Albania? Stay
here and come in our home,'' recounted Afradita Bruti, 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Brutis stayed, but when the war ended, Stanislav and his
family chose to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We begged them to stay. We said, `You can come in our house
and be protected by us. We Albanians are not going to touch you if
you didn't do anything harmful,' '' Bruti said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb family fled during the Serb military pullout,
saying their knowledge that massacres were taking place left them
vulnerable to retaliatory attacks. ``I have no face to stay here
anymore,'' Bruti recounted Stanislav telling him. ``I know what the
Serb soldiers are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanians worry about the fate of the Schindlers. Kosovar Serbs
are not well-liked in upper Serbia, where they are known as
``Albanian Serbs.'' Bruti and others are concerned that the people
who helped them will not find a truly safe home anywhere in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even Martinovic, who had offered his woodshed to save his
neighbors, could not be persuaded to stay, Buqaj said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Martinovic's sons had run a local restaurant and was
well-regarded by Albanians, but the other son had joined the
paramilitary, Buqaj said, presumably joining in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, a sad Martinovic met Buqaj and turned over the keys
to his house. Buqaj sought to return his neighbor's brave favor to
him, and offered his own home as shelter for Martinovic.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb man declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please take my keys. If your daughter returns, she can stay in
my house,'' Buqaj recalled Martinovic as insisting. ``I can't be
here anymore.''

INDONESIA'S MUSLIMS PAVE NEW PATHS IN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A crescent moon is rising over the world's
largest Muslim nation, a country that long has prided itself on
being a staunchly secular state. As results trickle in from its
first democratic elections since 1955, a stealth winner has
emerged: Muslim power.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of the 48 parties that contested the
historic June 7 elections are Muslim-based, a dramatic flowering
after decades of official suppression of Islam in politics. Several
of the parties are doing better than expected in partial returns.
Since neither of the leading secular parties will win a majority in
parliament, Muslim parties could be instrumental in deciding the
next president of the world's fourth-most-populous country.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight percent of Indonesia's 210 million citizens are
Muslim, yet for decades religion was excluded from politics and the
majority was sidelined in the corridors of military and economic
power, where Christians and ethnic Chinese long have held key
posts. That has been slowly changing this decade, but only in the
past year have grass-roots Islamic parties emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The rising tide of Muslim political power, and morality, could
challenge the foundations of this inclusive and tolerant nation, a
place where minidresses are more often seen on the capital's
streets than Muslim headscarves, where many Muslims drink and smoke
freely, and where a woman is the front-running presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A new breed of Indonesian politicians is invoking Muslim values
as an antidote to dirty politics, and Islamic unity as the means to
claim a larger piece of the pie for a long-disadvantaged majority.
They want more Muslims in top government posts, affirmative action
for Muslim businesses, more social safety nets, and tough
anticorruption laws. It remains to be seen whether any of the new
parties would want to impose a stricter view of religion or Islamic
law on the diverse population, or whether the largely liberal
public would accept that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muslim people in Indonesia need to be a united power, not
separated,'' said Djauhuri, 38, a Koran teacher who like many
Indonesians uses only one name. As his female students at Jakarta's
Al-Azhar mosque sang Koranic verses, Djauhuri reflected on the fact
that ``some people fear the power of Muslims, but they shouldn't.
True Muslims are for the interests of all people.''
</P>
<P>
   He also added that although he voted for a Muslim party, he _
like dozens of others interviewed _ does not want an Islamic state.
``Let there be no compulsion in religion,'' he said, quoting the
Koran.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of Islamic parties ``is a backlash'' against
the sidelining of Muslims in Indonesia, ``but a backlash should not
be in the form of another discrimination,'' said Abdurrahman Wahid,
a cleric and former head of perhaps the world's largest Muslim
organization, the 35-million-strong Nahdlatul Ulama, or Awakening
of the Learned.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid is now the presidential candidate for the most popular new
Muslim-based party, the National Awakening Party, which was running
second with 19 percent of the vote in the official tally Sunday. He
also leads Indonesia's ``traditionalist'' strand of Islam, which is
inclusive, tolerant, and secular in its political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that a few groups that have surfaced in the past
year _ such as the militant youth group Preparing for Islamic
Martyrdom _ might try to reverse Indonesia's secular traditions if
given the chance. ``They're everywhere in the Islamic world,'' he
said of the new zealots. ``But they don't have the votes here'' in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Alwi Shihab, deputy chairman of Wahid's party and a visiting
professor at Harvard Divinity School who is on leave to run for
parliament, said his party ``would like to see Islam as a cultural
and moral force, not as a political force. . . . Political Islam
could lead you to radicalism, to establishing an Islamic state, and
that is contradictory to our national ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the birth of new Muslim parties cannot help but reshape
Indonesian politics. On one side are nationalists and secularists,
led by the reformist party of Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of
the country's founding president Sukarno, and Wahid's Muslim-based
but inclusive party. On the other side is Golkar, the secular party
of Suharto, the ousted autocratic president. In recent years,
Muslim-trained leaders have taken the helm of the party, and in
this campaign Golkar tried to court the Muslim vote.
</P>
<P>
   Most Muslim parties espouse a reformist agenda, which would ally
them with Megawati and Wahid. But many conservatives oppose a woman
president and fear her party for its prominent Christian
leadership, even though Megawati is Muslim. In late May, eight
Muslim parties announced a deal to share votes to boost their
parliamentary seats. And the week before the election, two Muslim
associations ordered followers to vote for Muslim parties only,
while some clerics issued ``fatwahs,'' or religious edicts against
voting for secularists.
</P>
<P>
   The fatwahs seem to have had little effect, however. Megawati's
and Wahid's parties led in the official count Saturday, with a
combined 56 percent of the vote. (In an unofficial faster count,
the two parties had garnered just 47 percent of the vote as of
Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   But since the National Assembly, not the public, will choose the
next president, the Islamic bloc in parliament conceivably could
thwart the country's most popular politician from getting the top
job.
</P>
<P>
   It is a striking change of fortune for Islam in a country whose
national ideology all but forbade a single-religion state, and
where for decades, Muslim political groups were banned and
religious leaders muzzled. Initially, they were seen as a menace to
unity in the diverse, multireligious nation; later, they were a
threat to the unquestioned leadership of its autocratic president.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants make up 6 percent of the population, Catholics 3
percent, Hindus 2 percent, and Buddhists 1 percent, according to
government figures.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, himself a Muslim, cultivated a Christian leadership in
the armed forces and bestowed valuable deals on ethnic Chinese
businessmen-friends, feeding a divide-and-conquer culture that
spared him strong Muslim rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The Suharto era ended amid violent protests last year, and the
last 13 months have seen a renaissance of Muslim social and
political groups, underlining what many here say is a widespread
hunger for morality in government after decades of corruption,
cronyism, and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts worry that the rise of Islam in politics could
exacerbate Christian-Muslim violence that has claimed hundreds of
lives this year.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, the battle for dominance may not be among
different religions, but within Islam itself. With an array of
leaders, the lines have been drawn between three camps: a liberal,
inclusive philosophy espoused by Wahid, a ``modernist'' Muslim
movement that is more conservative and rising in popularity, and
fringe groups that have yet to define their agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Islam never has been a firebrand in Indonesia. It came
peacefully to the archipelago with Arab traders 1,000 years ago,
and over the centuries, it blended with Hinduism and indigenous
faiths. Sufi clerics preached a mystical and eclectic form of
worship, and unlike in the Arab world, Turkey, and India, there
were no wars to convert the masses.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the new, missionary-oriented parties?
</P>
<P>
   Indra Gunawan, 25, is a leader of the Justice Party, and he and
his missionary colleagues observe stricter codes for everyday
behavior than most here: They greet women with a prayer-like salute
rather than a handshake, they don't drink alcohol, and they don't
smoke. But Gunawan says his party does not want to establish an
Islamic state or impose rules that would, for example, force women
to wear jilbabs, or Islamic headscarves, which were illegal in
schools and government offices until around 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the values of Islam, which are universal,'' he said.
``We want something between a secular and relgious state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Sukatmajaya, secretary general of the Gerakan Pemuda
Islam, or Islamic Youth Movement, agrees that ``of course we don't
want Pakistan or Iran.'' The rise of Islamic politics, he says, is
to counter decades of ineffectual leadership by Islamic
``yes-men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Indonesians to follow the values of Islam, but
whatever we do must be in the context of our culture,'' he said.

TREATMENT HELPS SNORERS SNOOZE

 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Once or twice a week, Robert D'Amore recalls, the woman in his
life would wake him up in the middle of the night, complain about
his snoring, and ask him to sleep somewhere else. Anywhere else,
just as long as it was out of earshot. Despite this, D'Amore says,
he didn't fully appreciate how loud and obnoxious his snoring
really was. Then, one night, she left a tape recorder running and
played it back to him the next day.
</P>
<P>
   That did the trick. ``It was horrible,'' the 31-year-old man
acknowledges. ``I don't know how I was able to sleep through that
racket.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that about 40 million Americans are afflicted
with habitual snoring, it's a wonder that so many of us manage to
maintain relationships and get a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   According to medical studies, snoring affects about 20 percent
of the general population, and about 60 percent of men over 40.
While 57 percent of men in one study reported that their wives
snored, 85 percent of women polled said that their husbands did.
``Impaired social relationships'' is among the major problems
associated with loud snoring, according to the American Sleep
Disorders Association.
</P>
<P>
   In its extreme form, snoring can threaten the most solid of
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Linda Greenblatt, for instance, have been married for
33 years, peacefully sharing a bedroom for most of them. But a few
years ago, Martin Greenblatt's snoring escalated from a relatively
subdued hum to a rasping, annoying buzz.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fairly common later-in-life male development, but one
that can seriously affect spousal relations. ``When your partner
can't sleep because you're sawing wood,'' says Martin, 59, a Boston
lawyer, ``she can build up a pretty good head of resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a candidate for sainthood nor a silent sufferer,''
says Linda Greenblatt. ``He was so loud I could hear him through
earplugs, and I'd wake up and walk to another bedroom. I was
walking around like a zombie and really angry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Brody's wife, Susan, wasn't happy about his snoring,
either. Brody, 45, has had a serious snoring problem since his
mid-20s. ``I broke my nose four times when I was a kid,'' he says,
``and again when I was in the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in recent years, the Andover man reports, his snoring
got so bad his wife resorted to extreme measures. ``I was banished
from the bedchamber and had to sleep in a bunk bed in my son's
room,'' says Brody. ``It was the room farthest from the master
bedroom, but she says she could still hear me.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, problem snorers such as D'Amore, Greenblatt, and
Brody had only a few treatment options, all involving considerable
pain or discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Snoring results from a narrowing of the airway at the back of
the throat because of muscle relaxation during sleep. As air is
forced through the narrow passageway it causes excess soft palate
tissue to vibrate, producing sounds ranging from a series of low
snorts to what can resemble a high-powered chain saw badly in need
of oiling.
</P>
<P>
   Laser surgery to the palate can be effective in reducing
habitual snoring but causes swelling and lingering post-operative
pain. It has mostly been used to treat extreme cases of obstructive
sleep apnea syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition in
which breathing is repeatedly interrupted for 10 seconds or more
during sleep. Nonsurgical options include nasal dilators, such as
adhesive tape that widens the nostrils to improve airflow, and oral
appliances that adjust the position of the jaw or tongue to prevent
closing of the airway.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering how awful his snoring was, D'Amore says, he
went to his primary care physician and asked to be fitted with a
jaw retainer. However, the doctor suggested instead that he look
into Somnoplasty, an effective and relatively painless new snoring
treatment that uses radio-frequency energy to shrink soft palate
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Past procedures involved shortening or cutting into the
palate, but Somnoplasty, or radio frequency palate ablation, is
about as minimal as a surgical procedure can be and it doesn't
really hurt,'' says Dr. Gregory Randolph of the Massachusetts Eye
and Ear Infirmary, the first surgeon to perform the procedure in
the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by Somnus Medical Technologies, a California company
specializing in treatments for upper airway disorders, Somnoplasty
involves inserting a needle into the palate and delivering
controlled thermal energy to targeted areas with a hand-held
instrument, reducing tissue volume, and stiffening soft tissue.
``Somnoplasty causes scarring that makes the tissue tighter and
less inclined to vibrate,'' Randolph says.
</P>
<P>
   An outpatient procedure, Somnoplasty requires only a local
anesthetic and a treatment takes about a half-hour. ``There's a
little swelling in the throat for a day or so,'' says Dr. Randolph,
``but no pain.''
</P>
<P>
   It typically takes three to five Somnoplasty treatments to
eliminate snoring, or reduce it to a minimum, he says, and most
patients are willing to stay the course. ``The other procedures
were so painful that it was very hard to get patients to submit to
such serial treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Somnoplasty doesn't come cheap. Randolph and the other members
of his surgical team, Dr. Nicholas Busaba and Dr. Richard Fabian,
charge $1,800 for the first treatment. Subsequent treatments are
$250 each.
</P>
<P>
   Because Somnoplasty is a new procedure, approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration less than two years ago, it is not covered
by most insurance plans. However, a pretreatment examination to
determine that snoring is the problem and not a symptom of some
other condition, such as obstricted sleep apnea, usually is covered
by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amore considers himself one lucky snorer. After his first
treatment, the volume of his snoring dropped significantly. ``I was
allowed back in the bedroom,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A second treatment he had recently, D'Amore says, has probably
cured him. ``I still snore a little bit, but I think it's going to
go away,'' he says. Although D'Amore didn't realize it at the time,
his loud snoring was affecting the quality of his own sleep almost
as much as that of his friend. ``Now I wake up feeling refreshed,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Brody and Greenblatt, who have also been treated by Randolph,
each report noticeable improvements. But neither is cured yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in the bottom bunk in my son's room,'' says Brody,
``but he tells me I sound a lot better.'' He thinks it will
probably take three or more treatments to bring his snoring to
acceptable levels. ``My wife is very encouraging,'' Brody says.
``She wants this to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Greenblatt has had two treatments. ``It's an incremental
thing,'' he says, ``and the second treatment definitely moved the
ball down the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He isn't cured,'' says Linda Greenblatt. ``He still snores and
I'm still wearing earplugs, but now I'm not sleeping in another
room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marriage has lasted 33 years and it will probably survive
a little bit longer,'' says Martin Greenblatt, who plans to have
another treatment. ``But laugh and the world laughs with you. Snore
and you sleep alone.''

WHAT GORE NEEDS ISN'T STAGE-MANAGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Privately, Al Gore is live wire.
</P>
<P>
   Second Lady Tipper Gore says so _ and Tipper is an honorable
woman. US Representative Martin Meehan says so. And Meehan is a
right honorable gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton says so and . . . well, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   All the vice president needs to do, or so the conventional
wisdom goes, is loosen up. Doff the coat. Take off the tie.
Unbutton the collar. Show people the real Al.
</P>
<P>
   But as he formally announces for the office he first sought in
1988, there's a bigger question about Gore: Why the disparity
between his regular-guy private self and his cautious, formal,
skittish public persona in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question more pressing after last week's campaign
kickoff. Texas Governor George W. Bush swept through New Hampshire
Monday in a whirl of grins and mischief, heightening the contrast
with poor plodding Gore, who came to Manchester Thursday to make
his own candidacy official.
</P>
<P>
   There, Gore led a tightly scripted public forum that campaign
consultant Bob Squier said was designed to showcase his skills in a
give-and-take situation, but which actually seemed like a seminar
on political cures for insomnia. (A sample of the folksy, relaxed
Gore: ``Now I want to engage in a dialogue with you about some of
the issues I have just discussed.'')
</P>
<P>
   Even at his best _ and this was it, Squier said _ Gore talks to
voters as though he were lecturing a class of second-graders about
crosswalk safety.
</P>
<P>
   That's led Gore supporters to hope 2000 will be the year of geek
chic. ``As far as him being a stiff, I think the country is
probably ready for someone who is a little more boring than Clinton
was,'' Meehan say hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But why does a man drop a dense screen over his true
self in public? There are only three likely reasons _ and two bode
ill for Gore's presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   First, and most innocuous, is the institutional explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has been constrained as vice president,'' said US
Senator John Kerry. ``That requires a supporting role, and I think
he is breaking out of that now.'' Except that Gore was every bit as
wary and constrained before he became VP.
</P>
<P>
   The second is that Gore may not trust his political instincts.
And with good reason. Hailed as the great Southern hope in 1988,
Gore's campaign quickly became a disaster. The candidate couldn't
decide where to stand and fight _ and on Super Tuesday Michael
Dukakis boxed his ears and battered his premise by beating Gore in
both Florida and Texas, before ending the threat by thumping Gore
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore's gaffes and embarrassments are
well-known. There's his appropriation of his sister's death from
cancer in the administration's battle against tobacco _ though he
himself kept accepting contributions from tobacco interests for six
years after her death. And his pettifogging defense of his
in-office fund raising calls on the grounds that no ``controlling
legal authority'' _ vis-a-vis, a judge _ had ruled on exactly how
the law applied. And his 1997 toasting of then-Chinese Prime
Minister Li Peng, who oversaw the Tiananmen Square massacre.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the silly stuff. His quarter-baked claim that he
and Tipper were the models for Oliver and Jenny in ``Love Story''
and his assertion that he invented the Internet speak of poor
instincts, an odd self-image, and a clumsy tongue.
</P>
<P>
   But the more troubling explanation is this: The vice president
seems afraid or unwilling to engage in a forthright process of
political argument. Call it algoraphobia.
</P>
<P>
   One illustration comes in a moment Gore's own supporters still
point to as a seminal one for the VP: his 1993 debate about the
North American Free Trade Agreement with Texas businessman Ross
Perot. NAFTA is a complex issue, with different results for
different workers. Better-educated workers have done well, but some
unskilled workers have certainly paid a price competing against
lower-wage foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than debate the real issues, Gore preferred to skewer
Perot. First he held up pictures of Reed Smoot and Willis Hawley,
the federal lawmakers whose high tariffs help exacerbate the Great
Depression, as though the issues were remotely comparable.
</P>
<P>
   Then he attacked the Texas billionaire because Perot's son had
business interests shipping goods from Mexico into the United
States through a duty-free zone at Forth Worth's Alliance Airport.
His charge: Perot opposed NAFTA to preserve a special advantage for
his family, all while lecturing Perot that ``the politics of
negativism and fear only go so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, addressing the NAACP, Gore used the same sort of
tactic, saying of affirmative action opponents: ``They use their
colorblind the way duck hunters use a duck blind _ they hide behind
it and hope the ducks won't notice.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president found a different way to avoid a very real
issue when he came to Charlestown High School in mid-May. There,
Gore called for ``revolutionary change'' in public education, but
rejected the ``risky'' notion of school vouchers. Everyone, Gore
said, agreed those were a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   That, as Clinton might say, depends on what you mean by
everyone. The teachers unions do. So do liberals and many
Democrats. But vouchers are steadily winning converts, not only
among Republicans, but also among black voters _ a key Democratic
constituency _ whose children are often trapped in underperforming
urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, however, that's been the nature of Gore's
argumentation: ad hominem attacks, imputations of ill will to
opponents, or sweeping statements that paper over legitimate public
policy disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of Gore's reluctance to confront controversey
frontally has been his penchant for micro-politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been Clinton's partner in two national campaigns. Their
1992 campaign against Republican President George Bush was an
intellectually sophisticated effort at public persuasion, with
reasonably detailed proposals on everything from welfare to health
care to fiscal policy _ including, even, plans for a tax hike on
higher earners.
</P>
<P>
   But when the duo, bruised by their over-reaching on health care,
and battered by the Republican congressional victory in 1994, ran
for re-election in 1996, they campaigned on issues so small as to
be almost beneath the political radar: school uniforms, teen
curfews, stepped-up anti-truancy efforts, 911 for non-emergency
calls, cellular phones for crime-watch volunteers, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   As he begins his own quest for the presidency, Gore has two
models to choose from. So far, the results aren't encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some of the issues Gore has highlighted in the last
half year: larger print on drug labels, an airline passenger bill
of rights, urban sprawl, tax breaks to help firms entice workers to
use public transit, telephone traffic reports, annual
student-teacher-parent conferences, and grants to promote community
inclusion in planning new schools.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire last week, Gore's focus was just as small.
</P>
<P>
   There, he laid out five economic proposals that would guide his
administration: continued economic growth (certainly a consummation
devoutly to be wished, but can it truly be called a proposal?), tax
cuts to promote research and development, investment in information
technology, increased free trade, and programs to help workers stay
current with technology.
</P>
<P>
   Subsidiary ideas: balance the budget, eliminate waste and
bureaucratic excess, defend the Internet from foreign tariffs, and
create educational savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   None of those, of course, would set Gore more than a half-inch
apart from a mainstream Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's aped the Clinton approach on micro-issues,'' laments one
veteran of several presidential campaigns. ``It's the Dick Morris
school of small-issue politics _ and it comes at a time when when
the public may be ready for a politician who addresses big
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one big-name national strategist who agrees with
that assessment is none other than Morris himself.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Morris is renouncing micro-politics.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who guided Clinton's 1996 re-election strategy
doesn't think that approach will necessary work when a
non-incumbent seeks the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is trying to run for election using tactics more
appropriate for a race for re-election: the announcement of grants,
the initiatives from the White House,'' Morris said. ``It is kind
of a Rose Garden strategy _ but it is not his Rose Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   So what would Morris recommend? ``A presidential candidate who
is not president needs to leave the White House and campaign with
new ideas that are bolder and more far-reaching than those of the
current administration,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As Al Gore seeks the presidency in his own right, showing that
kind of intellectual courage would say more about his authenticity
than a dozen stage-managed attempts at spontaneity.

 KASICH PLUGS AWAY, WAITS FOR CANDIDACY TO CATCH FIRE
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa _ John Kasich is standing alone in the center
of the wood-paneled VFW here, trying to excite the 80 or so members
of the Pachyderm Club intent on eating their tuna-egg salad on
white bread.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich waves his arms, he refers to his audience as ``you
guys,'' he disagrees with their questions, and he waits for
lightning to strike.
</P>
<P>
   This is the strategy behind the Ohio congressman's campaign for
president: If he plugs away long enough, if he talks to enough
voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, he might _ with a bolt of luck _
become the first sitting member of the House elected president
since James Garfield in 1880.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been struck by lightning,'' says Kasich, the
chairman of the House Budget Committee, during the hour's drive
from Des Moines. ``The key is to be out in the field when the storm
comes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the hallmark of Kasich's political career has been to
do what others said he could not. He was just 26 when he upset an
incumbent Democrat for the Ohio state Senate, surprising all the
political pros there. When he was 30, he became the only GOP
challenger to unseat a Democratic incumbent from Congress that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich (rhymes with basic) has been told so many times that he
will fail that he relishes proving people wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get to be chairman of the Budget Committee, I
couldn't balance the budget, I couldn't cut taxes, I couldn't get
elected to Congress, I couldn't kill the B-2, I couldn't reform the
Pentagon, I couldn't begin to impact corporate welfare,'' he says,
running through the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things,'' he continues, mimicking his
detractors. ``You go out and you try to engage in running for
president, form your exploratory committee _ that will fall on its
face, you don't have the discipline, you won't raise the money, you
won't last, you won't be focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he is running for president at the very bottom of a
crowded field. Recent polls put his standing at about 1 to 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But at age 47, Kasich is at a turning point. Term limits will
force him to give up his Budget Committee chairmanship at the end
of this session of Congress. He has served in the House for close
to 18 years, successfully agitating for a balanced budget and the
end of the annual deficit.
</P>
<P>
   And by the end of June, Kasich may well shift $1.4 million from
his House reelection account into his presidential coffers,
signaling that he doesn't intend to run for reelection, ending his
congressional career.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, however, will not say whether he plans to give up his
House seat or run for reelection while pursuing the Republican
nomination for president. If he says he's leaving the House, he
would become a lame duck; if he says he is seeking reelection, it
would undercut the seriousness of his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be stupid to tell people what I was going to do,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   His style is bold and brash and slightly frenetic. He gets
excited by ideas, particularly his own. When he talks, it is
rapid-fire, as if his mouth can't keep up with everything that's
rocketing through his brain. And he has long shown a willingness to
challenge Republican Party dogma.
</P>
<P>
   To the chagrin of many of his GOP colleagues, he is vehemently
opposed to ``corporate welfare'' subsidies from the government. He
led the fight to cap production of the B-2 bomber at 20 jets, down
from a proposed fleet of 132. He cut a $50 million annual program
to subsidize the timber industry for road construction in national
forests, upsetting lawmakers from the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   He opposes ethanol subsidies, which are dear to Iowa corn
farmers. He would like to abolish the Overseas Private Investment
Corp., which helps US companies sell products overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer in cutting that which doesn't work,'' he says.
If he had his way, he would kill the Energy, Education, and
Commerce departments, as well as federal funding for the arts,
federal insurance programs for businesses, and federal grants for
businesses' technology research.
</P>
<P>
   He does believe in providing federal dollars for school choice
programs, reorganizing Social Security in order to save it, and
allowing religious nonprofit organizations to have access to the
same federal grants as secular institutions.
</P>
<P>
   He'd also like to institute a ``loser pays'' requirement in the
legal system.
</P>
<P>
   As he paces around the linoleum floor of the VFW in central
Iowa, he hopscotches from one issue to another, depending on what
pops into his head and what this Republican lunch club asks.
</P>
<P>
   Young people, he says, ``think there's a better chance of a UFO
landing on the parking lot out there than getting a Social Security
check in the mail.'' And with a bit of self-mocking showmanship, he
says, ``I came out with a plan _ ta da!''
</P>
<P>
   He urges the crowd to listen carefully to the candidates and pay
attention to what each would do to tackle the thorny problems of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's have a big debate about Social Security, let's have a
big debate about how we're going to fix health care in America,''
Kasich says. ``Let's go to the convention; let's spill out into the
streets and slug one another out there and raise Cain and
regenerate our party.''
</P>
<P>
   This exuberance attracts people to Kasich. It also leads many to
suggest that he is too young to become president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told John Kennedy that,'' replies Kasich, without a trace
of humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look young, and my energy level is unusual in
politics,'' he says. ``Most people move at the speed of dinosaurs
and glaciers. They see somebody that moves faster than that, it
really throws them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kasich is older than either President Kennedy or
President Clinton when each ran for the highest office in the land.
He believes he has more experience than many who became president _
such as Jimmy Carter _ and some who are running for president now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've accomplished things that people have tried for a
generation,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At the Phillips 66 station on the way to Marshalltown, Kasich
wanders the aisles, picking up two packs of Twizzlers and a cup of
coffee. He admits that he has allowed himself to daydream about a
Kasich presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the music at state dinners would probably take a
drastic turn, he agrees with a laugh. His favorite band is
Porcupine Tree, though he also likes Madonna and Pearl Jam. He once
told Vaclav Havel, the president of Czechoslovakia, to pick up the
Verve (``Urban Hymns'') and the Radioheads (``OK Computer'').
</P>
<P>
   But more seriously, a President Kasich ``wouldn't be somebody
who just fell off the turnip truck on the way to Washington,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   If he were elected, he says, he would be ``somebody who knew
precisely what he wanted to accomplish, and at the same time knew
how to do it. You could have such sweeping change, you would have
such a breath of fresh air, you would actually be able to get
things done, it would restore some hope in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, John Kasich, the son of a mailman in
Pennsylvania, knows that for all the photo-ops of him bowling in
Iowa and fly-fishing in New Hampshire, and for all the coffees in
living rooms and VFW halls, political fame eludes him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is my message getting out yet? No,'' he admits with a
philosophical shrug. ``I have not had my moment yet, and I don't
know if it will come.''

GRUDEN OF THE OAKLAND RAIDERS FLEXES HIS CLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The group of NFL coach/emperors is a small
one, and a well-aged one at that. After all, the twin skills of
wisdom and leverage take time to nurture and muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of makes you wonder how Jon Gruden did it so quickly,
especially where he does it, and for whom.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden just finished his fifth or sixth or seventh minicamp
(hey, who counts?) as the head coach of the Oakland Raiders this
past weekend, and while minicamps are by and large exercises in
glamorless living, they also provide occasional clues to a team's
direction, even if, in some cases, the direction is only circular.
</P>
<P>
   In Gruden's case, there were two relatively little noted but
interesting decisions, and they both involved players who didn't
fit into the grand plan.
</P>
<P>
   On successive days, he released backup quarterback Heath Shuler,
who had been signed in the offseason as an intriguing additive to
Rich Gannon, and Harvey Williams, the running back turned tight end
turned running back turned . . . well, the Raiders really never
knew what to do with him now, did they?
</P>
<P>
   These seem like such small things (except, of course, to the
freshly unemployed), but when you add them to the release of Jeff
George and the signing of Darrien Gordon (ergo, the release of
Desmond Howard), you get the unmistakable feeling that Gruden is
truly the master of his own destiny, and at a staggeringly young
age, too.
</P>
<P>
   Before you get your spines up about what seems like another
swipe at Gruden's birth certificate, we mention it only to point
out how quickly he has come to his present position, and how
quickly he convinced Al Davis to let him get there.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden is 36, which you know. He has been a salaried, real
assistant or head coach in the NFL for only six years. His first
Raider team started 6-2 and ended 8-8. He is not, therefore,
overburdened by resume.
</P>
<P>
   Compare this to the other nine NFL coaches who also have their
owners' ears and wallets. St. Louis' Dick Vermeil is 62, and has 15
years' NFL experience. New Orleans' Mike Ditka is 59, with 26 years
on the job. Carolina's George Seifert is 59, with 18 years. Bill
Parcells of the New York Jets is 58, with 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Jimmy Johnson is 56, with eight years. Dan Reeves of
Atlanta is 55, but with 29 years on the job. Seattle's Mike
Holmgren is 51, with 14 years. Dennis Green of Minnesota is 50,
with 11 years. Mike Shanahan of Denver is 47, but with 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Six of those nine (Ditka, Seifert, Parcells, Johnson, Holmgren
and Shanahan) have Super Bowl rings as a head coach. Two others
(Vermeil and Reeves) have been to the big show. Against all that,
Gruden seems as shiny and new as the day he was hired.
</P>
<P>
   But power is power, no matter when you get it, and in the
context of football in the hierarchy-sensitive NFL, power is good.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden's power is, of course, conditional, which is less than
can be said for most of the other men on the list. He could not,
for example, sign Billy Crystal to play strong safety without
having an extraordinarily good explanation for The Al, unlike
Parcells, Vermeil, Holmgren or Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Gruden has to have a good explanation, the fact is
that he has dismissed the two biggest signings the Raiders have
made since returning to Oakland, and we know they are the biggest
because Al His Own Self was there at the press conference for
George and signed Howard himself.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing Shuler didn't have the same impact, but it was an
indication that Gruden can call mulligans on himself, which almost
no other coach on any level dares do. And Williams' dismissal was
an admission that Gruden had no more idea how to utilize him than
Joe Bugel did, or Mike White before him. Indeed, Gruden used
Williams less than either of his predecessors because, at least in
his own estimation, Williams wasn't a good enough running back or
tight end for Gruden's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Power of this sort can be transitory, but it usually isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Green, for example, ripped his owners in a book after years of
underachievement and off-field rumors and charges, and held his job
long enough for Randy Moss and Randall Cunningham to cure
everyone's ills. Vermeil was gripped by the angst of his Rams'
horrors, but was talked off the retirement ledge. Parcells had a
heart problem, but no such problem getting his ventricles cleared
for another job.
</P>
<P>
   In short, once you get this kind of hammer, you have to do an
awful lot to lose it. At least in most cases, anyway. It is always
dangerous to underestimate the length of Al Davis' reach.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, it is equally dangerous to underestimate the
length of Jon Gruden's sleeve. The last Raider coach to win even
this much control was John Madden. You'll have to do the rest of
the math yourselves.

FOR ELDERS ON THE ROAD, THE BEST ADVICE IS `BE PREPARED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margaret Treseler was only a day into her long-planned vacation
on Spain's Costa del Sol last March when she began feeling muscle
aches all over her body. An experienced traveler, the 73-year-old
Boston woman knew it was something beyond jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   A hotel doctor gave her a salve. But the achiness didn't
subside, and three hours later, another physician who answered her
distress call suggested a shot of cortisone for the pain. At that
point, Treseler decided to go to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the language barrier, I waited two hours in the
emergency room,'' she said. ``But once they saw me, they started
paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Treseler was having a heart attack _ her second one.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing 12 days were a nightmare for Treseler and her eight
children back home. ``It was terrifically frightening,'' she says.
``I would ask the cardiologist `What is it? How bad is it?' and he
would just point to his chest and shake his head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until my brother and sister got over there, we didn't know how
bad off she was,'' adds John Treseler, a son who tried to
coordinate the situation from his home in Baltimore. ``That was our
biggest frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Treseler's ordeal had a happy ending: she had
open-heart surgery back in Boston that has put her well on the road
to recovery. But it serves as a warning to the growing number of
adventurous elders embarking on far-flung trips they have long
dreamt of and saved for. ``These days you find a lot of people in
their 80s and beyond out there doing whatever they have to do to
see the sights,'' says Walter Sanders, a retired TV newsman and
frequent globe-trotter who is president of the Massachusetts
chapter of the American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Elders travel more often and stay away longer than their
under-50 counterparts, according to a 1995 survey by the magazine
Modern Maturity. Two-thirds classify themselves as ``adventurous''
or ``experimental'' tourists who frequently scout out new
destinations. A quarter-million will sign up this year for one of
the 12,300 Elderhostel educational programs held all over the
planet, on everything from Maori culture and Elizabethan theater to
Viking shipbuilders and choral singing. Travel agencies that
specialize in seniors are thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more older travelers, and they're going on more
extensive trips,'' reports Alicia Gallagher, who coordinates a
travel clinic, which focuses on infectious diseases, at Lahey
Clinic in Burlington, Mass. ``Older people are healthier now, and
that makes them more adventuresome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the ability we now have to extend life with specific
medications, people are able to be more active,'' agrees Dr. Paul
Mendis, medical director for Harvard Pilgrim's First Seniority HMO,
which serves about 70,000 seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``And with families scattered all across the country, there's
more incentive for elders to travel to see their grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, travel is arduous for anyone, full of unaccustomed
stress and temptations to overdo things. Elders are likely to have
chronic diseases, both recognized and undiagnosed, that can flare
up under the travails of travel. Even ordinary tourist curses, such
as jet lag and travelers' diarrhea, can escalate into serious
problems for elders.
</P>
<P>
   Little attention has been paid so far to the particular problems
of older travelers. There is little systematic advice to tap into,
virtually no studies on the issues facing older travelers, and few
organizations or Internet sites targeted specifically to them. One
exception is a useful website run by the US State Department at
http://travel.state.gov/olderamericans.html, which is accessible
through many libraries for those without home computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the general paucity of information, with a little
foresight, planning, and common sense, older travelers can lower
their risk of vacation-spoiling (or life-threatening) health
problems and increase their chances of coping successfully if a
medical crisis does arise far from home.
</P>
<P>
   The to-do list should lead off with a review of health insurance
coverage and limits. Regular Medicare, the coverage on which most
Americans over 65 rely, is good throughout the United States. But
don't count on it to cover anything beyond these borders. Some
``medigap'' or Medicare supplement policies, such as Medex Gold or
Bronz through Massachusetts Blue Cross-Blue Shield, will cover
limited medical expenses in foreign countries; check your policy's
fine print, call the insurer before departure if anything is
unclear, and be prepared to pay for care and medications yourself
and save receipts to get reimbursed later.
</P>
<P>
   Many Medicare beneficiaries should seriously consider buying a
time-limited health insurance policy for the duration of their
trip, say health and travel professionals. The cost will vary by
insurer, coverage limits, and the length of the trip, but it should
be within $100 to $300 for most trips. That could turn out to be a
bargain if a serious problem arises.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: Don't buy a policy with ``preexisting condition''
exclusions, and do seek out a reputable insurer with an established
track record. Depending on your destination, health risk, finances,
and how risk-averse you are, you might consider buying insurance to
cover medical evacuation to a specialized hospital or one back
home. There's also trip-interruption insurance, which refunds the
unused portion of tours cut short by illness.
</P>
<P>
   Elders in Medicare HMOs, such as Secure Horizons, First
Seniority, Fallon's Senior Plan, and HMO Blue, are covered for
emergency or urgent health care in the States or abroad, but not
normally for medical evacuation costs.
</P>
<P>
   In Treseler's case, Tufts Health Plan's Secure Horizons covered
her entire hospital stay in Spain (and an agent persuaded the
hospital by telephone to refund a $2,000 credit card charge it
extracted from Treseler's son). A separate trip insurance policy
paid for Business Class passage home for Treseler and her daughter,
a nurse who had flown to Spain to help her mother.
</P>
<P>
   For domestic travelers, new federal rules make it easier for
``snowbirds'' who spend part of the winter in warmer climes.
Medicare HMOs must now cover emergency and urgent care for up to 12
months' out-of-area stays. Plan managers say they often bend the
rules to include necessary non-urgent care for certain things, such
as monitoring high blood pressure and blood-clotting tendencies _
but they ask subscribers to get prior authorization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very committed to seeing that patients are covered when
they're out of the area and we just don't quibble about it,'' says
Dr. Allen Smith, medical director of Secure Horizons.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs can present a travel problem. The best
strategy is to take an ample supply of all medications to cover the
trip's duration _ in their original containers. But if pills get
lost or run out, it should be possible for your primary care
physician to call in a prescription in another state (except for
narcotic painkillers). It's a different story abroad; you will
probably need a list of the generic names (not the US brand names)
of the drugs you're taking. Carry an explanation from your doctor,
on the physician's letterhead, about why you need the medications.
In some cases, this may be sufficient to get a prescription, but in
others, you'll need to contact a local doctor.
</P>
<P>
   If you have insurance coverage for prescription drugs, be
prepared to pay the local pharmacist and get reimbursed later, so
keep receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Need to carry narcotic painkillers or needles and syringes for
diabetes care? Get a doctor's verifying letter to deal with zealous
officials concerned about illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the pre-departure list: allow four to six weeks to get
vaccinations for destinations where certain diseases are prevalent
_ such as yellow fever in sub-Sarahan Africa, diphtheria in Eastern
Europe, and typhoid fever in many off-the-beaten-track locales in
Latin America, Africa, and India. There's no vaccine against
malaria, but if you're traveling to areas where this mosquito-borne
disease is common, you may want to take anti-malarial drugs, along
with supplies of DEET-containing insect repellent and mosquito
netting.
</P>
<P>
   Those headed for less exotic destinations still should pack a
kit with basic first-aid supplies, analgesics, and sunscreen. And
don't forget anti-diarrhea medications _ Pepto-Bismol (except for
those who shouldn't take aspirin), Kaopectate, and Lomotil or
Immodium AD.
</P>
<P>
   Traveler's diarrhea is the bane of all ages, but for elders a
bout of diarrhea can grow beyond nuisance proportions because of
fluid loss and depletion of blood chemicals called electrolytes,
which are vital for proper nerve conduction and normal heart
rhythm. ``Traveler's diarrhea is one of the biggest risks for
elders,'' says Dr. Winnie Ooi, director of Lahey Clinic's travel
clinic. ``Often patients are on diuretics for blood pressure
problems and they will need to stop the medication for a day or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Elders for whom dehydration may be particularly dangerous _ or
anyone worried about it _ should pack an oral rehydration powder
that can be mixed with (bottled) water to replenish electrolytes
and sugar. It's available from pharmacies as WHO Oral Rehydration
Salt, Pedialyte, Rehydralyte, Ricelyte, and similar forms.
</P>
<P>
   Much traveler's diarrhea can be prevented with simple
precautions (see chart), but many people who know better still get
sick _ often toward the end of a trip. ``We have a theory about
that,'' says Lahey's Alicia Gallagher. ``They feel well, and they
get a little cavalier about precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   When diarrhea strikes, doctors advise staying away from milk and
milk products because of temporary deficiency of the enzyme
lactose, which is necessary to digest milk.
</P>
<P>
   If diarrhea persists beyond 24 hours, despite over-the-counter
medicine, Ooi and Gallagher advise starting an antibiotic, such as
ciprofloxacin, which they often prescribe in advance of a trip.
</P>
<P>
   So you're as prepared as you can be and departure day is
approaching. How can you minimize jet lag, which can hit elders
particularly hard? The Lahey travel experts advise eastbound jet
travelers to go to bed and get up an hour earlier than usual three
days before the flight; then they should set the sleep-wake
schedule back another hour for each of the next two days.
(Westbound travelers do the opposite, retiring an hour later for
three days and rising later.)
</P>
<P>
   On flight day, eat light, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and adjust
your medication schedule with your physician's advice. Take it easy
when you land, and get some bright light exposure and exercise in
the mornings (if you've flown east) or the late afternoon (if
you've flown west).
</P>
<P>
   And if this all sounds so intimidating that you're tempted to
stay at home, take heart from Margaret Treseler's response when
asked if her traveling days are over: ``I hope not,'' she said. ``I
brought up a big family, and these are my fun days!''

REPORTS OF TIGER'S RETURN GREATLY EXAGGERATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does extinction really have to be forever?
</P>
<P>
   The news flash several weeks ago was tantalizing: Australian
Museum director Michael Archer announced that the thylacine, or
Tasmanian tiger _ an exquisite creature presumed extinct for 50
years _ could be ``kick started'' back to life. Archer claimed that
cloning techniques could be applied to newly discovered baby tiger
specimens that had been pickled in alcohol rather than a
formaldehyde solution, which damages genetic material.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Archer, who has a specimen that dates back to 1866,
boasted recently in an interview with the BBC that within 50 years
it will be possible to walk out of a pet store with a Tasmanian
tiger on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites at ABC, CBS, and CNN hyped the news to the hilt. ``I
call this the Jurassic Park syndrome,'' says Michael Hutchins,
director of conservation and science for the American Zoo and
Aquarium Association. The movie, which brought velociraptors and a
brontosaurus back to life on screen, seems to have inspired a
number of assertions that extinct animals really can be cloned
including the woolly mammoth, the giant sloth, and the quagga, a
partially-striped variety of zebra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of any cases in which the cloning process has
brought a species back from the dead,'' Hutchins says.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchins, who helps mastermind endangered species breeding
programs in North American zoos, and happens to be a fan of the
thylacine, understands the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   The thylacine was an animal like no other: It was the largest
marsupial carnivore of modern times and a creature that looked
something like a wolf crossed with a tiger crossed with a kangaroo.
In fact, it is also called the Tasmanian wolf. The muscular animal
had the head of a wolf and its massive jaws could open at a
startling 120 degrees and then close with ferocious force. A fully
grown male would measure 6 feet from nose to tail tip, and weigh as
much as 77 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Thylacines were ruddy brown in coat color with a set of 15 to 20
dark stripes extending from mid-section to tail. The tail was less
like a wolf or tiger's and more like that of a kangaroo. And in
true marsupial fashion, this fearsome hunter had a pouch to carry
its young. Like the Tasmanian devil, another marsupial carnivore,
the pouch of the thylacine faced backwards, presumably to protect
the young while the animal trotted through heavy brush.
</P>
<P>
   Though capable of relentlessly pursuing prey, such as the
kangaroo-like wallaby, the thylacine was driven to extinction
thousands of years ago on mainland Australia with the introduction
of the social dingo dog. But without competition for food from the
dingo on the nearby heart-shaped island state of Tasmania, the shy,
secretive animal held out well into this centry. But a campaign of
slaughter, probably aided by an outbreak of a disease with
distemper-like symptoms, obliterated the population in the early
1900s. The last known living Tasmanian tiger, named Benjamin, died
at the Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to become enchanted with the ghost of this elegant
animal, and though there has never been any hard evidence that
Tasmanian tigers survive today, there are about 10 sightings each
year reported to the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service,
according to research officer Nick Mooney.
</P>
<P>
   It seems everyone wants to believe that the Tasmanian tiger
still lives, or will live in the future. So who wouldn't pounce on
Archer's notion? Well, most people who have looked at the science.
Mooney of the Tasmanian wildlife service says cloning a Tasmanian
tiger will not happen ``in the foreseeable future.'' He also thinks
all of the ``fascination with how technologically clever we are,''
is ``very distracting from grassroots conservation'' efforts in
Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
   And he feels that the wild Tasmanian habitat might be so
degraded by the time the lab work is finished that ``the poor clone
would be condemned to being a captive curiosity, no doubt in the
`Mike Archer wing' of the Syndey Museum or suchlike.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Archer's colleagues from the department of zoology at
the University of Tasmania are more bemused than intrigued.
Professor Craig Johnson, the head of the department, said, ``To be
blunt, with present technology and even within the reasonable
horizons of future developments in molecular techniques, producing
thylacines (or any other extinct species) from tissue preserved in
alcohol is unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   And the university's marsupial expert, Dr. Randy Rose, concurs.
``Mike Archer's claims are a bit far-fetched,'' Rose says, though
he clearly gets a kick out of Archer's showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is conceptually feasible,'' says Eric Overstrom, the man
from Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, who brought
the world its first cloned transgenic goats. ``But there are three
large hurdles.''
</P>
<P>
   The first one is DNA. Overstrom says it is ``unlikely'' that the
DNA samples they could retrieve from these specimens (there are at
least seven in museums around the world) would be ``adequately
intact.'' In fact, like Hutchins, Overstrom says as far as he
knows, no dead animal, no matter how it was preserved, has ever
been cloned.
</P>
<P>
   In cloning, scientists place the nucleus of a cell of one animal
into the egg of another whose genetic material has been removed.
The implanted nucleus, which carries the cell's genetic
information, acts as a blueprint, and the egg divides and grows,
eventually becoming an identical twin of the animal whose cell
nucleus was used to create it.
</P>
<P>
   The second big hurdle involves a host animal. If you scoop out
some nice, intact thylacine genetic material, who will carry the
egg and the fetus to fruition? All of the cloning breakthroughs
have involved domestic, not extinct or rare, animals. Scientists
can harvest sheep or goat eggs for implantation in the wombs of
sheep or goats, but whose egg would be compatible with that of the
thylacine?
</P>
<P>
   Although of very different appearance, the closest species is
the Tasmanian devil, the animal who has inherited the title of
``largest marsupial carnivore.'' The stumpy little spaniel- size
creatures are basically jaws on wheels with a bite estimated to be
three times as strong as that of a pit bull, allowing a ``tassie''
to devour carrion, including cows, from stem to stern.
</P>
<P>
   But would doctored deviled eggs do the trick?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Betsy Dresser of the Audubon Institute and the Audubon Park
and Zoo in New Orleans, doesn't think so. She is no stranger to
cross-species work in assisted reproduction (though not cloning).
She successfully implanted an embryo of the largest forest
antelope, the bongo, into the womb of a much more common species,
the eland in the early 1980s. (She also was responsible for the
world's first test-tube gorilla in 1995.) Dresser's work over the
years has proven how tricky it is to harvest mature, useable eggs
from various species. She suspects that the Tasmanian devil is a
species too different for easy egg transfer. But there may be an
animal out there whose eggs would work for both implantation and
gestation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are probably a long, long way from doing this,'' Dresser
says, ``but I will never say never.''
</P>
<P>
   Overstrom says the part of the cloning work that involves egg
compatibility and then the implantation into the host is not well
understood. Crossing species lines in the cloning process further
muddies the amniotic waters and going from doctored egg to womb to
newborn may, in fact, turn out to be ``species-specific.'' He says,
``We just don't understand the details of that process, going
across species.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to do this work with two related species _ buffalo and
cattle _ have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Third on the list of Overstrom's concerns: money and material.
It takes millions of dollars to fund a cloning project. And it
takes hundreds if not thousands of eggs to get one success.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, everyone, including the scientists, would like to
say that cloning a thylacine is possible. The Tasmanian tiger was a
unique creature that was, unfortunately, trapped and shot by humans
until it disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can acknowledge that, by our own ineptitude, a species was
wiped out,'' Overstrom says. ``And the humanistic part of us is
justified in wanting to correct that mistake.''

SOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY GORE HAS MORE PASSION THAN ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd have to go back to Teddy Roosevelt, who created many of
the national parks, to find a presidential candidate with
environmental credentials like Al Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   While Republican front-runner George W. Bush got his first major
briefing on global warming this spring, Gore's study began in the
1960s at Harvard University, where he learned at the knee of the
man who invented the theory.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made the environment the centerpiece of his 1988 campaign
for president, when rival Jesse Jackson said Gore's dissertations
on the state of Earth made him sound like the ``national chemist.''
But defeat only spurred Gore to write a best-selling book on how to
save the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Vice President Gore is the environmental point man for
the first administration run by men who call themselves
``environmentalists.'' As perhaps the most influential
environmental policy maker in the world, Gore helped push issues
such as global warming to the center stage of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Gore begins his second run for the White House, he faces
a rebellion from the one group whose support many thought he should
have sewn up long ago: environmentalists. Gore's passion for nature
may rival Roosevelt's, but critics say he has too often squandered
opportunities to produce tough policies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Clinton ``talk very big rhetoric and actually propose
very little in terms of action. It's what I would call the school
uniform solution to environmental problems,'' said Phillip E. Clapp
of the National Environmental Trust, one of Gore's most vocal
critics on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   On issues from saving swordfish to logging in national forests,
environmentalists say the administration has chosen modest
compromises over Gore's tough principles.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to global warming, for instance, Gore
``understands the science at a level that few, if any, politicians
ever have. On the other hand, he needs to engage with people on the
policy,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist at the
Environmental Defense Fund in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent environmentalists say privately that Gore can't
take their votes for granted, and nonpartisan groups such as the
Environmental Defense Fund are talking to several candidates in
hopes of building bridges to the eventual winner.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism from environmentalists, in the form of big
newspaper ads and open letters expressing ``disappointment'' in the
vice president, angers Gore loyalists. They say that Gore has had
to contend with a Republican Congress and skeptical White House
advisers who make bold environmental measures difficult. Even so,
they say, the Clinton administration has done more for the
environment than any other in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   They say that today's environmentalists seem to forget the
not-so-distant past when former President Reagan symbolically tore
the solar panels from the White House roof or when Vice President
Dan Quayle tried to relax environmental standards to help industry.
Now, say Gore boosters, environmentalists can always count on a
sympathetic hearing from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``has dramatically moved the bar'' in protecting the
environment, said Katie McGinty, until recently the director of the
White House Council on Environmental Quality. ``We would not have .
. . an international game plan to save the world from disruptive
climatic changes if not for Al Gore's leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to an international treaty, called the Kyoto
Protocol, that Gore brokered in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some criticism of Gore may have been inevitable because of
expectations Gore created through his 1992 book, ``Earth in the
Balance,'' which portrayed a global environmental crisis. Gore
called for making environmental protection ``the central organizing
principle for civilization,'' and called global warming ``the most
serious threat we have ever faced.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's passion has often not been matched by action. The
Clinton administration has proposed few measures to control the
United States' burning of oil and coal, the leading human source of
gases that contribute to global warming. And Gore icily rejected
environmentalists' urging that the Kyoto Protocol be sent to the US
Senate so that American commitments would become binding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name a senator who would support me,'' Gore told the leaders
of several environmental groups last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore argues that he wants to steadily advance environmental
causes without creating a polarizing debate, a mistake that he says
the administration made in 1993 by trying to slap a new tax on coal
and oil. Congress swiftly rejected the so-called BTU tax, and the
fight has poisoned administration efforts to win support for
policies against global warming ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, suspect Gore's caution is driven by his
presidential ambitions. Gore himself has cited his ``tendency to
put a finger to the political winds and proceed cautiously.'' With
Republicans already seizing upon passages in Gore's book for
evidence of extremism, Gore may not want to give them more
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thinks he's insincere,'' said John Passacantando of the
Washington-based environmental group Ozone Action. ``The criticism
is more that he and his staff are letting the fearmongers
circumscribe his political agenda, limiting him on environmental
issues to small potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Gore is that rare politician who thrives on the
scientific and technical details of environmental issues, surfing
the Web or calling scientists directly for the latest information.
Even Gore's cocktail party conversation often turns to issues such
as stabilizing global population.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore is formidably well-informed, as he
demonstrated a couple of years ago when he very publicly tutored
President Clinton on the ecological role of phosphorous in Lake
Tahoe, Calif.

bills the Legislature passed this year. He cut $51 million in
spending from the state budget, vetoed 29 bills, let several become
law without his signature and signed hundreds more. Among the
casualties: a bill allowing county commissions to appoint legal
counsel for indigent defendants. Among the successes: a law that
could take some of the sting out of the Hopwood court ruling. It
allows Texas universities to match scholarships offered by other

 UNDATED: ... in that.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In fact, during our interview Hall downplays most of the horror
stories that have trailed him, vignettes that make him a prime
candidate for an ``E! Hollywood True Story'' pathography. In his
effort to escape the oblivion of projects like ``The Killing
Grounds'' and ``Into the Sun,'' he seems to be revising the canon
of negative media images: Hall as the 17-year-old party boy
``drinking vodka by the quart every day,'' as he told People in
1992; Hall as a terror on the movie set of 1986's ``Out of
Bounds,'' where crew members referred to him as ``Anthony Michael
Moron'' or simply ``The Brat''; Hall as the misguided careerist who
turned down roles in ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' and ``Pretty in
Pink'' and gave up the lead in Stanley Kubrick's ``Full Metal
Jacket'' because of ``scheduling and business,'' as he told the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had fun, you know what I mean?'' he says now. ``It was never
disruptive. . . . Honestly. I didn't have the Sean Penn experience.
I didn't grow up in Malibu, I haven't punched people out, I haven't
done any of that. I think a lot of it is unfair.'' But there was a
punching incident reported in the Los Angeles Times in 1988, with
Hall quoted as saying, ``I slugged a guy in a club a few months
ago. My mother was singing there and some guy made a comment, so I
hit him. Of course, the press reported it, but I don't regret doing
it.'' Today, reminded of the incident, he says, ``I don't remember
punching anyone when I've worked. I have an Irish temperament, but
I am a professional.'' When pressed, he says, ``That's an old
thing. That was years ago. Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hall doesn't embark on a confessional about his
ill-fated year on ``Saturday Night Live'' in 1985, when at 17 he
became the youngest-ever Not for Prime Time Player. ``I was rude to
a lot of people,'' he said in 1988. ``I was drinking on the set.''
Today, he says simply, ``It didn't take me long to realize I wasn't
a stand-up comic. It was difficult insofar as they didn't know how
to work with me. They didn't know what to write for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But who wants to push Hall back into the mire of publicity
mistakes past? He has a sincere desire to move forward to a day
when articles won't need to elaborate on his difficult years. ``A
lot of that was an unfair rap, honestly,'' he says. ``It wasn't
like I was lashing out at people. I feel like I'm going around with
this Lee Marvin image or something. . . . I have dedicated my life
to my work, and the challenging times have been 10 years since. . .
. The best publicity is to work and keep working. There's other
tragedies like Dana Plato that are very sad. I feel fortunate that
I kept my head on and persevered. A lot of people have been less
fortunate with more success.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the 1990s has come an enlightened awareness of the
pitfalls of growing up on-screen. We have a better understanding of
the traumas of someone like Macaulay Culkin, who was similarly
squired into fame by John Hughes. ``I sacrificed, but I wouldn't
say that I suffered,'' Hall says. ``Suffering is Kosovo. But I feel
there were sacrifices involved _ being away from my family for
extended periods of time, forfeiting time in the school
environment. It was interesting to grow up in the industry where I
was subject and object. I look at it as a 15-year film school
education.''

<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Hall says he passionately wanted to play Bill Gates, bad hair
and all, when he auditioned with ``Pirates of Silicon Valley''
director Martyn Burke. ``I told him that it mattered to me and that
I wanted to be involved. Oftentimes you leave meetings not having
said something like that, and connecting on some small level.''
</P>
<P>
   To create an impression of the real Gates, he watched
documentary footage and visited the Microsoft Web site. But he did
not have the chance to meet Gates, since Burke and TNT decided not
to tell an authorized story of either Microsoft or Apple. ``We
deconstructed Gates,'' Hall says. ``We didn't want to approach
parody, but I definitely wanted to get his tone. We did everything
from cutting up cotton balls or tampons on the set and, in some
scenes, stuffing them in my nose to get that nasal tone that he
has. Also his body language is interesting. We deciphered that at a
certain point he kind of left his body behind, it was all cerebral
energy. He kind of has this old man's gait to his walk.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance, like his smaller role in ``Six Degrees of
Separation'' in 1993, is a hint of what his acting future may
bring, if he can continue to land good parts. Meanwhile, he
recently produced an album of his own songs called ``Hall of
Mirrors,'' on which he sings and plays guitar, bass, and drums.
It's on sale through his Web site. He's also hoping to star in a
biopic about Robert Kennedy, either his own project or one
currently planned by TNT. To cultivate his career, he lives in
Marina del Rey, Calif., but he says he misses the street life of
New York City, where he spent much of his youth. ``I realized I had
to be out there. As they say, even Spielberg lives there.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likes to return to Boston a few times a year. His
mother, Mercedes Hall, and her family are from West Roxbury.
``That's where I lived for the first couple of years of my life.
Then we moved. I have such a huge family. My mother is one of 13,
and so it's a classic Boston family. . . . I was like the 14th
child, because I was the first grandkid.'' He credits his mother,
his family, and his Northeast temperament for his ``survivor
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more relaxed and comfortable with myself now,'' he says.
``For a while, there was a lot to learn.''

FILMS RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !!!! ``Buena Vista Social Club'' Musician Ry Cooder and
filmmaker Wim Wenders went to Cuba to capture on film a handful of
Cuban jazz giants whose careers have been in limbo during the
Castro era. Finding them alive and vital, this documentary provides
them with a chance to restart their careers, which ignite
irresistibly in a pair of concerts. (G) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``The General's Daughter'' Bold, slick juggernaut of a
military murder mystery. The crude selling of a brutal sex crime on
a swampy army base undercuts potent performances by John Travolta
as an Army investigator who won't be swerved into a whitewash and
Madeleine Stowe as his sexy, savvy rape-counselor colleague. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``The Red Violin'' Handsome film about the journey of a
priceless 17th-century Cremonese violin whose owners don't have
much luck with it. Visually, it's a stunner; dramatically, it's not
_ it never stays with a character long enough or more than
superficially enough for us to attach to anyone. (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Tarzan'' This lively take on the ape man as a sensitive
superstar athlete should reinvigorate the lagging Disney animation
franchise. It allows Tarzan to do things no live version could, and
finds the animators confidently working in the tradiitonal Disney
house style, abetted by computers. Tony Goldwyn voices Tarzan,
Minnie Driver voices Jane, and Glenn Close is another vocal plus as
Tarzan's adoptive gorilla mom. (G) &QL;

   He has until Aug. 6 to decide for certain whether he will run.
Meanwhile, campaign strategist David Looman, who is working with
Jordan, said they would use the next two months as an exploratory
period to raise money and test public reaction to the prospect of a
Jordan comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose job approval rating has steadily dipped in the
polls since he took office, defeated Jordan in the December 1995
run-off election, tallying 57 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, also a former police chief, has been hinting for months
that he was considering a rematch. The election is Nov. 2. Unless a
candidate wins a majority, there will be a runoff in December.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has kept a relatively low profile since he left office,
although he hasn't been shy about criticizing Brown over his
development plans for Treasure Island and for boosting city
spending by $1 billion. He said in a recent interview with that
Brown had been too cozy with special interest groups and with
helping his friends, rather than focusing on quality-of-life
issues.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Johnston, a spokesman for Brown's re-election campaign,
said his team welcomed Jordan into the campaign. ``Ultimately, it
will be the voters who will decide whether they want to keep the
city moving forward under Mayor Brown or whether they want to look
back to the Jordan years.''
</P>
<P>
   The voters, he said, spoke clearly in the last election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem like it was a fairly decisive victory last time
around,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is one of 20 challengers who have filed declarations of
intent with the Department of Elections. Among them is Clint
Reilly, a businessman who, as a former campaign consultant, ran
Jordan's unsuccessful re-election race in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and Jordan, both considered law-and-order moderates who
relish the chance to take on waste in government spending, have
their strongest base in the West of Twin Peaks neighborhoods, which
are often San Francisco's most conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Several other high-profile politicos haven't ruled out
campaigns. Topping the list are Board of Supervisors President Tom
Ammiano; Supervisor Leland Yee, an Ammiano ally who chairs the
board's powerful Finance and Labor Committee; and Supervisor Gavin
Newsom, who was appointed by Brown but has been showing a growing
independence.
</P>
<P>
   David Binder, a San Francisco pollster who currently isn't
working for any mayoral candidate, said Jordan would most likely
face an uphill battle in trying to retake the mayor's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a lot of potential for Frank Jordan's campaign,''
Binder said. A poll he conducted in spring for another campaign
unrelated to the mayor's race found Jordan's negative ratings with
voters were higher than his positives.
</P>
<P>
   Those surveyed weren't ``adverse to Frank Jordan, the man,'' he
said. ``They think he's generally a good guy, well intended. But
there are many people who don't like his politics. They think he's
too conservative for San Francisco, and they don't think he was a
strong leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Bruzzone, an activist in Republican politics, suggested
that Jordan should be given a second chance, simply because he
faced circumstances _ such as a much less robust economy _ beyond
his control as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economy and city budget deficits, Jordan ran the
city without imposing significant tax increases or laying off
employees Bruzzone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably no one else in this city who deserves a
chance again to be mayor,'' Bruzzone said.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor, Jordan faced vigorous opposition from a more liberal
Board of Supervisors, which blocked many of his initiatives.
Advocates for the poor, particularly homeless activists, held
regular protests inside and outside the mayor's office after he
cracked down on nuisance crimes and welfare cheats. City employee
unions also took him on.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the shower.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of the mayor's race, Jordan, in a whimsical,
spontaneous campaign stunt, jumped into a shower _ naked _ with two
male disc jockeys from Los Angeles. A San Francisco Examiner
reporter and freelance photographer were on hand to capture the
moment (a photograph exposed Jordan from the waste up), landing the
story on the front page and provoking national attention.
</P>
<P>
   While the incident didn't decide Jordan's re-election chances,
it spawned countless jokes and has become part of his legacy.

CHRISSIE HYNDE RETURNS WITH `VIVA L'AMORE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Visiting Manhattan to promote her new album, Chrissie Hynde of
the Pretenders has just come from a photo shoot that threatened to
get testy. The photographer had brought along clothes for Hynde to
wear _ a common gesture in today's fashion-conscious photo spreads
_ but Hynde set her straight quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to use my own clothes,'' Hynde says she told the
photographer, ``and I won't say who made the clothes, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The photographer looked stunned, then asked, ``Have you always
dressed yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon Hynde burst out laughing and said, ``Look, if you had
tried to tell us how to dress in 1981, we would have cracked you in
the jaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Hynde, a godmother of the punk scene, is still a total
individualist. This is a woman who wore a T-shirt with the words
``Have a nice death'' during her first tour with the Pretenders.
Today, after spending time as a single mom raising two children,
then marrying a Colombian sculptor (Lucho Brieva), she retains an
uncompromising spirit.
</P>
<P>
   That spirit flowers again on the Pretenders' new album, ``Viva
L'Amore,'' which comes out Tuesday. It doesn't rock as hard as
early Pretenders discs, but then what does? And the rock that does
adorn it is still bracingly vital, as heard in the guitar-stoked
``Legalize Me,'' ``Dragway 42,'' and the razor-edged ``Baby's
Breath,'' with Hynde reviving her caustic side: ``Why did you send
me roses? / Save them for someone's death,'' she sings. ``There was
a time when you thought I was in love with you / Well, think
again!''
</P>
<P>
   These songs are counterbalanced by some pretty, more positive,
sometimes gloppy love ballads and by the reflective thoughts in the
tune ``Human'': ``I crash, I burn, and maybe someday I'll learn /
I'm only human on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Hynde even adds a song in Spanish, ``Rabo de Nube,'' about
finding hope; and, as if to demonstrate the versatility that
defines her adult-rock era, she features a wide array of album
guests, including guitar god Jeff Beck, lounge lizard David
Johansen, songwriter Jules Shear, and reggae-pop singer Ali
Campbell of UB40.
</P>
<P>
   She and the rest of the Pretenders _ Martin Chambers on drums,
Adam Seymour on guitar, and Andy Hobson on bass _ are also due to
play a bunch of Lilith Fair dates this summer, including an Aug. 3
date at the Tweeter Center in Mansfield with Sarah McLachlan,
Sheryl Crow, and several other strong-minded, female-fronted acts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she thinks of Lilith during our phone interview,
Hynde has a ready answer. ``It's show business, isn't it? Having
all women is kind of a gimmick. It's entertainment. I don't know if
it's supposed to be anything else, but for me, that's what it is. .
. . But it sounds like fun, like joining the circus for a couple of
weeks. And, surely, what self-respecting kid didn't want to do
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Taken overall, the Pretenders' new album marks an energetic
return for Hynde, 47, who grew up in Akron, Ohio, before moving to
London in the mid-'70s and sparking that city's blossoming new
wave-punk movement. She and the Pretenders went on to record such
hits as ``Precious,'' ``Brass in Pocket,'' ``Stop Your Sobbin' ''
(written by the Kinks' Ray Davies, who is the father of one of her
children), ``Back in the Chain Gang,'' ``Talk of the Town,''
``Don't Get Me Wrong,'' and ``I'll Stand by You.''
</P>
<P>
   Hynde's restored energy is also seen in the new album's cover _
a portrait of herself with fists in the air, taken by Linda
McCartney. ``It's got a revolutionary kind of vibe, which fits
nicely into my album title, which is `Viva L'Amore.' It's supposed
to sound like a revolutionary slogan,'' says Hynde.
</P>
<P>
   There are no firebrand politics on it, however, but the
controversial opening track, ``Popstar,'' has been interpreted as
Hynde's ranting about the record industry. On that cut, which has a
Lou Reed-like toughness, Hynde sings about the phony nature of some
of today's young teen stars who feel they have to resort to breast
implants to have a more videogenic image. ``After a couple of hits,
she'll be getting a new pair of (breasts),'' Hynde wails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds like I'm railing against the industry and
talking about the new breed of singers,'' says Hynde. ``But,
really, it's more about talking to an ex-boyfriend who is going out
with a young pop star.'' The climactic verse, directed to the
ex-boyfriend: ``They don't make 'em like they used to / You should
have stuck with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hynde has made many personal changes in recent years _ besides
marrying, she gave up her longtime marijuana habit, partly to
please her nonsmoking husband. ``I had always mixed (pot) with
tobacco in the English style, so I quit the whole thing in one
go.''
</P>
<P>
   But something she doesn't see changing is the greed-driven
record industry. She's always been an outsider to it, and that
still holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you went back to the '50s, '60s, '70s, or any time, you
could always see a lot of evil doings in the industry,'' Hynde
says. ``As Otis Redding said, `Everything changes, but it still
remains the same.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hynde, that means she's still going her own way, is still
ruffling the industry, and is still making some of the best rock
'n' roll around, regardless of age.

TEXAN'S FIRST NOVEL WEAVES TRONG TALE OF BOY GONE AWRY

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HADRIAN'S WALLS 
By Robert Draper 
Knopf, 321 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning, Hadrian Coleman's walls existed only in his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   His dad, the local vet, was the most respected man in Shepherd
County, a corner of East Texas where iniquity was winning out over
equity. Doc Coleman was the most popular guy around, too, and the
most righteous. Before the doc died, when Hadrian was only 14,
Hadrian heard his father curse only twice, once on the night the
Klan came to threaten him for treating a black man's mule.
</P>
<P>
   The doc's goodness was exaggerated by the comparison with other
county leaders. Justice was for sale in the crooked courtroom of
Horace Castleberry, and justice was often denied in the local state
prison, ruled ruthlessly by Thunderball Hope, who would think
nothing of throwing a con in ``the Oven'' if it suited him.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to be as good as his dad is at the base of
``Hadrian's Walls,'' the engrossing first novel by Robert Draper, a
journalist who's a full-blooded Texan with a full-bodied gift for
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   When the doc died, Hadrian started to drift in a dangerous
direction, and his mother turned to Castleberry for help, a
decision that could hardly have gone more wrong. Within a week, the
judge had tried to molest Hadrian's best friend, Hadrian had come
to his rescue, and in the scuffle that resulted, Hadrian had broken
the judge's neck. Almost overnight, Hadrian's walls had turned to
stone.
</P>
<P>
   What ensues is intricate and clever. If the full circumstances
had been told at trial, Hadrian probably wouldn't have gotten 50
years. The friend Hadrian had saved was none other than Sonny Hope,
Thunderball's only child. Thunderball wouldn't let Sonny testify,
but figured he could protect Hadrian once he was inside. At the
first opportunity, he takes him out of the general population and
installs him as his house boy. He thinks he's being benevolent,
protecting Hadrian, paying off Sonny's debt. But he's really giving
Hadrian a front-row seat to see how he might have grown up had he
not stood up for Sonny. Would becoming some hard con's pretty boy
have been any more devastating?
</P>
<P>
   Just as Hadrian had learned at his father's knee, so had Sonny,
but his lessons had been in control and manipulation. When someone
filed a civil-rights lawsuit over the Oven, it was Sonny whose
testimony ended his father's reign. Before long, it was Sonny who
had taken over as director; now he was Hadrian's protector, as well
as his debtor.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear from the first pages that Hadrian is deep-down good,
and yet 15 years later, he kills again and goes on the lam mere
days before his parole would have taken effect. Eventually, Sonny
wins him a pardon and brings him back to Shepherdsville, but with a
cold and devious motive; Hadrian's walls rise anew, in the form of
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Draper's descriptions are often delicious. Castleberry's smile
is ``little more than a flesh wound on his rancid face.'' Later,
Hadrian comes to realize, ``I wore their blood, Wexler's and Judge
Castleberry's, just as I'd worn a number on my back. The awareness
of this had snuck up on me, as a killer would.''
</P>
<P>
   The author draws the East Texas backdrop convincingly, and
provides a rich cast whose actions ring true without approaching
cliche. There are people to admire, people to hate, and people to
puzzle over. A particular bit of delight is Mimi, Hadrian's only
sibling. She's grown up to be hopeless white trash, a result he
blames himself for. And he does seem to have influenced her: When
she spies something she likes, it isn't ``keen,'' or ``cool''; it's
``killer.''
</P>
<P>
   So deftly does Draper mesh the elements of word play, plot,
characterization, and human insight through this novel that his
ending is slightly a letdown. Despite that, though, the race to see
whether Hadrian's walls ever come tumbling down is a pleasure to
read.

IS BLOOD IN VEINS ACTUALLY BLUE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is the blood in veins actually blue, turning red when it
mixes with oxygen in the lungs?
</P>
<P>
   B.M.N., Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Only if you live on Beacon Hill,'' replies Dr. Chris
Stowell, head of the blood bank at Massachusetts General Hospital.
In fact, not even in the truest blue-blooded Brahmin does blood run
anything other than red. But it does come in different shades of
red.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more oxygen it's carrying the redder it is,'' Dr. Stowell
explains. As blood comes out of the lungs with a fresh load of
oxygen, it's as bright as it gets. As it travels through the body,
releasing some of that oxygen, it darkens. By the time the blood is
on it's way back to the lungs, though it's still carrying 80
percent of it's oxygen capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Look inside your forearms. If you see any blood vessels that
look blue, it doesn't mean you're a Cabot or a Lowell. The veins
are carrying burgundy blood but they look blue to us because of the
way our skin and blood vessel walls transmit light. (Technically
speaking, there is less red light reflected from the shallow area
between the surface and the vessel than blue light because blue
light scatters more widely. The tissue around the vein reflects
back more red. This doesn't mean the vessel is really blue, only
that it looks blue.)
</P>
<P>
   And why is blood red in the first place? Red blood cells, which
look like a mini version of a jelly doughnut after somebody pushed
their thumb down on the middle, contain a special molecule called
hemoglobin, which has four iron atoms. The iron is the magnet that
grabs and holds the oxygen as the blood travels through the lungs,
then lets it go as it passes through the body. Each iron atom is
surrounded by a little ring of amino acids called porphyrin. The
combination of the porphyrin ring and iron atoms creates the red
color of our blood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the greatest earthquake that could occur on this
planet?
</P>
<P>
   S.B., Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The experts agree that it'll be tough to top the 9.5
magnitude quake 50 miles off the coast of Chile in 1960. That
massive event involved a huge section of ocean bottom being pushed
under the land mass of South America. It killed 5,700 people. It's
power was enough to raise sections of the Andes mountains 20 feet,
and the seismic waves it generated caused the earth to vibrate and
ring like a bell (though we couldn't hear it) for more than a
month.
</P>
<P>
   MIT Professor of Geophysics Nafi Toksoz says such a quake would
have the energy equivalent of 10 to the 25th power ergs _ a unit of
energy measurement equivalent to about 10 BTUs. That's one tenth of
the total amount of energy consumed by the United States in a year.
It is one hundred thousand times the amount of energy released by
the nuclear explosion over Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   Why couldn't we get a bigger quake than that? Toksoz explains
that earthquakes occur along faults, places in the topmost layer of
the earth known as the crust or lithosphere of the earth, which is
roughly 60 miles deep, where sections of rock are sliding along one
another, pushing against one another, or pulling away from each
other. No evidence has ever been found of a fault zone being any
longer than the 680 miles-long fault that produced the Chilean
quake. The famous San Andreas fault in Southern California is 375
miles long.
</P>
<P>
   We usually hear about earthquake magnitude as measured by the
Richter scale, named for Charles Richter, a crusty seismologist
from the California Institute of Technology. It turns out Richter's
scale isn't precise for many quakes, especially big ones. But it's
not really his fault
</P>
<P>
   We've learned a lot about earthquakes since he set up his famous
scale in 1935. We now know they generate different kinds of waves.
Some shake the ground up and down, one full wave, once a minute.
Some create only one wave per hour. New England quakes create
several ground waves per second. There's a scale for each wave.
</P>
<P>
   We've also learned about different kinds of faults. Put your
hands together, pointed forward, and rub them sideways against each
other. That's called a ``strike-slip'' fault. That's how the San
Andreas moves. Now, hands together, slide one down compared with
the other. That's called a ``normal'' fault. Hands together again,
raise one up compare to the other. That's a ``thrust'' fault. We
get a lot of those in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Toksoz says geologists now favor the Moment Magnitude scale,
which simply measures how long the fault is, and how far the rock
on one side moved, or slipped compared to the other. Toksoz says
Chile showed 8.5 on the Richter scale, but a Moment Magnitude 9.5.
But Moment Magnitude isn't as precise for smaller quakes. So
several scales, including Richter's, will probably remain in use
for a while.

`WEST'-WARD HO! KEVIN KLINE GOES WILD WILD 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Kevin Kline with Will Smith in a scene
from ``Wild Wild West.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``How many actors does it take to screw in a light bulb?'' Kevin
Kline asks.
 &HT;    The Oscar-winning actor pauses, then offers the punch line.
 &HT;    ``It takes 15 actors,'' he says. ``One to actually screw the
light bulb in and 14 to debate if they could have done it better if
given the role.''
 &HT;    It's a strange joke to hear from an actor, but then Kline is not
a typical actor. He thinks of himself as a character actor, but has
the dashing good looks of a leading man. He's a workaholic, but he
spends a long time waiting for good roles to come along.
 &HT;    He loves the written word, but you'll rarely find him poring
through scripts for those elusive roles.
 &HT;    ``I hate reading scripts,'' Kline explains. ``It's like looking
at a blueprint for someone's house you probably have no intention
of visiting.''
 &HT;    Kline's latest role is a fine example of his ambiguous status in
Hollywood. It's a part that seems ideal for him, with plenty of
opportunities for the off-center comedy which is perhaps his
greatest skill _ but it came his way only after another actor
passed on it. It was originally intended for George Clooney, a
television star whose resume features only a fraction as many
movies as Kline's, not to mention one fewer Oscar.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, when ``Wild Wild West'' opens on June 30, the
megabudget summer blockbuster will find Kline co-starring with Will
Smith as two heroes in post-Civil War America, trying to thwart the
evil plans of mad scientist Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh).
 &HT;    It can be a bad career move to pick up a role that another actor
has already spurned, but Kline says he had no hesitation in
accepting the part of Artemus Gordon, the master-of-disguise
gadgetmeister who's partnered with Secret Service agent James West
(Smith).
 &HT;    ``I loved the script because it was unlike anything I'd ever
read,'' the actor says. ``It was just filled with incidents and
action sequences and one event after another _ it was
irresistible.''
 &HT;    Besides, he adds, the chance to do comedy appealed to him.
 &HT;    ``It was the perfect anecdote to `Ivanhoe,' which is what I was
doing on stage last year,'' Kline says. ``A lot of times I choose
things according to what I'm doing now _ I always want to do
something very, very different.''
 &HT;    Certainly, Gordon is an unusual character, one that Kline found
intriguing.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to make him nonviolent. He is actually someone who
abhors violence,'' Kline says. ``I also wanted to make him more
cerebral than instinctive. He needs his wits in order to survive.''
 &HT;    He didn't check out Ross Martin's approach to the role in the
original 1960s television series, he adds.
 &HT;    ``I have never seen the show in my life,'' Kline says. ``What if
I didn't like it?''
 &HT;    Besides, he adds, ``I never base a performance on another's
performance.''
 &HT;    It's been a busy year for Kline, who early this spring was seen
as the megalomaniacal aspiring actor Bottom in ``William
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Puncturing Bottom's
pretensions was catnip for Kline.
 &HT;    ``I admit I have a very low threshold for pompous people,'' the
actor says. ``In high school, I had such a problem with authority.
I found it so absurd and overdone.''
 &HT;    Kline grew up in St. Louis, the son of a Jewish father and a
Catholic mother _ which may account for his troubles in a Catholic
high school ran by Benedictine monks.
 &HT;    ``I was the class wit,'' he says. ``I couldn't not talk back. I
was the smartass.
 &HT;    ``I went to a school where there was corporal punishment, so I
was beaten on my hands,'' Kline says. ``But even though my hands
hurt so much I couldn't make a fist, I would still act up.
 &HT;    ``There was one teacher _ we really had it in for each other,''
he recalls. ``I remember he'd come in and I'd actually throw myself
out of class. Why wait for him to do it?''
 &HT;    At the time he had no plans to become an actor, but gradually he
was drawn in that direction by early inspirations ranging from
Laurence Olivier, Paul Newman and Marlon Brando to Jerry Lewis,
W.C. Fields and the Marx Brothers.
 &HT;    ``I never had one dramatic moment where I said, `I have to be an
actor,''' he says. ``I think just watching certain actors do
certain roles over a period of time influenced me.''
 &HT;    After studying at New York's prestigious Juilliard School, Kline
found work with touring theater companies almost immediately. It's
a source of pride to him that he's always earned his living by
acting.
 &HT;    ``I never had to work as a waiter,'' Kline says. ``I would have
been terrible. I'm sure I would have told the truth about which
specials sucked.''
 &HT;    A role on the daytime soap opera ``Search for Tomorrow''
(1976-77) took Kline back to New York, where he subsequently became
a stage favorite, winning Tony awards for ``On the Twentieth
Century'' (1978) and ``The Pirates of Penzance'' (1980) and
starring in two critically acclaimed productions of ``Hamlet.''
 &HT;    His screen debut came opposite Meryl Streep in 1982's ``Sophie's
Choice.'' A variety of film roles followed, ranging from wild
comedy _ his Oscar-winning turn as a dimwitted hit man in ``A Fish
Called Wanda'' (1988) and his double performance in ``Dave'' (1993)
_ to such heavy dramas as ``Grand Canyon'' (1991) and ``The Ice
Storm'' (1997).
 &HT;    All of which doesn't change the fact that right now Kline is
looking for work.
 &HT;    ``That's the horrible thing about acting,'' he says. ``When
you're not working, you're in essence unemployed.''
 &HT;    Not that he minds the chance to spend time in New York with
actress Phoebe Cates, his wife of 10 years, and their children. But
he admits that he's getting itchy, and is thinking about a return
to the stage, possibly in Shakespeare.
 &HT;    On the film front, he adds, things are less encouraging.
 &HT;    ``I take my agent's word for it if I should read something,'' he
says with a grimace. ``Most of the film scripts are just awful. I
assume you've been to the movies lately, so you know what I mean.
 &HT;    ``It's hard for an actor,'' he adds, ``because today's scripts
are works in process. You'll hear, `It's the 13th draft, and we
have a new writer coming in.' I'm like, `Why don't you just send it
to me when you're finished?'
 &HT;    ``I'll hear, `We are finished _ except we've got a new middle, a
new beginning and we'll probably redo the ending.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, he says, his passion for acting remains undimmed.
 &HT;    ``I think the best aspect of an artist is his desire to probe
and communicate a notion larger than himself,'' Kline says. ``You
can also use acting to shed light on your particular existence.''
 &HT;    Long active in programs to encourage and support rising young
actors, Kline says that their talent, passion and commitment helps
keep him dedicated to his own work.
 &HT;    ``The highest compliment I can give them is, `I envy you. I
wanted to play that part.'''

JULIANNE MOORE'S WALK ON THE WILDE SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Julianne Moore in a scene from ``An
Ideal Husband.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    We've seen Julianne Moore doing an extended monologue naked from
the waist down. We've seen her fleeing for her life from rampaging
dinosaurs. We've seen her having sex with a spectacularly
well-endowed porn star.
 &HT;    But this is something new.
 &HT;    ``An Ideal Husband,'' being released throughout the United
States in June and July, takes Moore into Helena Bonham Carter
territory. Based on Oscar Wilde's play, the film is set in 1890s
England, with all the elaborate costumes, sumptuous scenery and
painstakingly perfect manners which that implies.
 &HT;    And her co-stars are period-piece veterans, one and all: Rupert
Everett plays a shameless womanizer, Jeremy Northam an honest
politician with a dark secret and Cate Blanchett as his adoring
wife.
 &HT;    Moore? Well, she plays Mrs. Cheveley, a deceptively pleasant
woman who's learned Northam's secret, and whose flawless demeanour
masks a ruthless determination to play it for all it's worth.
 &HT;    In short, she plays arguably the film's most complicated
character _ which means we're on Julianne Moore turf after all.
 &HT;    There may not have been many corsets or brittle epigrams in a
filmography that includes memorable, naturalistic performances in
such films as ``The Hand that Rocks the Cradle'' (1992), ``Short
Cuts'' (1993), ``Safe'' (1995), ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park''
(1997), ``Boogie Nights'' (1997) and ``Cookie's Fortune'' (1999),
but Moore says she didn't have many qualms in tackling
writer/director Oliver Parker's film.
 &HT;    ``I'd done plenty of period work and acted in the classics when
I went to acting school,'' the Boston University graduate says.
``It's just that I hadn't done those things on screen. Doing this
didn't feel alien to me. A lot of my film roles have been very
contemporary, so it may be new for the audience, but it wasn't
particularly new to me.
 &HT;    ``The dialogue was a bigger challenge,'' Moore says by
telephone, speaking from the streets of New York as she walks
hurriedly across town for a doctor's appointment. ``Anytime you're
dealing with a specific style of dialogue, it's challenging.
Wilde's language is inherently theatrical, which is part of the
beauty of it, but you can't do too much of that in a film, because
it just doesn't work.
 &HT;    ``For all of us, especially Oliver Parker, the goal was to make
it somewhat naturalistic and more accessible,'' she says. ``I hope
we pulled that part of it off.''
 &HT;    Most difficult of all, the actress says, was to balance her
performance so that the audience wouldn't be entirely put off by
Mrs. Cheveley and her underhanded machinations.
 &HT;    ``That was tough,'' she says, then breaks off to chastise
someone for zipping through a yellow light.
 &HT;    ``I sometimes think I could have gone further with the
villainy,'' she resumes. ``When I look at the film, I think, `Oh,
what the hell! She is the villainess.'
 &HT;    ``It was hard, because you need to keep people interested, but
you don't want people thinking, `Oh, just get that horrible woman
out of here!'
 &HT;    ``The way I tried to approach it was that she's an incredibly
self-directed person,'' Moore says. ``She's not necessarily evil,
but she just really, really knows what she wants, and is more than
willing to do what she has to do to get it.
 &HT;    ``And, as she's doing everything she does, she's really enjoying
herself,'' the actress concludes. ``I loved that part of playing
her.''
 &HT;    Moore admits that she was wary of her status as the only
American on the set, but adds that it didn't turn out to be a
problem.
 &HT;    ``Being around so many Brits made me more and more American,
strangely enough,'' she says. ``When I was younger and was around
Brits, I'd try to be more British or at least squelch my
American-ness. On this job, for some reason, I got to be enormously
American _ it became my one defining characteristic.
 &HT;    ``I don't think anyone else on the set cared or even noticed.''
 &HT;    Moore's resume includes hits and flops alike, independent
features, modest studio productions and blockbusters in turn. The
actress admits, with a giggle, that there isn't any one
consideration behind her decision-making process.
 &HT;    ``It's often the script,'' she says. ``It's often the character
and it's often the director. Sometimes it's the other actors.
 &HT;    ``I really love to work, so if something in a film interests me
I'll probably do it,'' she concludes. ``Of course, I'd like for as
many elements at once to be there, but's that not always the
case.''
 &HT;    And, oh yes, there's the money. Unlike some other actors, Moore
readily admits that there are some movies she does simply for the
paycheck.
 &HT;    ``I do a movie like `Safe' and I lose money,'' she says.
``People will say, `Why did you do such and such?' and it's like,
`Look, I'm a person. I have a family _ I need to pay my mortgage
and I need to feed my child.'
 &HT;    ``It's not like we all stand around, do parts and people throw
money at us,'' she says with a laugh. ``On some movies we make a
really good living, and on some jobs we make nothing.
 &HT;    ``There are always financial considerations to think about.''
 &HT;    Her next couple of movies, however, definitely are ones she has
her heart in. She reteams with Paul Thomas Anderson, director of
``Boogie Nights,'' for the ensemble drama ``Magnolia,'' and then
co-stars with Sigourney Weaver in ``The Map of the World,'' a
somber piece about a woman (Moore) whose daughter accidentally
drowns while playing in the yard of a neighbor (Weaver).
 &HT;    Then there's ``The End of the Affair,'' based on the Graham
Greene novel. Directed by Neil Jordan, it teams Moore with Ralph
Fiennes and Stephen Rea.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, it's got the most beautiful story in the world,''
Moore says enthusiastically. ``I hadn't read the novel when I read
the script, so I came to it completely cold. I just couldn't
believe it when I finished the script.
 &HT;    ``It's about a writer (Fiennes) who, during World War II, has an
affair with a woman (Moore) who's married to a government employee
(Rea),'' she says. ``It's about what happens to these people's
lives as a result of the affair. It's just a really poetic,
wonderfully moving story about love and grief and human nature.''
 &HT;    Nowadays stories about the fundamental issues of life resonate
with Moore, who in the last couple of years has had her own view of
the world redefined. While shooting ``The Myth of Fingerprints''
(1997), she fell in love with the film's director, Bart Freundlich.
They quickly had a child, Caleb, now 18 months old.
 &HT;    Becoming a mother, Moore says, changed her sense of herself, her
life and the entire world.
 &HT;    ``I don't mean to sound too deep, but it just connects you to
the chain of human events in a really, really wonderful way,''
Moore says. ``That's what was completely unexpected about it for
me.
 &HT;    ``Everybody talks about that and writes about that, but you
don't really understand it until you experience it for yourself,
until you move from being the child to being the parent,'' she
says. ``It's given me a lot of perspective, and that alters how I
approach my life and my work.''
 &HT;    With a mom who's an actress and a dad who directs, the boy seems
all but predestined to be an actor.
 &HT;    ``I think so,'' Moore says with obvious pride. ``Caleb's
wonderfully expressive. Actually, he loves to dance, so we might
have a dancer before we have an actor.''

A BOOST FOR DISABLED WHO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Senator Edward Kennedy rose on the Senate floor on June 14,
he was confronting (not for the first time) one of those bizarre
realities that is only possible in an American legislature.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, there was this overwhelmingly popular, very
carefully assembled proposal that will be transforming in its
impact on the better part of 8 million people plus their families _
the disabled who can work _ which on its merits had managed to
assemble no less than 78 co-sponsors by the moment Kennedy stood
up. It was what you would expect for an initiative that taps into
an almost desperate yearning to work and empowers it by making
health care affordable for those now dependent on federal income
maintenance payments.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, fronting for the Senate's hard-core
conservatives, there was one man _ Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican
_ blocking any scheduling of the measure on the floor. It was
staying blocked because of reflexive fears that anything remotely
resembling a new entitlement is necessarily dangerous. The proposal
had overwhelming, bipartisan support, including the strong backing
of all the relevant big shots, and yet it had to that moment
received no date for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason why we should be denied further opportunity
to consider this legislation,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Until there's a date from the fellow who presides
over this largely dysfunctional body, Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi, the Work Incentives Improvement Act will be an
amendment to whatever else happens to be on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he knew full well (from rich experience) that ``it
is a rather unusual process and procedure. I know the Senate has
its repsonsibilities, but there is also a responsibility to the
millions of Americans with disabilities. They have been waiting for
some period of time as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the possibility that Kennedy might act had already moved
Lott off his backside, leading to chats about scheduling the bill.
But by literally standing up for people who can't stand up on their
own, Kennedy sliced through the blockage like a knife through
butter. When he arose, the bill on the Senate floor was a spending
measure; that meant Budget Committee chairman Pete Domenici,
Republican of New Mexico, would now be going to Phil Gramm to
wonder why his ``hold'' on the disability bill was messing up his
own legislation; and that meant the same would happen for all the
other items lucky enough to be on Lott's desultory agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, within three days of Kennedy's maneuver, time
for floor consideration had been hastily arranged, Gramm's concerns
swept aside. The measure passed by the razor-thin margin of 99-0.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the margin involved far more than just the fact
it had the support of the four senators with relevant expertise and
power: Labor Committee chairman Jim Jeffords, Republican of
Vermont, and ranking Democrat Kennedy; and Finance Committee
chairman Bill Roth, Republican of Delaware, and ranking Democrat
Pat Moynihan of New York.
</P>
<P>
   It also involved substance and logic. Oversimplified, the bill
will keep care and health insurance affordable for disabled people
who require expensive treatments or expensive medicine in order to
work. Currently, there are millions of people who would have a job
literally tomorrow if it didn't rob them of the care that makes
work possible.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, states could offer the disabled a chance to
maintain comphrehensive coverage under Medicaid, with cost-sharing
on a sliding scale with income. They could also cover people with
Social Security disability insurance under Medicare after they
start working.
</P>
<P>
   And, to greatly improve the opportunities for the disabled to
work, the bill would create a new payment system for employment
services, authorizing government funds to rehabilitation or
training providers based on a portion of the cash benefits that are
no longer necessary after somebody starts working.
</P>
<P>
   No one is really sure that any of this will cost a dime over
time, given the explosion in job opportunities _ and therefore
income tax revenue _ that it is certain to produce.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that it took a good old-fashioned use of political
muscle by Kennedy to make this happen. Unlike most pols, however,
Kennedy played hardball on behalf of the disabled instead of some
big-bucks campaign contributor seeking a tax break. He's done it
all his life, and he will do it again this year on behalf of a
higher minimum wage and greater rights for health care consumers
known as patients.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For anyone who has trouble grasping that Kennedy's ties to the
voters are based on far more than mystique and money, there was one
perfect example in the Senate last week.

 (Includes a black-and-white slide of director Alfred Hitchcock at
work.) 
 By LAWRENCE WELLS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There aren't a lot of people still around who worked with
legendary director Alfred Hitchcock in his prime.
 &HT;    But Martin Landau is one of them. This year, which marks
Hitchcock's centennial _ he was born on Aug. 13, 1899, in England _
brings another red-letter day, the 40th anniversary of Landau's
film debut in Hitchcock's classic ``North By Northwest'' (1959).
 &HT;    That film's most memorable scene involves a chase across the
faces of Mt. Rushmore, with two spies (Landau and James Mason)
trying to kill the fleeing hero (Cary Grant).
 &HT;    The scene was Hitchcock's attempt to make up for a misjudgment
in a 1942 film, the actor says.
 &HT;    ``I had a conversation with him about a film he made years
before, called `Saboteur,''' Landau recalls. ``In that movie he
used the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop, and he said he made a big
mistake, because he had Norman Lloyd, who was the bad guy, hanging
off the torch. Lloyd's sleeve tears, and he falls to his death.
Robert Cummings, who I believe was the leading man in that film,
was not in jeopardy.
 &HT;    ``Hitchcock said it was a foolhardy mistake,'' he says,
``because the audience actually wanted the bad guy to die. So
Hitchcock wanted to remedy that with another national monument,
another national shrine, for his setting.''
 &HT;    In 1958, when the movie was filmed, Landau was still years away
from ``Mission Impossible,'' the 1960s television series which made
him famous, and even further from Oscar-nominated roles in Francis
Ford Coppola's ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' (1988) and Woody
Allen's ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' (1989). It would be 36 years
before he was voted Best Supporting Actor for his performance as
Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's ``Ed Wood'' (1994).
 &HT;    The 30-year-old Brooklyn native was still focused on building a
stage career when Hitchcock spotted him in a play called ``Middle
of the Night'' and cast him as Leonard, the sinister sidekick to
Mason's master spy, Vandamm.
 &HT;    ``At the time, when I read the script, I thought it was a
terrific script,'' he recalls. ``I must say that my character was a
bit nebulous. There wasn't very much there.''
 &HT;    The role might have been a simple thug, but Landau added
unexpected nuances, justifying Hitchcock's faith in an actor with
no film experience whatever.
 &HT;    ``I tried to create something interesting and dangerous and
bright,'' he says. ``From my point of view, Leonard was the
smartest guy in the picture. He notices something nobody else
notices _ that there's no bullet hole or blood when Cary gets shot
in the cafeteria at Mt. Rushmore. He's on top of things, and yet
with great economy _ he doesn't waste a move or a gesture or do
anything extraneous.
 &HT;    ``I just felt there was stuff there, even though in terms of
dialogue it wasn't a massive part,'' he says. ``But I felt the time
I was on the screen could be used well, to further the picture,
really, and create more jeopardy and danger.''
 &HT;    Landau also gave Leonard an unstated attraction to his boss.
 &HT;    ``I played him as being homosexual, ever so subtly, which a lot
of people thought was rather risky in the '50s,'' he says, ``but I
saw no reason just to be a henchman. I felt that the triangle, his
jealousy of Eva Marie Saint and James Mason, was a more interesting
take.''
 &HT;    Despite his reputation as a tyrant over actors and crew alike,
Hitchcock gave Landau the latitude to experiment with his
character. Deftly imitating the director's famous British drawl,
the actor offers a look at Hitchcock's working style.
 &HT;    ``He always whispered to people,'' Landau says. ``He never told
me anything. I'd go to him and he'd say, `Marrr-tin, I'll only tell
you if I don't like what you're doing!'
 &HT;    ``He basically had _ people don't know this _ but he had
enormous respect for actors,'' Landau adds. ``He was a provocateur.
Some of the things they said about him, that he treated actors like
cattle, that wasn't so.
 &HT;    ``And he gave you a lot of room to create your character,'' he
says. ``You pretty much knew physically where you were, because
when I was first hired he took me around the office and showed me
the storyboards. I saw the entire movie, shot by shot from
beginning to end, because he did storyboard the entire film.''
 &HT;    In fact, Landau says, if anything he felt nervous because
Hitchcock gave him so little direction.
 &HT;    ``You know, sometimes he'd whisper something to Cary or Eva
Marie or James, and I felt left out,'' he says. ``I'd ask, `What do
you want to tell me?'
 &HT;    ``And he'd say, `I'll only tell you if I don't like what you're
doing.'''
 &HT;    Despite the film's lengthy climax atop Mt. Rushmore, Landau says
that the crew actually spent only a few days at the South Dakota
landmark.
 &HT;    ``We didn't shoot any of the actual climbing scenes there,'' he
says. ``We didn't even shoot inside the cafeteria, though we ate in
the cafeteria _ the cafeteria was built back at MGM to exact scale.
 &HT;    ``The stuff we shot were the scene in the parking lot with Eva
Marie running out, with the faces in the background and some other
scenes,'' he says. ``We were only there a couple of days.''
 &HT;    After the movie opened, park officials protested the so-called
``desecration of the monument.'' Landau rejected this claim at the
time, and still does.
 &HT;    ``There wasn't any desecration,'' he says with a snort. ``It was
about our `alphabet soup' _ the CIA or FBI, Leo Carroll's group _
he even calls it `the alphabet soup' in the movie. We never really
know exactly who are fighting these foreign agents.
 &HT;    ``Mt. Rushmore serves as the essence of our country,'' he says.
``The country endures. The good guys win. The spies _ whoever they
are, obviously international terrorists _ the mountain does them
in. The mountain's spirit prevails. I don't think there's anything
wrong with using that as a background.''
 &HT;    In fact, since then the film has helped to boost tourism at the
monument, just as ``King Kong'' helped to create worldwide
awareness of the Empire State Building.
 &HT;    Like many of Hitchcock's films, the elaborate suspense builds to
a climax which is over practically before it begins.
 &HT;    ``The entire ending of the film takes place in only 40
seconds,'' Landau says with a laugh. ``One moment I'm stepping on
Cary Grant's hand to make him fall and then, in less than a minute,
I get shot, James Mason is caught, Cary is saved, Eva Marie is
saved and they're on their honeymoon, the last shot being of the
train going into the tunnel _ which is somewhat phallic!''
 &HT;    ``North By Northwest'' is in the process of receiving a full
restoration from Turner Entertainment, working from the original
Vistavision camera negatives. The restored version, featuring a
newly revitalized soundtrack as well, will be released to theatres
first and then shown on cable television.
 &HT;    It's appropriately red-carpet treatment for a film whose
reputation has grown steadily over the years, to the pleasure and
amusement of its cast.
 &HT;    ``Every time I ran into Cary Grant,'' Landau recalls, ``he said,
`You know, Martin, we did something right. When I go to colleges on
a lecture tour, the picture they want to talk about most is `North
By Northwest.' Of all the films I've done _ and I've done scads of
them _ this is the one they want to talk about ... I don't know
what the hell it was, but we did something right.'''

 (Includes a color slide of Keri Russell, Scott Speedman and Scott
Foley in a scene from ``Felicity.'') 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, ``Felicity'' was being hailed by critics as
1998/99's only can't-miss new show _ and also suffering the
customary bashing that comes with front-runner status.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone had an opinion about ``Felicity,'' including plenty of
people who'd never seen a second of it.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the WB drama about a pert California teen (Keri
Russell) who moves to New York to attend college _ and pursue her
handsome high-school classmate, Ben (Scott Speedman) _ has
established itself as a solid hit, not to mention making stars of
Russell, Speedman and Scott Foley, who plays the third leg of their
triangle, the thoroughly decent Noel.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Felicity,'' Russell's biggest credit was a gig on ``The
New Mickey Mouse Club.'' Speedman had virtually no acting
experience, having been cast purely on the basis of a killer
audition tape.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Russell says, getting used to the show has been much
like the adjustments their characters have gone through as
first-year college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a parallel there,'' she says. ``None of us
knew what to expect when this all started. This show was a lot
different from anything I had ever worked on before, and it took
some adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when I first signed onto the show, I was so
excited, but I was also so scared,'' she recalls. ``It was
completely overwhelming. Now I feel like I know what's going on,
and I know how to handle all the publicity and craziness. I have a
better sense of awareness, and I know how to pace myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedman says he never felt overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody kept telling me what a crazy year it was going to
be,'' he says, ``but it wasn't. I mean, it was crazy at times, but
that was mostly because of the workload and long hours. It was
pretty weird, but not that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As the title character, Russell naturally got a more
concentrated version of the hype. She's become used to seeing her
character dissected as a role model _ and faring better than such
past victims as Murphy Brown or Ally McBeal _ and says she's been
delighted by the show's fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get tons of letters,'' she says, ``and everyone is just
completely cool. It's the same thing with the way people respond in
public _ they're pretty laid back: They don't come up screaming,
`There's Felicity!' They usually just come up and say, `We think
your show is so cool.'
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to be a little calmer, I guess, compared to fans
of other shows,'' she adds. ``But those are the type of people the
show attracts. Our viewers are really intelligent. They're not
screaming, unless it's a pack of 12-year-old boys or something.
They always have positive things to say about the show, so for the
most part it's been great.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedman adds that the difference is more noticeable when they
get away from Los Angeles, which he says prides itself on letting
celebrities alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many actors down there, they can't tell one from
the next,'' he says. ``It's when you go to a small town that it
gets kind of strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans seem to be really polite,'' he says. ``They're not
overwhelming. We've got a small, really hardcore audience. Those
people who've come up to me are just really polite.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the fans do get excited about, however, is Felicity's
vacillating between her longstanding crush on the often-arrogant
Ben and her new interest in the lower-key Noel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the neighborhood I live in, there's an all-girl school,''
Russell says. ``I would be riding my bike to the post office or
whatever, and these girls would always come up to me and ask who I
liked better, Ben or Noel. Then they would chant, `Noel! Noel!
You've got to choose Noel!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the occasional few of them liked Ben,'' she says with a
joking sneer at Speedman. ``But I really liked the idea that girls
like Noel best, because he's definitely more of a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period for about a month last season where Ben
just got hit with one thing after another,'' Speedman says
defensively. ``He had a gambling problem, and so on. There was no
good news for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the writers make Noel a really pleasant guy, so there's
not much comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   The series began as a star turn for Russell, but seems to be
evolving into an ensemble show _ a development which she says suits
her just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the idea that we've become an ensemble cast,'' the
actress says. ``And it did make things a bit easier on me. I'm
still working a lot, but it's a lot easier than those first few
episodes, when I was in almost every scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also some really talented people in our cast,''
Speedman adds. ``They deserve their chance, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' fans rave about the show's music, which offers a
much wider range than most teen shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely love the music on our show,'' Russell says,
beaming. ``Our music supervisor, Amanda Demme, is fabulous. Look at
our soundtrack album that was just released _ it has people like
Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, Aretha Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just teenybopper little songs,'' she says. ``It's the
same kind of music that I like listening to.''
</P>
<P>
   The series seems likely to continue indefinitely, but Speedman
doubts that it will rack up anything like the nine-year run of
``Beverly Hills, 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all, like, 40 years old now,'' he groans. ``That show
is like a factory, just pushing out product. I'd leave the show if
we ever got like that _ which isn't likely to happen. Our show is
so different. We have great writers, and the quality control is
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as much as either is willing to say about the future.
Nothing closer-range _ such as how they'll resolve last season's
teaser ending, which left Felicity torn between going to Europe
with Noel or driving home to California with Ben.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to know what happens,'' Russell says, laughing.
``So many people have been asking me that question. And they're
just writing the new season right now, so it's still up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of know what's going to happen,'' she says teasingly,
``but I have to keep quiet.''

 (Includes a color slide of Kevin Kline with Will Smith in a scene
from ``Wild Wild West.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``How many actors does it take to screw in a light bulb?'' Kevin
Kline asks.
 &HT;    The Oscar-winning actor pauses, then offers the punch line.
 &HT;    ``It takes 15 actors,'' he says. ``One to actually screw the
light bulb in and 14 to debate if they could have done it better if
given the role.''
 &HT;    It's a strange joke to hear from an actor, but then Kline is not
a typical actor. He thinks of himself as a character actor, but has
the dashing good looks of a leading man. He's a workaholic, but he
spends a long time waiting for good roles to come along.
 &HT;    He loves the written word, but you'll rarely find him poring
through scripts for those elusive roles.
 &HT;    ``I hate reading scripts,'' Kline explains. ``It's like looking
at a blueprint for someone's house you probably have no intention
of visiting.''
 &HT;    Kline's latest role is a fine example of his ambiguous status in
Hollywood. It's a part that seems ideal for him, with plenty of
opportunities for the off-center comedy which is perhaps his
greatest skill _ but it came his way only after another actor
passed on it. It was originally intended for George Clooney, a
television star whose resume features only a fraction as many
movies as Kline's, not to mention one fewer Oscar.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, when ``Wild Wild West'' opens on June 30, the
megabudget summer blockbuster will find Kline co-starring with Will
Smith as two heroes in post-Civil War America, trying to thwart the
evil plans of mad scientist Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh).
 &HT;    It can be a bad career move to pick up a role that another actor
has already spurned, but Kline says he had no hesitation in
accepting the part of Artemus Gordon, the master-of-disguise
gadgetmeister who's partnered with Secret Service agent James West
(Smith).
 &HT;    ``I loved the script because it was unlike anything I'd ever
read,'' the actor says. ``It was just filled with incidents and
action sequences and one event after another _ it was
irresistible.''
 &HT;    Besides, he adds, the chance to do comedy appealed to him.
 &HT;    ``It was the perfect anecdote to `Ivanhoe,' which is what I was
doing on stage last year,'' Kline says. ``A lot of times I choose
things according to what I'm doing now _ I always want to do
something very, very different.''
 &HT;    Certainly, Gordon is an unusual character, one that Kline found
intriguing.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to make him nonviolent. He is actually someone who
abhors violence,'' Kline says. ``I also wanted to make him more
cerebral than instinctive. He needs his wits in order to survive.''
 &HT;    He didn't check out Ross Martin's approach to the role in the
original 1960s television series, he adds.
 &HT;    ``I have never seen the show in my life,'' Kline says. ``What if
I didn't like it?''
 &HT;    Besides, he adds, ``I never base a performance on another's
performance.''
 &HT;    It's been a busy year for Kline, who early this spring was seen
as the megalomaniacal aspiring actor Bottom in ``William
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Puncturing Bottom's
pretensions was catnip for Kline.
 &HT;    ``I admit I have a very low threshold for pompous people,'' the
actor says. ``In high school, I had such a problem with authority.
I found it so absurd and overdone.''
 &HT;    Kline grew up in St. Louis, the son of a Jewish father and a
Catholic mother _ which may account for his troubles in a Catholic
high school ran by Benedictine monks.
 &HT;    ``I was the class wit,'' he says. ``I couldn't not talk back. I
was the smartass.
 &HT;    ``I went to a school where there was corporal punishment, so I
was beaten on my hands,'' Kline says. ``But even though my hands
hurt so much I couldn't make a fist, I would still act up.
 &HT;    ``There was one teacher _ we really had it in for each other,''
he recalls. ``I remember he'd come in and I'd actually throw myself
out of class. Why wait for him to do it?''
 &HT;    At the time he had no plans to become an actor, but gradually he
was drawn in that direction by early inspirations ranging from
Laurence Olivier, Paul Newman and Marlon Brando to Jerry Lewis,
W.C. Fields and the Marx Brothers.
 &HT;    ``I never had one dramatic moment where I said, `I have to be an
actor,''' he says. ``I think just watching certain actors do
certain roles over a period of time influenced me.''
 &HT;    After studying at New York's prestigious Juilliard School, Kline
found work with touring theater companies almost immediately. It's
a source of pride to him that he's always earned his living by
acting.
 &HT;    ``I never had to work as a waiter,'' Kline says. ``I would have
been terrible. I'm sure I would have told the truth about which
specials sucked.''
 &HT;    A role on the daytime soap opera ``Search for Tomorrow''
(1976-77) took Kline back to New York, where he subsequently became
a stage favorite, winning Tony awards for ``On the Twentieth
Century'' (1978) and ``The Pirates of Penzance'' (1980) and
starring in two critically acclaimed productions of ``Hamlet.''
 &HT;    His screen debut came opposite Meryl Streep in 1982's ``Sophie's
Choice.'' A variety of film roles followed, ranging from wild
comedy _ his Oscar-winning turn as a dimwitted hit man in ``A Fish
Called Wanda'' (1988) and his double performance in ``Dave'' (1993)
_ to such heavy dramas as ``Grand Canyon'' (1991) and ``The Ice
Storm'' (1997).
 &HT;    All of which doesn't change the fact that right now Kline is
looking for work.
 &HT;    ``That's the horrible thing about acting,'' he says. ``When
you're not working, you're in essence unemployed.''
 &HT;    Not that he minds the chance to spend time in New York with
actress Phoebe Cates, his wife of 10 years, and their children. But
he admits that he's getting itchy, and is thinking about a return
to the stage, possibly in Shakespeare.
 &HT;    On the film front, he adds, things are less encouraging.
 &HT;    ``I take my agent's word for it if I should read something,'' he
says with a grimace. ``Most of the film scripts are just awful. I
assume you've been to the movies lately, so you know what I mean.
 &HT;    ``It's hard for an actor,'' he adds, ``because today's scripts
are works in process. You'll hear, `It's the 13th draft, and we
have a new writer coming in.' I'm like, `Why don't you just send it
to me when you're finished?'
 &HT;    ``I'll hear, `We are finished _ except we've got a new middle, a
new beginning and we'll probably redo the ending.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, he says, his passion for acting remains undimmed.
 &HT;    ``I think the best aspect of an artist is his desire to probe
and communicate a notion larger than himself,'' Kline says. ``You
can also use acting to shed light on your particular existence.''
 &HT;    Long active in programs to encourage and support rising young
actors, Kline says that their talent, passion and commitment helps
keep him dedicated to his own work.
 &HT;    ``The highest compliment I can give them is, `I envy you. I
wanted to play that part.'''

JULIANNE MOORE'S WALK ON THE WILDE SIDE

 (Includes a color slide of Julianne Moore in a scene from ``An
Ideal Husband.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    We've seen Julianne Moore doing an extended monologue naked from
the waist down. We've seen her fleeing for her life from rampaging
dinosaurs. We've seen her having sex with a spectacularly
well-endowed porn star.
 &HT;    But this is something new.
 &HT;    ``An Ideal Husband,'' being released throughout the United
States in June and July, takes Moore into Helena Bonham Carter
territory. Based on Oscar Wilde's play, the film is set in 1890s
England, with all the elaborate costumes, sumptuous scenery and
painstakingly perfect manners which that implies.
 &HT;    And her co-stars are period-piece veterans, one and all: Rupert
Everett plays a shameless womanizer, Jeremy Northam an honest
politician with a dark secret and Cate Blanchett as his adoring
wife.
 &HT;    Moore? Well, she plays Mrs. Cheveley, a deceptively pleasant
woman who's learned Northam's secret, and whose flawless demeanour
masks a ruthless determination to play it for all it's worth.
 &HT;    In short, she plays arguably the film's most complicated
character _ which means we're on Julianne Moore turf after all.
 &HT;    There may not have been many corsets or brittle epigrams in a
filmography that includes memorable, naturalistic performances in
such films as ``The Hand that Rocks the Cradle'' (1992), ``Short
Cuts'' (1993), ``Safe'' (1995), ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park''
(1997), ``Boogie Nights'' (1997) and ``Cookie's Fortune'' (1999),
but Moore says she didn't have many qualms in tackling
writer/director Oliver Parker's film.
 &HT;    ``I'd done plenty of period work and acted in the classics when
I went to acting school,'' the Boston University graduate says.
``It's just that I hadn't done those things on screen. Doing this
didn't feel alien to me. A lot of my film roles have been very
contemporary, so it may be new for the audience, but it wasn't
particularly new to me.
 &HT;    ``The dialogue was a bigger challenge,'' Moore says by
telephone, speaking from the streets of New York as she walks
hurriedly across town for a doctor's appointment. ``Anytime you're
dealing with a specific style of dialogue, it's challenging.
Wilde's language is inherently theatrical, which is part of the
beauty of it, but you can't do too much of that in a film, because
it just doesn't work.
 &HT;    ``For all of us, especially Oliver Parker, the goal was to make
it somewhat naturalistic and more accessible,'' she says. ``I hope
we pulled that part of it off.''
 &HT;    Most difficult of all, the actress says, was to balance her
performance so that the audience wouldn't be entirely put off by
Mrs. Cheveley and her underhanded machinations.
 &HT;    ``That was tough,'' she says, then breaks off to chastise
someone for zipping through a yellow light.
 &HT;    ``I sometimes think I could have gone further with the
villainy,'' she resumes. ``When I look at the film, I think, `Oh,
what the hell! She is the villainess.'
 &HT;    ``It was hard, because you need to keep people interested, but
you don't want people thinking, `Oh, just get that horrible woman
out of here!'
 &HT;    ``The way I tried to approach it was that she's an incredibly
self-directed person,'' Moore says. ``She's not necessarily evil,
but she just really, really knows what she wants, and is more than
willing to do what she has to do to get it.
 &HT;    ``And, as she's doing everything she does, she's really enjoying
herself,'' the actress concludes. ``I loved that part of playing
her.''
 &HT;    Moore admits that she was wary of her status as the only
American on the set, but adds that it didn't turn out to be a
problem.
 &HT;    ``Being around so many Brits made me more and more American,
strangely enough,'' she says. ``When I was younger and was around
Brits, I'd try to be more British or at least squelch my
American-ness. On this job, for some reason, I got to be enormously
American _ it became my one defining characteristic.
 &HT;    ``I don't think anyone else on the set cared or even noticed.''
 &HT;    Moore's resume includes hits and flops alike, independent
features, modest studio productions and blockbusters in turn. The
actress admits, with a giggle, that there isn't any one
consideration behind her decision-making process.
 &HT;    ``It's often the script,'' she says. ``It's often the character
and it's often the director. Sometimes it's the other actors.
 &HT;    ``I really love to work, so if something in a film interests me
I'll probably do it,'' she concludes. ``Of course, I'd like for as
many elements at once to be there, but's that not always the
case.''
 &HT;    And, oh yes, there's the money. Unlike some other actors, Moore
readily admits that there are some movies she does simply for the
paycheck.
 &HT;    ``I do a movie like `Safe' and I lose money,'' she says.
``People will say, `Why did you do such and such?' and it's like,
`Look, I'm a person. I have a family _ I need to pay my mortgage
and I need to feed my child.'
 &HT;    ``It's not like we all stand around, do parts and people throw
money at us,'' she says with a laugh. ``On some movies we make a
really good living, and on some jobs we make nothing.
 &HT;    ``There are always financial considerations to think about.''
 &HT;    Her next couple of movies, however, definitely are ones she has
her heart in. She reteams with Paul Thomas Anderson, director of
``Boogie Nights,'' for the ensemble drama ``Magnolia,'' and then
co-stars with Sigourney Weaver in ``The Map of the World,'' a
somber piece about a woman (Moore) whose daughter accidentally
drowns while playing in the yard of a neighbor (Weaver).
 &HT;    Then there's ``The End of the Affair,'' based on the Graham
Greene novel. Directed by Neil Jordan, it teams Moore with Ralph
Fiennes and Stephen Rea.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, it's got the most beautiful story in the world,''
Moore says enthusiastically. ``I hadn't read the novel when I read
the script, so I came to it completely cold. I just couldn't
believe it when I finished the script.
 &HT;    ``It's about a writer (Fiennes) who, during World War II, has an
affair with a woman (Moore) who's married to a government employee
(Rea),'' she says. ``It's about what happens to these people's
lives as a result of the affair. It's just a really poetic,
wonderfully moving story about love and grief and human nature.''
 &HT;    Nowadays stories about the fundamental issues of life resonate
with Moore, who in the last couple of years has had her own view of
the world redefined. While shooting ``The Myth of Fingerprints''
(1997), she fell in love with the film's director, Bart Freundlich.
They quickly had a child, Caleb, now 18 months old.
 &HT;    Becoming a mother, Moore says, changed her sense of herself, her
life and the entire world.
 &HT;    ``I don't mean to sound too deep, but it just connects you to
the chain of human events in a really, really wonderful way,''
Moore says. ``That's what was completely unexpected about it for
me.
 &HT;    ``Everybody talks about that and writes about that, but you
don't really understand it until you experience it for yourself,
until you move from being the child to being the parent,'' she
says. ``It's given me a lot of perspective, and that alters how I
approach my life and my work.''
 &HT;    With a mom who's an actress and a dad who directs, the boy seems
all but predestined to be an actor.
 &HT;    ``I think so,'' Moore says with obvious pride. ``Caleb's
wonderfully expressive. Actually, he loves to dance, so we might
have a dancer before we have an actor.''

 (Includes a black-and-white slide of director Alfred Hitchcock at
work.) 
 By LAWRENCE WELLS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There aren't a lot of people still around who worked with
legendary director Alfred Hitchcock in his prime.
 &HT;    But Martin Landau is one of them. This year, which marks
Hitchcock's centennial _ he was born on Aug. 13, 1899, in England _
brings another red-letter day, the 40th anniversary of Landau's
film debut in Hitchcock's classic ``North By Northwest'' (1959).
 &HT;    That film's most memorable scene involves a chase across the
faces of Mt. Rushmore, with two spies (Landau and James Mason)
trying to kill the fleeing hero (Cary Grant).
 &HT;    The scene was Hitchcock's attempt to make up for a misjudgment
in a 1942 film, the actor says.
 &HT;    ``I had a conversation with him about a film he made years
before, called `Saboteur,''' Landau recalls. ``In that movie he
used the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop, and he said he made a big
mistake, because he had Norman Lloyd, who was the bad guy, hanging
off the torch. Lloyd's sleeve tears, and he falls to his death.
Robert Cummings, who I believe was the leading man in that film,
was not in jeopardy.
 &HT;    ``Hitchcock said it was a foolhardy mistake,'' he says,
``because the audience actually wanted the bad guy to die. So
Hitchcock wanted to remedy that with another national monument,
another national shrine, for his setting.''
 &HT;    In 1958, when the movie was filmed, Landau was still years away
from ``Mission Impossible,'' the 1960s television series which made
him famous, and even further from Oscar-nominated roles in Francis
Ford Coppola's ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' (1988) and Woody
Allen's ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' (1989). It would be 36 years
before he was voted Best Supporting Actor for his performance as
Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's ``Ed Wood'' (1994).
 &HT;    The 30-year-old Brooklyn native was still focused on building a
stage career when Hitchcock spotted him in a play called ``Middle
of the Night'' and cast him as Leonard, the sinister sidekick to
Mason's master spy, Vandamm.
 &HT;    ``At the time, when I read the script, I thought it was a
terrific script,'' he recalls. ``I must say that my character was a
bit nebulous. There wasn't very much there.''
 &HT;    The role might have been a simple thug, but Landau added
unexpected nuances, justifying Hitchcock's faith in an actor with
no film experience whatever.
 &HT;    ``I tried to create something interesting and dangerous and
bright,'' he says. ``From my point of view, Leonard was the
smartest guy in the picture. He notices something nobody else
notices _ that there's no bullet hole or blood when Cary gets shot
in the cafeteria at Mt. Rushmore. He's on top of things, and yet
with great economy _ he doesn't waste a move or a gesture or do
anything extraneous.
 &HT;    ``I just felt there was stuff there, even though in terms of
dialogue it wasn't a massive part,'' he says. ``But I felt the time
I was on the screen could be used well, to further the picture,
really, and create more jeopardy and danger.''
 &HT;    Landau also gave Leonard an unstated attraction to his boss.
 &HT;    ``I played him as being homosexual, ever so subtly, which a lot
of people thought was rather risky in the '50s,'' he says, ``but I
saw no reason just to be a henchman. I felt that the triangle, his
jealousy of Eva Marie Saint and James Mason, was a more interesting
take.''
 &HT;    Despite his reputation as a tyrant over actors and crew alike,
Hitchcock gave Landau the latitude to experiment with his
character. Deftly imitating the director's famous British drawl,
the actor offers a look at Hitchcock's working style.
 &HT;    ``He always whispered to people,'' Landau says. ``He never told
me anything. I'd go to him and he'd say, `Marrr-tin, I'll only tell
you if I don't like what you're doing!'
 &HT;    ``He basically had _ people don't know this _ but he had
enormous respect for actors,'' Landau adds. ``He was a provocateur.
Some of the things they said about him, that he treated actors like
cattle, that wasn't so.
 &HT;    ``And he gave you a lot of room to create your character,'' he
says. ``You pretty much knew physically where you were, because
when I was first hired he took me around the office and showed me
the storyboards. I saw the entire movie, shot by shot from
beginning to end, because he did storyboard the entire film.''
 &HT;    In fact, Landau says, if anything he felt nervous because
Hitchcock gave him so little direction.
 &HT;    ``You know, sometimes he'd whisper something to Cary or Eva
Marie or James, and I felt left out,'' he says. ``I'd ask, `What do
you want to tell me?'
 &HT;    ``And he'd say, `I'll only tell you if I don't like what you're
doing.'''
 &HT;    Despite the film's lengthy climax atop Mt. Rushmore, Landau says
that the crew actually spent only a few days at the South Dakota
landmark.
 &HT;    ``We didn't shoot any of the actual climbing scenes there,'' he
says. ``We didn't even shoot inside the cafeteria, though we ate in
the cafeteria _ the cafeteria was built back at MGM to exact scale.
 &HT;    ``The stuff we shot were the scene in the parking lot with Eva
Marie running out, with the faces in the background and some other
scenes,'' he says. ``We were only there a couple of days.''
 &HT;    After the movie opened, park officials protested the so-called
``desecration of the monument.'' Landau rejected this claim at the
time, and still does.
 &HT;    ``There wasn't any desecration,'' he says with a snort. ``It was
about our `alphabet soup' _ the CIA or FBI, Leo Carroll's group _
he even calls it `the alphabet soup' in the movie. We never really
know exactly who are fighting these foreign agents.
 &HT;    ``Mt. Rushmore serves as the essence of our country,'' he says.
``The country endures. The good guys win. The spies _ whoever they
are, obviously international terrorists _ the mountain does them
in. The mountain's spirit prevails. I don't think there's anything
wrong with using that as a background.''
 &HT;    In fact, since then the film has helped to boost tourism at the
monument, just as ``King Kong'' helped to create worldwide
awareness of the Empire State Building.
 &HT;    Like many of Hitchcock's films, the elaborate suspense builds to
a climax which is over practically before it begins.
 &HT;    ``The entire ending of the film takes place in only 40
seconds,'' Landau says with a laugh. ``One moment I'm stepping on
Cary Grant's hand to make him fall and then, in less than a minute,
I get shot, James Mason is caught, Cary is saved, Eva Marie is
saved and they're on their honeymoon, the last shot being of the
train going into the tunnel _ which is somewhat phallic!''
 &HT;    ``North By Northwest'' is in the process of receiving a full
restoration from Turner Entertainment, working from the original
Vistavision camera negatives. The restored version, featuring a
newly revitalized soundtrack as well, will be released to theatres
first and then shown on cable television.
 &HT;    It's appropriately red-carpet treatment for a film whose
reputation has grown steadily over the years, to the pleasure and
amusement of its cast.
 &HT;    ``Every time I ran into Cary Grant,'' Landau recalls, ``he said,
`You know, Martin, we did something right. When I go to colleges on
a lecture tour, the picture they want to talk about most is `North
By Northwest.' Of all the films I've done _ and I've done scads of
them _ this is the one they want to talk about ... I don't know
what the hell it was, but we did something right.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, ``Felicity'' was being hailed by critics as
1998/99's only can't-miss new show _ and also suffering the
customary bashing that comes with front-runner status.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone had an opinion about ``Felicity,'' including plenty of
people who'd never seen a second of it.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the WB drama about a pert California teen (Keri
Russell) who moves to New York to attend college _ and pursue her
handsome high-school classmate, Ben (Scott Speedman) _ has
established itself as a solid hit, not to mention making stars of
Russell, Speedman and Scott Foley, who plays the third leg of their
triangle, the thoroughly decent Noel.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Felicity,'' Russell's biggest credit was a gig on ``The
New Mickey Mouse Club.'' Speedman had virtually no acting
experience, having been cast purely on the basis of a killer
audition tape.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Russell says, getting used to the show has been much
like the adjustments their characters have gone through as
first-year college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a parallel there,'' she says. ``None of us
knew what to expect when this all started. This show was a lot
different from anything I had ever worked on before, and it took
some adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when I first signed onto the show, I was so
excited, but I was also so scared,'' she recalls. ``It was
completely overwhelming. Now I feel like I know what's going on,
and I know how to handle all the publicity and craziness. I have a
better sense of awareness, and I know how to pace myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedman says he never felt overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody kept telling me what a crazy year it was going to
be,'' he says, ``but it wasn't. I mean, it was crazy at times, but
that was mostly because of the workload and long hours. It was
pretty weird, but not that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As the title character, Russell naturally got a more
concentrated version of the hype. She's become used to seeing her
character dissected as a role model _ and faring better than such
past victims as Murphy Brown or Ally McBeal _ and says she's been
delighted by the show's fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get tons of letters,'' she says, ``and everyone is just
completely cool. It's the same thing with the way people respond in
public _ they're pretty laid back: They don't come up screaming,
`There's Felicity!' They usually just come up and say, `We think
your show is so cool.'
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to be a little calmer, I guess, compared to fans
of other shows,'' she adds. ``But those are the type of people the
show attracts. Our viewers are really intelligent. They're not
screaming, unless it's a pack of 12-year-old boys or something.
They always have positive things to say about the show, so for the
most part it's been great.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedman adds that the difference is more noticeable when they
get away from Los Angeles, which he says prides itself on letting
celebrities alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many actors down there, they can't tell one from
the next,'' he says. ``It's when you go to a small town that it
gets kind of strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans seem to be really polite,'' he says. ``They're not
overwhelming. We've got a small, really hardcore audience. Those
people who've come up to me are just really polite.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the fans do get excited about, however, is Felicity's
vacillating between her longstanding crush on the often-arrogant
Ben and her new interest in the lower-key Noel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the neighborhood I live in, there's an all-girl school,''
Russell says. ``I would be riding my bike to the post office or
whatever, and these girls would always come up to me and ask who I
liked better, Ben or Noel. Then they would chant, `Noel! Noel!
You've got to choose Noel!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the occasional few of them liked Ben,'' she says with a
joking sneer at Speedman. ``But I really liked the idea that girls
like Noel best, because he's definitely more of a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period for about a month last season where Ben
just got hit with one thing after another,'' Speedman says
defensively. ``He had a gambling problem, and so on. There was no
good news for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the writers make Noel a really pleasant guy, so there's
not much comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   The series began as a star turn for Russell, but seems to be
evolving into an ensemble show _ a development which she says suits
her just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the idea that we've become an ensemble cast,'' the
actress says. ``And it did make things a bit easier on me. I'm
still working a lot, but it's a lot easier than those first few
episodes, when I was in almost every scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also some really talented people in our cast,''
Speedman adds. ``They deserve their chance, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' fans rave about the show's music, which offers a
much wider range than most teen shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely love the music on our show,'' Russell says,
beaming. ``Our music supervisor, Amanda Demme, is fabulous. Look at
our soundtrack album that was just released _ it has people like
Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, Aretha Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just teenybopper little songs,'' she says. ``It's the
same kind of music that I like listening to.''
</P>
<P>
   The series seems likely to continue indefinitely, but Speedman
doubts that it will rack up anything like the nine-year run of
``Beverly Hills, 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all, like, 40 years old now,'' he groans. ``That show
is like a factory, just pushing out product. I'd leave the show if
we ever got like that _ which isn't likely to happen. Our show is
so different. We have great writers, and the quality control is
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as much as either is willing to say about the future.
Nothing closer-range _ such as how they'll resolve last season's
teaser ending, which left Felicity torn between going to Europe
with Noel or driving home to California with Ben.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to know what happens,'' Russell says, laughing.
``So many people have been asking me that question. And they're
just writing the new season right now, so it's still up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of know what's going to happen,'' she says teasingly,
``but I have to keep quiet.''

BUSH MAY NEED A DRAMATIC MOVE, LIKE ELIZABETH DOLE AS VP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the expected Democratic and Republican nominees for
president have formally announced their intentions, both might be
thinking, even at this early stage, about running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Many nominees generally use the other side of their tickets to
shore up geographically weak areas, or to give balance to their
political philosophies. Still, the conventional wisdom is that vice
presidential nominees, regardless of who they are or where they're
from, have little influence with voters in their choice for
president.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Texas Governor George W. Bush, the early GOP
frontrunner, wins the party's nomination, his choice of a vice
presidential running mate might be crucial to defeating Vice
President Al Gore Jr., the expected Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conventional wisdom, Bush might greatly enhance his
chances of becoming the next President if he does something
extraordinary in picking his running mate. While choosing an
African-American woman or African-American man of Colin Powell's
stature could wrest much of the black vote from Gore, it might
prove a move that the conservative GOP simply would not accept.
</P>
<P>
   The next best thing for Bush would be to select Elizabeth Dole
as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush makes such a move, Gore could easily counter with his
choice of a running mate _ someone like US Senator Dianne Feinstein
of California.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is popular, he might not be popular enough to attract
a majority of mainstream voters to his candidacy or to the
candidacies of other Republicans in the House and Senate. As polls
reflected during the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal and the impeachment
trial, nearly two-thirds of the electorate supported President
Clinton throughout the ordeal, which helped him defeat Republican
efforts to convict him on the charges arising from his involvement
with former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls also showed that a majority of women, if not
supporting Clinton, were clearly critical of the GOP's impeachment
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party is still wounded from its defeats at the
hands of Clinton, and is still in danger of losing control of the
House and Senate in the next election. And the Republican-led
successful effort last week against tightened gun control laws may
hurt the GOP's prospects even more.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's current hold on the majority of mainstream voters,
which undoubtedly will help Gore, has been enhanced with NATO's _
and his _ recent win in the Kosovo crisis. His popularity rose even
higher because he was able to conduct a successful air war without
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton's popularity and the strong economy continue, those
attributes will give Gore more political impetus in his expected
battle with Bush. Thus, despite Gore's well-known stiff demeanor
and slow, often boring cadence in his speeches, he will still be a
formidable opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has a strong image as a ``clean'' candidate that
should work well in the post-Clinton era.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's kickoff was well received around the nation,
moving him even higher in the polls among other GOP contenders as
well as against Gore, he still carries a lot of negative Republican
baggage with him that is still filled with the GOP-led impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To help win back some of the strong support Clinton received
from the nation's women during the scandal and trial, Bush just may
need to do something extraordinary for a Republican. And not much
would be more extraordinary than to have a woman such as Dole on
the GOP ticket to help soften the overall negative image that many
women have toward the party.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits might argue that having a woman on the ticket
certainly did not help Democratic presidential nominee Walter
Mondale in 1984 when he set the precedent by bringing aboard
Geraldine Ferarro as his running mate. But Ferraro, it turned out,
had her own problems that did more harm than good to Mondale's
campaign. It was also a different era. Women have even a larger say
today in the nation's political life.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason why Bush might need Dole as a running mate is the
motor voter bill _ allowing citizens to register to vote while
registering their cars _ that was passed in 1995. That bill has
added as many as 10 million African-Americans to the voting lists
across the country. The bill has worked to the advantage of Clinton
and other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage that Gore may have over Bush is ``Clinton the
fund-raiser,'' especially after his air war success over Kosovo. He
is one of the biggest fund-raisers for Gore and other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Hillary Clinton's expected run for the US Senate
seat in New York. Her campaign would attract women not only to her
campaign, but to Gore's as well. Hillary has been popular with
women.
</P>
<P>
   One more aspect that is likely to work in Gore's favor is the
Rev. Jesse Jackson factor. Jackson, whose own popularity soared
with his successful effort to have several American soldiers
released by Serbian authorities, is likely to be a signficant
player in the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's presence will help bring out a strong African-American
vote, and he will help maintain the coalition of blacks, Hispanics,
liberals and elderly voters that supported Clinton in the past.
</P>
<P>
   There is also one more factor that will help Gore in his
campaign against Bush: organized labor. It's no surprise that one
of Gore's campaign themes is to help working families.
</P>
<P>
   With help from the Bill and Hillary Clinton, Jackson, the motor
voter bill, and organized labor, Gore could win without having a
woman on the ticket _ but having a running mate such as Feinstein
certainly would not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, might not be able to win without doing
something new and extraordinary, such as Elizabeth Dole on the
ticket.

FASTER AND SAFER ON THE OPEN ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a sometime Young Man in a Hurry _ I was once pulled over by a
New Hampshire state trooper for driving at a speed he claimed to
have clocked in the low three digits _ I absorbed with a pang the
news of Montana's surrender to the forces of automotive
correctness. Until last month, Montana had kept its highways
blessedly free of speed limits. State law permitted motorists to
drive as fast as they liked during daylight hours, so long as their
speed was ``reasonable and prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Montanabahn is no more. Earlier this year the state's
Supreme Court struck down the law for vagueness, leaving lawmakers
with little choice but to bridle their constituents with a speed
limit. On May 28, the Montana Highway Patrol began pulling over
drivers going faster than 75 m.p.h. and giving them _ ugh _
speeding tickets.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, even libertarian-leaning young men in a hurry don't
object to speed limits per se _ only to those that are too low.
Most drivers on most roads will travel at the ``reasonable and
prudent'' speed for that road, regardless of the posted limit.
Countless studies have shown that raising or lowering speed limits
has little effect on the speed at which traffic moves. That is why
average highway speeds climbed by only 3 m.p.h. when the 55 m.p.h.
limit was repealed in 1995. Drivers were already moving at the
higher speed; the repeal just meant that they were no longer doing
so illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 55 m.p.h. speed limit was arguably the most disobeyed
federal law in American history,'' writes Stephen Moore of the Cato
Institute in a new monograph. Its major effect, he concludes, was
to create ``a nation of scofflaws'' _ and to generate a booming
trade in CB radios and radar detectors. Countless drivers objected
to the law, and with reason. What sense did it make to tell
motorists in Bozeman that they could drive no faster than motorists
in Boston? You didn't have to be a states-rights fanatic to believe
that Washington had no business setting speed limits for every
highway in America.
</P>
<P>
   The repeal of the 55 m.p.h. limit was one of the most popular
accomplishments of the new Republican Congress. The bill sailed
through the Senate, 80-16; the House passed it unanimously. But
from highway-safety lobbyists, consumer activists, and the Clinton
administration came dire warnings. ``History will never forgive
Congress for this assault on the sanctity of human life,'' Ralph
Nader thundered. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena declared,
``Allowing speed limits to rise above 55 simply means that more
Americans will die and be injured on our highways.''
</P>
<P>
   They even specified the number of casualties. Judith Stone, the
head of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, went on the
``Today'' show to foretell ``6,400 added highway fatalities a year
and millions more injuries.'' Over and over that figure was
repeated: If speed limits went above 55, the annual highway body
count would soar by 6,400.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. Speed limits have been raised in every state
save Hawaii, yet highway fatalities last year totaled 41,480 _ 337
fewer than in 1995, the last year the 55 m.p.h. limit was in
effect. And those 6,400 additional deaths? ``We never said it was
going to happen overnight,'' Judith Stone told USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Moore points out that the lower number of auto fatalities
actually understates the good news. Each year, more vehicles are
driven and more miles traveled; so the meaningful highway safety
statistic is not the number of automobile deaths, but the death
rate _ the number of fatalities per 100 million miles traveled.
That figure has been dropping since the 1920s, and the recent rise
in speed limits didn't arrest the trend. Between 1995 and 1998, the
death rate fell another 7.5 percent. America's highways have never
been safer.
</P>
<P>
   And that is true for virtually every yardstick of safety.
Injuries? There were 3.46 million auto-related injuries in 1995 vs.
3.25 million in 1998. Pedestrian deaths? Down 300 since the speed
limits were raised. Car crashes? The 1998 data haven't been
released, but as of 1997, the crash rate per 100 million
vehicle-miles had fallen to 264 _ a drop of more than 4 percent
since 1995. There is no getting around it. Highway speed went up;
highway deaths and injuries didn't.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly bitter opponent of higher speed limits is the
auto insurance industry, which has argued for years that faster
speeds will mean more accidents, more deaths, swollen insurance
costs, and higher premiums. ``Yet during 1997 and 1998,'' reports
Moore, ``auto claims and auto insurance premiums have dramatically
declined _ reversing a decade of higher costs. Collision claims
were down 3.1 percent in 1997 and bodily injury claims fell by a
huge 4.7 percent.'' The drop in claims was so favorable that State
Farm Insurance was able to rebate $900 million to policyholders in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   So why do insurers denounce higher speeds so hotly? Could it be
that what they really object to is not the higher limit, but the
fact that fewer drivers will be ticketed for speeding _ and thus
not subject to ``unsafe driver'' premium hikes?
</P>
<P>
   The 55 m.p.h. speed limit was widely flouted and roundly
resented, and not just by reckless young men in a hurry. Tens of
millions of ordinary drivers routinely ignored the law. Turns out
they were right. Three years after 55 was repealed, we're saving
time, saving money, and saving lives. Who said speed kills?

HOUSE BLEW IT ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's not a political problem, but a medical one. Maybe the
Centers for Disease Control can explain better than the National
Rifle Association how the US House of Representatives went from
tone deaf to stone deaf in only six months.
</P>
<P>
   After December's impeachment follies, it did not seem possible
that congressmen could be any more out of touch with the people
they were elected to represent. Then came last week's debate on
juvenile violence and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the House fulminate into the wee hours of the morning
about the ``cultural causes'' of violence, only to cast a few
meaningless votes denouncing Hollywood and embracing the Ten
Commandments, was positively surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Were these guys all out hunting squirrel last month when the
public forced their Republican colleagues in the Senate to reverse
themselves and get behind some moderate regulations on firearms?
</P>
<P>
   Is their attention span really so short that they think
Columbine is already Saturday's news, only eight weeks after the
slaughter of 13 and the suicides of two teenage gunmen in a
Littleton, Colo., high school?
</P>
<P>
   No one expects an easy consensus on gun control. Americans
differ too fundamentally on the meaning of the Second Amendment to
the Constitution. Those who think the framers were talking about a
militia will never agree with those who interpret the right to bear
arms as authorization to carry a concealed weapon. But, as the
millennium turns and this nation grows more violent, it serves no
one's interests to carry out this debate at the extremes.
</P>
<P>
   That's just where it occurred last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a bizarre coalition of liberal Democrats and
conservative Republicans formally killed a bill designed to help
keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals. But efforts
to regulate firearms really died the night before when 45 Democrats
joined Republicans to squeeze out a 218-211 vote to limit the
regulation of sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Democrat who did in gun control this year. It's no
secret that Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan has been
seething at Bill Clinton for five years about the Republican
takeover of the House. He blames the loss of Democratic control of
the chamber on the vote to ban assault weapons, a ban he supported
under duress and has regretted ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. It was a tough vote for Dingell, an enthusiastic
hunter and a former board member of the NRA, an organization that
poured millions of dollars into the campaign to defeat Democrats
that year. Dingell paid a price when the House fell to the GOP,
losing his chairmanship of the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But this week he debased the legislative process and the chamber
he has served for 44 years, the longest tenure of any House member.
Dingell's line in the sand was a piddling provision to mandate a
72-hour waiting period to check the background of buyers at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Is that really so onerous? The same waiting period is in effect
for those who buy handguns under the Brady bill. Dingell
characterized a three-day waiting period as ``harassment of
law-abiding citizens.'' Please. What law-abiding citizen has so
urgent a need for firepower that he can't wait 72 hours to reassure
his neighbors of his unblemished record?
</P>
<P>
   The polarization in Congress on gun control frustrates the
national will to have a rational conversation about the limits of
individual freedom and the measures necessary to ensure public
safety. Voters are not nearly as fixated as Dingell on fears about
his party's political prospects in 2000 and his personal desire to
regain a powerful committee chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a moment that made one wonder last week whether a
rogue virus had infected the House, it was when gun control
opponents _ including Dingell _ gave a standing ovation to
Representative Carolyn McCarthy, the New York Democrat whose
husband was killed and son critically wounded during a shooting
spree on the Long Island Railroad in 1993. She argued passionately
and tearfully that any small inconvenience to gun buyers caused by
the longer waiting period she championed was more than offset by
the gain in public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Why the disconnect between her words and their votes? Why the
gulf between her grief and their deeds?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the answer is the power of the NRA. Or maybe it's time to
call in the CDC.

ERIC BOGOSIAN HAS NOTHING BUT QUESTIONS ON HIS MIND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON -- Listening to Eric Bogosian talk is a bit like watching
a one-man intellectual Ping-Pong match: He's been having a heated
debate with himself, on and off the stage, since he began writing
and performing solo shows 20 years ago. Should he sell his soul to
Hollywood or should he devote himself to art? Is he simply ``the
guy in the Steven Seagal movie'' (``Under Siege 2: Dark
Territory'') or is he a philosopher/playwright? Is he a brooding
cynic, deliberately detached from the main, or is he just another
middle-class mensch with a wife, two kids, and a picket fence? Is
he arrogant and self-centered, or is he terrified of ``losing his
chops''? Is he a ``dangerous bad guy'' or a ``boring middle-aged
putz''?
</P>
<P>
   The answers depend on the situation and the time of day _ that
is, if you can get any answer at all. ``I'm a question guy, not an
answer guy,'' he says, admitting that he is full of clashing
convictions. The endless introspection, fraught with nervous
energy, finds its way into his art. ``There are days when I'm
feeling sharp and smart, and then there are days when I'm feeling
insecure,'' he says. ``I mine all those thoughts for the dark days,
and I put all the pettiness and selfishness into my characters. I
make work about all the petty, stupid stuff, but at the same time,
I hear that other voice about a higher plane of values.'' A pause.
``Oh, God, this is so full of. . . .'' Inner contradictions, if you
will.
</P>
<P>
   Life for Bogosian is a never-ending point-counterpoint. Voices
bounce around in his head, and those contrary thoughts find their
way into his latest work, ``Wake Up and Smell the Coffee,'' which
opens a weeklong engagement Tuesday at the American Repertory
Theatre in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In such celebrated early works as ``Sex, Drugs, Rock &AMP; Roll''
and ``Drinking in America,'' the chameleonlike performer presented
a gallery of characters, folks like the fatuous producer, the
vacuous pill popper, and the unctuous preacher. He paraded these
sharply etched portraits onstage one after the other, but in the
new show, he mixes them up for the first time, interrupting his own
monologues with competing characters. He connects all these voices
with a leitmotif about a plane crash. ``The whole mind-set of the
piece is about ambition and crashing in America today,'' he says.
``What happens in airports is a lot of waiting and running. Just
waiting in line seems to be the contemporary condition.''
</P>
<P>
   And you know what happens when you wait in line. You think. You
question. You obsess. That seems to be the Bogosian condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a point in my life where I'm looking over my shoulder
and saying, `Who am I, and what have I been doing for the last 20
years?' '' says Bogosian, 46. ``Because I talk so much about
issues, I really have to ask myself, `Yeah, so? You have all these
smartass things to say, and what good does it do, really?' That's
an honest question I ask myself, and it comes up in the
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, so?
</P>
<P>
   ``I beg the question,'' he says. ``Maybe the answer is felt by
the audience. The more we try to explain it, the more we're missing
the point. It's like when you study Shakespeare, all you talk about
is the plot lines and the ideas and the themes and the history of
whether there really was a Hamlet. But when people went and saw
those plays originally, they didn't think about any of that stuff.
If you overintellectualize this stuff, you kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Explaining himself
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he says he hates trying to explain himself
publicly, but on the other hand, he isn't afraid to call a reporter
and ask for an interview. ``The work should speak for itself, but
you gotta be on the drive-time show at 7 a.m. and have some DJ go,
`All right, we got Eric Bogosian here, and he's really wild.' What
I would really prefer to be is J. D. Salinger and say, `Here's the
work. Goodbye.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Bogosian also allows that he's flirted with celebrity over
the years, appearing in more than a dozen films, including the
Seagal action picture. He starred in the film adaptation of his
play ``Talk Radio,'' which was directed by Oliver Stone. His play
``subUrbia'' was also made into a film. Today he says he lives in
``a kind of twilight zone of semi-celebrity,'' hardly J. D.
Salinger. But now that he's well into his 40s _ ``I'm so old; I
look terrible'' _ he isn't as conflicted as he once was about
alternating the film work and the stage work. He also isn't
interested in projecting the image of the angry young man he
cultivated when he left his native Woburn for the New York
performance art scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of Woburn, coming out of the '60s, coming out of
the downtown New York punk scene, I carried all this attitude,'' he
says. ``I think shedding that attitude is part of my journey. Maybe
it's OK to admit at the end of the day that I'm nothing more than a
sort of bookish, wimpy guy. I get into my feelings, but then I
really can't stand doing that in the end, so I have to diss that as
well. It really is like living in an echo chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought leads to another stream of assertions and
contradictions. He is delving into spirituality, reading ancient
texts, but then again, he hates evangelical hypocrisy, and he
skewers it in his show. He has gotten over his irrational fears,
but then again, he's terrified of cable cars and roller coasters
and any vehicle that goes clank.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Angst making art
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It goes on and on, this endless self-scrutiny. ``I guess I'm a
little crazy, but I wouldn't be able to make work if I wasn't,'' he
says. ``As long as it isn't hurting me or making me feel bad _
well, it sort of makes me feel bad at times _ but that's who I am,
and that's always been the case. It's not the bogeyman that it was
when I was a kid, and today, I actually feel blessed that that's
the way my head works.''
</P>
<P>
   Those blessed contradictions infuse ``Wake Up and Smell the
Coffee,'' which is directed by Bogosian's wife, Jo Bonney. Bogosian
uses his nervous energy and angst to create a cacophony of voices
that mirrors his own chaotic thought process _ and, by extension,
reflects the overwhelming and competing forms of communication of
the information age.
</P>
<P>
   Bogosian has been honing the piece for four years; it has
changed since he performed it at Trinity Repertory Company in
Providence in 1995. He says there's nothing he loves more than
working on his plays, and there's nothing more terrifying than the
fear of losing his writer's touch. (Except maybe cable cars.) He
despaired in 1997 when his then-new play, ``Griller,'' performed at
the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, was poorly received. ``I didn't
solve the play, and when I really applied myself, I still couldn't
figure it out,'' he confesses. ``I think I'm afraid of losing my
chops or not being as smart as I want to be. That's really scary.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's now free to labor on his plays; the occasional
Hollywood gigs provide financial security and support his art. ``I
make money so I can write plays, whether anyone wants me to or
not,'' he says. ``That's the sort of scary existential situation
that I've been passing through over the last five or six years.
I've had more and more freedom to do whatever the hell I want.''
But even that raises a final question. ``Then you say, `So what is
that? So do it already. Shut up.' ''

WORLD CUP SPONSORS HELP SHAPE IMAGE OF WOMEN IN TEAM SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For generations, throngs of sports fans have cheered for men
playing team sports. Are they now ready to cheer for women?
</P>
<P>
   The three-week-long Women's World Cup soccer tournament is
under &UR;  &LR; way across the country, providing women who play team sports
with a huge and rare opportunity to capture the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors and licensed manufacturers, through marketing
and retail campaigns, will play key roles in determining whether
women will now reap some of the popular acclaim and commercial
success long enjoyed by men's professional sports. So far,
businesses like what they see in the emerging image of women in the
plucky, demanding sport of soccer, and they are promoting the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's no question that an event that's strictly
women athletes, that's sold over a half-million tickets, and which
1 billion viewers will watch on television worldwide, has the
potential to set a new standard for women's sports,'' said Dean
Stoyer, who helped design Nike's multimillion-dollar marketing
campaign that features Mia Hamm, the star of the US team.
</P>
<P>
   While individual women competing in golf, tennis, and figure
skating have struggled for years to claim some of the spotlight
from men, only the Women's National Basketball Association and the
playing of the Women's World Cup in the United States have provided
significant financial opportunities in the team sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, women athletes had been almost untouchables when it
came to things like endorsing products,'' said Bob Williams,
president of the Burns Celebrity Sports Service, a Chicago-based
company that links advertisers and athletes. ``In the mid-'90s
there was an explosion, but it was figure skaters like Nancy
Kerrigan or tennis stars like Martina Hingis and the Williams
sisters, Venus and Serena. Only now are we getting any action for
team sport players, like Cheryl Swoopes in basketball and, now, in
a very large way, Mia Hamm in soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer has endured growing pains, striving to become a major
sport in this country. But observers say it might be different for
the women. For one thing, unlike the men's national team, the women
win. They took the first Women's World Cup in 1991, the gold medal
at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and they are favored to win this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``America likes winners and big events _ and we like being
identified with them as a company,'' said Bruce Hudson, director of
international sports marketing for Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc.
``We were the first out of the box with a commercial during the
men's World Cup last year that had lots of action footage, and
helped create an image for a group of women players who clearly
have become more and more popular with a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The image is becoming so popular that Mattel is selling Women's
World Cup Barbie dolls at prominent store displays around the
country. Gillette Co. has clamored to position its stadium signs in
prominent spots for the international television exposure. And the
Allstate Insurance Co. decided to be an official sponsor of the
tournament, the first time in the 67-year history of the company
that it has sponsored athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about it because it clearly helps us with a
target audience of younger women with families,'' said Raleigh
Ford, a marketing spokesman for Allstate.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the intersection of two significant demographic
trends makes the current Women's World Cup attractive to
corporations: Women and girls are participating in team sports in
greater numbers than ever, with big increases in this decade, and
women continue to be the pre-eminent decision makers on retail
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is what you might call the children of the Title
IX generation causing a huge leap in participation levels by women
and girls in sports that were long the preserve of male athletes.
The question becomes, will that translate in the next generation,
the grandchildren of Title IX, to popularity among spectators and
television viewers,'' said Robert Madrigal, of the University of
Oregon's Warsaw Sports Marketing Center. Passed into law in 1972,
Title IX mandated equitable opportunities to play sports for girls
attending schools that receive federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Women's World Cup could be a hugely important development
_ especially if the US women do well _ and if the companies that
were smart enough to get involved are smart with their marketing,''
Madrigal said.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the importance of a sports event is whether
Adidas and Nike fight over sponsorship _ and they are fighting over
the Women's World Cup. Adidas, the largest manufacturer of soccer
shoes and equipment in the world, has joined 10 other companies in
paying $6 million to be an official sponsor. Adidas is using the
trademarks of the tournament in its advertising, along with
pictures of members of the US women's team, like Kristine Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   However, Nike has refused to be eclipsed, embracing the event by
financing a national tour of the US team that began last year. Nike
also has launched the sort of marketing campaign featuring Hamm
that it once used to make Michael Jordan a national icon, even
using Jordan in some of the spots with Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   In one TV commercial, Hamm and Jordan challenge each other in a
variety of sports from sprinting to fencing while a woman's voice
sings, ``Anything you can do, I can do better. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always sold casual footwear well to women and girls,
but this is a battle for the performance footwear market, which is
really growing among female consumers,'' Nike's Stoyer said. ``From
1991 to 1998, there's been an 86 percent growth rate in the number
of girls participating on soccer at the high school level and a 120
percent increase in college. We want those new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked with Mia since 1994, and I can tell you that if
Mia Hamm wants to wear it, you can be pretty sure that a lot of
14-year-old girls are going to want to wear it, too,'' Stoyer said.
``Once, they wanted to be like Mike. Now, they want to be like
Mia.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm now appears as a spokeswoman for at least 15 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other women players on the US soccer team who have garnered
endorsement contracts with various companies include Briana Scurry,
Brandi Chastain, Tiffeny Milbrett and Tisha Venturini.
</P>
<P>
   As Nike's Jordan commercials proved, such marketing benefits not
only the company, but it helps create the image and mythology of
the sport. Basketball was still in recovery from the drug scandals
of the 1970s and early 1980s when the Jordan commercials began to
air, and they helped revitalize the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of women's sports are hoping for something of the same for
women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new is the sense that this has never happened for women
in team sports,'' said Lucy Danzinger, editor of Women's Sports &AMP;
Fitness. ``This girl gang of passionate soccer players is being
allowed to compete in a way that only men have competed before.
And, well, it's about time. We're thrilled!''

   BLACK-SAILOR-PARDON (Naval Weapons Base Concord, Calif.) _
During World War II, an explosion on a segregated naval base here
killed 320 men. After the accident, black sailors were ordered to
resume loading ammunition onto ships. Fifty of them refused, were
court-martialed by an all-white panel, found guilty of mutiny and
imprisoned. Now, in an extraordinary legal battle, lawyers for one
black veteran have filed for a presidential pardon arguing that the
black sailors failed to follow orders out of legitimate fear and
had no intent to mutiny. The petition pits the racial symbolism of

   MEDICAID-DENTAL (Manchester, N.H.) _ Even though the vast
majority of the poorest Americans, particularly children, are
covered by Medicaid for dental care, they are not getting it. Why
not? Several reasons, experts say. Most dentists tend to be loath
to take Medicaid patients because the program scrimps on payments

<P>
   EXPERIMENTAL-PATIENTS (Undated) _ Chronically ill patients with
limited or no health insurance are increasingly filling a demand
for experimental drug study participants as drug companies rush
record numbers of new medications through the testing process. For
these people, experiments have become treatments; clinical
investigators are their specialists. But the benefit can be
fleeting or nonexistent. Chronically ill patients with no other
options can be treated with an experimental medication that does
not work or that even worsens their condition. Or they can end up
with a placebo rather than the medication itself. And once the
study is over, usually in a matter of weeks, they are left to their
own devices. By Gina Kolata and Kurt Eichenwald. Eds: May hold.

careers and companies derailed by bungled mergers, Walter Shipley
has quietly pulled off two of the biggest banking mergers in
history, folding Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical and Chase
Manhattan together to create a leader in the rapidly changing
financial services business. And Shipley, who retired as Chase's
chief executive on June 1 but will remain chairman, has advice for
dealmeisters hoping to ride America's merger wave: Slash-and-burn
takeovers will come back to haunt you. ``Our philosophy is that the
best is when both sides feel they've come out winners,'' he said.
By Timothy L. O'Brien.

   EUROPE-COKE (Undated) _ Developments: Coca-Cola meets with
Belgian officials over lifting a ban on Coke, Fanta and Sprite and
takes out full-page ads in French newspapers to reassure consumers.
The European Union has asked Belgium and France to investigate
further why more than 200 people got sick after drinking Coca-Cola.
By Constance L. Hays.

MEYEROWITZ TRANSFERS PHOTO TALENT TO `POP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
POP 
Produced and directed by: Joel Meyerowitz 
Date: Tuesday, 9 p.m. 
On: PBS 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well known and respected for his color photography, Joel
Meyerowitz has now made a film, his first, called ``Pop.'' Produced
for ``Frontline,'' it's a highly personal account of a road trip
Meyerowitz took with his elderly father, who was suffering with
Alzheimer's disease, from the older man's adopted home in Florida
to the block in the Bronx where the family lived when Joel was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Meyerowitz's acclaimed still photography is so finely attuned to
his sense of geometric form and the brilliance of light, it was
hard to imagine him being comfortable with moving images. Would he
be able to relax his control enough to give the family chronicle
air and life? Wouldn't he helplessly overwhelm the human themes
with obsessive attention to painterly images?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple, and gladdening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop'' is a filial love poem driven naturally by the dynamic of
Hy Meyerowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, son Joel can't suppress his formal artistry, so the
hourlong film offers some striking images _ of stringent Atlantic
seascapes, fine low skies filmed through the car windshield,
elegant-looking human shadows cast on the side of a stucco
building.
</P>
<P>
   But the foreground of this memorable nonfiction film is, as it
should be, filled by the irrepressible 87-year-old Meyerowitz. He's
a failing but somehow indestructible and enormously likable little
man: onetime Golden Gloves lightweight boxing champ, expressively
loving father of three sons he doesn't clearly remember, and a kind
of poet in spite of, or perhaps because of, his loosening grasp on
normal language.
</P>
<P>
   There is some wistfulness in this father-son journey (which also
included Joel's son Sasha), a sense of things past and passing.
``What do I do, Pop?'' Joel asks his dad en route, trying to
exercise the older man's blurring memory. ``You're a doll. Number
One,'' Hy pipes up from the rear seat. Does it bother him that he
can't clearly remember his sons' jobs and lives, Joel asks next.
``Well, I tell you, yeah. I see them. Hello . . . goodbye.'' In a
heart-wrenching riff shadowed with grief, apropos of nothing much,
Hy says, ``Everybody, I'm sure, is sorry they have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But almost everything that should seem sad or perhaps angle down
a dark pathway, paradoxically, doesn't. Despite occasional
unfounded worries that his 86-year-old wife is cheating on him, Hy
is a repository of love, and the film is charged with his vesuvial
affections. No matter what else he is losing, has lost, Hy's love
for people and life itself seems undiminished. It's as though
perhaps we're seeing his very core, all the more visible for his
loss of various past powers and defenses. His heart seems like a
furnace, warming waitresses, theme-park patrons, random folks he
buttonholes on streets in Southern backwaters or his blighted old
Bronx neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Where many filmmakers doing a film about a loved one end up
really telling a story about themselves, Joel Myerowitz doesn't.
He's very present, of course, but never in the way, and,
mercifully, he never steps on Hy's wonderful lines. Hy says so much
that is memorably rich with emotion, nothing more so than: ``My
life _ it wasn't much, but it was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to some wonderfully edited and deployed clips from family
home movies, we see that life in tender bloom. The athletic young
father balancing one of his sons on an outstretched hand; the
competent young adult Hy when he was considered arbiter of
neighborhood disputes and known as ``the mayor''; and Hy larking
with wife Sally, both of them moving in the stately slo-mo that
imparts a dreamy quality to the footage from the past.
</P>
<P>
   One peculiarity about ``Pop'' throws it slightly off balance.
That is the presence of Sasha, who interacts only briefly, although
endearingly, with his grandfather and very little with his own dad,
the filmmaker. It appears that Sasha may be on board mainly to help
with the filmmaking. But his role isn't properly explained, leaving
us with nagging questions about this rather elusive youngest
Meyerowitz, and the sense that ``Pop'' might have been, but for
some reason isn't, more about the interconnectedness of three
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Hy, though, was certainly meant to be the focus of this
celebratory portrait. In many ways, he seems the very soul of
optimism. With good reasons to complain, he rarely does. On the
contrary, as he says on the phone one day to his wife back in
Florida, ``To my limit, I'm having what I like.''

SLIMMED-DOWN `JUNETEENTH' LEAVES UNANSWERED QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VENISE WAGNER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Random House publication of Ralph Ellison's ``Juneteenth''
is Ellison's vision according to John Callahan, an Ellison scholar,
his literary executor and friend.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan has carefully pared Ellison's unfinished 1,500-page
manuscript into a trim, neatly structured 354-page novel. And he
chose the title.
</P>
<P>
   As with any vision based on someone's other than the visionary,
there must be departures. Here, Callahan imposed a structure on an
unwieldy narrative that he said spiraled out of control. Ellison,
Callahan has explained, was determined to fold everything from his
experience in hometown Oklahoma into an American epic that pulled
together the country's disparate cultural threads.
</P>
<P>
   Though Callahan's editing was limited mostly to creating a ready
structure for readers, it's a severe edit that in the end leaves
the reader wondering what Ellison's vision might have been had he
finished it. But just as we read the Gospel according to the
disciples wondering which rendition best captures the time, we
should read ``Juneteenth'' as, if nothing else, a guide to better
understanding Ellison's literary aim and the obstacles that
obscured a finish.
</P>
<P>
   We can't say for sure that the famed author of the 1952 classic,
``Invisible Man,'' would have succeeded in fitting the pieces of
his manuscript together. He had been struggling with the work for
the last 40 years of his life, which ended at the age of 80 in
1994. So it might be safe to say there was no solution. It didn't
help that writer's block plagued Ellison after a 1967 fire in his
Massachusetts farmhouse destroyed extensive revisions of the
manuscript, revisions that presumably had brought him closer to
completion of his vision.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Ellison's vision came out of the premise that black
culture has marked all of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize no American culture which is not the partial
creation of black people,'' Ellison told author James Alan
McPherson in a 1969 interview. ``I recognize no American style in
literature, in dance, in music, even in assembly-line processes,
which does not bear the mark of the American Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   We see Ellison's position clearly in ``Invisible Man'' as the
protagonist learns from work in a paint factory that the whitest
white is made with a drop of black.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bold statement in a country that for generations has held
that American culture is white. In an essay from ``Thirteen Ways of
Looking at a Black Man,'' Henry Louis Gates Jr. states that Ellison
and close friend Albert Murray held tight to the assertion that the
truest Americans were black. For Ellison and Murray, said Gates,
being American does not mean being white. It means, in large part,
being inextricably linked to blackness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, literary critics and historians continually deny American
culture's link and indebtedness to African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In her extended essay, ``Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the
Literary Imagination,'' Toni Morrison says this denial maintains
that the canon of American literature is ``free of, uninformed and
unshaped by the four-hundred-year-old presence of, first Africans
and then African-Americans in the United States. It assumes that
this presence _ which shaped the body politic, the Constitution and
the entire history of the culture _ has had no significant place or
consequence in the origin and development of that culture's
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Juneteenth,'' white America's denial of its
African-American heritage is personified in Sen. Adam Sunraider, a
light-skinned man of indefinite race who shuns his rearing in rural
Georgia as a black boy named Bliss. Sunraider reinvents himself,
severing ties with the only family he knew: the Rev. Alonzo
Hickman, who raised Bliss as his own, and Hickman's congregation.
</P>
<P>
   In his reinvention, Sunraider becomes a flimflam movie man and
later a politician, turning the very oratorical skills that Hickman
taught him into weapons against blacks.
</P>
<P>
   When Hickman gets word that Sunraider's life is in danger, he
and his congregation go to the senator's office to warn him. The
secretary promptly turns them away. But Hickman is persistent.
</P>
<P>
   While he and the congregation sit in the Senate gallery hoping
to ward off threats, the assassin, a man named Severen, raises his
gun and shoots the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Alive when he reaches the hospital, Sunraider calls for the man
he knew as Daddy Hickman. It is here that the narrative launches
into a journey of betrayal and reconciliation, exploring what it
was that made Bliss leave and disown part of himself, and how
willing he is to return.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to be admired in ``Juneteenth.'' Ellison's
lyricism, spun in antiphonal and jazz motifs, highlights his
elegant use of language. Sometimes he pays homage to William
Faulkner, turning phrases in a mishmash of varying time frames.
</P>
<P>
   As Sunraider goes in and out of consciousness, we're led through
both dream and memory. The senator remembers an encounter in one of
the many small towns he and his movie/confidence-men visit. He
meets a young black woman, skin the color of peaches, who pines to
be in moving pictures. His own longings and loneliness penetrate
like the fog. The more he reins in his desires for her, the closer
he comes to splitting himself in two.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he leaves his soul behind.
</P>
<P>
   But because ``Juneteenth'' is an unfinished work, it presents
problems. The narrative begs for other voices and perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   What had Sunraider done that angered Severen that he wanted to
kill him? How far had Sunraider gone to destroy the people who
loved and cared for him? One is left wondering if the answer is in
the larger manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman's voice is strong and vital to the narrative, but at
times he takes over, drowning out Bliss and the dilemma that drives
the young man. In the end, through the power of redemption, Hickman
emerges the hero _ not only saving Bliss but preserving humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juneteenth'' is both gift and torment. Experiencing Ellison
all over again whets the appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan vows he will publish a scholar's version of Ellison's
manuscript _ one that will allow readers and Ellison enthusiasts to
decide for themselves what should have and might have been.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard truth is no one will ever know for sure.

<P>
   DECANI, Yugoslavia _ Offering a tranquil campus behind a massive
stone gatehouse, the Serbian Orthodox Visoki Decani monastery is a
refuge in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Monks here measure time in centuries, so as they
completed the first Sunday mass since NATO troops moved in to
Kosovo, they had little hope for a quick peace in the burned and
bloodied towns around them.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the monastery gate, monks brought tea to the Italian
NATO troops standing guard next to a tank. Inside, birds chirped
and a monk tended to his bee hives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the nearby town of Decani is in almost complete ruin
and mass graves of Albanians foul the air in several spots along
this stretch of road.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, the monastery was refuge to about 150
ethnic Albanians fleeing the terror and murder of Yugoslav forces
and Serb police. Most of their fellows Kosovars had fled Kosovo to
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Serb troops completed their withdrawal from the war-torn
province, 15 Serb civilians were in the monastery for safety. They
fear a return to their homes could leave them vulnerable to ethnic
Albanian revenge. About 20 Gypsies also had taken shelter in the
Monastery; in the past Gypsies often have cooperated with the
ruling Serbs here.
</P>
<P>
   One of 20 monks in residence, Abbot Theodosie -- he would not
give his family name -- commented to journalists on the many
calamities that have befallen the region since the monastery was
built 665 years ago: from the Turkish conquest and 500-year
occupation to the mass emigration of the Austro-Hungarian wars to
the Italian occupation of World War II and Communism.
</P>
<P>
   He gestured to the stately domed church, handsome in soft
horizontal stripes of cream and rose marble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This church remembers a lot of things,'' he said. ``Today we
have a similar situation as many times before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been done without any reason. (There has been)
conflict that has not been good for anyone,'' he said. ``First we
were witness to the exodus of the Albanian people. Now we are
witness to the exodus of the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   A 64-year-old Serb man approached visitors with a letter signed
by three Albanians attesting that he was not a looter or murderer.
But, he is afraid to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Patriarch Pavle, the head of the Serbian Orthodox
Church, took the unprecedented step of calling for the resignation
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who led the Serb
onslaught in Kosovo. He also urged ethnic Serbs to stay in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For inspiration, Pavle moved the seat of the church from
Belgrade to Pec, a city in Kosovo which has been the home of the
church several times since the 14th Century.
</P>
<P>
   The church complex in Pec is sheltering more than 100 Serbs.
But, Albanians do not see the church in Pec, at times the
instrument of Serb nationalism, as benevolent.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sunday, a nun who spotted two Albanians accompanying
foreign journalists was far from welcoming. ``Look at the Albanians
trying to come here, acting like foreigners,'' she hissed within
earshot.
</P>
<P>
   Ekram Ceku, Pec commander of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army,
said last week that church officials apologized to him for the Serb
carnage. The apology rang hollow to him, coming now from the
vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a declaration and doing something is two different
things,'' Ceku said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, the monastery here at Decani has a reputation for kindness
worthy of its quiet splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church are brilliant, original frescos. The face of
Jesus looks down from the dome high above heavy marble pillars as
if it is afloat. One fresco shows a scale balance, with an angel on
the left, the devil on the right and a naked human in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, people have gone away from God and in this sense
they have gone away from each other,'' Abbot Theodosie said of the
recent carnage.
</P>
<P>
   He said he sees no end to the cycle of violence between Serbs
and Albanians. ``But, God can see it,'' he said, ``And we pray for
him to bring reason to peoples' minds.''

   Researchers at the University of Missouri wanted to test the
theory that the way to make better, shorter business meetings was
to take the chairs away. And sure enough, comparing outcomes for
111 meetings, they found that those conducted while the
participants were seated lasted longer than meetings in which the
participants remained standing. However, the quality of
decision-making was the same for both formats.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which appears in the current issue of The Journal of
Applied Psychology, looked at 56 standing meetings and 55 sitting
meetings for five-member groups of students ages 19 to 44.
</P>
<P>
   The groups took part in an exercise called Lost on the Moon. In
it, each group was told that their space shuttle had crashed on the
moon and was given a list of the items that survived the crash. The
participants were asked to rank the supplies collectively in the
order of their importance to the group's survival. The
participants' rankings were compared to a ``best answer'' provided
by NASA experts. The students also filled out questionnaires before
and after their meetings to assess their commitment to the
decisions and satisfaction with the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that seated meetings lasted 34 percent
longer than the standing meetings and that the standing students
reported greater satisfaction with their meetings. Sitting and
standing participants also reported equal commitment to their
groups' decisions, and researchers said that there was no
significant difference in the quality of the decisions produced in
either format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone hates meetings in organizations,'' said Dr. Allen C.
Bluedorn, professor of management at the University of Missouri's
College of Business and Public Administration and lead author of
the study. ``They're usually poorly done. We expected the quality
of the decision making to suffer when the meetings were conducted
standing up. But there was no significant difference.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another surprise for the researchers. ``As the
sitting-down meetings took longer,'' Bluedorn said, ``we thought
they would lead to more creativity and more synergy. That didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary Waller, a professor who specializes in organizational
behavior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne, who was
not involved with the study, added: ``I think it's a pretty
important finding. If I was consulting with an organization, I
would probably suggest that they combine sit-down and standing-up
meetings.''

   Spanish explorers in the 16th century first recorded the fact
that dead rattlesnakes can bite, but that word has apparently not
gotten around: Two toxicologists in Phoenix found that 15 percent
of the rattlesnake bites they treated in a 10-month period came
from snakes that had been decapitated, shot or whomped until dead.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey R. Suchard of the Good Samaritan Regional Medical
Center said that he and a colleague, Dr. Frank LoVecchio, conducted
the study after a man came in for treatment in 1997 after he had
been bitten while picking up the corpse of a snake he had
bludgeoned with a shovel. ``We thought it was pretty weird, and
decided to keep track,'' Suchard said. Their study was published as
a letter in the current issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine.

   Their expectation was that such after-death encounters would
prove to be very uncommon. But five of the 34 rattlesnake bite
victims they treated fit the bill. The first of the five had beaten
a rattlesnake on the head with a stick until it was motionless,
then was bitten on the index finger when he picked it up. Two
others had shot the snakes in the head and picked them up after
waiting a few minutes. And two had decapitated the snakes with
bullets and were bitten when they picked up the severed heads; one
patient had to have a finger amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Suchard said that earlier studies have found that overall,
people who are bitten by rattlesnake tend to be ``intoxicated young
men.'' Only one of the five patients bitten by a dead snake in his
study was drunk, but none displayed what he considered to be good
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic message people should know is to leave snakes
alone,'' he said. ``If you are so foolhardy as to try and kill one,
then don't think it's OK to pick it up just because it's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   There is only one right thing to do when a rattlesnake is
encountered, he added: ``Call animal control.''

<P>
   &UR; Can riding a bicycle lead to erectile dysfunction or
impotence? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is well established that cycling can cause penile numbness,
erectile dysfunction and impotency. At Boston University, several
studies have shown a significant correlation between cycling and
these conditions. In one study, 4 percent of young, healthy male
cyclists in their 20s and 30s reported erectile dysfunction
compared with only 1 percent of runners of the same age, fitness
level, and health status. Although this is a small percentage, the
data suggest a statistically significant increase in problems
compared to runners.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the bike seat is the major problem. The back of
the traditional hard, narrow bike seat is not wide enough to
support the ``sit'' bones, so the cyclist moves forward, putting
weight on the soft tissue of the perineum _ the area between the
genitals and anus. Compressing the artery and nerve in this area
may cause irreversible impotency.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclists should choose a wide, soft saddle and should stop
riding if they feel any pain or numbness in the genital area.
</P>
<P>
   - &UR; Dr. IRWIN GOLDSTEIN, Professor of Urology, Boston University
School of Medicine &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of riding a bike far outweigh any risk of impotency
or sexual dysfunction for the general population. I have seen many
people with sexual dysfunction and impotency, many of whom rode
bikes, but riding was never found to be the cause of their problem.
</P>
<P>
   While some studies have shown a link between cycling and
decreased blood flow to the genitals, numbness and impotency, the
data are far from definitive and more studies are needed before
anyone recommends not riding a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, cycling for improved health and fitness is one way to
help prevent impotency and enhance sexual performance.
</P>
<P>
   The main risks for impotency include heart disease,
hypertension, diabetes and smoking. When cyclists become more fit,
they reduce their risk of developing heart disease and high blood
pressure. And few cyclists smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In general, people who are fit and feel good about their bodies
are less likely to suffer psychogenic-related erectile problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the men of General Hospital are good, they're very, very
good _ but when they're bad they're better. And soap fans will find
out just how much better on July 11 when heartthrobs Maurice Benard
(Sonny), Steve Burton (Jason), Billy Warlock (A.J.) and Wally Kurth
(Ned) appear in a rare, no-holds-barred question-and-answer session
at the Canada's Wonderland theme park in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Benard and Burton play mobsters, while Warlock is seen as the
alcoholic black sheep of the show's ritzy Quartermaine clan.
Kurth's character is the only ``good guy'' in the pack, though even
Ned's been known to reveal a naughty side on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the guys are married: Benard is wed to his longtime
sweetheart Paula Smith (they have two children), Burton recently
said ``I Do'' with Sheree Gustin, a former GH production intern,
and Kurth is the husband of actress Rena Sofer (formerly GH's
Lois), who will star this fall in the new ABC sitcom ``Oh, Grow
Up!''
</P>
<P>
   Warlock and ``Port Charles'' sensation Julie Pinson (Eve)
recently became engaged and plan to wed in the spring of 2000. TV
Guide caught up with this quartet of popular actors to grill them
about fame, fans and the future.
</P>
<P>
   TVG: Your work schedules are insane. You have very full personal
lives. Why make time for this fan appearance?
</P>
<P>
   BENARD: The money! No, just kidding. The fans are great. I wish
I could do more weekend appearances, but it's the traveling that
breaks my butt. I only get out, maybe, once a month.
</P>
<P>
   WARLOCK: I want the feedback of the fans, I need it as an actor.
Besides, the fans dictate everything. The producers and writers are
very influenced by what the fans want.
</P>
<P>
   KURTH: I love the fans. They are so committed. A lot of them
tell me they still watch GH because they grew up watching the show
with their mothers or grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   TVG: Why is it so rare to see a Wally Kurth interview?
</P>
<P>
   KURTH: I've been doing soaps for 13 years. I've stopped doing
interviews in the last few years, because I feel there's just
nothing more anyone could possibly want to know about me _ or that
I want to tell them. I think we could all use a little more mystery
_ the actors and the shows.
</P>
<P>
   TVG: The clean-cut heroes used to be the most popular characters
on soaps. Now, more and more fans seem to be sparking to the dark,
complex, dysfunctional, antihero characters, such as Sonny and
Jason.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: It all goes back to that James Dean thing. You know, the
tortured, brooding, vulnerable guy who can't help but be a little
bad. The fans like bad boys, which is why I was freaking out during
my first few years on GH because Jason used to be as wholesome as a
Boy Scout. Thank God Jason hit his head on a rock and joined the
mob.
</P>
<P>
   BENARD: It's more interesting to play someone with demons. The
dark side excites me. And a lot of the fans think they can help
you, that they can set you straight. They think, ``I could be the
one to change him.'' The clean-cut hero doesn't have all that much
to change.
</P>
<P>
   TVG: You guys aren't just bad, you're in the Mafia! Isn't the
adoration women feel for you rather, well, twisted?
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: GH is just a fantasy. The fans know it's just a soap
opera playground. Audiences love the Mafia _ from ``The Godfather''
movies to ``The Sopranos.'' We're intrigued with that world. We're
fascinated to see that you can be in organized crime and still be
real people with real problems and romances and families. The fans
can enjoy the bad things we do because they know Maurice and Steve
don't really do them.
</P>
<P>
   TVG: Does it help that GH has always kept Sonny's and Jason's
mob activities sort of vague? What exactly do they traffic in?
We've been watching for years and have no clue!
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: Basically they try to, uh, I don't know, control the
unions? It's so funny that we don't really deal in anything
illegal. No drugs. No black-market babies. We just sorta strong-arm
people.
</P>
<P>
   TVG: Billy, prior to GH, you played a hero _ and won an Emmy _
as Frankie on ``Days of Our Lives.'' What's your preference?
</P>
<P>
   WARLOCK: It's always more interesting to play someone with
emotional problems, though there was a time when A.J. was so bad
even I couldn't justify it as an actor. We definitely went
overboard, but that's all in the writing.
</P>
<P>
   TVG: Wally, you've played back-to-back clean-cut heroes (before
GH, he was Justin Kiriakis on Days). Do you envy the bad guys?
</P>
<P>
   KURTH: I do prefer the times my character has an edge. Ned is
very similar to Justin, which is why actors have to get off soaps
after a while _ we need to prove there's more to us than what we're
allowed to play.
</P>
<P>
   TVG: So are you thinking about leaving GH?
</P>
<P>
   KURTH: I'll definitely consider it when my contract is up. At
that point, hopefully, I'll feel financially comfortable enough to
take the chance, because Rena's sitcom is very funny, and I think
it'll be a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to get back to the theater (Kurth starred on Broadway
in ``The Pirates of Penzance''). After years of never-ending soap
stories, I want to do movies where there's a beginning, middle and
end. In fact, I just finished writing a screenplay, which I will
produce next summer. It'll be shot in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   TVG: Maurice, you left GH to pursue greener pastures. Then you
returned last November, but only signed a one-year contract. Does
this suggest you'll leave again?
</P>
<P>
   BENARD: I won't leave GH again unless I have something great to
go to. I'm glad I came back. I did roles in three little
independent films while I was off the show, but it wasn't much to
brag about. The only thing that frustrates me is that I feel I
deserve a shot at something big, and I just haven't had that shot.
I'm honest and realistic, but I also feel I can hold my own with
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   TVG: And the rumors of your departure, Steve?
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: My contract is up in December and, for the first time,
certain networks have been coming to me to discuss stuff. But I
love GH. I know I can work elsewhere, but it's the quality of the
work I'm worried about. I'm not planning to be the next Tom Cruise
or Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   If an offer won't improve my career, if it's not a better role
than Jason, then what's the point? GH is home for me.

   NEW MARKET, Va. _ The aroma of frying onions is wafting out from
the concession stand and the Eagles are singing ``Take It Easy''
over the PA system. Carrying the accordion he will use to play
``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' during the seventh-inning stretch,
retired FBI agent Sol Quinn sidles by a flower box of red geraniums
to reach his seat behind home plate. Players from the New Market
Rebels are raking and lining the infield.

Shenandoah Valley.

<P>
   ``I love it here,'' exclaims Julio Chinea, 22, who grew up in
Naples, Fla., and pitched for Miami Dade Junior College and
Bluefield College in West Virginia to earn his spot on the Rebels.
``Since I was in about the ninth grade, I'd heard about it (from
older players) and I just always wanted to play in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   For the college players who have come for 37 summers, the dusty
diamonds of the Shenandoah Valley League are fields of dreams. They
know that Mo Vaughn of the California Angels and Steve Finley of
the Arizona Diamondbacks and scores of other major leaguers played
here in summers past. They know that baseball ``bird dogs'' with
radar guns and stopwatches sometimes sit amid the friendly fans
behind the chicken-wire backstops.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of scouts come to games and the coaches have pretty good
connections,'' explains Tom Perrin, 21, a shortstop from West Palm
Beach, Fla., and the College of Charleston. ``That's what you're
here for.''
</P>
<P>
   They see the Valley as a step toward million dollar contracts
and prime-time play. But even those who will never draw a baseball
paycheck can gain from a summer spent living with a local family
and working on a farm or corner grocery. Many experience an America
that they knew only from TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinda like Mayberry here. Everybody knows everybody,''
marvels Charlie Wentzky, 20, a pitcher from Anderson, S.C., and the
College of Charleston. ``It's amazing that there are people like
this left in the world _ with all the shootings and robberies and
stuff. They don't lock their doors. Basically, they don't live by
the watch. They come and go as they need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Players learn about social networks by watching the community
unite to finance a season and welcome a team of strangers into its
midst, explains Larry Strawderman, the Rebels' volunteer general
manager.

   New Market Rebels of several seasons ago gave the nicknames to
Jean Morse, a wife, mother, hairdresser, school bus driver, cook
and hostess, and her husband, Everett, a husky state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five seasons, after every game, home and away,
``Mama Jean'' has fed the team. She cooks for 25 players _ plus
coaches and an occasional visiting parent or girlfriend _ at her
house with an inviting front porch located a few of blocks from
Rebel Field. Afterward, players watch TV, play cards and talk for
hours, often spending the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``My policy: I go to bed when I'm ready,'' said Jean Morse. ``I
woke up the other morning to find that nine players had slept
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered along Interstate-81, there are six teams in the Valley
League: the Winchester Royals, Front Royal Cardinals, Harrisonburg
Turks, Waynesboro Generals, Staunton Braves and the Rebels. With a
population of 1,500, New Market is the smallest host community. It
is a town without taverns or other late-night establishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team needs a place to group, bond, hang out and get to
know each other,'' said Morse. ``It's a home away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer grocery bill is ``astronomical,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food she puts out is amazing,'' said Chinea.
</P>
<P>
   The menu after a recent Friday night home game included fried
chicken, macaroni and cheese casserole and coleslaw. Sometimes
there is pizza or spaghetti or lasagna or cold cuts for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 2 o'clock, I'm cleaning up the mess,'' said Morse, whose
efforts are voluntary and self-financed.
</P>
<P>
   There's one ironclad rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any have been drinking, they don't drive from the house. I
take their car keys,'' she said. ``And anybody who thinks college
students don't drink beer is kidding themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the deterrent of ``Big E,'' with his state patrol
car parked in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there have ever been problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college coaches don't send bad boys up here,'' says Jay
Zuspan, who has hosted players on his Christmas tree farm outside
of New Market for six summers. ``They won't send us trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't meet a more polite group of young men than these
baseball players,'' echoes Morse, declining to name the only two
exceptions in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players keep in touch after they leave. Others
don't. She follows all their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Marshall McDougall from Florida State hit six home runs
in one game this year, I said, 'Why, he slept on my couch','' she
recalled. ``I keep telling them, when they get to the big leagues,
don't forget about Mama Jean in Virginia.''

   During the early innings, the setting sun warms the backs of the
400 or so fans who paid the $3 admission to Rebel Park. Massanutten
Mountain looms above an outfield fence painted with advertisements
from local merchants. Giggling teen-aged girls lean over the
railing near the third base dugout to gaze at their favorite
Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Wentzky is the cutest player, agree Kim Leitzel and
Katelyn Linski, both 13. They come to most games, as do their
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   School is out, so ``you get together at the game,'' explains
Katelyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the green chairs behind home plate sit the ``grandstand
managers,'' club members who pay $75 a year for this prime position
for viewing, socializing and grousing at the umpire. Many are
retirees from the nearby Bryce Mountain Resort. Visiting fans _
mostly host families from other league towns _ sit in bleachers
near the first base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebel Park announcer welcomes by name and hometown the
visiting moms, dads, grandparents and girlfriends of players on
both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Between innings, some fans cut through a neighboring yard to get
black raspberry sundaes or fresh peach shakes at Pack's Frozen
Custard stand. Others spend $1.25 for a Rebel Park hot dog topped
with those fried onions. Kids chase foul balls and return them for
a pack of baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy watching the town turn out for games. The whole summer
schedule is wrapped around this ball park,'' said Martha Sims. She
and her husband, George, are both Lutheran ministers as well as
family hosts for a player.

<P>
   ``This is baseball the way it was in the 1950s,'' says Mo Weber,
the Rebels' 76-year-old batting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Retired from coaching at the College of William and Mary, he
banters easily with players who kid him about personally knowing
Abner Doubleday or coaching Joe DiMaggio in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are flat-out better today,'' he says. ``They are
physically bigger, stronger, faster, better conditioned. They know
more about anatomy and physiology.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven decades or so of baseball, he loves to hear the ump
say ``batter up.''

   ``You don't have time for much except baseball,'' says Carson
Wiggins, 20, a pitcher from Waynesboro, Ga., and Georgia College in
Milledgeville who is spending the summer with the Winchester
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The league schedules 40 games in 55 days. Then there are
playoffs for the top teams. The longest road trip _ between
Staunton and Winchester _ takes about 90 minutes by bus. The
players are not paid, although the league picks up the tab for
their airfare from home and back and helps to find them summer
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Wiggins and the rest of the Royals are visiting
Bing Crosby Field in Front Royal.
</P>
<P>
   The crooner was grand marshal of the 1949 Apple Blossom
Festival, explains Linda Keen, the Cardinals volunteer president.
The next year, he hosted a movie premier in Front Royal and
performed at a benefit and even donated his own money for the white
cinder block stadium that now bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins is spending the summer about 20 miles away in
Winchester, a bustling community known for its apple orchards and
as the hometown of Patsy Cline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winchester is big compared to Waynesboro,'' jokes Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
   He is staying with the same family that hosted his brother,
Daniel, two summers ago. Daniel just signed a contract with the
Chicago Cubs organization.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Wiggins is philosophical about his own future. If it
includes a big league career, fine. For now, though, he is happy to
spend his days working in Martin's Grocery and his nights playing
baseball in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players are hopeful of playing professionally, but
they know the odds are long.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal since Little League _ and the main goal of most
of the players here _ is just to keep playing as long as we can,''
said Jeff Reardon, a New Market Rebels pitcher from Siena College
in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every kid's dream,'' said J.C. Bunch, a Front Royal
Cardinals catcher from Austin, Texas, and Trinity College in San
Antonio. ``The league provides an opportunity to be seen by
scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, they are enjoying the culture shock of living
slow in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think California has a town this small,'' says Tom
Adinolfi, a New Market pitcher from San Jose State. ``I'd been here
two days and already people on the street were saying, 'Hi Tim'.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Biery, who works at an auto parts dealership in Staunton,
is president of the Valley League. The position pays $200 a year.
Only coaches and umpires receive real salaries. Most everybody else
is an unpaid volunteer. About 20 percent of the league budget comes
from Major League Baseball through an NCAA program. The NCAA
sanctions several such summer leagues scattered from Alaska to Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team does its own recruiting. They compete with each
other for players _ as well as with other leagues,'' said Biery.
``The main selling point is the quality of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Since admissions pay the bulk of the bills, promotion is an
important element of the league. There are contests for the best
decorated lawn chairs, for instance. And New Market has an
incongruous Chicken Man who cavorts during some games.
</P>
<P>
   The team got a good deal on the suit through the Internet,
explained GM Strawderman. ``He's a Rebel chicken.''

   NEW MARKET, Va. _ The aroma of frying onions is wafting out from
the concession stand and the Eagles are singing ``Take It Easy''
over the PA system. Carrying the accordion he will use to play
``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' during the seventh-inning stretch,
retired FBI agent Sol Quinn sidles by a flower box of red geraniums
to reach his seat behind home plate. Players from the New Market
Rebels are raking and lining the infield.

   Players learn about social networks by watching the community
unite to finance a season and welcome a team of strangers into its
midst, explains Larry Strawderman, the Rebels' volunteer general
manager.

   Two of the teachers are ``Mama Jean'' and ``Big E.''

   New Market Rebels of several seasons ago gave the nicknames to
Jean Morse, a wife, mother, hairdresser, school bus driver, cook
and hostess, and her husband, Everett, a husky state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five seasons, after every game, home and away,
``Mama Jean'' has fed the team. She cooks for 25 players _ plus
coaches and an occasional visiting parent or girlfriend _ at her
house with an inviting front porch located a few of blocks from
Rebel Field. Afterward, players watch TV, play cards and talk for
hours, often spending the night.

   Scattered along Interstate-81, there are six teams in the Valley
League: the Winchester Royals, Front Royal Cardinals, Harrisonburg
Turks, Waynesboro Generals, Staunton Braves and the Rebels. With a
population of 1,500, New Market is the smallest host community. It
is a town without taverns or other late-night establishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team needs a place to group, bond, hang out and get to
know each other,'' said Morse. ``It's a home away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer grocery bill is ``astronomical,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food she puts out is amazing,'' said Chinea.

   The menu after a recent Friday night home game included fried
chicken, macaroni and cheese casserole and coleslaw. Sometimes
there is pizza or spaghetti or lasagna or cold cuts for sandwiches.

<P>
   ``At 2 o'clock, I'm cleaning up the mess,'' said Morse, whose
efforts are voluntary and self-financed.
</P>
<P>
   There's one ironclad rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any have been drinking, they don't drive from the house. I
take their car keys,'' she said. ``And anybody who thinks college
students don't drink beer is kidding themselves.''

   There is also the deterrent of ``Big E,'' with his state patrol
car parked in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there have ever been problems.

<P>
   ``The college coaches don't send bad boys up here,'' says Jay
Zuspan, who has hosted players on his Christmas tree farm outside
of New Market for six summers. ``They won't send us trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't meet a more polite group of young men than these
baseball players,'' echoes Morse, declining to name the only two
exceptions in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players keep in touch after they leave. Others
don't. She follows all their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Marshall McDougall from Florida State hit six home runs
in one game this year, I said, 'Why, he slept on my couch','' she

   During the early innings, the setting sun warms the backs of the
400 or so fans who paid the $3 admission to Rebel Park. Massanutten
Mountain looms above an outfield fence painted with advertisements
from local merchants. Giggling teen-aged girls lean over the
railing near the third base dugout to gaze at their favorite
Rebels.

   Charlie Wentzky is the cutest player, agree Kim Leitzel and
Katelyn Linski, both 13. They come to most games, as do their
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   School is out, so ``you get together at the game,'' explains
Katelyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the green chairs behind home plate sit the ``grandstand
managers,'' club members who pay $75 a year for this prime position
for viewing, socializing and grousing at the umpire. Many are
retirees from the nearby Bryce Mountain Resort. Visiting fans _
mostly host families from other league towns _ sit in bleachers
near the first base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebel Park announcer welcomes by name and hometown the
visiting moms, dads, grandparents and girlfriends of players on
both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Between innings, some fans cut through a neighboring yard to get
black raspberry sundaes or fresh peach shakes at Pack's Frozen
Custard stand. Others spend $1.25 for a Rebel Park hot dog topped
with those fried onions. Kids chase foul balls and return them for
a pack of baseball cards.

   ``I enjoy watching the town turn out for games. The whole summer
schedule is wrapped around this ball park,'' said Martha Sims. She
and her husband, George, are both Lutheran ministers as well as
family hosts for a player.

   ``This is baseball the way it was in the 1950s,'' says Mo Weber,
the Rebels' 76-year-old batting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Retired from coaching at the College of William and Mary, he
banters easily with players who kid him about personally knowing
Abner Doubleday or coaching Joe DiMaggio in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are flat-out better today,'' he says. ``They are
physically bigger, stronger, faster, better conditioned. They know
more about anatomy and physiology.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven decades or so of baseball, he loves to hear the ump
say ``batter up.''

   ``You don't have time for much except baseball,'' says Carson
Wiggins, 20, a pitcher from Waynesboro, Ga., and Georgia College in
Milledgeville who is spending the summer with the Winchester
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The league schedules 40 games in 55 days. Then there are
playoffs for the top teams. The longest road trip _ between
Staunton and Winchester _ takes about 90 minutes by bus. The
players are not paid, although the league picks up the tab for
their airfare from home and back and helps to find them summer
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Wiggins and the rest of the Royals are visiting
Bing Crosby Field in Front Royal.
</P>
<P>
   The crooner was grand marshal of the 1949 Apple Blossom
Festival, explains Linda Keen, the Cardinals volunteer president.
The next year, he hosted a movie premier in Front Royal and
performed at a benefit and even donated his own money for the white
cinder block stadium that now bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins is spending the summer about 20 miles away in
Winchester, a bustling community known for its apple orchards and
as the hometown of Patsy Cline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winchester is big compared to Waynesboro,'' jokes Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
   He is staying with the same family that hosted his brother,
Daniel, two summers ago. Daniel just signed a contract with the
Chicago Cubs organization.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Wiggins is philosophical about his own future. If it
includes a big league career, fine. For now, though, he is happy to
spend his days working in Martin's Grocery and his nights playing
baseball in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players are hopeful of playing professionally, but
they know the odds are long.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal since Little League _ and the main goal of most
of the players here _ is just to keep playing as long as we can,''
said Jeff Reardon, a New Market Rebels pitcher from Siena College
in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every kid's dream,'' said J.C. Bunch, a Front Royal
Cardinals catcher from Austin, Texas, and Trinity College in San
Antonio. ``The league provides an opportunity to be seen by
scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, they are enjoying the culture shock of living
slow in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think California has a town this small,'' says Tom
Adinolfi, a New Market pitcher from San Jose State. ``I'd been here
two days and already people on the street were saying, 'Hi Tim'.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Biery, who works at an auto parts dealership in Staunton,
is president of the Valley League. The position pays $200 a year.
Only coaches and umpires receive real salaries. Most everybody else
is an unpaid volunteer. About 20 percent of the league budget comes
from Major League Baseball through an NCAA program. The NCAA
sanctions several such summer leagues scattered from Alaska to Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team does its own recruiting. They compete with each
other for players _ as well as with other leagues,'' said Biery.
``The main selling point is the quality of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Since admissions pay the bulk of the bills, promotion is an
important element of the league. There are contests for the best
decorated lawn chairs, for instance. And New Market has an
incongruous Chicken Man who cavorts during some games.
</P>
<P>
   The team got a good deal on the suit through the Internet,
explained GM Strawderman. ``He's a Rebel chicken.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: PARADOX OR NOT, CHOLESTEROL IS ON THE RISE IN
FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans, famous for wanting their cake and eating it too, were
delighted to learn that even though French foods seem to be rich in
fat, much of it artery-clogging saturated animal fat, the French
are not nearly as likely to be cut down in midlife by heart
attacks. This intriguing phenomenon is called the French Paradox,
and it has drawn comment, criticism and speculation for much of
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest treatise on the subject, published in a recent
issue of The British Medical Journal, suggests the paradox may not
be so paradoxical after all. Rather, the authors maintain, it is
only a matter of time before the fatty French diet exacts its
coronary toll. These scientists, Drs. Malcolm Law and Nicholas
Wald, specialists in preventive medicine at St. Bartholomew's and
the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, point out that
for decades until 1970, the French ate much less animal fat and had
significantly lower blood cholesterol levels than did Britons, who
were in no better shape than Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But as the French diet grew richer, French cholesterol levels
did too. ``Only between 1970 and 1980 did French values increase to
those in Britain,'' the authors noted, adding that since only about
1 percent of men die of heart disease before age 50, it takes
decades of exposure to a high-fat diet to exact this toll.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new British report is the most thorough analysis of
this ``time-lag hypothesis,'' it has been put forward before as an
explanation for French diet and health. Dr. Marion Nestle,
chairwoman of the department of nutrition at New York University,
noted several years ago that it was not until 1985 that French
consumption of fat caught up to that of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Nestle said, ``There's been a steady increase
in fat consumption in France over the last 20 years as the French
diet has become more Americanized.'' She noted that the French were
now eating more meat and fast foods, snacking more, eating fewer
regular relaxed meals, exercising less and drinking less wine than
in the past. And, predictably, they are getting fatter.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a few more decades, Nestle predicted, and the French will
no longer enjoy a coronary death rate that is less than half that
of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if the French did not reach American levels of fat
consumption until recently, something still seems to have been
protecting their hearts. How else could they have gotten away with
their apparent penchant for eggs, butter and cream, not to mention
pates and rich cheeses full of saturated fat and cholesterol?
</P>
<P>
   Several health experts, commenting on the report by Law and
Wald, have offered possible explanations that could prove helpful
to Americans seeking to lower their risk of heart disease without
forgoing all the pleasures of dietary fat.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Meir Stampfer and Dr. Eric Rimm of the Harvard School of
Public Health stress in their commentary that coronary disease is
not due to any single factor and that preventing it cannot result
from only one adjustment in living habits, like eating less
saturated fat. Although they do not dismiss the idea that time will
take its toll on the French heart, they cite several other
differences in dietary habits between the French and Britons (and,
by extension, Americans) that studies strongly suggest play an
important role in heart disease. For example:
</P>
<P>
   ALCOHOL _ ``Law and Wald may be too quick to dismiss the role of
alcohol as a partial explanation,'' the Boston researchers wrote.
Many studies have shown a strong relationship between an increased
intake of alcohol and a lower level of cardiac deaths. Alcohol
raises blood levels of protective HDL cholesterol, which helps rid
arteries of fatty deposits. Red wine in particular, the favored
beverage in France, contains chemicals that lower the risk of blood
clots that could touch off a heart attack. Also important may be
the pattern of alcohol consumption. In France wine is drunk slowly
with meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence of benefit from moderate consumption of alcohol
is very, very strong, and it seems to be strongest when alcohol is
taken with meals on a moderate, regular basis as opposed to weekend
bingeing or alcohol consumed alone,'' Stampfer said in an
interview. Moderate consumption means a daily limit of two glasses
of wine for men and one glass for women.
</P>
<P>
   FIBER _ The French consume two to three times more fiber from
whole grains and grain products than do Britons and Americans.
These cereal fibers have been linked in at least three major
studies to a decreased risk of heart disease, most recently this
month in a study of nearly 69,000 middle-aged nurses published in
The Journal of the American Medical Association. Each increase of
five grams a day of cereal fiber (the amount in a half-cup of
bran-flake cereal) was associated with a 37 percent decrease in
coronary risk among these women. Similar associations were found in
the Iowa Women's Study and in men in the Health Professionals
Follow-Up Study.
</P>
<P>
   NUTS _ The French eat about twice as many nuts as Americans do.
Several studies that followed tens of thousands of men and women in
this country showed that ``even modest amounts of nuts were
associated with a markedly lower risk of coronary heart disease, a
benefit greater than would be predicted from their effects on serum
cholesterol,'' Stampfer said. The fat in nuts is the unsaturated
kind that lowers the level of harmful LDL cholesterol.
``Ironically, many health-conscious Americans have been avoiding
nuts because they are high in fat,'' he noted. Over all, for the
last 30 years, the French intake of heart-sparing polyunsaturated
fat has been nearly twice that in Britain, Stampfer and Rimm noted.
</P>
<P>
   FOLATE _ When Americans visit France or dine in fancy French
restaurants in this country, they tend to eat rich, fancy foods.
``But the French people don't eat fancy foods day to day,''
Stampfer said. ``They eat many more fruits and vegetables,''
including those that are rich in a B-vitamin called folate (or
folic acid), which has been associated with a decreased risk of
heart disease. Good sources of folate include dark-green leafy
vegetables and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   GLYCEMIC LOAD _ Frequent consumption of foods that quickly raise
the level of sugar in the blood has been linked to an increased
risk of developing heart disease and diabetes. When blood sugar
rises, insulin is released to process it, which stimulates the
production of a harmful form of triglycerides, a known coronary
risk factor. In general, whole foods and minimally processed grains
(including pasta, which is made from crushed as opposed to finely
ground semolina wheat) produce a low glycemic load, while sweets,
pastries, white bread and potatoes produce a high glycemic load.
Americans who snack on sweets and refined carbohydrates raise their
glycemic load and, in turn, their risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   CHEESE AND FOIE GRAS _ Dr. Serge Renaud, research director at
France's National Institute of Health and Medical Research,
maintains that there is something different about the fats in duck
and goose liver and in cheese that makes them less damaging and
possibly even protective of the heart. His evidence in part comes
from the heart of foie gras country, the Gascony region of
southwest France, where the coronary death rate among middle-aged
men is about half that of the rest of France. He has said that
``goose and duck fat is closer in chemical composition to olive oil
than it is to butter and lard.'' What, if anything, may be special
about the fats in cheese is now under study.
</P>
<P>
   PORTION SIZE _ Rich foods or not, the French simply eat less
than Americans do. French portion sizes tend to be a third to a
half of American portions, and until recently, the French sat down
to eat leisurely meals three times a day and rarely ate between
meals, Nestle said. French visitors to America are typically aghast
at the amount of food piled on plates in American restaurants and
homes. The French are more gourmets than gluttons, as evidenced by
the difference in obesity rates: 30 percent here versus 8 percent
there.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their dietary advantages, the French still get heart
disease. Dr. Dean Ornish, cardiac specialist at the University of
California at San Francisco, has pointed out that while ``heart
attacks are less frequent in France, they are still the leading
cause of death there.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Nestle noted, French habits are changing, and not for the
better. Children are now given soft drinks, not wine, to drink;
wine consumption over all has dropped to about half of former
levels; snacking is now commonplace, more and more family meals are
coming from pizza parlors and McDonald's and more people are
driving to big markets to shop instead of walking to local
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   As she and others have said, it is only a matter of time.

CLINTON URGES YUGOSLAVIA TO FOLLOW SLOVENIA'S EXAMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia _ President Clinton challenged the Serbs in
nearby Yugoslavia Monday to sack Slobodan Milosevic so they will be
eligible for the multi-billion dollar reconstruction package being
assembled by the United States and the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also emphasized the prosperity that could await
Yugoslavia as he paid a celebratory visit to Slovenia _ the first
former Yugoslav republic to reject Milosevic and embrace
independence, ethnic tolerance and the West.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in rain-swept Congress Square, Clinton urged the Serbs
to join ``a Europe undivided, democratic and at peace for the first
time in history.'' The president also praised Slovenia as a top
candidate for future admission to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   By visiting a former Yugoslav republic and meeting here with the
president of the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic,
Clinton appeared to symbolically tighten the diplomatic isolation
around Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked to meet Djukanovic to underscore allied support
for ``democratic efforts in Montenegro and our willingness to work
with them,'' said White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also planned to meet leaders of Macedonia and Albania
during a visit to Macedonia on Tuesday _ a schedule that will bring
him face-to-face with three leaders who govern territory adjacent
to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world admires Slovenia's success in building freedom
and prosperity _ and now we look to you to play a crucial role as
we build a better future for all of Europe,'' Clinton told
thousands of Slovenes who waited more than three hours in the rain
to hear the first American president to visit their eight-year-old
nation, population of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Serbia to be part of the new Europe,'' Clinton
continued. ``But Serbia must reject the murderous rule of Mr.
Milosevic and choose the path that Slovenia has chosen, where
people reach across the old divides and find strength in their
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek called Clinton's visit
``confirmation'' of Slovenia's ``partnership'' with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came here following a summit in Bonn with German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder where the American president and the
current president of the 15-nation European Union agreed to map a
multi-billion dollar reconstruction program for Kosovo and the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked Slovenia for allowing allied warplanes to use
its airspace to reach Yugoslavia during the 78-day bombing campaign
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that forced Milosevic to
halt his troops' murderous campaign against ethnic Albanian Muslims
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. He also praised Slovenia for
providing help to thousands of Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all you have done, I am very, very grateful,'' Clinton
said, adding: ``You have been a good partner and you are an
excellent candidate for NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO admitted Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary earlier
this year, leaving Slovenia disappointed that it would have to wait
at least until 2002 to be considered for membership in the
19-nation alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remark offered no firm commitment of U.S support. But
his words were greeted with enthusiastic cheers by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia is one of eight nations seeking NATO admission. A
crossroads between Europe and the Balkans, Slovenia is a member of
NATO's consultative Partnership for Peace which readies aspiring
member nations for membership.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the audience, Peter Judez, 29, an electrician from
Novo Mesto, said he is willing to be patient for his small nation
to join the western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be good for us to join,'' Judez said. ``We would feel
safer then.''
</P>
<P>
   Judez praised Clinton's visit: ``It is a good job, Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the crowd, Peter Stegnar, 16, a high school
student, said membership in NATO will be ``difficult to obtain
because so many other nations want to join, too.'' Stegnar added:
``We are a small country and alone. We can't move ahead without
joining the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Judez and Stegnar said Clinton's visit helped soothe their
nation's sense of disappointment about having to wait for
admission.

</P>
<P>
   Slovenia also is scheduled to join the 15-nation European Union
in 2006. Slovenia's per capita income of $11,000 is comparable to
Portugal and Greece, both members of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenes expressed zero tolerance for Milosevic, a Serbian
dictator who has ordered wars against Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and
now Kosovo since the breakup of Yugoslavia began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is a terrorist,'' declared Stegnar. ``It is not
right for people to be killed in Kosovo because they want to speak
their language, practice their religion and preserve their customs.
Milosevic must go on trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Stegnar expressed confidence that the Balkans can overcome their
ethnic and religious diversity and rivalries, saying: ``You do it
with friendly ways. The Serbs have been a very aggressive people.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosovic and four lieutenants have been indicted for war crimes
by an international war crimes tribunal based in the Netherlands.
Clinton conceded last week in Paris that the allies have little
chance of capturing Milosevic for trial, if he remains inside of
Serbia.

<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton was taken by the enthusiastic
reception, that included crowds along the motorcade route from the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This in many ways will be very memorable for the president
because of the sight of so many tens of thousands of people out
there in the rain, who had waited out there for many hours,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia, a predominantly Roman Catholic Slavic nation governed
for centuries by the Austo-Hungarian Empire, has long been a
step-child of Europe. Leaders of the victorious nations in World
War I redrew the map of post-war Europe to lump tiny Slovenia
together with the Slav principalities of the Balkans to create the
Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes _ renamed Yugoslavia in 1929.

   KOSOVO-RDP (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ The agreement reached early

During World War II, an explosion on a segregated naval base here
killed 320 men. After the accident, black sailors were ordered to
resume loading ammunition onto ships. Fifty of them refused, were
court-martialed by an all-white panel, found guilty of mutiny and
imprisoned. Now, in an extraordinary legal battle, lawyers for one
black veteran have filed for a presidential pardon arguing that the
black sailors failed to follow orders out of legitimate fear and
had no intent to mutiny. The petition pits the racial symbolism of
a celebrated case against the military's view that servicemen

   EXPERIMENTAL-PATIENTS (Undated) _ Chronically ill patients with
limited or no health insurance are increasingly filling a demand
for experimental drug study participants as drug companies rush
record numbers of new medications through the testing process. For
these people, experiments have become treatments; clinical
investigators are their specialists. But the benefit can be
fleeting or nonexistent. Chronically ill patients with no other
options can be treated with an experimental medication that does
not work or that even worsens their condition. Or they can end up
with a placebo rather than the medication itself. And once the
study is over, usually in a matter of weeks, they are left to their
own devices. By Gina Kolata and Kurt Eichenwald.

   My wife and I had barely settled down across from each another
when she got the bad news: She had smallpox. An inauspicious start,
I thought, trying to tamp down any sense of satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   This became easier to do once I got my own diagnosis: spotted
fever. Things weren't looking so hot for me, either.
</P>
<P>
   But my spirits were buoyed anew when my wife found out she had
contracted woolsorters' disease _ better known as anthrax. And my
next diagnosis, however embarrassing, did not diminish my
hopefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dandruff!'' my wife snickered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty funny for somebody with two fatal diseases,'' I replied
icily.
</P>
<P>
   This exchange set the tone for the 45 minutes or so that
followed, in which we played a new board game of questionable
taste, but unquestionable imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Infection, sort of a cross between Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit,
is a game that pits from two to nine people against one another on
a playing field run rampant with disease, from the fiercest (like
malaria) to the simply annoying (say, athlete's foot).
</P>
<P>
   The goal is survival. The first player who is completely cured _
or, in a less hopeful scenario, is the only one left alive _ wins.
</P>
<P>
   While the game, which costs $30, allows players to get rid of
diseases by giving them to other players (or casting them off at
places like a public pool), its creator, Dan Sullivan of Milpitas,
Calif., says, ``The game is really about getting healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, 34, a chemist who works for a large computer parts
company, created the game as an independent venture. He sees his
audience as the ``hypochondriac in all of us.'' To date, he has
sold 800 in stores or through his Web site (www.earwig.net).
</P>
<P>
   Players begin with five diseases, which are contained on cards
bearing the name of the malady, its description and its treatment.
Then they try to buy cures from specialists or even a voodoo
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said much research went into the game, and it shows.
Still, there will always be quibblers. My wife, told that she had a
collapsed lung, peevishly noted that the condition is not
infectious. ``So, `Infection' is really a misnomer,'' she said.
``You could just call it `Disease.''' (Yeah _ or you could also
just avoid playing against copy editors.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she was just sensing her impending defeat. Soon, I cured
myself of my last disease, leaving her with heartburn, athlete's
foot _ and that collapsed lung.  &QL;

WHAT MAKES A HIT RADIO SONG IN THE SUMMER?
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by BC-SUMMERSONGS-LIST) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer 1965, El Paso: I'm nearly 6 years old, riding in the
family car _ a Ford Fairlane, as I recall _ with one of my older
sisters. It's hellishly hot, and the car isn't air-conditioned.
We're listening to KELP, El Paso's top AM station, and this Rolling
Stones song comes on, with this incredible, buzzing guitar riff
followed by Mick Jagger purring, ``I can't get no ...
sat-is-fac-tion ...''
</P>
<P>
   I'm too young to have any idea what Jagger is singing about, but
that guitar sure sounds good, as do the parts where all the other
instruments drop out and it's just the drums and then Jagger sings,
``Hey hey hey, that's what I say ...''
</P>
<P>
   It would take me till November 1974, when I rediscovered
``Satisfaction,'' to figure out what Jagger was singing about.
Didn't matter _ for me, the most famous guitar intro in rock is a
time machine, one that takes me back to my last free summer before
entering first grade.
</P>
<P>
   For me, and probably for a lot of people, ``Satisfaction'' is
the epitome of a single of the summer. This is not to be confused
with a summer song, which is merely a song ABOUT summer; a single
of the summer DEFINES a summer. When you hear it, it brings you
back to where you were and who you were with that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think that it comes down to a really personal
thing,'' says Pat McMahon, program director for Dallas R&AMP;B oldies
station KTXQ/102.1 FM. ``It comes from youth, summer, long days,
girlfriends, boyfriends, days at the beach or at the park.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, one person's single of the summer could be
another person's shoulder-shrug. But some songs transcend this, and
take on a more generational aura. Martha and the Vandellas'
``Dancing in the Streets'' (1964) is one of 'em; so is
``Satisfaction.'' But then, so is the Police's 1983 hit ``Every
Breath You Take.'' ``Summer in the City,'' from 1967; ``Summer
Nights,'' from 1978; ``Love Shack,'' from 1989; and last year's
``The Way'' are all evocative summer songs for their eras.
</P>
<P>
   These examples are a diverse lot, ranging from ebullient calls
to party to anthems of rebellion, to a moody ode to sexual
obsession. So it's hard to get a handle on just what makes a song a
single of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curt answer is, its release date,'' says Thomas Ryan,
author of ``American Hit Radio,'' in which Ryan discusses his picks
for the best Top 40 singles from 1955 to 1994. ``Sometimes, I think
that that's the way this works out.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not that simple. If a release date were all it took, a
kitsch classic such as Paper Lace's ``The Night Chicago Died'' _
which actually hit No. 1 in 1974 _ could be a contender for that
summer's representative single. Even a good song that's a huge hit,
such as Boyz II Men's 1992 blockbuster ``End of the Road,'' can
find the single-of-the-summer honor elusive. That song was No. 1
forever, but something about it is too elegiac to evoke that summer
feeling. ``Every Breath You Take'' aside, it's rare to hear a slow
summer song.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something with a lot of energy,'' says Dave Morales,
music director for Dallas Top 40 station KHKS/106.1 FM (a k a
KISS). ``You almost see somebody driving with the top down,
cruising the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan agrees, but adds that there's even more to the sound,
something almost ethereal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best songs of summer definitely convey an atmosphere,''
Ryan says. ``A perfect example is that Seal song from a few years
back, `Crazy.' The opening riff just floated on the air. It was
like it was coming from space, or from a p.a., or coming around the
mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Atmosphere is certainly part of it, in more ways than one. Ryan
points out that a single of the summer is ubiquitous; it's the type
of song you hear everywhere you go, even without trying (for this
reason, Ryan picks the Captain &AMP; Tennille's ``Love Will Keep Us
Together'' as the single of the summer for 1975, even though he
doesn't like it). Because more people are outside in the summer,
it's easier to hear incidental music wafting over from someone
else's sound system. Even geography can fit into the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, music is a very public thing,'' says Robert
Christgau, pop music critic for The Village Voice. ``It's songs you
hear in open-air situations. Up north, I think that means more than
it does down south, because our summer season is shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason you hear about singles of the summer while
you don't hear about, say, singles of the fall. Radio programmers
say that because school is out in the summer, the days are longer
and TV is in reruns, radio listening increases. But not all summers
have representative singles; sometimes, the music's just not strong
enough or right enough. Then again, some summers have more than one
flagship single. A good example is the summer of 1978, when the
Rolling Stones' ``disco'' move ``Miss You'' hit at the same time
that John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were singing about
``Summer Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Once again, this may be a personal thing. When ``Miss You'' came
out, I had just moved to Los Angeles, leaving behind a crush that
was never reciprocated. As a generational song, ``Summer Nights''
probably gets the edge, because not only was it a big summer hit,
it was ABOUT summer. But just because a song sounds summery doesn't
mean it was released in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of (the Beach Boys') `Good Vibrations' as a
summer song, because I remember, quite distinctly, listening to
that record in November in my car,'' Christgau says. ``The reason
`Good Vibrations' registers as a summer song is supposedly
everything the Beach Boys do is about summer. It's really about
California, where it's summer for eight months a year.''
</P>
<P>
   You can write a song about summer and release it in the summer,
but that won't make it a single of the summer. First Class' ``Beach
Baby'' fits the criteria, but who even really remembers what year
it came out? (Answer: 1974.) You can't force a single of the
summer; it has to happen by itself. A single of the summer can't be
self-conscious; the most evocative ones (such as ``Every Breath You
Take,'' which lingered at No. 1 for eight weeks in 1983) probably
didn't even feel like singles of the summer when they were first
released. But hearing them later always takes you back to that
certain time.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that stops record companies from trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of their biggest hypes when they're pushing songs is,
`It's a great summertime record,' '' Morales says. ``But if the
listeners don't go for it, it's not going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations have also tried forcing the matter. Recently,
stations have tried to give the honor to songs as unsummery as
Collective Soul's ``December,'' which was released in summer 1995
but was a self-pitying ditty about a wintry breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, one of the radio stations here kept calling this
song `Hooch' the single of the summer,'' says McMahon, the KTXQ
program director. ``I don't think a radio station has the power to
do that.'' Sure enough, it's hard to remember who even sang
``Hooch'' (answer: Everything), while the 1998 single-of-the-summer
honors probably go to Barenaked Ladies' inescapable ``One Week'' or
Fastball's ``The Way'' (a perfect summer song for road-trippers).
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's theory of ubiquity fits in here; ``One Week'' and ``The
Way'' received airplay all over. But he believes that the
fragmentation of radio formats has made it more difficult for a
summer to have a representative song. In 1965, ``Satisfaction'' was
played on the same stations that played ``I Got You Babe,'' ``The
Same Old Song'' and ``Papa's Got a Brand New Bag.'' Today, it would
be unusual to hear a rock song, a folk song, an R&AMP;B song and a funk
song on the same contemporary radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, other people's radios often keep the phenomenon
alive. Some R&AMP;B hits, such as Coolio's ``Fantastic Voyage'' and
TLC's ``Waterfalls,'' cross over to Top 40 radio, but that doesn't
mean that fans of ``alternative'' rock, country or hard rock are
going to hear these songs _ unless they're channel-surfers, or they
hear someone else playing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think that the rise of the boom box and the moving
sound system has a lot to do with this,'' Christgau says. ``That's
been a really important change in just putting music out on the
street in a way it didn't use to be. Up here, at least one (single
of the summer) is gonna be a hip-hop song. Because hip-hop
dominates street culture. ... I'm talking about what people listen
to on the streets, even in white neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the single of the summer for 1999?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's Ricky Martin's `Livin' La Vida Loca,' '' says
Morales, the KISS music director. ``We're banging the hell out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, to show you how subjective this is, Christgau disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's peaking a little early to be a summer song, I think,'' he
says. ``It was No. 1 for five weeks and it's on the way down.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be too early to tell whether this summer has a song;
TLC's ``No Scrubs'' is hanging around, and Will Smith's ``Wild Wild
West'' seems likely to peak on the charts about the same time the
``West'' movie comes out, on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Martin's ``La Vida Loca'' is pretty much everywhere.
You don't even have to be outside to hear it; if you're in a
restaurant, a clothing store or coffee shop that's tuned in to KISS
or one of its rivals, you're likely to hear Martin's hit. As
Christgau says, it's the music that's in the air.

PERSONAL HEALTH: PARADOX OR NOT, CHOLESTEROL IS ON THE RISE IN
FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
repeating to fix coding  (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans, famous for wanting their cake and eating it too, were
delighted to learn that even though French foods seem to be rich in
fat, much of it artery-clogging saturated animal fat, the French
are not nearly as likely to be cut down in midlife by heart
attacks. This intriguing phenomenon is called the French Paradox,
and it has drawn comment, criticism and speculation for much of
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest treatise on the subject, published in a recent
issue of The British Medical Journal, suggests the paradox may not
be so paradoxical after all. Rather, the authors maintain, it is
only a matter of time before the fatty French diet exacts its
coronary toll. These scientists, Drs. Malcolm Law and Nicholas
Wald, specialists in preventive medicine at St. Bartholomew's and
the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, point out that
for decades until 1970, the French ate much less animal fat and had
significantly lower blood cholesterol levels than did Britons, who
were in no better shape than Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But as the French diet grew richer, French cholesterol levels
did too. ``Only between 1970 and 1980 did French values increase to
those in Britain,'' the authors noted, adding that since only about
1 percent of men die of heart disease before age 50, it takes
decades of exposure to a high-fat diet to exact this toll.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new British report is the most thorough analysis of
this ``time-lag hypothesis,'' it has been put forward before as an
explanation for French diet and health. Dr. Marion Nestle,
chairwoman of the department of nutrition at New York University,
noted several years ago that it was not until 1985 that French
consumption of fat caught up to that of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Nestle said, ``There's been a steady increase
in fat consumption in France over the last 20 years as the French
diet has become more Americanized.'' She noted that the French were
now eating more meat and fast foods, snacking more, eating fewer
regular relaxed meals, exercising less and drinking less wine than
in the past. And, predictably, they are getting fatter.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a few more decades, Nestle predicted, and the French will
no longer enjoy a coronary death rate that is less than half that
of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if the French did not reach American levels of fat
consumption until recently, something still seems to have been
protecting their hearts. How else could they have gotten away with
their apparent penchant for eggs, butter and cream, not to mention
pates and rich cheeses full of saturated fat and cholesterol?
</P>
<P>
   Several health experts, commenting on the report by Law and
Wald, have offered possible explanations that could prove helpful
to Americans seeking to lower their risk of heart disease without
forgoing all the pleasures of dietary fat.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Meir Stampfer and Dr. Eric Rimm of the Harvard School of
Public Health stress in their commentary that coronary disease is
not due to any single factor and that preventing it cannot result
from only one adjustment in living habits, like eating less
saturated fat. Although they do not dismiss the idea that time will
take its toll on the French heart, they cite several other
differences in dietary habits between the French and Britons (and,
by extension, Americans) that studies strongly suggest play an
important role in heart disease. For example:
</P>
<P>
   ALCOHOL _ ``Law and Wald may be too quick to dismiss the role of
alcohol as a partial explanation,'' the Boston researchers wrote.
Many studies have shown a strong relationship between an increased
intake of alcohol and a lower level of cardiac deaths. Alcohol
raises blood levels of protective HDL cholesterol, which helps rid
arteries of fatty deposits. Red wine in particular, the favored
beverage in France, contains chemicals that lower the risk of blood
clots that could touch off a heart attack. Also important may be
the pattern of alcohol consumption. In France wine is drunk slowly
with meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence of benefit from moderate consumption of alcohol
is very, very strong, and it seems to be strongest when alcohol is
taken with meals on a moderate, regular basis as opposed to weekend
bingeing or alcohol consumed alone,'' Stampfer said in an
interview. Moderate consumption means a daily limit of two glasses
of wine for men and one glass for women.
</P>
<P>
   FIBER _ The French consume two to three times more fiber from
whole grains and grain products than do Britons and Americans.
These cereal fibers have been linked in at least three major
studies to a decreased risk of heart disease, most recently this
month in a study of nearly 69,000 middle-aged nurses published in
The Journal of the American Medical Association. Each increase of
five grams a day of cereal fiber (the amount in a half-cup of
bran-flake cereal) was associated with a 37 percent decrease in
coronary risk among these women. Similar associations were found in
the Iowa Women's Study and in men in the Health Professionals
Follow-Up Study.
</P>
<P>
   NUTS _ The French eat about twice as many nuts as Americans do.
Several studies that followed tens of thousands of men and women in
this country showed that ``even modest amounts of nuts were
associated with a markedly lower risk of coronary heart disease, a
benefit greater than would be predicted from their effects on serum
cholesterol,'' Stampfer said. The fat in nuts is the unsaturated
kind that lowers the level of harmful LDL cholesterol.
``Ironically, many health-conscious Americans have been avoiding
nuts because they are high in fat,'' he noted. Over all, for the
last 30 years, the French intake of heart-sparing polyunsaturated
fat has been nearly twice that in Britain, Stampfer and Rimm noted.
</P>
<P>
   FOLATE _ When Americans visit France or dine in fancy French
restaurants in this country, they tend to eat rich, fancy foods.
``But the French people don't eat fancy foods day to day,''
Stampfer said. ``They eat many more fruits and vegetables,''
including those that are rich in a B-vitamin called folate (or
folic acid), which has been associated with a decreased risk of
heart disease. Good sources of folate include dark-green leafy
vegetables and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   GLYCEMIC LOAD _ Frequent consumption of foods that quickly raise
the level of sugar in the blood has been linked to an increased
risk of developing heart disease and diabetes. When blood sugar
rises, insulin is released to process it, which stimulates the
production of a harmful form of triglycerides, a known coronary
risk factor. In general, whole foods and minimally processed grains
(including pasta, which is made from crushed as opposed to finely
ground semolina wheat) produce a low glycemic load, while sweets,
pastries, white bread and potatoes produce a high glycemic load.
Americans who snack on sweets and refined carbohydrates raise their
glycemic load and, in turn, their risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   CHEESE AND FOIE GRAS _ Dr. Serge Renaud, research director at
France's National Institute of Health and Medical Research,
maintains that there is something different about the fats in duck
and goose liver and in cheese that makes them less damaging and
possibly even protective of the heart. His evidence in part comes
from the heart of foie gras country, the Gascony region of
southwest France, where the coronary death rate among middle-aged
men is about half that of the rest of France. He has said that
``goose and duck fat is closer in chemical composition to olive oil
than it is to butter and lard.'' What, if anything, may be special
about the fats in cheese is now under study.
</P>
<P>
   PORTION SIZE _ Rich foods or not, the French simply eat less
than Americans do. French portion sizes tend to be a third to a
half of American portions, and until recently, the French sat down
to eat leisurely meals three times a day and rarely ate between
meals, Nestle said. French visitors to America are typically aghast
at the amount of food piled on plates in American restaurants and
homes. The French are more gourmets than gluttons, as evidenced by
the difference in obesity rates: 30 percent here versus 8 percent
there.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their dietary advantages, the French still get heart
disease. Dr. Dean Ornish, cardiac specialist at the University of
California at San Francisco, has pointed out that while ``heart
attacks are less frequent in France, they are still the leading
cause of death there.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Nestle noted, French habits are changing, and not for the
better. Children are now given soft drinks, not wine, to drink;
wine consumption over all has dropped to about half of former
levels; snacking is now commonplace, more and more family meals are
coming from pizza parlors and McDonald's and more people are
driving to big markets to shop instead of walking to local
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   As she and others have said, it is only a matter of time.

researchers, physicians and parents who are concerned about the
female athlete triad, a syndrome experts have defined as three
distinct but related problems: disordered eating, suspended
menstrual cycle and premature bone loss.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall understands the syndrome, which can lead to
permanent damage, better than many. She lived it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Ms. Marshall was the youngest member of the U.S.
women's Olympic gymnastics team, which finished fourth in Munich.
The next year, at age 15, she left her hometown of Urbana, Ill., to
train with her coach in Eugene, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a group house with eight other gymnasts, Ms. Marshall
spent most of her time in the gym, practicing six hours a day
almost every day of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult time for me,'' said Ms. Marshall, now 42
and living in Salem, Ore. ``When I hit puberty, I didn't have the
guiding influence of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   As the months passed, Ms. Marshall began to lose her
preadolescent body shape, so valued in gymnastics. After gaining 10
pounds, she started a series of fad diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while I tried a no-carbohydrates diet,'' Ms. Marshall
said, ``then for three weeks I had only onion soup and Fresca. My
weight went up and down. I wasn't anorexic, but I had definite
disordered eating and no energy at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall's erratic eating pattern and rigorous exercise led
to amenorrhea, generally defined as the cessation of the menstrual
period for at least three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have my period for a year,'' Ms. Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of injuries, and worried about the long-term
health of her bones and cessation of menstruation, Ms. Marshall and
her parents decided that she should return home. The experience
convinced her that she should suspend the high-level training
needed to gain a spot on the 1976 Olympic team, and limit herself
to gymnastics competition at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened to me,'' Ms. Marshall said, ``it became a
passion to do something about the female athlete triad.''
</P>
<P>
   Through her wellness program, Ms. Marshall strives to help
athletes and parents and to educate coaches in a number of health
areas, including the triad.
</P>
<P>
   The female athlete triad is now widely discussed in
sportsmedicine and coaching circles, and a number of medical
journals _ including the New England Journal of Medicine _ have
reported on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the National Institutes of Health and
American Academy of Orthopedic Surgery held a joint workshop to
discuss the triad, and the American College of Sports Medicine and
the U.S. Olympic Committee held a half-day seminar on the subject.
The latter two groups convened a panel of experts to create a
consensus statement about the triad. The statement is to be
released in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The female athlete triad is not new. The term was coined in
1992, when a group of concerned female doctors and sports
scientists became alarmed after seeing more and more female
athletes who were not eating well, not menstruating and suffering
stress fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Aurelia Nattiv, an assistant professor of family medicine
and orthopedic surgery at the University of California at Los
Angeles and a team physician in the university's Department of
Intercollegiate Athletics, was one of the first physicians to
notice the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all seemed to have the same story,'' Dr. Nattiv said. ``It
wasn't just a coincidence that these three things were occurring
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating disorders in female athletes gained widespread attention
in 1994 with the death of Christy Henrich, a world-class gymnast
who suffered from anorexia nervosa and bulimia. At the time of her
death at age 22, the 4-foot, 11-inch Ms. Henrich weighed less than
60 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No studies have pinpointed exactly how prevalent disordered
eating is among female athletes, mainly because of disagreement
about how to define the disorder. But informal surveys suggest that
15 percent to 62 percent of female athletes are affected by
disordered eating behavior that ranges from a preoccupation with
losing weight to anorexia or bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many athletes do not necessarily meet the strict psychiatric
criteria for an eating disorder,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Joy, an
assistant professor in the Department of Family and Preventive
Medicine and a team physician at the University of Utah in Salt
Lake City. ``But if an athlete demonstrates restricted eating
behavior that does result in amenorrhea, I don't care what you call
it, it's clearly not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Amenorrhea occurs in many women who practice disordered eating
and rigorous athletic training. Deprived of fuel and exercising at
a high level, the body can move into a state of energy imbalance, a
kind of starvation mode. When this occurs, the body may respond by
shutting off systems that are not essential, like the reproductive
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In women who are training intensely, as many as 40 or 50
percent may be amenorrheic,'' said Dr. Anne B. Loucks, a professor
in the Department of Biological Sciences at Ohio University. ``It
may be even higher for cross-country runners and ballet dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the general population, amenorrhea affects 2 percent to 5
percent of women who would be expected to have menstrual periods,
Loucks said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts worry that many female athletes _ and a fair number of
doctors _ hold the belief that amenorrhea is a natural side effect
of high-level exercise. But, Loucks cautioned, ``This should not be
considered a healthy part of training. It is a serious medical
condition that requires treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The third component of the triad, loss of bone tissue, is
quietly dangerous. When a young woman's body falls into a
low-estrogen state, similar to a postmenopausal woman, she may
experience decreased bone density, an early stage of osteoporosis.
In runners especially, this may show up as a stress fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though it's never too late to work on bone health,'' said
Nattiv, who is also director of the Osteoporosis Center at UCLA,
``bone loss may be irreversible. As these women get older and more
frail they are going to be set up for a more serious problem like a
hip fracture because of their low bone density.''
</P>
<P>
   Although experts stress that any female athlete is at risk for
the female athlete triad, those in certain sports are more likely
to experience the problem. For example, women who compete in
endurance sports like distance running _ in which low body weight
can improve performance _ may be at high risk for the syndrome.
Sports that are judged subjectively, like figure skating, diving,
gymnastics, those with body-hugging uniforms, like swimming and
gymnastics, and sports with weight categories, like martial arts,
may also produce a disproportionate share of athletes with the
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   But some doctors and coaches believe that gymnasts may be at
particular risk. In that sport, the best performers are often
preadolescents _ or those with a preadolescent body type. Gymnasts
who gain weight or those with larger body frames may try
desperately to lose weight, which can spiral into the female
athlete triad.
</P>
<P>
   Psychological reasons may also explain the prevalence of the
triad among female gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sport attracts athletes who are also at risk for
developing eating disorders,'' Ms. Marshall said. ``Age is also a
factor: Gymnasts are often adolescent women, which is also the
primary population for eating disorders. And those the sport
attracts are highly motivated, very driven, detail oriented people,
personality traits common in those with eating disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Nattiv added, ``The same characteristics that make her your best
athlete, also put her at greatest risk for the triad.''
</P>
<P>
   For parents and coaches and for athletes who are concerned about
any of the female athlete triad disorders in themselves or
teammates, the first step should be to consult a health care
professional who is familiar with the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to do something,'' said Audrius Barzdukas,
associate director of coaching for the U.S. Olympic Committee. ``If
something doesn't seem right, it's better to err on the side of
caution than to ignore a potentially life-threatening problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the female athlete triad is serious, Ms. Marshall said,
it should not drive women away from exercise or competitive sport.
``Sports is a good thing. The question is: If the majority of women
are coming out of sports with character strengthening and life
skills, how we can we help the segment that gets out of balance?''

THE `REEL' MOMENTS OF FATHERHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TO STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Now I was in one heck of a mess, I figured, and
it meant big trouble. Big Trouble with Dad.
</P>
<P>
   I was 11 years old, back when I thought I could think a fish on
the hook, and we were fishing in a small boat in the shallows of
Monterey Bay, just off Capitola. It was a warm, blue-sky day, with
scarcely a breeze and just a light roll to the calm, briny blue. We
had anchored along some shallow kelp beds, then dropped our baits
to the bottom, just 40 or 50 feet deep, and started catching small
rockfish and maybe a rock crab now and then.
</P>
<P>
   We were fishing in a wood dory that had a mid-boat engine well,
and when my dad wasn't looking, I began pointing my rod inside that
engine well. I started to think it would be fun to catch a fish
right through the engine well, as if I had caught a fish inside the
boat. But after I cut a small piece of bait, I suddenly noticed
that my fishing rod had somehow disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   First, I accused my brother, Bob Jr., of stealing it. When he
professed convincing innocence, I figured a pelican had flown off
with it when I wasn't looking. But then I noticed that I still had
my bait in one hand, hook in the other, and started tracing the
line. I followed it across the boat, and there it went, right
through that engine well and into the ocean below; somehow I had
dropped my fishing rod right through the engine well in the boat:
The rod was on the bottom of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, Dad, I've got a little problem with my line,'' I
explained.
</P>
<P>
   He traced the line with his eyes into the sea, and after a
shocked, ``What will you do next?'' he started pulling on my line.
In time, to my amazement, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got something coming up now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough. In a few minutes, by hand-lining the fishing line,
he was eventually able to pull the rod in right off the bottom of
the ocean. It popped through the engine well, and in minutes, I was
fishing again, though with the requisite, ``How did you manage to
do that!'' from brother Bob. After all, brothers keep track of
screw-ups.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of moments that boys, brothers and parents
remembered Sunday, Father's Day. Sure, dad usually feels it's his
job to provide his family with a home, food, safety and security.
But that's not what kids remember. They remember the moments when
they were in trouble, a mess from which there appears no possible
extrication, and somehow dad bails them out. That is what Father's
Day is really about.
</P>
<P>
   Well, last week was a special time for my own two kids, Kris, 8,
and Jeremy, 11. Like so many youngsters across America, they got
out of school for summer, but a special reward came when I was able
to get permission from Brian Riley of Red Bank Quail to take the
boys out on the 15,000 acres of property he manages and fish a few
of the farm ponds there.
</P>
<P>
   As we drove to Red Bluff, there were visions of so many bass and
bluegill that we'd have to fight them off with the oars. To make
the trip work, I bought each of the boys a raft, so they could
paddle around the ponds and fish, and I'd be nearby in a float
tube.
</P>
<P>
   It was a warm evening, clear sky, with a light ripple on the
pond from a breeze out of the north. As we arrived in my old pickup
truck, we watched a fish rising on the surface in the corner of a
pond, leaving little swirls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' Jeremy said in a nervous whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it, too,'' Kris answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go get him,'' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy jumped out of the truck, grabbed his rod and snuck up on
that fish from shore. His first cast landed with a plop, sending
out miniature rings on the surface, and the lure sat motionless,
floating quietly, until the rings disappeared. Then Jeremy twitched
that lure, and in the next instant, a fish smashed into it and
practically came flying out of the water, and then came the shout,
``I got him!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was a friendly tussle, and it turned out be a bluegill,
a strong little fellow, and I showed Jeremy how to grab the hook
with pliers and release the fish back to the lake without harming
it.
</P>
<P>
   In minutes, we plunked our rafts in the lake, strapped on our
life vests, then starting floating around, casting about with our
lures, catching fish, letting them go amid shouts that echoed
across the water ... ``I got one'' ... ``Look at this one!'' ...
``This one's huge!''
</P>
<P>
   As dusk arrived, the bullfrogs were croaking away in the tules
along the shore, and sometimes when we approached, they would jump
a foot or two, startling us for moment. When it was time to leave,
we'd caught too many fish to count. At one point, Jeremy was in
what he called ``Bluegill Central,'' a fish a cast. At another,
Kris announced he was going to catch one at a certain spot, then
did.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, this is what being a dad is all about, and I announced it
was time to head out, but across the pond, Jeremy was lost in
concentration, working on a knot or something in his little raft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working on a line problem,'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, he was still out there, floating about, not
fishing, but working at something. It was nearly dark now.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with a giant grin he rowed in. As he neared shore, I
could see that in his raft was this giant mess, the fishing line,
billowing in a huge tangle in a two-foot mound, all of it, with no
line left on his reel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he grinned. Later, he confided: ``I was changing lures
and I noticed my rod was gone,'' he explained. ``I didn't know
where it was for a second, then I followed the line and it went
right out of the boat and into the pond, and that's when I figured
out it was on the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added: ``So I started pulling the line in, all of it,
until the rod came back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kris grinned, a triumphant moment for his brother to get in a
mess. After all, he noted, ``I'm usually the one getting in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Jeremy added, ``You might not understand how a thing like
this can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, actually, I know exactly how these things can happen,''
remembering when I had done the same exact thing on that day out in
Capitola.
</P>
<P>
   It's knowing about how ``these things can happen'' and making
them OK that makes being a dad special.

SUMMERTIME BLUES AND RED-HOT SINGLES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies SUMMER SONGS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Singles of the summer don't have to be about the summer, but it
helps. The only criterion for this subjective and highly personal
list of singles of the summer is that the songs actually were hits
in the summers of their respective years. Not every year has a
single of the summer; some years have more than one. Here are some
choices from the past 35 years. Feel free to argue with them.
</P>
<P>
   1964: ``Dancing in the Street,'' Martha and the Vandellas _ The
group that gave us ``Heat Wave'' in the summer of '63 peaked at No.
2 with this anthem, a call to party in a nation still jolted by the
Kennedy assassination and starting to become divided over Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   1965: ``(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,'' the Rolling Stones _
Arguably the most famous riff in rock history announces a song
about youthful disaffection, lust and rebellion, sung by Mick
Jagger in a voice that moves from a purr to a yowl.
</P>
<P>
   1966: ``Summer in the City,'' The Lovin' Spoonful _ A crashing
organ introduces one of the best summer songs of all time, painting
a picture of sidewalks hotter than a matchstick and joyous
nighttime meetings on rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   1967: (four-way tie) ``Groovin','' the Little Rascals; ``Light
My Fire,'' the Doors; ``All You Need Is Love,'' the Beatles; ``Ode
to Billie Joe,'' Bobbie Gentry _ If any summer proved that it could
hold more than one single, it was the Summer of Love. A celebration
of a lazy Sunday afternoon; a dark, lusty anthem driven by a trashy
Farfisa organ; a Fab Four plea for unity; and a countryish
melodrama about a mysterious death _ all ruled the airwaves that
year.
</P>
<P>
   1969: ``Hot Fun in the Summertime,'' Sly &AMP; the Family Stone _
Sly's good-time song, which sounds like it was made to be played at
a picnic, would be one of the last times he evinced a vibe this
positive.
</P>
<P>
   1970: ``In the Summertime,'' Mungo Jerry _ Easily the goofiest
song on this list, this skiffle-group hit was anachronistic even
when it peaked at No. 3 in July 1970 _ and yet it's completely
infectious.
</P>
<P>
   1975: ``Love Will Keep Us Together,'' the Captain and Tennille _
Hey, we didn't say we LIKED all these songs. But in the summer of
'75, you couldn't get away from this perky concoction, which stayed
No. 1 for four weeks. Maybe it was this, and not disco, that led to
the fragmentation of radio formats.
</P>
<P>
   1978: (tie) ``Miss You,'' the Rolling Stones _ The Stones'
``disco'' move _ really not a very good dance song _ got them
airplay on stations that had given up on them, making the song
unavoidable during the summer of '78. ``Summer Nights,'' John
Travolta and Olivia Newton-John _ Just as faux retro as ``Miss
You'' was faux disco, this was completely manufactured nostalgia
(and poorly produced, too _ the background singers all but drown
out the weaker-voiced leads). But it was about summer nights (and
days), so we all said, ``Tell me more, tell me more.''
</P>
<P>
   1979: ``Funkytown,'' Lipps Inc. _ Yeah, so maybe it wasn't THE
single of the summer, but it's one of the best disco songs, with a
driving groove and a buoyant chorus. It was also the epitome of an
open-air song, because even those of us who were anti-disco in '79
couldn't get away from the blasted thing. Not that all of us wanted
to.
</P>
<P>
   1983: ``Every Breath You Take,'' the Police _ Sting's lyric,
about stalker-level obsession, was so misinterpreted as a love song
that Sting wrote ``If You Love Somebody Set Them Free'' as an
answer to it a couple of years later. But this stayed at No. 1 for
eight weeks, entering the chart in June and staying on the radio
the remainder of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   1984: ``When Doves Cry,'' Prince _ Man, what a day the first
Tuesday in June was this year, as Prince's ``Purple Rain'' and
Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the U.S.A.'' albums were both
released. But ``Rain's'' flagship single, about the wounds created
by a turbulent relationship, stayed at No. 1 for five weeks and
sounded far more summery than any of the Springsteen singles (note
to wise guys: ``Glory Days'' was released the next summer).
</P>
<P>
   1989: ``Love Shack,'' the B-52's _ Believe it or not, this
didn't debut on the Top 40 till September, but it bubbled under so
long on then-new ``alternative rock'' formats that it felt like a
single of the summer, especially with its lines about laughin' and
a-dancin', kissin' and a-huggin'. To think that we ever thought of
such ebullience as ``alternative'' ...
</P>
<P>
   1994: ``Fantastic Voyage,'' Coolio _ Yes, we know, we skipped
some years, and during one of 'em Boyz II Men's ``End of the Road''
ruled the summer charts. The Boyz had an even bigger hit in summer
'94 with ``I'll Make Love to You.'' But c'mon, what makes you think
more of trips to the beach, the Boyz's too-cool harmonies or
Coolio's bouncin' hip-hop anthem that beckons you to slide, slide,
slippity-slide?
</P>
<P>
   1998: ``The Way,'' Fastball _ Yeah, Barenaked Ladies' ``One
Week'' was all over the place, but this song had it beat for summer
feeling; it starts like it's on an old transistor radio, it has a
keyboard riff AND a chorus you swear you've heard before, and it's
about a couple of folks who simply decide to aimlessly hit the
highway. Perfect road-trip music.

MELATONIN USED TO RESTORE SLEEP PATTERNS IN BLIND PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By ERICA GOODE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Dr. James Stevenson, then a graduate student
in psychology at Stanford University, developed a theory about why
he had so much trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, who had been blind from birth, suffered insomnia at
night, and in the daytime experienced ``sleep attacks,'' which
arrived one hour later each day, playing havoc with his efforts to
get to classes on time.
</P>
<P>
   He had read that in blinded animals, the body's clock, normally
harnessed to the 24-hour cycle of daylight and darkness, often goes
into free run, shifting sleep patterns. His own sleeping
difficulties, Stevenson suspected, might have a similar origin.
</P>
<P>
   A sleep researcher, Dr. Laughton Miles, later confirmed what
Stevenson had concluded: In the absence of light, his body had
taken up a free-running, 24.9-hour circadian rhythm of sleep and
wakefulness, a schedule that shifted his natural sleeping time back
by nearly an hour each day.
</P>
<P>
   But Miles, who in 1977 published a scientific report on
Stevenson's case, could find no way to fix the problem, nor could
other researchers, who have spent two decades seeking effective
treatments for the sleep problems caused by free-running circadian
rhythms, which affect about half the 200,000 Americans who are
totally blind.
</P>
<P>
   If a study to be presented Tuesday at the annual meeting of the
Associated Profession Sleep Societies in Orlando, Fla., holds up,
however, the search may finally be over.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert L. Sack, Dr. Alfred J. Lewy and Richard L. Brandes of
the Sleep and Mood Disorders Laboratory at Oregon Health Sciences
University, are scheduled to present their finding that a daily
10-milligram dose of the hormone melatonin successfully
``entrained'' the free-running rhythms of six out of seven totally
blind subjects, returning them to a normal, 24-hour sleep pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even entraining one blind person with melatonin is
important,'' said Charmane Eastman, director of the Biological
Rhythms Research Laboratory at Rush Presbyterian-St. Lukes Medical
Center in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, she said, has implications not only for the
blind, who often list sleep problems as one of the most difficult
aspects of their disability, but also for sighted people, whose
circadian rhythms can be altered by jet lag or shift work.
</P>
<P>
   Lewy, director of the sleep lab at Oregon, said, ``Totally blind
people offer a natural way to study the human body clock, without
the interference of light cues.''
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier study, the researchers tried using a 5-milligram
dose of melatonin without success. ``We got some shifting of
rhythms, but we weren't able to establish a clear 24-hour cycle,''
Sack said.
</P>
<P>
   A few other investigators have reported single cases in which
melatonin corrected free-running sleep-wake cycles in blind people.
And Stevenson, now a research psychologist at NASA Ames Research
Center in Mountainview, Calif., said he began taking melatonin
before bedtime in 1987, and now sleeps normally. But the new study
compared melatonin with placebo pills in a group of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland _ a tiny structure
deep in the brain _ and helps regulate the body's biological clock.
In sighted people, melatonin secretion is synchronized with the
24-hour cycle of daylight and darkness, turning on at nightfall,
and continuing for about 12 hours. But in the absence of light,
most people's body clocks run on a cycle slightly longer than 24
hours, Sack said.
</P>
<P>
   The hormone is also sold over the counter as a nutritional
supplement, usually in 3-milligram tablets. Taken in the afternoon,
it shifts the body's clock earlier, tricking it into thinking dusk
has already fallen. Taken in the morning, however, it delays the
clock, as if dawn had not yet arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists still know little about the effects of melatonin at
different dosages: In sleep studies, researchers have used doses as
small as 0.3 milligrams and as large as 75 milligrams or higher.
Sack said for some blind people 10 milligrams may be more than is
needed. He and his colleagues are conducting further research to
see if dosages between 5 and 10 milligrams are equally effective.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the subjects, who did not know which treatment
they were receiving, took melatonin an hour before bedtime for a
period of weeks, then were switched to a dummy pill, or vice versa.
The length of time it took for the melatonin to shift rhythms back
to normal varied from person to person. ``Without knowledge of a
person's circadian phase,'' Sack and his colleagues wrote, ``it may
be difficult to know the best day for initiating melatonin
treatment; thus entrainment may not occur for weeks or months.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Zang, a 47-year-old man from Portland who has been
totally blind since being hit in the head by a stray bullet while
sitting in his pickup truck 16 years ago, said the benefits of
melatonin became apparent not long after he started taking the
supplement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the study, I had no control of my sleep,'' Zang said.
``I'd sleep any time of the day or night. I'd be awake at 2 in the
morning and fall asleep at noon. But since I've been on the
melatonin I go to sleep at 11 o'clock and wake up at 5, 6 or 7.''

   Metal in the Microwave
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1 in the modern kitchen: never put metal in the
microwave. Aluminum foil and metal containers reflect, rather than
absorb, microwave radiation, and can cause overheating, arcing,
even fire.
</P>
<P>
   But now materials scientists at Pennsylvania State University
have developed a process that allows metal to be microwaved. Rather
than popcorn, their ovens produce precision machine parts.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers adapted a technique known as sintering, in which
powdered metals are cold-pressed into a desired shape and heated
below the melting point until the powders fuse. Most sintering
processes use a conventional furnace, although some microwave
sintering of ceramics and semimetals (containing carbide) has been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The Penn State team, which described its research in the journal
Nature, used mixtures of powdered iron, copper, tungsten and other
metals in microwave ovens of up to 6,000 watts. The researchers
found that rather than reflecting microwaves, the powdered metals
absorbed them.
</P>
<P>
   The cold-pressed parts, toothed gears and other components up to
about two inches wide, were placed in a ceramic tube in the oven.
The tube, a key to the process, allows microwaves in but will not
let the resulting heat out, helping to maintain the high
temperatures (typically 2,000 degrees) needed for sintering. The
researchers found that in many cases, microwaved parts were denser
and harder than similar parts sintered in a conventional furnace.
</P>
<P>
   Secrets of the Mayans
</P>
<P>
   The materials scientists among the ancient peoples that once
dominated Central America did not have high technology at their
disposal, but their results were equally astonishing. Among other
things, the Mayans and other civilizations made natural latex into
rubber, producing strips for attaching ax heads to handles, hollow
figurines, and balls for the ritual ball game that played such a
huge role in their societies.
</P>
<P>
   Rubber was made in Central America as early as 1600 B.C.,
predating modern vulcanization processes by a cool 3,500 years. And
the secret formula has been out for a long time: Spanish invaders
in the 16th century described how the Indians mixed latex sap with
juice from a type of morning glory vine to make the rubber. What
has been lacking has been an understanding of how the process
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have
now filled in some of the gaps. Ancient samples were too heavily
oxidized and otherwise degraded for analysis, so the researchers
found the next best thing: rubber produced by the same traditional
process by people in the Chiapas region of southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The MIT team compared unprocessed latex, which becomes brittle
when dried, to the rubber. They found that proteins and other
compounds in unprocessed latex disrupt interactions among the
polymer chains. The vine liquid separates these compounds, allowing
the polymer chains to become entangled. Other compounds in the vine
liquid itself increase the cross-linking between the polymers. Both
phenomena help account for the rubbery qualities of the finished
product.
</P>
<P>
   Origin of a Comet
</P>
<P>
   In studying how an icy comet has evolved, one clue can be found
in the amount of carbon monoxide it gives off as it nears the Sun.
Relatively less carbon monoxide would mean that the comet formed in
the warmer confines of the ancient disk of gas and dust that
swirled around and eventually formed the planets. More carbon
monoxide would mean the comet was born in the colder gas cloud that
preceded the disk.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers had never had the chance to get detailed
information about cometary carbon monoxide until Hale-Bopp appeared
in 1997. Now, researchers from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and several American universities report that carbon
monoxide emissions from Hale-Bopp are consistent with its having
been formed in the protoplanetary disk, in an area between Jupiter
and Neptune.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, writing in Nature, also report that Hale-Bopp's
carbon monoxide comes from two sources, evenly split: ice in the
nucleus, and the coma, where more complex molecules may be being
broken down by the Sun's warmth.

   Seashells
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do seashells grow?
</P>
<P>
   A. Seashells, and indeed all shells of the mollusk group,
whether they live in salt water, in fresh water or on land, do not
grow by adding cells of living tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they gradually increase in size at one edge, called the
growing edge, as crystals of mineral salts are secreted by a large,
thin, enveloping flap of tissue called the mantle and laid down in
a framework of a hornlike substance called conchiolin.
</P>
<P>
   Seashells are chiefly calcium carbonate, extracted from the
water, according to The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Animal
Kingdom (Danbury Press). In the mantle, tiny tubes excrete the
almost invisible specks of mineral salt that cement to the
conchiolin.
</P>
<P>
   Most shells have three layers: first, a protective outer skin of
organic matter that may be smooth or rough; second, a layer of
crystals arranged at right angles to the surface of the shell, and
finally, an inner layer composed of overlapping crystals. In some
mollusks, like oysters, this layer is pearly and iridescent.
</P>
<P>
   Shells increase in size as material is added to the growing edge
and in thickness as overlapping layers are added to the inner
surface.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an injury to the shell or if a foreign body is
inserted between the mantle and shell, secretions from the mantle
quickly repair the damage or encase the foreign object.

ALZHEIMER'S DOESN'T BLUR PHOTOGRAPHER'S LOVING PORTRAIT OF `POP'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When we meet him, Hy Meyerowitz is 87 years old. He's an affable
sort who loves his wife, Sally, has a kind word and a handshake for
everyone he meets, fondly recalls boxing in the Golden Gloves in
the '20s _ and can remember neither the names of his three sons nor
what he did yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Hy Meyerowitz has Alzheimer's, which is slowly robbing him of
his life experiences _ but which somehow, to judge by his son
Joel's documentary, ``Pop,'' never manages to steal his humanity.
</P>
<P>
   And it is portraying this dichotomy that makes ``Pop,'' which
airs Tuesday night on PBS, such a moving, uplifting hour of
television _ a perfect Father's Day present, two days late.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Meyerowitz is an acclaimed photographer whose work has
appeared in more than 120 exhibitions in museums and galleries
around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York
and the Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   His premise for ``Pop'' was simplicity itself: The two of them,
plus Joel's son Sasha, would go on a two-week road trip to Florida
and back, with Joel goosing Hy's memories as they drive and hit
various tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like a truly bad idea: Let's stick the old guy
with the degenerative brain disease in a car, take him to
unfamiliar surroundings, and ask him a lot of questions. What good
could possibly come of this?
</P>
<P>
   What emerges, however, is a portrait of a man caught between
wholeness and nothingness. And what comes of that, and Hy's
interaction with Joel, is a glimpse of the universal truth of the
bond between all fathers and sons that cannot be broken, that is
unique in the human family.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost sure to be imperfect, and tested in a thousand
ways, but it remains, no matter what changes swirl around it. Even
if the son becomes, in many ways, the protector.
</P>
<P>
   Hy's moments of lucidity _ and there are many _ include poignant
memories, touches of whimsical humor, a genuine love for other
people (friend and stranger, black and white) and a deep insight
into himself. With all his defenses gone, we see the real man,
without pretense. We see him as still in love with his wife, proud
of his kids, and still living life on life's terms.
</P>
<P>
   It is, moreover, hard to believe that this is Joel Meyerowitz's
first film. He deftly intersperses periods in which Hy simply talks
among those moments in which he is gently questioned, and mixes
footage of the journey with photos and film of Hy and his family
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The film has a sweet, easy feel _ in the hands of a lesser
artist this journey could have turned horribly maudlin, but
Meyerowitz never lets that happen.
</P>
<P>
   We feel for Hy, and we gain more insight into just how baffling
the disease's effects are, but we are never asked to view him as
just a victim, as just an old man with a nice life behind him and a
horrible void awaiting.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping the tone just right _ through memories, through
subtly placed music, through showing Hy as a fully formed man,
warts and all _ we feel more for him, and for the relationship
between Hy and Joel.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it wasn't much, but it was great, I was having a great
time all the time,'' he says at one point, and it's a totally
revealing moment. We see that Hy realized he was one among many,
that he always felt he had a responsibility to his friends and
neighbors to do his best, and that that love of simply being alive
could not be killed.
</P>
<P>
   Hy Meyerowitz did his best. His was not an extraordinary life,
but it was one lived extraordinarily well _ even at the end.
Meyerowitz has given us the universal through the specific. ``Pop''
captures both the idea that your dad is the greatest, strongest,
most powerful man in the world, and the realization that he is
simply flesh and blood. And that's pretty wonderful, too.
</P>

COLUMN: REAL DOGS DON'T BEEP
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Just in time for the millennium (no, not a doomsday comet; we
should be so lucky), comes Aibo, the $2,500 robot dog from Sony
that looks and acts just like a real dog assuming your idea of a
real dog is something with titanium skin and what appears to be a
CB antenna sticking out of its butt.
</P>
<P>
   Aibo, which is short for Artificial Intelligence roBOt, is, in
the lyrical prose of Sony's engineers, ``an autonomous robot that
is capable of not only functioning in response to external
stimulation and its own judgment, but also of expressing various
emotions, growing through learning and communicating with human
beings to provide an entirely new form of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true, you could use similar words to describe Al Gore,
but in this case we are not talking about a presidential candidate
but rather a 3 1/2-pound, 11-inch-long assemblage of circuit boards
and transistors that looks somewhat like a cross between Snoopy and
a Big Bertha driver.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sony geek-speak, ``Aibo has a head and legs with 3
degrees of freedom (up and down, forward and back, left and right)
each, a tail with 2 degrees of freedom (up and down, sideways) and
a mouth with one degree of freedom (open or closed), and is capable
of four-legged locomotion. It incorporates various sensors and
autonomous programs that allow it to behave just like a living
creature, reacting to external stimuli and acting in accordance
with its own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Translated, that means (I think) that Aibo can walk, sit and
beg, lie down, wag its tail, yawn, chase a ball and even dance.
And, just like a real dog, when it runs out of power, you simply
plug Aibo into its own personal battery charger and four hours
later, its ready for more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding, kids! Real dogs don't come with their own battery
charger! And even if they did, the first thing they'd do is bury it
in the yard or drool over it so much that the circuits would short
out and the whole thing would be way too disgusting to touch.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the obvious question of how a robot dog like Aibo
would stack up against a real dog. For testing purposes, the
closest thing I could come to a real dog was our pug, Buster. Don't
worry: Buster was not harmed in any way during this exercise. In
fact, exercise is probably the wrong word to use since he slept the
whole time.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here is a trait-by-trait comparison:
</P>
<P>
   WEIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Aibo: 3.5 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Buster: 25 pounds
</P>
<P>
   Details: Thanks to a diet of scrambled eggs and popcorn, Buster
is an ounce of two over his ideal weight and is currently on a
strict diet (absolutely no sour cream on his baked potato). The
drawback is that when he falls asleep on your lap, your legs go
numb. But unlike Aibo, he makes an excellent doorstop on windy
days.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage: Buster
</P>
<P>
   DISGUSTING PERSONAL HABITS
</P>
<P>
   Aibo: None
</P>
<P>
   Buster: Too many to list.
</P>
<P>
   Details: You don't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage: Aibo
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HE WILL DO IN AN ELECTRICAL STORM
</P>
<P>
   Aibo: Attract lightning
</P>
<P>
   Buster: Hide under bed
</P>
<P>
   Details: Buster is usually found under 13-year-old's bed, as
there is a better selection of food there. If lightning strikes
while Aibo is recharging, your house may become the set for the
upcoming Godzilla sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage: Buster
</P>
<P>
   NUMBER OF STATIONS PICKED UP BY TAIL
</P>
<P>
   Aibo: Dozens, but all in Japanese
</P>
<P>
   Buster: None
</P>
<P>
   Details: When you grow tired of him, Aibo would make a great
$2,500 shish kebab skewer. When you grow tired of Buster, he will
still want more shish kebab.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage: Tie
</P>
<P>
   REACTION TO TV DOORBELLS
</P>
<P>
   Aibo: Whirling of gears, flashing of lights
</P>
<P>
   Buster: BARKBARKBARKBARKBARK!
</P>
<P>
   Details: Thanks to Buster's vigilance, we have never had our
home broken into by Homer Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage: Buster
</P>
<P>
   Well, folks, you can't argue with unbiased scientific research
and you can't argue with whatever this thing was, either. Real dogs
are, for now at least, superior to robot dogs, which is not to say
that Buster's intelligence wouldn't be enhanced by a 100MHz, 64-bit
RISC processor with 16 MB of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he didn't slobber on it or bury it in the yard.

MEDICARE TO BLANKET NATION WITH GUIDEBOOKS

   WASHINGTON _ Following a trial run in five states, the federal
Medicare agency is planning nationwide distribution of a new
consumer guide it held back last year due to fears it would foster
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The handbook, set to go in the mail this fall as part of a $133
million public education campaign, will provide 39 million
beneficiaries with general information about Medicare as well as
available managed care options. The handbook will direct recipients
to a toll-free number and Internet site for more details and
in-depth comparisons of HMO benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials said their experience in five test states _
Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Oregon and Washington _ provided them with
important insight into how to craft the handbook to make it most
useful to the recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a special effort over the past year to really listen
to beneficiaries,'' said Nancy-Ann DeParle, head of the Health Care
Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the Medicare &AMP; You handbook was to be distributed
nationally last year as part of a congressional effort to slow
spending on Medicare by encouraging more older Americans to join
health maintenance organizations and other managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers, Clinton administration officials and senior
advocates became worried that beneficiaries _ most of whom have
little or no experience with managed care _ would be overwhelmed
and frightened by the imposing 45-page handbook, a concern
supported by surveys and focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the national initiative was scrapped and the
five-state pilot program was undertaken instead. In addition, the
Medicare agency conducted in-depth studies of beneficiary response
in five communities in the trial states _- Sarasota, Fla.; Dayton,
Ohio; Eugene, Ore.; Olympia, Wash., and Tucson, Ariz. _ as well as
Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   One of the findings made by the researchers, according to the
health care agency, was that the handbook did not provoke the
predicted anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't happen,'' said Carol Cronin, director of the
health agency's Center for Beneficiary Services.
</P>
<P>
   What the agency did discover was that most beneficiaries glance
through the handbook but hold on to it to refer to the information
when the need arises. The researchers recommended several changes
to make it more digestible, including a quick summary at the front.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, senior advocates and others anticipate the handbook
will spark some puzzlement when it goes out in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable,'' said Tricia Smith, a top lobbyist for the
American Association of Retired Persons. ``You have 39 million
beneficiaries. You have more complex information than they have
confronted before coming into their homes. The fact is this is an
extraordinarily complicated program.''
</P>
<P>
   One source of trouble may be the current upheaval among Medicare
HMOs, with plans withdrawing from counties and scaling back benefit
packages.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to cover whole states and other large geographic areas,
the handbooks will list available HMOs. But all those plans will
not serve all communities receiving the literature.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, beneficiaries who call the hotline or check the Web
site will get brochures describing what plans, if any, serve their
particular ZIP code, raising the possibility of disappointment if
the coverage they wanted is not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to be about more choice but then they find
out they don't have much choice,'' said Smith. She said, though,
the opportunity for a second, more detailed mailing for those who
call the hot line should reduce confusion. ``I think that is
actually a very good step.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some insurance carriers are predicting more turmoil in
the Medicare HMO community in the coming months, DeParle, the
Medicare administrator, is optimistic the disruption will be
minimal. ``I am not anticipating quite what we saw law year,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency intends to print 34 million of the books,
distributing one per household after some couples complained the
agency was wasting money by sending them two. Officials were
enthusiastic about the way the Medicare hotline functioned and
expect callers to get answers with no waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare managed care companies are underwriting the cost of the
education program through a special assessment, a fee the industry
believes is unfair since Medicare HMOs are already struggling
financially and the handbook information goes far beyond managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Medicare beneficiaries in fee-for-service amount to 85
percent of all beneficiaries and managed care plans take care of
only 15 percent, they imposed on managed care plans 100 percent of
the costs,'' said Stephen J. deMontmollin, an executive with AvMed
Health Plan in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But Medicare officials say the assessment is justified because
the handbook will serve as a marketing tool for managed care plans
trying to gain Medicare customers.

`LIMBO' BENDS OVER BACKWARD TO TAKE RISKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer-director John Sayles has a reputation as an
independent-film pioneer. But chatting with Sayles and Maggie
Renzi, his longtime companion and frequent film producer, feels
less like talking about movies than it feels like listening to the
adventures of a world-traveling couple.
</P>
<P>
   Sayles' movies have taken the pair all over, from the Harlem of
1984's ``The Brother From Another Planet'' to the Irish shores of
1994's ``The Secret of Roan Inish'' to the Mexican jungles of last
year's ``Men With Guns.'' Last year, the couple spent the summer in
and around Juneau, Alaska, working on Sayles' 12th directorial
effort, ``Limbo,'' which opened last week. Although they don't make
the job sound a whole lot like work, they give you the sense that
they weren't accidental tourists. They lived the local life, made
friends in the community and came to understand what makes Alaska
unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part of Alaska we were shooting in, until probably the
last 10 years, was mostly men,'' says the tall, affable Sayles.
``Women were very, very scarce. Traditionally, it's a place where
men went to risk their lives to make a living, to make a fortune.
And women were more like camp followers. I'd say in the last 10 to
20 years, really, more and more women have come up there just
because they wanted to come up there _ and they've stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   This knowledge helps inform ``Limbo,'' a complex _ some would
say problematic _ movie that starts, like many of Sayles' films, as
an examination of a culture before switching gears to settle on
three characters. But ``Limbo's'' male lead, Joe Gastineau (David
Strathairn), isn't a risk taker _ he's been reserved and haunted
since a fishing-boat accident 25 years ago. He begins to come alive
again through his burgeoning relationship with feisty singer Donna
De Angelo (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, in a career-defining
performance) and her sullen daughter Noelle (Dallas native Vanessa
Martinez).
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't already know that Sayles and Renzi were a couple,
it would take you seconds to figure it out. They have that way of
picking up on each other's sentences, of pushing the conversation
ahead by filling in each other's gaps. As easy as it is to talk to
them, though, ``Limbo'' is a tough movie to discuss without
spoiling a few things. Sayles continually pulls the rug out from
under his audience, changing the movie's focus and giving it an
abrupt, ambiguous ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a phrase early in the movie where a guy says, `What do
you get when you get on a roller coaster? Not risk, but the
illusion of risk,''' Sayles says. ``Most movies are meant to be
roller-coaster rides. If you think of `Mad Max' or `Raiders of the
Lost Ark,' it's a great roller-coaster ride. There's a lot of
twists and turns, but finally you know that Mel Gibson and Harrison
Ford aren't going to get killed. There's that seat belt, that this
is a `movie' movie. It's the illusion of risk. In this movie, what
I'm asking of the audience is to take that seat belt off.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has been comfortable removing it. Although
``Limbo'' recently earned Sayles the best director award at the
Seattle Film Festival and has received many positive reviews, its
ending has caused a certain amount of outrage among audiences and
critics. Boos were reported at some screenings, and the movie
inspired one California entertainment journalist to write an entire
column about how movies should have endings. Curiously, many of the
reviewers who have taken issue with the movie's unpredictability
are the same ones who object to the connect-the-dots structure of
movies like ``Instinct'' _ and who have forgotten that many
influential movies had ambiguous undertones.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's getting scary,'' Renzi says. ``Either people
have forgotten about the movies they saw before 1980, or they never
saw them. John talks about the ending of `The Graduate,' which as
you remember is not a freeze-frame with the bride and the boy
running away. It is, in fact, the two of them sitting in the back
of the bus riding into the rest of their lives with a big question
mark about what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayles, who says he hasn't read a review since eight movies ago
(a period that would include ``City of Hope'' and ``Lone Star,''
two of Sayles' best efforts), believes that ``Limbo's'' themes are
getting lost in the uproar about the ending. But then, the movie's
various meditations on ``limbo'' aren't easy to address, although
they're more secular than spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, in the movie, limbo kind of represents those
situations that everybody kind of gets into or lives in, where
you're not drowning but you're not going anywhere,'' Sayles says,
citing an example: ``You're in a job you hate, but you know, `I've
got rent to pay, I've got kids to feed, I don't have another job
lined up, it's not a good time to quit. ... Ah, I can stand it.'
... The only way out of those, truly, is either incredible luck _
and that rarely happens _ or taking a risk. And when you take a
risk _ not the illusion of risk, but real risk _ you don't know how
it's going to turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayles' movies have sometimes been criticized for being too
scriptbound, for their sense of concentrating too much on the words
and not the pictures. ``Limbo'' hasn't escaped these complaints,
but the movie's not likely to let down Sayles' admirers, who often
come to his films not for the stories but for the characters and
dialogue. No filmmaker has a stronger sense of place, the result of
his and Renzi's extensive research, their living on location and
their use of local talent wherever they film. And Sayles is rare in
the way that he can provide a story line for even the smallest
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say to the actors in our movies, no matter how small
the part is, the camera should be able to follow you, and we should
feel like you have a totally interesting story to tell,'' Sayles
says. ``This movie could be about you.''

POP STAR TO SELL ESTATE AFTER ZONING CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT REGIS FALLS, N.Y. _ Country-pop music superstar Shania
Twain and her husband-producer Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange have
vacated their vast estate in upstate New York after an
environmental controversy and put the property up for sale for $7.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the largest and most expensive private properties
currently on the market in the six-million acre Adirondack Park.
</P>
<P>
   Twain and Lange have not been seen around their 3,039-acre
Adirondack getaway for months after paying $45,000 in fines,
agreeing to remove soil used to fill protected wetlands and to
address other environmental violations in a settlement with the
Adirondack Park Agency, which oversees zoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've pretty much abandoned the Adirondacks,'' said
Mike Dikun, manager of the Adirondack Regional Airport in Saranac
Lake. There haven't been any sightings since last fall of the
couple, who had flown into the airport frequently in a chartered
private jet and were whisked away in a GMC sport utility vehicle
with a TWAIN vanity plate.
</P>
<P>
   Twain was not available for an interview, her publicist, Jim
Flammia, said. He added that the demands of Twain's tour schedule _
a West Coast swing begins with a concert June 24 in Portland, Ore.
_ likely would not permit her to stop in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``Twain Zone'' by the singer for its remoteness, the
property includes the entire 300-acre Dexter Lake and is located
near Saint Regis Falls, on the northern border of the Adirondack
Park.
</P>
<P>
   The estate features a 26,628-square foot, state-of-the-art
recording studio and apartments designed in the shape of a castle,
with turrets and a glass wall offering panoramic views. Twain and
her husband began building the complex four years ago after tearing
down a historic lakeside mansion. The estate includes a boathouse,
tennis court, horse stables and corrals. The hideaway is accessible
by a mile-long private dirt road through forest land.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, at the gated entrance along Blue Mountain Road, a
guard shack was empty and the only sound was a brisk wind hissing
through pine trees. Orange no trespassing signs were posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're long gone,'' said Wayne Hart, a neighbor on Blue
Mountain Road. ``Even when they were here, they were very quiet and
kept to themselves. I'd see them riding their horses once in a
while, but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain's plans to build a 12,000-square foot lakeside mansion
that she once described as ``Mediterranean-meets-Adirondack Great
Camp'' apparently have been shelved, despite being approved by the
Adirondack Park Agency just last month. That approval would
transfer to a new buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a zoning problem,'' Twain said in the June 14 issue
of People magazine. ``My husband wanted to do a lot of landscaping.
And that landscaping wasn't permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain told the magazine that she and her husband spend most of
their time in Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland, at a 19th-century manor
house overlooking Lake Geneva that they bought in December.
</P>
<P>
   Lange scored platinum album successes with such artists as
Michael Bolton, Bryan Addams and Foreigner before discovering Twain
in a video in 1993 and marrying her later that year. Twain's career
soared with the help of Lange's work on her Grammy-winning 1995
country album, ``The Woman in Me,'' which has sold more than 10
million copies and became the biggest-selling album by a female
artist in country music history.
</P>
<P>
   Their Adirondack estate is in decidedly non-celebrity environs,
surrounded by unpaved roads, mobile homes, sagging bungalows and
junk cars in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   The isolated setting _ 25 miles south of the Canadian border _
fits when one considers that the Canadian-born Twain, 33, grew up
in a poor mining town 500 miles north of Toronto and Lange, 50, who
is from South Africa, is known for a reclusive streak. Lange
recently bought the rights to nearly every photograph ever taken of
him, according to People.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These violations were cited in the November 1998 settlement with
the Adirondack Park Agency:
</P>
<P>
   _ A half-dozen areas where newly built structures, including a
retaining wall and a gazebo, were not set back at least 100 feet
from the lake.
</P>
<P>
   _ Five wetlands areas filled without proper permits, including a
one-acre section at the base of a slope into which the recording
studio was built.
</P>
<P>
   _ Installation of a septic system in a wetlands without proper
permits.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Curran, director of regulatory programs for the agency said
the wetlands fill is currently being removed. The septic system was
relocated to a new site away from the wetlands. Also, movable
structures such as the gazebo were transported beyond the 100-foot
lake setback zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The applicant (Lange) and his representatives really rolled
their sleeves up and did everything they could to correct the
situation,'' Curran said. ``They were very cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Politi, owner of the Lake Placid real estate company
listing the couple's estate, defended Lange and Twain. ``It was an
error in construction,'' Politi said. ``There's a lot worse going
on up here.''

DISNEY'S ANIMATED `TARZAN' MAKES THE LEAP

TARZAN 
Directed by: Kevin Lima, Chris Buck

Rice Burroughs' stories)

<P>
   There have been 47 Tarzan movies, but not until the 48th has
there been an animated ``Tarzan.'' Yet Edgar Rice Burroughs
discussed one with Walt Disney in the 1930s, and in some ways
drawing boards and now computer keyboards are the best routes to
the material. For one thing, they allow Tarzan to do the kind of
vine-swinging that not even Johnny Weissmuller in his prime could
have managed. Tarzan's jungle, given that it always has been a
jungle of the mind, looks better than almost all of Hollywood's
scraggly backlot attempts at the real thing. It's a little much
that Tarzan, as drawn, seems as much a mantis as a man, with no
waist to speak of and bulging thigh muscles. But the main thing is
that Disney's new animated ``Tarzan'' works.
</P>
<P>
   It's the strongest Disney animation of the last few years, a
strapping and satisfyingly crafted effort that will do a better job
of leading young audiences into Tarzaniana than yet another
traditional movie could have. The Disney animation canon, which
seems to have lost momentum with its last few offerings, should be
nudged forward again by ``Tarzan.'' It's lively, vividly drawn,
flecked with emotion without being drenched by it, and finally
addresses the question of what to do with the songs, which lately
have become the wrong kind of show-stopper. Instead of stopping the
action for bland generic pseudo-emotions, this new batch by Phil
Collins smartly stays in the background, effectively heightening
the moods and reinforcing the momentum, although sometimes
overdoing the drums.
</P>
<P>
   But there is momentum as ``Tarzan'' largely retains the familiar
story, making only a few departures. We don't see the grown Tarzan
until well into the film. It begins with the infant son of
shipwrecked parents orphaned when mother and father are killed in
their treehouse by a predatory leopard. The baby is rescued and
adopted by a kind gorilla mother who lost her own baby. His boyhood
as something of a freak in the gorilla clan ends when he comes of
age and exhilaratingly goes zooming through the trees. The
traditional Disney comic relief, less memorable than usual on this
occasion, is provided by a cowardly elephant voiced by Wayne Knight
and Tarzan's gorilla playmate, voiced by Rosie O'Donnell. It's a
relief that this ``Tarzan'' eliminates the problematic but
perennial Hollywood characters of Boy and Cheetah.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close's voice is a plus as Tarzan's nurturing adoptive
mother and Tony Goldwyn's is more than up to the task of voicing
Tarzan's conflicts when humans enter the picture. Minnie Driver
finds an agreeable zone between sappy and forbidding as Jane, and
Nigel Hawthorne is on the money as her dotty Victorian father.
Brian Blessed handles with plummy aplomb the bad-guy slot provided
by the father-daughter team's great white hunter guide, Clayton,
who looks like Basil Rathbone on steroids. Predictably, Tarzan and
the gorillas are far more civilized than the intruders, and the
film can be not only forgiven but applauded for taking a different
path than Burroughs did when it comes to Tarzan's decision on
whether to follow Jane back to England.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay smartly makes the disruption of the jungle
environment seem a consequence of the colonizing imperative itself
rather than the barbarous acts of a few aberrant individuals. The
animation process takes full advantage of the greater possibilities
for human-animal interaction than any live version could offer. The
drawing style is more traditional than innovative, not a bad thing,
except that it hasn't exactly achieved seamlessness between
differently styled renderings. If this ``Tarzan'' steers itself
away from the primal emotions that would have given it some points
of contact with the very top echelon of Disney animated classics,
it's not far below them. This ``Tarzan'' won't wither on the vine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a time when the words affirmative action are unmentionable in
some corners of academia, Dr. Eleanor Baum, electrical engineer,
dean of engineering at Cooper Union in New York and the first woman
to head an engineering college anywhere, is running a one-woman
affirmative action campaign that is transforming engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to Cooper Union 12 years ago, Dr. Baum, 59, has
deliberately moved the female engineering enrollment at her
tuition-free institution to 38 percent, from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond her Cooper Union accomplishments, Dr. Baum has a history
of breaking glass ceilings. She is chairman of the Board of
Governors of the New York Academy of Sciences, and a director of
Allegheny Power Systems, the United States Trust Co. and the Avnet
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee at her Cooper Union office on Astor Place on a
recent morning, she talked about what led her to try to redesign
the sexual composition of her profession.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why did you, in the midst of ``The Feminine Mystique'' years
of the 1950s, become an engineer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Growing up in my family, you had to be such a ``good'' kid _
so I took advanced math and science courses at Midwood High School
in Brooklyn. And I was the only girl in the classes. The boys were
all talking about becoming engineers. The girls at Midwood talked
about marriage and teaching. I didn't like that.
</P>
<P>
   I remember someone asking me, ``Oh, what do you want to do?''
and my answering ``engineer.'' Their reaction was pure horror.
``But people will think you're weird and no one will want to marry
you,'' my mother gasped when I told her of my ambitions. At that
point, I dug in my heels.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Engineering school _ City College _ must have been a strange
experience.
</P>
<P>
   A. Very. Because people  &UR; really did &LR;  think I was weird. I felt
very conspicuous, very alone, but I finish what I start.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers were supportive; many were not. I was even hit on
by teachers. I remember taking a lab where the person teaching it
was a married guy who asked me out. I was able to convince him it
was beneath his dignity to date a ``mere'' student.
</P>
<P>
   I was so conspicuous. Every time I got back a test, everyone was
terribly interested in my grade. And the hard part was the feeling
that I had to be ``all'' women. If I didn't understand something,
it meant that all women didn't understand this.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was your first job like?
</P>
<P>
   A. The first real job was at Sperry. It was awful, boring.
People often assumed that I was a secretary and not an engineer.
When I had to consult with another engineer, the thought was that I
was over there flirting with them. The supervisor had a talk with
me: ``I don't want you going over there and flirting with the
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting information for the project,'' I answered to his
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   I lucked out, though. Brooklyn Polytech was looking for
qualified people they could offer graduate fellowships to. They
called City College and the departmental secretary there, a
wonderful dear woman, gave them my name. I had to teach one course.
And I discovered that I loved teaching. I had become a engineer to
avoid being a teacher, and here I was a teacher, but I adored it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The other evening here at the Cooper Union you had an
Engineering Career Night for high school girls. The main message
seemed to be, ``Young woman, you're not a misfit if you want to be
an engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Because the women I met when I was in college who were
engineers were very strange ladies. Most of them were not married
and had given their lives to this profession and were very angry
people.
</P>
<P>
   I think that in these new times, you can have a career in
engineering and have a very normal life. Modern engineering, after
all, is done in teams. And people skills and team skills are
terribly important. One reason I think it's important to have women
go into this is that women do have these skills. They also
sometimes see problems very differently than men. And this mix is
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, we did a survey of women engineer students and we
found that more than two-thirds of women who become engineers have
a brother or a father who is one. And the reason is you have to
know an engineer to understand what they do. Because what engineers
do seems to be so mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do engineers do?
</P>
<P>
   A. They solve problems, many of them technical in nature. What
they really do is that simple _ they make life better for people.
They apply science towards this end. Those parts of engineering
where that message is very clear are very attractive to women.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you first came to Cooper Union more than a decade ago,
did you tell the board that you intended to drastically change the
gender makeup of the student body?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I didn't. That's the wrong way to go about things. The
right way is to get the job and then just do it. When I first came,
there were 5 percent women. It's 38 now. And I love it. One of my
triumphs is walking up the back stairs and finding necking couples,
and they are both engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you change the school's balance between men and women
in engineering?
</P>
<P>
   A. I let it be known that I'd really like to look for women and
minority faculty. I encouraged people to stop practices that make
women uncomfortable. We've not rehired a couple of people who made
remarks like, ``You know, women don't really belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember getting those remarks when I was a graduate student.
I remember when I passed my doctoral-qualifying exams, the remarks
of some of the men who didn't get passed were: ``It's so unfair
when she's only going to get married and have kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. How has industry responded to all these female graduates
you're suddenly turning out?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, industry loves it. In engineering, there are a lot of
companies who get government contacts with affirmative action
guidelines and they love the fact that there are women to hire.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you were a very young child, in the middle of World War
II, your parents took you and escaped Poland, traveled the width of
Asia to get to Japan and then immigrated to Canada and eventually,
the United States. Does some of your drive come from being a child
survivor?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I don't think of myself as a child survivor. I think of
my parents as the survivors. What drives me is being an only child
and the intensity of my parents' expectations. It was only me. And
with their having lost everybody in Europe, we were a very close
unit. We were, in my mother's view, all that she had in the world.
They wouldn't leave me with a baby sitter and took me everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The other piece of it, perhaps a less comfortable piece, is that
both of my parents had accents. It was a time in American history
when people with accents weren't trusted. They weren't
``American,'' and it took a very, very long time for my parents to
assimilate _ so I always grew up thinking my parents were
``different.'' And a little strange. While I was proud of their
achievements, there was an undercurrent of being a little
uncomfortable. I wanted to be like everyone else. For example, I
made a big point of forgetting Russian and Polish completely _ so
that I could be a ``real'' American and only speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Q. On a less serious subject, your husband is a physicist. Do
you agree with Dr. Rita Colwell, the head of the National Science
Foundation, who believes that physicists make the best mates for
female scientists?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, it's true. I did get married. My mother was wrong. As
for physicists, they are certainly not as pompous as many
physicians are. They don't have a God complex. I think they realize
that the universe is a complicated place.

HIDING SECRET MESSAGES WITHIN HUMAN CODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The genetic code has been asked to do a lot of
things, from ensuring that a spider has eight legs to giving
Elizabeth Taylor her violet eyes. But as far as is known, it has
never been asked to spy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in
New York have developed a technique for conducting espionage on a
molecular level, by hiding a message in human DNA. Using the
technique, a sender would create a unique strand of DNA that only
an intended recipient could isolate and ``read'' from millions of
similar strands.
</P>
<P>
   It is a modern twist on an ancient art, steganography, the
practice of communicating while concealing the communication. In
homage to what is perhaps the most famous steganographic technique,
the photographic microdot, the researchers have further hidden
their message by transferring the DNA onto a tiny printed dot and
pasting it over the period in an otherwise innocuous letter that is
sent to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   For Dr. Carter Bancroft, the lead researcher, using the genetic
code as a secret code was a sideline to a sideline. Bancroft, a
professor of physiology and biophysics at Mount Sinai, is a
molecular endocrinologist by profession. But for the last five
years he has become interested in the idea of using DNA as a kind
of organic computer. ``That got me thinking about ways to use DNA
outside the bounds of a living cell,'' Bancroft said.
</P>
<P>
   DNA is made up of building blocks, or nucleotides, and while
there are only four different ones _ known as A, C, G and T _ they
can be arranged in millions of ways, like four colors of beads on a
string. This complexity serves well when it comes to genetics, and
is also what makes DNA appropriate for passing secrets. ``I
realized that the human genome is so complex, you could hide a
message in it,'' Bancroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up with the idea turned out to be the most difficult
part. ``It is exceedingly simple to carry out,'' Bancroft said, in
that it uses only standard DNA research techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who described the technique in a recent issue
of the journal Nature, first came up with a simple encryption code,
a unique sequence of three nucleotides for each of the letters of
the alphabet, punctuation marks, numerals and a space. The letter
R, for example, is denoted by the sequence T-C-A.
</P>
<P>
   They then created strands of DNA, 69 nucleotides long, with the
nucleotides arranged according to the key to create a message
(their choice was ``June 6 invasion: Normandy,'' a message actually
sent by photographic microdot during World War II). They marked
each strand by adding ``primer'' sequences of 20 nucleotides each
to the beginning and end.
</P>
<P>
   The manufactured DNA was then mixed with a solution of human
DNA, the strands of which were broken up to the approximate length
of the coded strands. Because human DNA is incredibly complex,
chopping it up creates about 30 million uniquely sequenced strands.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used the U.S. mail as a conduit for their
message. They piped the DNA onto a piece of filter paper with a
tiny dot printed on it, cut out the dot after it dried and taped it
over the period in a sentence of a typewritten letter that was then
sent to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   This use of a microdot makes the technique doubly
steganographic. ``In the first case, we're hiding the message,''
Bancroft said. ``Then we're hiding the medium that contains the
message.''
</P>
<P>
   An enemy would first have to discover the microdot to have a
chance at intercepting the message. But for anyone lucky or skilled
enough to figure out a microdot is present, the difficulties would
be just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The secret DNA's primer sequences, which both the sender and the
intended recipient agree on beforehand, are crucial. By knowing the
nucleotide sequence in the primers, the recipient can use a common
research method, polymerase chain reaction, to isolate the secret
strand and produce an exponential number of copies of it. The
secret strand then dominates the DNA soup, and it is a simple
matter to analyze it, determine the sequence of nucleotides in the
message portion and decode it using the key.
</P>
<P>
   An enemy who does not know the primer sequences, on the other
hand, is faced with trying to find one strand among 30 million.
Even if the enemy knew the sequence of all human DNA (which is
currently unknown) and could somehow isolate the manufactured
strand by eliminating the natural ones from consideration, the
sender could help ensure security just by throwing in some DNA from
different organisms. It would not affect the recipient's ability to
isolate the secret strand.
</P>
<P>
   Bancroft sees the technique as a potential tool for corporate
security. It could become an alternative to cryptographic methods
used to send confidential messages within companies. Or perhaps it
might be employed to discreetly authenticate documents by adding a
DNA watermark. The technique seems less likely to be used by a
real-life James Bond, unless he has a degree in molecular biology.

   NEW MARKET, Va. _ The aroma of frying onions is wafting out from
the concession stand and the Eagles are singing ``Take It Easy''
over the PA system. Carrying the accordion he will use to play
``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' during the seventh-inning stretch,
retired FBI agent Sol Quinn sidles by a flower box of red geraniums
to reach his seat behind home plate. Players from the New Market
Rebels are raking and lining the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Another evening of baseball bliss is set to commence in the
Shenandoah Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' exclaims Julio Chinea, 22, who grew up in
Naples, Fla., and pitched for Miami Dade Junior College and
Bluefield College in Virginia to earn his spot on the Rebels.
``Since I was in about the ninth grade, I'd heard about it (from
older players) and I just always wanted to play in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   For the college players who have come for 37 summers, the dusty
diamonds of the Shenandoah Valley League are fields of dreams. They
know that Mo Vaughn of the California Angels and Steve Finley of
the Arizona Diamondbacks and scores of other major leaguers played
here in summers past. They know that baseball ``bird dogs'' with
radar guns and stopwatches sometimes sit amid the friendly fans
behind the chicken-wire backstops.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of scouts come to games and the coaches have pretty good
connections,'' explains Tom Perrin, 21, a shortstop from West Palm
Beach, Fla., and the College of Charleston. ``That's what you're
here for.''
</P>
<P>
   They see the Valley as a step toward million dollar contracts
and prime-time play. But even those who will never draw a baseball
paycheck can gain from a summer spent living with a local family
and working on a farm or corner grocery. Many experience an America
that they knew only from TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinda like Mayberry here. Everybody knows everybody,''
marvels Charlie Wentzky, 20, a pitcher from Anderson, S.C., and the
College of Charleston. ``It's amazing that there are people like
this left in the world _ with all the shootings and robberies and
stuff. They don't lock their doors. Basically, they don't live by
the watch. They come and go as they need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Players learn about social networks by watching the community
unite to finance a season and welcome a team of strangers into its
midst, explains Larry Strawderman, the Rebels' volunteer general
manager.

   Two of the teachers are ``Mama Jean'' and ``Big E.''
</P>
<P>
   New Market Rebels of several seasons ago gave the nicknames to
Jean Morse, a wife, mother, hairdresser, school bus driver, cook
and hostess, and her husband, Everett, a husky state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five seasons, after every game, home and away,
``Mama Jean'' has fed the team. She cooks for 25 players _ plus
coaches and an occasional visiting parent or girlfriend _ at her
house with an inviting front porch located a few of blocks from
Rebel Field. Afterward, players watch TV, play cards and talk for
hours, often spending the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``My policy: I go to bed when I'm ready,'' said Jean Morse. ``I
woke up the other morning to find that nine players had slept
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered along Interstate-81, there are six teams in the Valley
League: the Winchester Royals, Front Royal Cardinals, Harrisonburg
Turks, Waynesboro Generals, Staunton Braves and the Rebels. With a
population of 1,500, New Market is the smallest host community. It
is a town without taverns or other late-night establishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team needs a place to group, bond, hang out and get to
know each other,'' said Morse. ``It's a home away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer grocery bill is ``astronomical,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food she puts out is amazing,'' said Chinea.
</P>
<P>
   The menu after a recent Friday night home game included fried
chicken, macaroni and cheese casserole and coleslaw. Sometimes
there is pizza or spaghetti or lasagna or cold cuts for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 2 o'clock, I'm cleaning up the mess,'' said Morse, whose
efforts are voluntary and self-financed.
</P>
<P>
   There's one ironclad rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any have been drinking, they don't drive from the house. I
take their car keys,'' she said. ``And anybody who thinks college
students don't drink beer is kidding themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the deterrent of ``Big E,'' with his state patrol
car parked in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there have ever been problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college coaches don't send bad boys up here,'' says Jay
Zuspan, who has hosted players on his Christmas tree farm outside
of New Market for six summers. ``They won't send us trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't meet a more polite group of young men than these
baseball players,'' echoes Morse, declining to name the only two
exceptions in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players keep in touch after they leave. Others
don't. She follows all their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Marshall McDougall from Florida State hit six home runs
in one game this year, I said, 'Why, he slept on my couch','' she
recalled. ``I keep telling them, when they get to the big leagues,
don't forget about Mama Jean in Virginia.''

   During the early innings, the setting sun warms the backs of the
400 or so fans who paid the $3 admission to Rebel Park. Massanutten
Mountain looms above an outfield fence painted with advertisements
from local merchants. Giggling teen-aged girls lean over the
railing near the third base dugout to gaze at their favorite
Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Wentzky is the cutest player, agree Kim Leitzel and
Katelyn Linski, both 13. They come to most games, as do their
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   School is out, so ``you get together at the game,'' explains
Katelyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the green chairs behind home plate sit the ``grandstand
managers,'' club members who pay $75 a year for this prime position
for viewing, socializing and grousing at the umpire. Many are
retirees from the nearby Bryce Mountain Resort. Visiting fans _
mostly host families from other league towns _ sit in bleachers
near the first base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebel Park announcer welcomes by name and hometown the
visiting moms, dads, grandparents and girlfriends of players on
both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Between innings, some fans cut through a neighboring yard to get
black raspberry sundaes or fresh peach shakes at Pack's Frozen
Custard stand. Others spend $1.25 for a Rebel Park hot dog topped
with those fried onions. Kids chase foul balls and return them for
a pack of baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy watching the town turn out for games. The whole summer
schedule is wrapped around this ball park,'' said Martha Sims. She
and her husband, George, are both Lutheran ministers as well as
family hosts for a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is baseball the way it was in the 1950s,'' says Mo Weber,
the Rebels' 76-year-old batting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Retired from coaching at the College of William and Mary, he
banters easily with players who kid him about personally knowing
Abner Doubleday or coaching Joe DiMaggio in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are flat-out better today,'' he says. ``They are
physically bigger, stronger, faster, better conditioned. They know
more about anatomy and physiology.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven decades or so of baseball, he loves to hear the ump
say ``batter up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate to still be in the game.''

   ``You don't have time for much except baseball,'' says Carson
Wiggins, 20, a pitcher from Waynesboro, Ga., and Georgia College in
Milledgeville who is spending the summer with the Winchester
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The league schedules 40 games in 55 days. Then there are
playoffs for the top teams. The longest road trip _ between
Staunton and Winchester _ takes about 90 minutes by bus. The
players are not paid, although the league picks up the tab for
their airfare from home and back and helps to find them summer
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Wiggins and the rest of the Royals are visiting
Bing Crosby Field in Front Royal.
</P>
<P>
   The crooner was grand marshal of the 1949 Apple Blossom
Festival, explains Linda Keen, the Cardinals volunteer president.
The next year, he hosted a movie premier in Front Royal and
performed at a benefit and even donated his own money for the white
cinder block stadium that now bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins is spending the summer about 20 miles away in
Winchester, a bustling community known for its apple orchards and
as the hometown of Patsy Cline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winchester is big compared to Waynesboro,'' jokes Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
   He is staying with the same family that hosted his brother,
Daniel, two summers ago.

   During the early innings, the setting sun warms the backs of the
400 or so fans who paid the $3 admission to Rebel Park. Massanutten
Mountain looms above an outfield fence painted with advertisements
from local merchants. Giggling teen-aged girls lean over the
railing near the third base dugout to gaze at their favorite
Rebels.

   Charlie Wentzky is the cutest player, agree Kim Leitzel and
Katelyn Linski, both 13. They come to most games, as do their

<P>
   School is out, so ``you get together at the game,'' explains
Katelyn.

   In the green chairs behind home plate sit the ``grandstand
managers,'' club members who pay $75 a year for this prime position
for viewing, socializing and grousing at the umpire. Many are
retirees from the nearby Bryce Mountain Resort. Visiting fans _
mostly host families from other league towns _ sit in bleachers
near the first base dugout.

   The Rebel Park announcer welcomes by name and hometown the
visiting moms, dads, grandparents and girlfriends of players on

   Between innings, some fans cut through a neighboring yard to get
black raspberry sundaes or fresh peach shakes at Pack's Frozen
Custard stand. Others spend $1.25 for a Rebel Park hot dog topped
with those fried onions. Kids chase foul balls and return them for
a pack of baseball cards.

<P>
   ``I enjoy watching the town turn out for games. The whole summer
schedule is wrapped around this ball park,'' said Martha Sims. She
and her husband, George, are both Lutheran ministers as well as
family hosts for a player.

   ``This is baseball the way it was in the 1950s,'' says Mo Weber,
the Rebels' 76-year-old batting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Retired from coaching at the College of William and Mary, he
banters easily with players who kid him about personally knowing
Abner Doubleday or coaching Joe DiMaggio in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are flat-out better today,'' he says. ``They are
physically bigger, stronger, faster, better conditioned. They know

say ``batter up.''

   ``You don't have time for much except baseball,'' says Carson
Wiggins, 20, a pitcher from Waynesboro, Ga., and Georgia College in
Milledgeville who is spending the summer with the Winchester
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The league schedules 40 games in 55 days. Then there are
playoffs for the top teams. The longest road trip _ between
Staunton and Winchester _ takes about 90 minutes by bus. The
players are not paid, although the league picks up the tab for
their airfare from home and back and helps to find them summer
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Wiggins and the rest of the Royals are visiting
Bing Crosby Field in Front Royal.
</P>
<P>
   The crooner was grand marshal of the 1949 Apple Blossom
Festival, explains Linda Keen, the Cardinals volunteer president.
The next year, he hosted a movie premier in Front Royal and
performed at a benefit and even donated his own money for the white
cinder block stadium that now bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins is spending the summer about 20 miles away in
Winchester, a bustling community known for its apple orchards and
as the hometown of Patsy Cline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winchester is big compared to Waynesboro,'' jokes Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
   He is staying with the same family that hosted his brother,
Daniel, two summers ago. Daniel just signed a contract with the
Chicago Cubs organization.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Wiggins is philosophical about his own future. If it
includes a big league career, fine. For now, though, he is happy to
spend his days working in Martin's Grocery and his nights playing
baseball in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players are hopeful of playing professionally, but
they know the odds are long.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal since Little League _ and the main goal of most
of the players here _ is just to keep playing as long as we can,''
said Jeff Reardon, a New Market Rebels pitcher from Siena College
in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every kid's dream,'' said J.C. Bunch, a Front Royal
Cardinals catcher from Austin, Texas, and Trinity College in San
Antonio. ``The league provides an opportunity to be seen by
scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, they are enjoying the culture shock of living
slow in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think California has a town this small,'' says Tom
Adinolfi, a New Market pitcher from San Jose State. ``I'd been here
two days and already people on the street were saying, 'Hi Tim'.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Biery, who works at an auto parts dealership in Staunton,
is president of the Valley League. The position pays $200 a year.
Only coaches and umpires receive real salaries. Most everybody else
is an unpaid volunteer. About 20 percent of the league budget comes
from Major League Baseball through an NCAA program. The NCAA
sanctions several such summer leagues scattered from Alaska to Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team does its own recruiting. They compete with each
other for players _ as well as with other leagues,'' said Biery.
``The main selling point is the quality of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Since admissions pay the bulk of the bills, promotion is an
important element of the league. There are contests for the best
decorated lawn chairs, for instance. And New Market has an
incongruous Chicken Man who cavorts during some games.
</P>
<P>
   The team got a good deal on the suit through the Internet,
explained GM Strawderman. ``He's a Rebel chicken.''

   NEW MARKET, Va. _ The aroma of frying onions is wafting out from
the concession stand and the Eagles are singing ``Take It Easy''
over the PA system. Carrying the accordion he will use to play
``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' during the seventh-inning stretch,
retired FBI agent Sol Quinn sidles by a flower box of red geraniums
to reach his seat behind home plate. Players from the New Market
Rebels are raking and lining the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Another evening of baseball bliss is set to commence in the
Shenandoah Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' exclaims Julio Chinea, 22, who grew up in
Naples, Fla., and pitched for Miami Dade Junior College and
Bluefield College in Virginia to earn his spot on the Rebels.
``Since I was in about the ninth grade, I'd heard about it (from
older players) and I just always wanted to play in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   For the college players who have come for 37 summers, the dusty
diamonds of the Shenandoah Valley League are fields of dreams. They
know that Mo Vaughn of the California Angels and Steve Finley of
the Arizona Diamondbacks and scores of other major leaguers played
here in summers past. They know that baseball ``bird dogs'' with
radar guns and stopwatches sometimes sit amid the friendly fans
behind the chicken-wire backstops.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of scouts come to games and the coaches have pretty good
connections,'' explains Tom Perrin, 21, a shortstop from West Palm
Beach, Fla., and the College of Charleston. ``That's what you're
here for.''
</P>
<P>
   They see the Valley as a step toward million dollar contracts
and prime-time play. But even those who will never draw a baseball
paycheck can gain from a summer spent living with a local family
and working on a farm or corner grocery. Many experience an America
that they knew only from TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinda like Mayberry here. Everybody knows everybody,''
marvels Charlie Wentzky, 20, a pitcher from Anderson, S.C., and the
College of Charleston. ``It's amazing that there are people like
this left in the world _ with all the shootings and robberies and
stuff. They don't lock their doors. Basically, they don't live by
the watch. They come and go as they need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Players learn about social networks by watching the community
unite to finance a season and welcome a team of strangers into its
midst, explains Larry Strawderman, the Rebels' volunteer general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They learn life.''

   Two of the teachers are ``Mama Jean'' and ``Big E.''
</P>
<P>
   New Market Rebels of several seasons ago gave the nicknames to
Jean Morse, a wife, mother, hairdresser, school bus driver, cook
and hostess, and her husband, Everett, a husky state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five seasons, after every game, home and away,
``Mama Jean'' has fed the team. She cooks for 25 players _ plus
coaches and an occasional visiting parent or girlfriend _ at her
house with an inviting front porch located a few of blocks from
Rebel Field. Afterward, players watch TV, play cards and talk for
hours, often spending the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``My policy: I go to bed when I'm ready,'' said Jean Morse. ``I
woke up the other morning to find that nine players had slept
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered along Interstate-81, there are six teams in the Valley
League: the Winchester Royals, Front Royal Cardinals, Harrisonburg
Turks, Waynesboro Generals, Staunton Braves and the Rebels. With a
population of 1,500, New Market is the smallest host community. It
is a town without taverns or other late-night establishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team needs a place to group, bond, hang out and get to
know each other,'' said Morse. ``It's a home away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer grocery bill is ``astronomical,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food she puts out is amazing,'' said Chinea.
</P>
<P>
   The menu after a recent Friday night home game included fried
chicken, macaroni and cheese casserole and coleslaw. Sometimes
there is pizza or spaghetti or lasagna or cold cuts for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 2 o'clock, I'm cleaning up the mess,'' said Morse, whose
efforts are voluntary and self-financed.
</P>
<P>
   There's one ironclad rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any have been drinking, they don't drive from the house. I
take their car keys,'' she said. ``And anybody who thinks college
students don't drink beer is kidding themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the deterrent of ``Big E,'' with his state patrol
car parked in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there have ever been problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college coaches don't send bad boys up here,'' says Jay
Zuspan, who has hosted players on his Christmas tree farm outside
of New Market for six summers. ``They won't send us trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't meet a more polite group of young men than these
baseball players,'' echoes Morse, declining to name the only two
exceptions in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players keep in touch after they leave. Others
don't. She follows all their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Marshall McDougall from Florida State hit six home runs
in one game this year, I said, 'Why, he slept on my couch','' she
recalled. ``I keep telling them, when they get to the big leagues,
don't forget about Mama Jean in Virginia.''

   Between innings, some fans cut through a neighboring yard to get
black raspberry sundaes or fresh peach shakes at Pack's Frozen
Custard stand. Others spend $1.25 for a Rebel Park hot dog topped
with those fried onions. Kids chase foul balls and return them for
a pack of baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy watching the town turn out for games. The whole summer
schedule is wrapped around this ball park,'' said Martha Sims. She
and her husband, George, are both Lutheran ministers as well as
family hosts for a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is baseball the way it was in the 1950s,'' says Mo Weber,
the Rebels' 76-year-old batting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Retired from coaching at the College of William and Mary, he
banters easily with players who kid him about personally knowing
Abner Doubleday or coaching Joe DiMaggio in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are flat-out better today,'' he says. ``They are
physically bigger, stronger, faster, better conditioned. They know

   After seven decades or so of baseball, he loves to hear the ump
say ``batter up.''
</P>

   ``You don't have time for much except baseball,'' says Carson
Wiggins, 20, a pitcher from Waynesboro, Ga., and Georgia College in
Milledgeville who is spending the summer with the Winchester
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The league schedules 40 games in 55 days. Then there are
playoffs for the top teams. The longest road trip _ between
Staunton and Winchester _ takes about 90 minutes by bus. The
players are not paid, although the league picks up the tab for
their airfare from home and back and helps to find them summer
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Wiggins and the rest of the Royals are visiting
Bing Crosby Field in Front Royal.
</P>
<P>
   The crooner was grand marshal of the 1949 Apple Blossom
Festival, explains Linda Keen, the Cardinals volunteer president.
The next year, he hosted a movie premier in Front Royal and
performed at a benefit and even donated his own money for the white
cinder block stadium that now bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins is spending the summer about 20 miles away in
Winchester, a bustling community known for its apple orchards and
as the hometown of Patsy Cline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winchester is big compared to Waynesboro,'' jokes Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
   He is staying with the same family that hosted his brother,
Daniel, two summers ago. Daniel just signed a contract with the
Chicago Cubs organization.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Wiggins is philosophical about his own future. If it
includes a big league career, fine. For now, though, he is happy to
spend his days working in Martin's Grocery and his nights playing
baseball in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players are hopeful of playing professionally, but
they know the odds are long.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal since Little League _ and the main goal of most
of the players here _ is just to keep playing as long as we can,''
said Jeff Reardon, a New Market Rebels pitcher from Siena College
in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every kid's dream,'' said J.C. Bunch, a Front Royal
Cardinals catcher from Austin, Texas, and Trinity College in San
Antonio. ``The league provides an opportunity to be seen by
scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, they are enjoying the culture shock of living
slow in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think California has a town this small,'' says Tom
Adinolfi, a New Market pitcher from San Jose State. ``I'd been here
two days and already people on the street were saying, 'Hi Tim'.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Biery, who works at an auto parts dealership in Staunton,
is president of the Valley League. The position pays $200 a year.
Only coaches and umpires receive real salaries. Most everybody else
is an unpaid volunteer. About 20 percent of the league budget comes
from Major League Baseball through an NCAA program. The NCAA
sanctions several such summer leagues scattered from Alaska to Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team does its own recruiting. They compete with each
other for players _ as well as with other leagues,'' said Biery.
``The main selling point is the quality of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Since admissions pay the bulk of the bills, promotion is an
important element of the league. There are contests for the best
decorated lawn chairs, for instance. And New Market has an
incongruous Chicken Man who cavorts during some games.
</P>
<P>
   The team got a good deal on the suit through the Internet,
explained GM Strawderman. ``He's a Rebel chicken.''

THE REAL COMPETITION IN X GAMES ISN'T ATHLETIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK FAINARU-WADA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Generation X circus will roll into town
later this week _ a three-ring affair spanning the Embarcadero, the
Great Highway and Treasure Island and leaving the city awash in
skateboards, in-line skates, a man-made pile of snow, pierced body
parts, free-flowing locks, tattoos and an overriding sense of the
extreme and the rebellious.
</P>
<P>
   Here come the X Games, fashioned by ESPN, the all-sports network
that spawned the idea in 1993 to create an Olympics-modeled
competition for alternative sports and then gave birth to the event
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath all of the anti-establishment aura emitted by the X
Games lies a traditional reality: money. In actually creating its
own event, as opposed to the more traditional role of buying rights
to a sporting extravaganza (see: Super Bowl, NCAA Final Four, World
Series, NBA Finals), ESPN devised an avenue to reach an audience
coveted by sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``One word: demographics,'' said Barry Frank, a senior group
vice president at the mega-marketing company IMG. ``It's very hard
to capture those teen-age viewers under any circumstances,
particularly young males.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that, ESPN set out to find a way to reach consumers ages
12 to 34, to sell potential sponsors on the idea that their
advertising actually would be seen by young people.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a market that actually does have money to spend, and
that companies would like nothing more than to latch onto now in
hopes that younger people will remain loyal to their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X Generation is more independent at an earlier age and
with a higher discretionary income than any other generation in the
history of mankind,'' said Dean Bonham, whose business, The Bonham
Group, advises companies on sponsorship of sporting events. ``And
by the way, the income that is not discretionary is in their
parents' pockets, which they have influence over.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC saw the benefits of this type of event so clearly that it
recently announced its creation of the Gravity Games _ a carbon
copy of the X Games that will include some of the same sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it's significant that people recognize that the X
Games and the Gravity Games are both made-for-television events,''
Bonham said. ``And I think that will be more prominent in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hagle is ESPN's vice president in charge of integrated sales
and marketing. In other words, he's the top gun charged with
hunting down companies to attach their names _ and considerable
financial support _ to the X Games. More and more, Hagle has become
the hunted as well as the hunter.
</P>
<P>
   While the event had just six sponsors in 1995, it now has 16,
and the list includes the likes of Visa, AT&AMP;T, Taco Bell, the U.S.
Marine Corps, Snickers and Adidas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always the desire of ESPN, to try to create an event
that is of significant interest to both viewers and sponsors,''
Hagle said. ``It's not like this is necessarily new. ABC had the
Superstars years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of made-for-TV events, but the idea of
creating events based on what is the perceived marketplace demand,
I think that's a little bit of a new wrinkle.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wrinkle that has brought the programming and marketing
departments much closer together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, it was programmers program it and sellers sell
it,'' Hagle said. ``Now there's a tremendous amount of interaction
between the two groups.''

PHYSICISTS ZERO IN ON GHOSTLY NEUTRINOS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Minn., Pa., Japan, Canada, Mass.)   (nk) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists operating huge underground detectors in Japan and
Canada are racing to obtain independent proofs that the elusive
neutrino, a ghostly particle whose vast family may constitute a
large part of the mass of the universe, changes form as it flies
through matter or space.
</P>
<P>
   At least some neutrinos are now believed to have some mass, and
physicists would love to learn how much, a goal that may be reached
by studying the changes in form a traveling neutrino undergoes.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the effect of neutrinos, which pervade every cubic
inch of the universe, on the rate at which the universe expands.
Physicists also hope that further neutrino discoveries will account
for the Sun's ``missing neutrinos,'' neutrinos predicted by theory
but not yet detected by observation.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at an international meeting at Takayama, Japan, a
Japanese-American team of physicists disclosed the first clear
evidence that neutrinos oscillate from one ``flavor'' to another as
they pass through Earth. The discovery, made with the help of a
cathedral-size underground water tank called Super Kamiokande near
the city of Kamioka, Japan, may shed light not only on neutrinos
but on the future expansion rate and behavior of galaxies and the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year physicists in North America, Europe and Japan
have been racing each other to find independent evidence confirming
or refuting the finding of neutrino oscillation, and several large
laboratories have left the starting gate in the quest.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of neutrinos was predicted in 1930 and the
particles were actually discovered in 1956, but they remain cloaked
in enigmas. Physicists have determined that in particle reactions,
separate neutrino types are associated with three other types of
lepton particles: electrons, muons and tau particles. Thus,
electron neutrinos (the kind emitted by the Sun's nuclear
reactions), muon neutrinos (produced by laboratory accelerators)
and tau electrons (known by inference but never directly detected)
interact with matter in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Any experimental investigation of neutrinos is extraordinarily
difficult because these particles have no electric charge and their
mass, if not zero, must be vanishingly small. This means that a
typical neutrino could pass through a six-trillion-mile thickness
of solid lead with only a negligible chance of hitting anything.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for scientists, however, an occasional neutrino
defies the astronomical odds and hits a bit of matter in some
detector _ a tank of water, an atom of air or a huge block of
Antarctic ice, for example _ yielding a shower of debris. Some of
the debris leaves trails of blue light as it streaks through
transparent objects or fluids. Measurements of this light, called
Cherenkov radiation, allows scientists to reconstruct the events
that caused it.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments under way promise to shed light on the neutrino's
apparent ability to transform itself into different forms, a
phenomenon that could explain why the Sun's nuclear furnace seems
to emit many fewer neutrinos than the process should produce. It
may simply be that the solar neutrinos are reaching Earth in the
predicted numbers, but that many of them have turned themselves
into forms that are not revealed using conventional detectors.
</P>
<P>
   On June 9 scientists announced that the first neutrinos had been
captured by a uniquely sensitive new detector at the Sudbury
Neutrino Observatory, known by the acronym SNO, 6,800 feet below
ground in the Creighton nickel mine near Sudbury, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Like other large neutrino detectors, SNO mainly consists of a
huge water tank. What gives it greater sensitivity for corralling
neutrinos than any similar detector is that in place of ordinary
water, it is filled with 10,000 metric tons of heavy water, water
in which each ordinary hydrogen atom with a lone proton in its
nucleus is replaced by a hydrogen isotope, called a deuteron,
containing a proton and a neutron.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ordinary water, which can snag only one ``flavor,'' or
type of neutrino, heavy water is sensitive to all three neutrino
flavors: electron, muon and tau. In theory, heavy water should
register the arrival of all three flavors with equal probability,
regardless of how they try to hide by oscillating from one flavor
to another.
</P>
<P>
   Building SNO took 15 years, and its heavy water alone, lent for
the experiment by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., is valued at $210
million. There were many delaying snags along the way, and yet it
took only a few days to begin seeing the first neutrinos after the
detector was inaugurated in April, say the Canadian, American and
British scientists who built it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur B. McDonald, the director of the observatory, said in
his announcement on June 9 that ``to see such clear examples of
neutrino interactions within days of finally turning on was a real
triumph for the entire SNO team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eugene Beier of the University of Pennsylvania, a spokesman
for the U.S. contingent of the multinational observatory team, said
it would probably take about two years before the detector yielded
``definitive'' evidence of having spotted all three neutrino
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the detector may have to be modified to improve its
sensitivity. In one experiment, magnesium chloride would be mixed
with the heavy water, because chloride is particularly effective in
capturing neutrons emitted by neutrino interactions. In another
modification, detectors containing the rare isotope helium-3 would
be added to the water tank; helium-3 offers neutrons an even fatter
target.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a hoped-for confirmation that neutrinos in flight
oscillate between flavors. Under the rules of quantum mechanics,
this implies that neutrinos have mass, a situation with enormous
implications for astrophysics and cosmology because neutrino mass
could affect the rate of expansion of the universe and influence
the formation of galaxies and large-scale structure in the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Two new developments in Japan are narrowing the search for
confirmation of neutrino oscillation.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper to be published next week, a large Japanese and
American team reports the discovery of a nonsymmetric effect in the
arrival of neutrinos at the Super Kamiokande detector. More
neutrinos were found hitting the detector from the western
direction than from the east, an effect predicted from Earth's
magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrinos themselves are not influenced by magnetic fields, but
in this case they were created by the annihilation of positively
charged cosmic ray particles drawn toward Earth by the planet's
geomagnetic field. Neutrinos created by the impact of cosmic-ray
particles on upper atmospheric atoms continue along roughly the
same trajectories as the original cosmic rays.
</P>
<P>
   The asymmetric east-west neutrino result came as no great
surprise to the experimenters, ``but it was an extremely important
result,'' Beier said, ``because it showed by independent means that
the measurements of neutrino flow reported in Japan last year were
made correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another important neutrino experiment making use of a powerful
proton accelerator in Japan is expected to begin in a few days,
said Dr. Lawrence R. Sulak of Boston University, a member of the
Super Kamiokande research team.
</P>
<P>
   In the experiment, a proton beam from Japan's KEK (a Japanese
acronym meaning High Energy Accelerator Research Organization) is
to be fired into an aluminum target producing an intense beam of
pi-meson particles, which decay rapidly into neutrinos and muon
particles. The resulting neutrino beam will first pass through a
nearby water detector and then hit the ground at a downward angle
of 1.5 degrees, re-emerging 155 miles to the west at the Super
Kamiokande detector. (The experiment is known as K2K, for KEK to
Kamiokande.)
</P>
<P>
   The 155 miles of Earth through which the beam passes offers no
appreciable barrier to the neutrinos. If the same neutrino flux is
found at the nearby detector as at the distant Kamiokande detector,
the experiment will offer no proof of oscillation. But if, as
expected, fewer neutrinos are found at the end of the line than at
the beginning, it will mean that detectable neutrinos have
transformed themselves into an undetectable form on their way
through Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is expected to take about two years to yield
solid results, Sulak said.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat similar experiments are planned in Europe, where a beam
of neutrinos from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near
Chicago will slice through Earth to a neutrino detector 460 miles
away in an iron mine near Duluth, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   In a third project, a neutrino beam from the European Laboratory
for Particle Physics (CERN) near Geneva would be directed through
the ground to detectors within the Gran Sasso Tunnel under the
Italian Alps 455 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many experiments are closing in on the neutrino from many
different angles,'' Sulak said. ``With luck, it won't be too long
before we penetrate the particle's secrets.''

   NEW MARKET, Va. _ The aroma of frying onions is wafting out from
the concession stand and the Eagles are singing ``Take It Easy''
over the PA system. Carrying the accordion he will use to play
``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' during the seventh-inning stretch,
retired FBI agent Sol Quinn sidles by a flower box of red geraniums
to reach his seat behind home plate. Players from the New Market
Rebels are raking and lining the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Another evening of baseball bliss is set to commence in the
Shenandoah Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' exclaims Julio Chinea, 22, who grew up in
Naples, Fla., and pitched for Miami Dade Junior College and
Bluefield College in Virginia to earn his spot on the Rebels.
``Since I was in about the ninth grade, I'd heard about it (from
older players) and I just always wanted to play in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   For the college players who have come for 37 summers, the dusty
diamonds of the Shenandoah Valley League are fields of dreams. They
know that Mo Vaughn of the California Angels and Steve Finley of
the Arizona Diamondbacks and scores of other major leaguers played
here in summers past. They know that baseball ``bird dogs'' with
radar guns and stopwatches sometimes sit amid the friendly fans
behind the chicken-wire backstops.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of scouts come to games and the coaches have pretty good
connections,'' explains Tom Perrin, 21, a shortstop from West Palm
Beach, Fla., and the College of Charleston. ``That's what you're
here for.''
</P>
<P>
   They see the Valley as a step toward million dollar contracts
and prime-time play. But even those who will never draw a baseball
paycheck can gain from a summer spent living with a local family
and working on a farm or corner grocery. Many experience an America
that they knew only from TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinda like Mayberry here. Everybody knows everybody,''
marvels Charlie Wentzky, 20, a pitcher from Anderson, S.C., and the
College of Charleston. ``It's amazing that there are people like
this left in the world _ with all the shootings and robberies and
stuff. They don't lock their doors. Basically, they don't live by
the watch. They come and go as they need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Players learn about social networks by watching the community
unite to finance a season and welcome a team of strangers into its
midst, explains Larry Strawderman, the Rebels' volunteer general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They learn life.''

   Two of the teachers are ``Mama Jean'' and ``Big E.''
</P>
<P>
   New Market Rebels of several seasons ago gave the nicknames to
Jean Morse, a wife, mother, hairdresser, school bus driver, cook
and hostess, and her husband, Everett, a husky state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five seasons, after every game, home and away,
``Mama Jean'' has fed the team. She cooks for 25 players _ plus
coaches and an occasional visiting parent or girlfriend _ at her
house with an inviting front porch located a few of blocks from
Rebel Field. Afterward, players watch TV, play cards and talk for
hours, often spending the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``My policy: I go to bed when I'm ready,'' said Jean Morse. ``I
woke up the other morning to find that nine players had slept
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered along Interstate-81, there are six teams in the Valley
League: the Winchester Royals, Front Royal Cardinals, Harrisonburg
Turks, Waynesboro Generals, Staunton Braves and the Rebels. With a
population of 1,500, New Market is the smallest host community. It
is a town without taverns or other late-night establishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team needs a place to group, bond, hang out and get to
know each other,'' said Morse. ``It's a home away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer grocery bill is ``astronomical,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food she puts out is amazing,'' said Chinea.
</P>
<P>
   The menu after a recent Friday night home game included fried
chicken, macaroni and cheese casserole and coleslaw. Sometimes
there is pizza or spaghetti or lasagna or cold cuts for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 2 o'clock, I'm cleaning up the mess,'' said Morse, whose
efforts are voluntary and self-financed.
</P>
<P>
   There's one ironclad rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any have been drinking, they don't drive from the house. I
take their car keys,'' she said. ``And anybody who thinks college
students don't drink beer is kidding themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the deterrent of ``Big E,'' with his state patrol
car parked in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there have ever been problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college coaches don't send bad boys up here,'' says Jay
Zuspan, who has hosted players on his Christmas tree farm outside
of New Market for six summers. ``They won't send us trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't meet a more polite group of young men than these
baseball players,'' echoes Morse, declining to name the only two
exceptions in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players keep in touch after they leave. Others
don't. She follows all their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Marshall McDougall from Florida State hit six home runs
in one game this year, I said, 'Why, he slept on my couch','' she
recalled. ``I keep telling them, when they get to the big leagues,
don't forget about Mama Jean in Virginia.''

   During the early innings, the setting sun warms the backs of the
400 or so fans who paid the $3 admission to Rebel Park. Massanutten
Mountain looms above an outfield fence painted with advertisements
from local merchants. Giggling teen-aged girls lean over the
railing near the third base dugout to gaze at their favorite
Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Wentzky is the cutest player, agree Kim Leitzel and
Katelyn Linski, both 13. They come to most games, as do their
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   School is out, so ``you get together at the game,'' explains
Katelyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the green chairs behind home plate sit the ``grandstand
managers,'' club members who pay $75 a year for this prime position
for viewing, socializing and grousing at the umpire. Many are
retirees from the nearby Bryce Mountain Resort. Visiting fans _
mostly host families from other league towns _ sit in bleachers
near the first base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebel Park announcer welcomes by name and hometown the
visiting moms, dads, grandparents and girlfriends of players on
both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Between innings, some fans cut through a neighboring yard to get
black raspberry sundaes or fresh peach shakes at Pack's Frozen
Custard stand. Others spend $1.25 for a Rebel Park hot dog topped
with those fried onions. Kids chase foul balls and return them for
a pack of baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy watching the town turn out for games. The whole summer
schedule is wrapped around this ball park,'' said Martha Sims. She
and her husband, George, are both Lutheran ministers as well as
family hosts for a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is baseball the way it was in the 1950s,'' says Mo Weber,
the Rebels' 76-year-old batting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Retired from coaching at the College of William and Mary, he
banters easily with players who kid him about personally knowing
Abner Doubleday or coaching Joe DiMaggio in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are flat-out better today,'' he says. ``They are
physically bigger, stronger, faster, better conditioned. They know
more about anatomy and physiology.''

   After seven decades or so of baseball, he loves to hear the ump
say ``batter up.''

   ``You don't have time for much except baseball,'' says Carson
Wiggins, 20, a pitcher from Waynesboro, Ga., and Georgia College in
Milledgeville who is spending the summer with the Winchester
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The league schedules 40 games in 55 days. Then there are
playoffs for the top teams. The longest road trip _ between
Staunton and Winchester _ takes about 90 minutes by bus. The
players are not paid, although the league picks up the tab for
their airfare from home and back and helps to find them summer
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Wiggins and the rest of the Royals are visiting
Bing Crosby Field in Front Royal.
</P>
<P>
   The crooner was grand marshal of the 1949 Apple Blossom
Festival, explains Linda Keen, the Cardinals volunteer president.
The next year, he hosted a movie premier in Front Royal and
performed at a benefit and even donated his own money for the white
cinder block stadium that now bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins is spending the summer about 20 miles away in
Winchester, a bustling community known for its apple orchards and
as the hometown of Patsy Cline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winchester is big compared to Waynesboro,'' jokes Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
   He is staying with the same family that hosted his brother,
Daniel, two summers ago. Daniel just signed a contract with the
Chicago Cubs organization.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Wiggins is philosophical about his own future. If it
includes a big league career, fine. For now, though, he is happy to
spend his days working in Martin's Grocery and his nights playing
baseball in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players are hopeful of playing professionally, but
they know the odds are long.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal since Little League _ and the main goal of most
of the players here _ is just to keep playing as long as we can,''
said Jeff Reardon, a New Market Rebels pitcher from Siena College
in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every kid's dream,'' said J.C. Bunch, a Front Royal
Cardinals catcher from Austin, Texas, and Trinity College in San
Antonio. ``The league provides an opportunity to be seen by
scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, they are enjoying the culture shock of living
slow in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think California has a town this small,'' says Tom
Adinolfi, a New Market pitcher from San Jose State. ``I'd been here
two days and already people on the street were saying, 'Hi Tim'.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Biery, who works at an auto parts dealership in Staunton,
is president of the Valley League. The position pays $200 a year.
Only coaches and umpires receive real salaries. Most everybody else
is an unpaid volunteer. About 20 percent of the league budget comes
from Major League Baseball through an NCAA program. The NCAA
sanctions several such summer leagues scattered from Alaska to Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team does its own recruiting. They compete with each
other for players _ as well as with other leagues,'' said Biery.
``The main selling point is the quality of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Since admissions pay the bulk of the bills, promotion is an
important element of the league. There are contests for the best
decorated lawn chairs, for instance. And New Market has an
incongruous Chicken Man who cavorts during some games.
</P>
<P>
   The team got a good deal on the suit through the Internet,
explained GM Strawderman. ``He's a Rebel chicken.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The worst part of sickle cell disease is the
numbing, painful episodes that can strike any time, searing the
body with waves of agony as cells in crucial organs, starved for
oxygen and nutrients by blocked blood vessels, wither and die.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and patients can do little but endure until a crisis has
run its course. Powerful pain-killing drugs can help, as can blood
transfusions. But, basically, it is something to be tolerated until
it subsides.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe they have found ways to be more than
sympathetic bystanders when the acute, painful episodes occur. They
are conducting human tests with several new types of agents, the
products of years of basic research, that may result in the first
drugs to attack the basic mechanisms of the sickle cell crisis
itself and interrupt the attack once it has started.
</P>
<P>
   Two small biotechnology companies are developing drugs they say
have shown promise in clinical trials in lessening the impact of
sickle crises. Although each company's drug works in different
ways, researchers developing each preparation say they appear to
improve blood flow through small vessels and limit tissue damage.
</P>
<P>
   Their developers say the drugs, which appear to be relatively
nontoxic with few adverse effects, may be able to decrease the
duration of pain, reduce the length of hospital stays and lessen
the use of strong pain killers, including narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Harvard Medical School in Boston are also conducting
a trial to see if breathing nitric oxide gas during a crisis will
shorten the event and reduce the formation of sickle blood cells,
as laboratory tests suggest. Dr. Kenneth R. Bridges, head of the
joint sickle cell center at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the
Massachusetts General Hospital, said 11 of an expected 60 patients
have been enrolled in a trial to be completed by this fall that
involves hospitals in five cities.
</P>
<P>
   A number of drugs and compounds in trials, or about to be
tested, show some promise in reducing the impact of sickle cell
crises, said Dr. Martin M. Steinberg, an expert at the University
of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson who wrote a recent review
of sickle cell therapies in The New England Journal of Medicine.
``There were few things like this in the works five or 10 years ago
and we are seeing the results of a lot of basic research. We're
entering a very hopeful period.''
</P>
<P>
   Sickle cell disease is a family of inherited blood disorders
afflicting millions worldwide, primarily those with ancestors from
Africa, the Mediterranean and India. In this country, the disease
afflicts an estimated 80,000 African-Americans, and about 8 percent
of blacks carry a genetic tendency _ termed sickle cell trait _ for
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The disorders involve the production of abnormal forms of
hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells. When
depleted of oxygen, this sickle hemoglobin forms rigid polymers
that cause the normally pliable blood cells to stiffen and contort
into jagged shapes. These sickle-shaped cells block small vessels
and cause vascular inflammation and other changes that further
inhibit blood transport.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of blood flow results in ischemia, the damage and death of
cells and tissues deprived of oxygen and nutrients, and acute
episodes of severe pain in the chest, back, abdomen or extremities.
Experts say repeated crises result in damage to such organs as the
kidneys and blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the impact of sickle episodes, the CytRx Corp. of
Norcross, Ga., is testing a compound called Flocor that it says
improves blood flow in ischemic tissue by inhibiting adhesive
interactions and lowering blood viscosity. The company says early
tests indicate the chemical can shorten crises by acting as a
lubricant, allowing sickled blood cells to flow more easily through
tight vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. R. Martin Emanuele, the company's vice president for
research, said Flocor was a highly purified version of poloxamer
188, an emulsifying chemical used in food products and other drugs
to change the surface tension of oil-water mixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Flocor is being tested at 46 hospitals around the country in a
trial involving sickle cell patients in crisis. So far, 166 of a
planned 224 patients have been enrolled. The study is expected to
be completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Flocor, given intravenously, coats the blood cells and vessel
walls and appears to keep them apart so that adhesive receptors in
the blood vessels cannot hook onto the sickled cells, he said. The
compound, he said, also changes the membranes of normal and sickled
red cells, making them more bendable for maneuvering through small
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a direct effect on the cell membrane that is
difficult to characterize,'' Emanuele said. ``It probably has
something to do with a change in the surface tension of the cell in
the presence of Flocor, but we don't yet know the exact
mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   If the human trial succeeds, CytRx hopes to submit a new drug
application to the Food and Drug Administration for approval by the
middle of next year, said Jack J. Luchese, the company president.
With quick approval, the drug could be for sale early in 2001, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cypros Pharmaceutical Corp. of Carlsbad, Calif., is also
conducting a Phase III trial of a drug called Cordox, a natural
fruit-sugar compound known as fructose 1-6 diphosphate. Research
indicates extra intravenous doses of the compound, produced
naturally in the body while a common sugar called glucose is
metabolized, helps protect ischemic tissue from death, said Dr.
Paul J. Marangos, chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain and degenerative aspect of a sickle cell crisis is
caused by cell death,'' Marangos said. ``We are providing
additional energy to these cells to keep them alive while their
blood supply is restricted.'' Laboratory tests also suggest that
the treatment reduces red cell sickling and improves blood flow, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began last year and will involve 280 patients
at 40 medical centers, has enrolled 15 patients so far and
evaluated 100 more who will be included when they next have a
sickle crisis, he said. The company hopes to finish the trial by
the middle of next year and, if successful, seek FDA approval,
which could still be several years away, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, of the University of Mississippi, said the real value
was in early intervention. Even if the new treatments prove
effective in their emergency room tests, he said, the real benefit
could come in developing versions that patients could use at the
first sign of a crisis.

AMERICAN GIFT IS NO TROJAN HORSE FOR ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DENNIS YUSKO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEACON, N.Y. _ Art and history will collide in two weeks when an
exact replica of a 24-foot bronze horse envisioned by Leonardo da
Vinci is donated to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-ton ``horse that never was,'' created at the Tallix Art
Foundry in Beacon, N.Y., is a goodwill gesture and tribute to da
Vinci, said Rod Skidmore, the project's artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore estimates the cost of building the horse at over $6
million _ most of which came from American donors.
</P>
<P>
   Da Vinci, the legendary Renaissance artist, was commissioned in
1482 to design and build the largest equestrian statue in the
world. He worked on the project for 16 years and a full-scale model
was waiting to be cast in bronze when French troops invaded Milan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1499, the model was destroyed by occupying French troops, who
used the horse for archery practice. History has it that da Vinci
lamented the loss of ``Il Cavallo'' all the way to his deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 10, 500 years later, the American-made statue is
scheduled to be unveiled in a new cultural park in Milan being
constructed for the horse.
</P>
<P>
   Official acceptance of the gift by Milan Mayor Gabriele
Albertini came last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italians are thrilled with it,'' said Skidmore, 65, an 18-year
veteran of the project who has been in Italy twice in the last year
organizing preparations for shipping the statue.
</P>
<P>
   Alitalia, Italy's national airline, has volunteered to ship The
Horse in separate crates to Italy during the first week of July.
Before it is shipped, a public open house was planned in this
Dutchess County community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest astounds me,'' said Milan Kralik Jr., spokesman
and trustee of the Leonardo da Vinci Horse Inc. (LDVHI) of
Pennsylvania, the organization responsible for ``Il Cavallo,'' The
Horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attribute it to the uniqueness of the project _ it's the
first time in history anybody's built a bronze horse this big,''
said Kralik, who has worked on the project for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, it's the pure altruism of the gift; it's just a gift; a
thank you, like the Statue of Liberty was,'' Kralik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All 60 pieces of the horse have been welded together into
seven sub-sections, which have been assembled into a full-standing
horse,'' Kralik said.
</P>
<P>
   The statue is the largest of its kind in the world, and is the
product of a 22-year-old inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Da Vinci's horse drawings were rediscovered in 1965 in the
National Library of Madrid, and National Geographic wrote a cover
article on the horse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Charles Dent, a retired airline pilot from Fogelsville,
Pa., came across the article. Dent, and artist and art collector
who had a passion for Renaissance art, became so engrossed in the
horse that he dedicated the rest of his life to building one. He
died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie was a great, great fellow, and my wife's brother, but
he couldn't ask people for money,'' said Roger Enloe, now president
of the LDVHI board. ``So I started helping him.''
</P>
<P>
   The horse's master 24-foot clay model was completed by sculptor
Nina Akamu and her team of seven assistants in August 1998. The
casting, done one piece at a time, used both the sand mold process
and the lost wax process.
</P>
<P>
   Most sections were approximately four feet square, although some
were as small as an ear. Sections were assembled by welders while
fabricators simultaneously inserted a 3-ton stainless steel
armature into the interior for support.
</P>
<P>
   Match plates were installed, allowing the legs, tail and head to
be disassembled for transport and reinstallation by workers in
Milan.
</P>
<P>
   The horse will sit on a 4-foot pedestal to be built in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse symbolizes people attempting great things and
sticking with them until they get them done,'' Enloe said. ``I
really am very proud to have such a beautiful horse to send to
Italy.''

INTERNET MAKES IT EASIER TO CHECK OUT MR. RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Men and women ring the bar at a local Razzoo's, swilling goblets
of wine and bottles of beer under a haze of white cigarette smoke.
There is a din of constant chatter in the background.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the bar, Eric Edwards and Billie Jo Donath are
in a tight embrace, smiling as they gaze into each other's eyes
like lovers do.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be the man of Donath's dreams, or are they just
friends?
</P>
<P>
   More important, how much does she really know about him? Has she
done her homework?
</P>
<P>
   Though Donath said she would never go to such extremes, private
investigators said that a growing number of women are relying on
the Internet and more conventional means to do background checks on
prospective suitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking for a technological means to find Mr.
Right,'' said Ed Pankau, a Houston investigator who co-wrote ``How
to Investigate by Computer.'' ``In comes the Internet and the means
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the investment of a few minutes online, women can verify
their love interest's name, determine whether he is single or
married, and learn whether he has been named in any lawsuits, has a
criminal record or has a lien against property he owns, said
Pankau, a former investigator for the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women today are dating virtual strangers _ men they've met via
the Internet, personals, or in nightclubs and bars,'' said Joseph
Ryan, author of a recently published manual called ``Check Him Out!
The American Woman's Guide to Background Investigations.'' ``Often
these men are much different in reality from the knights in shining
armor they make themselves out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   While the potential for fraud has always been real, Ryan said
the ``deceit factor'' in dating is probably 100 times higher on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a worldwide phenomenon,'' Ryan said. ``The catch is
you don't know anything about a person except what they tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all women are willing to hire an investigator or use the
Internet to verify that their man is who he says he is. They prefer
to rely on information from friends or use their intuition.
</P>
<P>
   Donath, for example, is a 25-year-old teacher in the Fort Worth,
Texas, public school system. She said she would buy a book like
``Check Him Out,'' and read it for her own information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be valuable to have, but I would never use
it,'' she said. ``I'd never check someone out. I'd get to know them
on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Donath and Eric Edwards said they are just
friends. He appreciates her way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, if you don't trust a person to tell you the
truth, you shouldn't even be wasting your time,'' Edwards said.
``Why would you date someone you'd even have to think about doing a
background check on?''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeanne, who identified herself as a 21-year-old waitress
from Arlington, Texas, has a different view. She considers meeting
men via the Internet unsafe, but said that she'd probably go online
to check out a man she's interested in dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was that into him, I would definitely do it,'' she said.
``You can't be too sure about anything these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from a small town, and everyone I ever dated I knew
something about them,'' Jeanne said. ``Now I'm in a big city, and I
know nothing about the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne would want to know, among other things, Does he have a
girlfriend? Does he have a job or is he freeloading on his mother?
</P>
<P>
   Pankau, who receives about 60 requests a month for background
checks, said women ask for a variety of facts, such as employment
and credit history, educational background, and sexual practices.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you ask, background checks using agencies can
cost from $150 to $500. On the Internet, it's free.
</P>
<P>
   At Brown and Associates in Orlando, Fla., owner C.R. ``Bob''
Brown said his firm can do a complete background check for $150.
``That would include what we call a marriage tree, driving history
to help tell us if the person has a disregard for the law, criminal
history, and also a list of the vehicles registered to that person
and who's living in his home,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get children checking on Mom's guy or Mom doing the
checking herself. But usually it's a single woman who wants
surveillance more so than a background check.''
</P>
<P>
   In earlier times, women dated men from their neighborhood, not
from the World Wide Web. They relied on their mother's opinion,
even if they didn't always agree.
</P>
<P>
   But today, checking out a man's background may be a necessary
evil.
</P>
<P>
   A 38-year-old secretary, who asked not to be identified,
remembered a man she met on the Internet who for nearly a year led
her to believe he was single.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after she attended an out-of-town conference with
him that she learned he was married with two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will lie,'' she said. ``You'd better check them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who said she would never hire a private investigator,
said that she had learned through experience to do her own
snooping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I married my husband, I asked him to show me his
divorce decree,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He complied. They have been married for five years, she said.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Memories of a red dirt hill
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Linda Sinclair
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   From the time I was 3 years old I visited my grandparents in a
small town in Alabama, and that place was more familiar to me than
any of the many towns where my parents and I lived during those
years.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I was there in the fall to help my granddaddy dig
potatoes, and sometimes we were there at Christmas or Thanksgiving
with some or all of the families of my three aunts and two uncles.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I remember summer.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, I don't remember it being the terrible,
down-South hot that I know it must have been.
</P>
<P>
   I only remember the freedom and safety of being able to play in
wonderful places like the barn, where a rope swing hung from the
highest rafter, or up the chinaberry trees laden with ammunition
for cousin fights.
</P>
<P>
   I would play jacks or marbles under the shade of the pecan trees
in the front yard or escape beyond the garden and the chicken yard
to the top of a red dirt hill.
</P>
<P>
   My cousins and I took turns zipping down that hill in two Red
Flyer wagons. Then we would hide in the trees at the bottom, so
completely covered by kudzu vine that they became shadowy caves.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally in the afternoons we were allowed to walk the six
blocks to town to visit the ``handy'' store, a sagging, gray wood
building set on stilts over a little stream.
</P>
<P>
   There were jars of penny sweets, rows and rows of candy bars and
suckers on sticks sprouting from holes in a wooden block.
</P>
<P>
   In the evenings after supper everyone sat on the big front
porch. If I was lucky I got a place in the swing, where I rocked
and listened to stories of our family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a great while a car would pass, and my grandfather could
almost always identify the people for us.
</P>
<P>
   Finally one of the grownups would notice the lateness of the
hour, and we were sent or carried off to bed.
</P>
<P>
   The house, the garden and the red dirt hill are gone now, or
changed beyond recognition, and cars whiz by constantly at the
place where pecan trees used to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The little town isn't such a little town anymore. It started
growing up about the same time I did.
</P>
<P>
   But in my mind it will always stay the same as it was when I was
a child visiting in the summer.

WHY DOES `RELIGIOUS' SUDDENLY NEED A SYNONYM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 27)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Government should welcome the help of  &UR; faith-based &LR; 
institutions,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said in 1996. In April
of this year, a spokesman for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of
Florida, told The News and Record of Greensboro, N.C., ``The
governor supports  &UR; faith-based &LR;  initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long,'' said Vice President Al Gore to the Salvation
Army in Atlanta last month, `` &UR; faith-based &LR;  organizations have
wrought miracles on a shoestring.'' He welcomed ``the voices of
 &UR; faith-based &LR;  organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   In covering Gore's speech, John Harwood of The Wall Street
Journal noted ``both political parties' growing acceptance of
 &UR; faith-based &LR;  solutions since Republicans began promoting the idea
several years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Sack of The New York Times, though reporting Gore's
usage in direct quotation, did not use the suddenly popular phrase
in his own writing; instead, he used the more traditional noun in
discussing ``government financing of  &UR; religion-based &LR; 
welfare-to-work initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Faith-based &LR;  is hot enough to be enshrined in the official
canon. In Wisconsin, the Joint Legislative Council established the
Special Committee on  &UR; Faith-Based &LR;  Approaches to Crime Prevention
and Justice. Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen's legal counsel defines
those approaches as ``the acknowledgment of and faith in a higher
power,'' the belief that social pathologies include ``conditions of
the soul'' and that treatment involves ``a fundamental
transformation of character.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest use of this modifier now so in vogue was in
criticism, not affirmation, of religion in public life. In 1981,
Clarence Martin, a lobbyist for the Association for the Advancement
of Psychology, wrote that scholars of the social sciences, heirs to
Darwin, Marx and Freud, ``are the empirical left who may challenge
the views, or more importantly reject the  &UR; faith-based &LR;  values, of
the creationists, the moral majority, the laissez-faire
industrialists, the economic determinists, the sexists, the
militarists, the coalition who put Reagan in office.''
</P>
<P>
   The linguistic mystery: Why are political figures all using
 &UR; faith-based &LR;  rather than  &UR; religion-based &LR;  or, more simply than
that adjectival compound, the old-fashioned adjective  &UR; religious &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Religion &LR;  (probably from the Latin  &UR; religare &LR; , ``to restrain'')
is a set of beliefs;  &UR; faith &LR;  (from  &UR; fidere &LR; , ``to trust'') is the
unquestioning trust in the truth of those beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   American political tradition, following its metaphor of ``a wall
of separation between church and state,'' shies away from
``religion in politics'' but not away from religious values in
public life.
</P>
<P>
   By substituting  &UR; faith &LR;  (trust in the truths) for  &UR; religion &LR; 
(the organized set of beliefs), the new compound adjective gets
around the traditional objection. The Rev. Bill Callahan of the
Quixote Center in Hyattsville, Md., says, ``The language of
 &UR; faith-based &LR;  signals to people our motivation while separating us
from the institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -Based &LR;  is a hot formative suffix. Though  &UR; broad-based &LR;  is two
centuries old,  &UR; zero-based &LR;  took off around 1970 and missile lingo
gave us  &UR; land-based &LR; ,  &UR; sea-based &LR;  and  &UR; space-based &LR; . A discussion
of this particular parasynthetic derivative is  &UR; based-based &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   DISMILITARIZE?
</P>
<P>
   Few people are for unilateral  &UR; disarmament &LR; . Most Koreans and
Americans are familiar, after four decades, with a  &UR; demilitarized &LR; 
zone, or DMZ. Now, from the war that brought us  &UR; nonpermissive
environment &LR; , we have a distinction drawn between  &UR; disarm &LR;  and
 &UR; demilitarize &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Henry Shelton, said on
ABC's ``This Week'': ``We never said that we were going to
` &UR; disarm &LR; ' the KLA. We used the term ` &UR; demilitarize &LR; .''' The Wall
Street Journal editorialized on its meaning to the Kosovo
Liberation Army: ``This distinction apparently means they can keep
their hunting rifles, relying on a U.N.-supervised force to protect
them from Serbian tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The distinction, more finely put, is this:  &UR; Disarm &LR;  means ``to
divest of weapons; to deprive of the means of attack.''
 &UR; Demilitarize &LR;  means ``to close a military organization; to remove
the military power or potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we're into the trickiest kind of semantics. How  &UR; disarmed &LR; 
do you have to be to call yourself  &UR; demilitarized &LR; ? I think it
depends, first, on the power of the weaponry: If you carry a rifle
or a pistol, you are armed but not necessarily militarized; if you
are in an armored personnel carrier or in a choppering gunship,
You're in the Army Now.
</P>
<P>
   But how about an automatic rifle, a small mortar or a light
machine gun? If that's not  &UR; militarized &LR; , what about a little
howitzer or a heavy machine gun or shoulder-mounted missile? This
has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the meaning of  &UR; demilitarized &LR;  deals with
organization. Can a  &UR; demilitarized &LR;  group call itself an army? (The
Salvation Army would say yes.) Are a buncha guys hanging around in
civvies and calling one another ``Mister''  &UR; demilitarized &LR;  if they
practice maneuvers and draw a table of organization in the sand?
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman, Ken Bacon, informs me: `` &UR; Disarm &LR;  means
to take weapons away from an army.  &UR; Demilitarize &LR;  means to disband
the army.'' As I get it, the KLA will be disbanded but not
 &UR; disarmed &LR; , which suggest its members can keep all their arms as
individuals but may not assemble or otherwise get organized.
</P>
<P>
   The current meaning will be worked out at the negotiating tables
and on the field, then passed to lexicographers. Meanwhile, we are
in a very gray area. I asked a top soldier-diplomat if he would
like to set me straight on the latest specific meaning of
 &UR; demilitarize &LR; . I am not sure if he replied, ``No, thanks'' or ``No
tanks.''

`TRUE AT FIRST LIGHT': THE HUNTER RETURNS, WEARY BUT STILL MACHO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Africa was a fine subject, and he had written about it well and
truly in the past, but the old days were gone now, and he was old
and weary and ailing, and what he wrote this time was not good and
it was not true. The writer was a proud man and he took pride in
his writing, and when the writing of the Africa book did not go
well, he put it away. Long ago, he said that there was nothing
worse for a writer than for his writing ``which has been rewritten
and altered to be published without permission as his own,'' and he
believed this as he believed few things. Later, when he was gone,
others would forget his pride and his love of words, and they would
publish his Africa book and other books he had put aside. They
would publish the books because the writer was a famous writer and
he had many readers, but they would do damage to his name.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Hemingway: Although his instantly recognizable style helped
remake the writing of English prose in the first half of this
century, it would grow mannered and flaccid in the latter part of
his career, and it would make him an easy mark for feckless
imitators and hostile critics. His public persona, which initially
brought him fame and wealth, would become a kind of prison, and in
the years after his death, it would also make him an object of
derision among feminists and multiculturalists intent on judging
him by contemporary mores as a bigoted, sexist pig.
</P>
<P>
   No one has given such critics more ammunition than his estate
and publishers, who have brought out a succession of posthumously
published books consisting of writing that Hemingway himself chose
not to publish _ books that show Hemingway in the worst of all
possible lights, his prose a near-parody of his earlier style; his
self-portraits exercises in self-aggrandizing bravado. The latest
of these volumes is ``True at First Light,'' a so-called
``fictional memoir,'' laboriously extracted by Hemingway's son
Patrick from a 200,000-word, untitled manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which is roughly half the length of the original
manuscript, purports to chronicle a safari trip in Kenya that
Hemingway took with his fourth wife, Mary, in 1953. It recounts the
story of Mary's efforts to kill a lion that she has been tracking
for six months, and the narrator's involvement with a young woman
from the Wakamba tribe who is referred to as his ``fiancee'' or
``extra wife.'' Although ``First Light'' is not as embarrassing a
performance as ``Garden of Eden'' (published in 1986) or ``The
Dangerous Summer'' (published in 1985), it is decidedly mediocre
Hemingway, a pallid, perfunctory echo of ``Green Hills of Africa,''
a 1935 nonfiction work that itself holds up poorly next to his two
classic African stories, ``The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' and ``The
Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.''
</P>
<P>
   As Edmund Wilson has observed, Hemingway was able to externalize
and objectify the conflicting elements of his own personality in
his fiction. This capacity for self-criticism, however, tended to
fade away when he wrote in the first person, and it disappeared
entirely as Hemingway became increasingly concerned with living up
to his public persona and mythologizing his own life _ problems
pointed up all too clearly in ``First Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this book seems completely intent on creating a portrait
of the author as the white alpha male, an Uebermensch fought over
by women and looked up to by Africans. He protectively watches over
his wife, making sure she is not hurt while she is hunting, and he
takes it upon himself to help the local villagers rid themselves of
the scourge of marauding lions and leopards. He presumably embodies
Hemingway's belief that blood sports are a test of manhood and
honor, and he adheres to the hunter's code of ethics _ that is,
always kill cleanly and never leave an animal wounded.
</P>
<P>
   He looks at a picture of a man strangling two lions and is
``deeply moved.'' He declares that ``love is a terrible thing that
you would not wish on your neighbor.'' And he thinks to himself
``how nice it was that there was no African word for I'm sorry.''
He seems to think of himself as brave and honorable, when in fact
he comes across as patronizing, paternalistic and self-deluding. He
makes a lot of snide remarks about the Masai, describing them as
``a syphilis-ridden, anthropological, cattle-worshiping
curiosity,'' and petulantly knocks such literary rivals as Henry
James, John O'Hara and F. Scott Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Although Patrick Hemingway argues in his introduction that
``First Light'' is not a journal but a work of fiction, the book
hews closely to accounts of Hemingway's 1953 safari set down by
biographers, who have pointed out that the author did become
involved with an African woman and did ``go native,'' shaving his
head and hunting with a spear. The main difference between these
biographical accounts and ``First Light'' concerns Hemingway's _ or
``the narrator's'' _ prowess as a hunter and all that that implies
in the author's macho esthetic. While the biographies stress the
writer's humiliating difficulties with his marksmanship on this
trip, ``First Light'' focuses on Mary's disappointing encounter
with a lion: an encounter in which the Hemingway character must
come to her aid, kill the lion and then try to cheer her up.
</P>
<P>
   As in so much of Hemingway's later work, all this spinning of
his own legend is reflected in the deterioration of his prose. What
was special _ and at the time, galvanic _ about his early writing
was its precision and concision: Hemingway not only knew what to
leave out, but he also succeeded in turning that austerity into a
moral outlook, a way of looking at a world shattered and remade by
World War I. His early work had a clean, hard objectivity: It did
not engage in meaningless abstractions; it tried to show, not tell.
</P>
<P>
   In ``First Light,'' however, his angular language has turned
maudlin and flabby. The narrator is given to tendentious comments
like ``revelation stands in the same relation to human reason as
heavenly water does to the earthly water.'' Or ``Who knows what the
carrot feels, or the small young radish, or the used electric light
bulb, or the worn phonograph disk, or the apple tree in winter.''
The other characters are just as bad. ``Nobody knows the night,''
says one of his African crew. ``Not me. Not you. Nobody.'' As for
Mary, she is made to utter such absurdities as: ``I am a warrior.
I'm your wife and your love and your small warrior brother.''
</P>
<P>
   The famous rhythms of Hemingway's prose have similarly devolved
in these pages into empty mannerism and nervous tics. Of one
character, he writes: ``He coughed his cough at once so there would
be no doubt of it and it was a legitimate cough.'' And of his
narrator's drinking: ``Whisky can be as right as it can be wrong
and it said I was not a stranger and I knew it was correct at this
time of night.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Patrick Hemingway makes no great claims for
this book, saying he has licked the manuscript ``into what I hope
is not the worst of all possible shapes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Hemingway himself could have licked his unfinished draft
into the Ursus horribilis it might have been,'' he adds. ``What I
offer in `True at First Light' is a child's teddy bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Hemingway has done a more coherent job of editing this
book than his predecessors did with ``The Garden of Eden'' and
``The Dangerous Summer'': In comparison with those volumes, ``First
Light'' at least possesses a certain narrative tension and drive.
That, however, is beside the point. This book, which Hemingway
worked on while recovering from terrible injuries sustained in two
plane crashes (including a fractured skull, two cracked disks, and
a ruptured liver, kidney and spleen), was consigned to a bank vault
by its author, who did not regard it as fit to print.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Light'' never should have seen the light of day.

BRAVO REVEALS A LESS THAN FULL `MONTE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The English know their way around the classics, and now the
French step up with a ravishing version of ``The Count of Monte
Cristo.''
</P>
<P>
   And the star of the miniseries, which will be shown Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday on the Bravo cable channel, is that
lovable lug of French cinema, Gerard Depardieu, in his first TV
project.
</P>
<P>
   But a few cautions are required. One, it's in French with
English subtitles. Two, it's eight hours over four nights. Three,
the source material is a hoary specimen of ``classic'' literature.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance was never a specialty of Alexandre Dumas. Nor character
insight. He liked plot. He liked action. He liked love.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Count of Monte Cristo'' provides all that, in stark
melodrama, along with false imprisonment, fabulous wealth,
dastardly betrayal, multiple disguises, poison potions, sleeping
potions and, above all, vengeance served as chilled as vichyssoise.
</P>
<P>
   You get an early glimpse of Depardieu's son, Guillaume
Depardieu, as the young naval officer Edmond Dantes, who is in
Marseille and about to celebrate his engagement to a well-appointed
Mercedes (Naike Rivelli).
</P>
<P>
   But instead he's arrested by the prosecutor Villefort (Pierre
Arditi) and thrown into the prison fortress Chateau d'If, because
he was innocently carrying a letter from the exiled Emperor
Napoleon to a key supporter in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Dantes is still rotting in prison 18 years later (he's now
played by the elder Depardieu) when an unexpected encounter with
another inmate leads to his freedom and to a fortune in gems and
gold concealed on the rocky island of Monte Cristo.
</P>
<P>
   Dantes creates the identity of the mysterious count of Monte
Cristo and returns to the mainland to avenge himself. He's rough,
he's tough and, reminded that it's a shame to be consumed with
vengeance, he replies, ``What matter when vengeance is allied with
justice?''
</P>
<P>
   His targets are the corrupt innkeeper Caderousse (Roland
Blanche), who could have saved the young Dantes and didn't; his
anonymous accusers Danglars (Michel Aumont), now a Paris banker,
and Fernand de Morcerf (Jean Rochefort), now a Paris nobleman; and
the prosecutor, Villefort.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Didier Decoin and director Josee Dayan dwell on
several romances along the way, the better to relieve the
one-dimensional tedium of Dantes' obsession. One involves
Villefort's daughter, Valentine, played by yet another Depardieu
family member, Gerard's daughter Julie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Count of Monte Cristo'' has its grand moments, one of
which is a protracted scene where Morcerf is humiliated in the
upper house of the French parliament. But time has given this tale
a bad case of the dodders, and the crutches that hold the plot
aloft are too conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also reasons to watch. The $20 million production
is gorgeously filmed, for one thing, on Malta and at a series of
French locales. The miniseries is a lavish, big-scale event.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Depardieu. The character of Dantes is really as
wooden as a mallet, but Depardieu shows why he's made himself an
international film star.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, he's an actor of disparate elements _ barrel torso,
short legs, clownish nose, thick jaw, sad eyes and blond hair that
somehow ought to be dark. And rather attractive in spite of flawed
parts, or possibly because of them.
</P>
<P>
   There's a gentleness beneath the burly exterior, and this
miniseries stretches Dumas to take advantage of it. Yes, Dantes is
bent on vengeance. But he's also a sort of blend of Santa Claus and
Robin Hood, spreading his largesse as he homes in on his targets.
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries is a lot of Depardieu in four sittings, and he's
a rare performer who can carry the burden. You can tire of the
miniseries, but not of its star.
</P>
<P>
   As for the subtitles, they shouldn't be an obstacle. I watched
on a small screen without problem. And as background noise goes,
the French language is easier to take than the cacophony of
American television.

   KOSOVO-RDP (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ The agreement reached early
Monday to disband the Kosovo Liberation Army included, at the
insistence of its commanders, a pledge by the NATO allies to
consider letting the rebels form a provisional army for Kosovo
modeled on the National Guard in the United States. By Steven Lee
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-WOMEN-ASSAULT (Zrze, Yugoslavia) _ In interviews over the
last two weeks, dozens of women and men in Kosovo and in refugee
camps in Albania told stories that suggest that sexual assault and

   EXPERIMENTAL-PATIENTS (Undated) _ Chronically ill patients with
limited or no health insurance are increasingly filling a demand
for experimental drug study participants as drug companies rush
record numbers of new medications through the testing process. For
these people, experiments have become treatments; clinical
investigators are their specialists. But the benefit can be
fleeting or nonexistent. Chronically ill patients with no other
options can be treated with an experimental medication that does
not work or that even worsens their condition. Or they can end up
with a placebo rather than the medication itself. And once the
study is over, usually in a matter of weeks, they are left to their
own devices. By Gina Kolata and Kurt Eichenwald.

   REPUBS-ATTORNEYS-GENERAL (Washington) _ At a time when a number
of state attorneys general have embraced a new activism against

organization and think tank devoted to electing more Republicans to
positions as chief law enforcement officers and to promote

   BLACK-SAILOR-PARDON (Naval Weapons Base Concord, Calif.) _
During World War II, an explosion on a segregated naval base here
killed 320 men. After the accident, black sailors were ordered to
resume loading ammunition onto ships. Fifty of them refused, were
court-martialed by an all-white panel, found guilty of mutiny and
imprisoned. Now, in an extraordinary legal battle, lawyers for one
black veteran have filed for a presidential pardon arguing that the
black sailors failed to follow orders out of legitimate fear and
had no intent to mutiny. The petition pits the racial symbolism of
a celebrated case against the military's view that servicemen
cannot choose which orders to obey. By William Glaberson. 2,100

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Forget the fact they're cute. Sydney 2000
backers would prefer you don't fixate on the 'roos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but most people don't know there are 27 varieties of
kangaroos, that they're not mammals but marsupials, that they all
have a pouch. And that there's one type of kangaroo that lives in a
tree,'' the Australian mining executive explained to a visitor as
the 15-hour flight from Los Angeles approached Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``And koalas, mate? They're not bears, you know. Marsupials. Not
bears, mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the tale of his provincial-sounding countryman, Peter
Christopher buries his head in his hands and talks to the table:
``We like 'roos, but there's so much more.''
</P>
<P>
   He is correct, and the setting in which he speaks makes the
point.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, the Olympics coordinator for the Fairfax newspaper
group, sits at Nick's, a harborside restaurant in the Darling
Harbour area of downtown Sydney. In the turning basin ahead, Sydney
water ferries maneuver. To the left are shops, restaurants and the
massive hall where wrestling, judo and a host of other Olympic
sports will be played. To the right sits the historic Pyrmont
Bridge, now a pedestrian span. A quiet monorail, carrying the
advertising of an Olympic sponsor, glides over the bridge to a
station in a waterside shopping mall on the far side of the basin.
</P>
<P>
   This has the look, the feel and the amenities of one of THE
gathering spots during the Sydney Olympics, which start Sept. 15,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Atlanta in 1996, Sydney's is already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the nice things: We've got this great gathering
spot that is already in place, waiting for the Olympics,'' said
Christopher, guiding a visitor through the city.
</P>
<P>
   With less than 470 days to go, Sydney is starting to tie up the
loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   By no means is the city finished and ready for the Olympic
crush, but the venue construction is in excellent shape, and work
proceeds along on redoing the airport, city streets, shopping
plazas, transit areas and other public sites.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Atlanta four years ago would have seen a similar
construction build-up as the city spruced up on schedule for its
Olympic visitors. But a criticism of the Atlanta experience was
that downtown was not entirely visitor-friendly outside the newly
built Centennial Olympic Park, and temporary street vendors brought
an unfortunate tackiness to the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, with its famed and striking Opera House, its magnificent
harbor and its lively downtown and culture that already include
tasteful street vendors, newsstands and flower stands, looks like a
city that will keep the Olympic crowds happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have to do a lot to bugger it up, `` said Milton
Cockburn, General Manager, Media, for the Sydney Organising
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG).
</P>
<P>
   But there's always that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Still looming in the background is the continuing controversy
over the International Olympic Committee's city selection process.
If new problems arise, Sydney could suffer, and there's always the
fear that sponsors would back out.
</P>
<P>
   Hedging its bets, Sydney has started chopping its budget,
seeking ways to save as insurance against a shortfall later. The
latest cuts included about $50 million in funds for a variety of
programs, including a salary freeze, reduced staffing levels during
the Games, a short-term hiring freeze and some savings on Olympic
family services, such as free tickets and pool vehicles instead of
dedicated cars for some IOC family members.
</P>
<P>
   SOCOG's budget is now at $1.69 billion, about the same as
Atlanta's in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly keen to get the IOC to behave as much as
possible like ordinary citizens of Sydney,'' said Michael Knight,
SOCOG president. ``There are some bits that the IOC will be more
relaxed about than others, but in the end I think it's fair to say
that the IOC's negotiating position in the current climate is not
particularly strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the cuts, there were signs of strain between the IOC
and SOCOG. IOC Vice President Richard Pound said Sydney has escaped
the scrutiny given to the Salt Lake bid, kept secret the cool
temperatures there during September and failed to disclose problems
with the city's transport system.
</P>
<P>
   ``A touch of malice,'' one local paper said about Pound.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that mix the debate over Olympic official Phil Coles, who
was embroiled in the IOC controversy. Coles has resigned his post
with SOCOG and the Australian Olympic Committe but remains an IOC
member.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other local controversies, too. Bondi Beach
residents didn't want beach volleyball in their neighborhood, but
it made such a great TV setting that Sydney didn't want to back off
despite protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``NIMBYs, that's what I call 'em,'' one irate taxi driver said
of those who use the not-in-my-back-yard argument. ``Who are they
to tell us we can't have beach volleyball there? They ran off
'Baywatch,' too.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, another beach community did that.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seems settled, at this stage, with concessions being
made to make life more palatable for Bondi Beach residents during
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the usual concerns that rise from people who
actually live in a host city: steep ticket prices, congestion in
general, how to get to work during the Games, concern about how
their city and country will be portrayed internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is at the point many Olympic cities find themselves in
the year before the Games: lots of time spent on citizens'
complaints, construction issues, funding debates _ and not much
public discussion of the sports and the Games.
</P>
<P>
   As Sydney heads toward Opening Ceremonies, Cockburn said, SOCOG
has employed 40 to 50 people who worked with the Atlanta Committee
for the Olympic Games, a move that initially bothered some because
locals felt they didn't need any guidance from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But those feelings have for the most part disappeared, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something reassuring when you're in a room and
discussing how to handle issues and hearing those American
accents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They have taken note of some of the issues from the Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had (ACOG chief operating officer) A.D. Frazier down here a
while back,'' said Cockburn, ``and one of the things that he said
he'd look at differently if he had it to do over again would be
dealing with the press. Not the broadcasters because they aren't
going to go on TV and trash you after they've paid so much to
televise the Games. But the press. He said he still has scratch
marks on his back from that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney organizers certainly understand how quickly the
international press can turn on an Olympic city, and they're doing
what they can to make sure that doesn't hapen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going through ways to cut the budget,'' Cockburn told editors
from across Australia and New Zealand recently, ``we looked at the
three bars we have in the Olympics area for journalists. We
considered eliminating those to save money, but decided that
wouldn't be a good thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Sydney's Olympic construction is proceeding
without a hitch, with nearly all venues completed on time and
within budget. Still to be finished are the Superdome (for
basketball and gymnastics), Tennis Centre, Shooting Centre,
Velodrome and, early next year, the second water polo venue.
</P>
<P>
   The center of activity is the Olympic stadium (Stadium
Australia), a striking structure that has already seen action,
hosting several sporting events, including one filled to its
110,000-person capacity.
</P>
<P>
   One reviewer calls it ``a display of structural virtuosity.''
Others say it looks like a Pringle potato chip.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium is the centerpiece of the Homebush Bay Olympic
facility. On the outskirts of Sydney, it's the central spot for
Olympic activities and home for track and field, swimming, water
polo, baseball, field hockey and other events. It's a huge sports
complex, made even more photogenic by the burying of major
electrical transmission lines to make the site attractive for the
television audience.
</P>
<P>
   One Homebush Bay stadium _ the woodchop pavilion _ won't see any
Olympic action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually quite a sport ... very strenuous and exciting,''
Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   Like American pro wrestling?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, this is the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sydney was struggling with the Bondi Beach controversy,
there was even one proposal that sand be carted to the woodchop
pavilion so it could be used for beach volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   For those who view Sydney's beaches as some of the finest in the
world, that was the last straw in the balancing act between Olympic
needs and local desires.
</P>
<P>
   In a countdown report, the Sydney Morning Herald noted the
timeline, and the local apprehension, and asked: 500 days ``to what
precisely? The greatest event on earth or the greatest
imposition?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are strange and confounding times for a Sydneysider
attempting to make sense of an event bewildering in its magnitude,
though many of us are yet to come to terms with the scope of the
event.''

   The company estimates only 20 percent of businesses have an
online presence. The new unit will build upon offerings from Netcom
On-Line Communication Services Inc., which focused on business
customers and was purchased by MindSpring in February for $245
million.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring Biz has its own staff of 280 dedicated employees,
with 100 based in Atlanta and the others primarily centered in San
Jose's Netcom headquarters. Other MindSpring Biz employees will be
based MindSpring's call centers in Dallas, and Harrisburg, Penn.
MindSpring Biz hired a new director of marketing, Tim Sesmones, who
will be based in Atlanta. The others are existing employees.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring said about 20 percent of its 1.2 million subscribers
are small businesses. Business customers typically provide higher
profits because they pay more for premium services, said Ed
Douglas, a vice president with the new unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They require a lot more hand-holding,'' Douglas said. ``That's
one of the things that's been missing out there in the
small-business arena.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring hopes to attract small businesses to the Web by
making speed the cornerstone of its small business offerings.
Through an arrangement with Covad Communications' networks, the
largest provider of high speed phone service in the country,
MindSpring will be able to provide its business customers with
symmetrical digital subscriber lines. The service will offer
business users a high speed ``always on'' connection. The
high-speed connections will be available this fall in Atlanta,
Dallas, San Francisco and Los Angeles. More cities are slated to be
added in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``MindSpring sDSL is a low-cost, high speed alternative to a T1
line or ISDN service,'' said Greg Stromberg, executive vice
president of MindSpring Biz.
</P>
<P>
   Services are bundled in packages with prices starting at about
$100. Depending on the Internet speed and services selected,
pricing can vary.

COURT BACKS WARRANTLESS SEARCH OF CARS IN DRUG CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police do not have to obtain a warrant to search a
car suspected of carrying illegal drugs, even in cases where they
had plenty of time to get one, the Supreme Court said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In an unsigned opinion, the court noted that it has said in the
past that the Fourth Amendment, which generally requires police to
get a warrant from a judge before conducting a search, does not
apply to cars because they are mobile. Now, the court said, the
so-called ``automobile exception'' is valid even when time is not
an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision stemmed from a Maryland case that began at
11 a.m. July 2, 1996. At that time St. Mary's County Sheriff Deputy
Lyle Long received a tip from a reliable source that Kevin Dyson, a
known drug dealer in the area, had gone to New York that morning to
buy drugs and would be returning to Maryland in a rented red Toyota
later that day with a large amount of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Long called the rental car company to corroborate the
information given him. After the facts checked out, the sheriff's
staff decided to pick up Dyson's car when it entered St. Mary's
County.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 a.m. July 3, other deputies stopped Dyson's car, searched
it for drugs and found 23 grams of crack cocaine in a duffel bag
the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson was convicted in a county court of conspiracy to possess
cocaine with intent to distribute it. He appealed, arguing that the
warrantless search violated his Fourth Amendment rights because the
sheriff's deputies had sufficient time after the informant's tip to
obtain a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland reversed the
county court's decision. It ruled that for the automobile exception
to the warrant requirement to apply, there must be not only
probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime is contained in
the car but also that police do not have time to get a warrant. The
state's highest court declined to review that decision, and the
Maryland attorney general appealed
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's decision the Supreme Court reversed the special
appeals court ruling and reinstated the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holding of the Court of Special Appeals that the
`automobile exception' requires a separate finding of exigency in
addition to a finding of probable cause is squarely contrary to our
previous holdings,'' the high court said.
</P>
<P>
   All nine justices agreed that the sheriff's deputies did not
need a warrant in Dyson's case. But Justice Stephen Breyer
dissented from the result, saying the high court should not reverse
the state court without hearing arguments that Dyson was not
properly represented because his lawyer did not file a response to
the attorney general's appeal.

 &HT;    Truth more awful than believed in Kosovo
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a chilling report from Kosovo, a team of Time reporters
discovers evidence of Serbian atrocities more horrible than
imagined. In the town of Pec, a rich, urban center, Serbian forces
swept through the city three times in an attempt to crush the
Kosovo Liberation Army and to destroy the Albanian intellectual and
political culture. The tales of death and brutality are troubling
enough, but the photograph of a young Albanian boy carrying a
one-legged doll and a bowl of crumbs is absolutely haunting.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek ($3.50), meanwhile, sent reporters and photographers
into Suva Reka, where victims and killers were often on a
first-name basis and Serbs settled old scores with ethnic Albanian
neighbors over business competition. Twenty-one members of the
prominent Berisha family were killed, apparently in retaliation
over a dispute with Serbian businessman Misko Nisavic. ``This was a
massacre with a personal history,'' says correspondent Rod
Nordland.

   &QR;  Remembering Papa: Cigar Aficionado pays tribute to Ernest
Hemingway on the 100th anniversary of his birth and examines the
mystique that has spawned a cottage industry for scholars and
Hemingway heirs. Hemingway's sons, John, Patrick and Gregory,
formed Hemingway Ltd. in 1992 to license the use of the patriarch's
name and image. The authorized items included a Hemingway shotgun
(which caused a storm of protest since the writer used a shotgun to
kill himself) and a $600 limited-edition Mont Blanc fountain pen. A
nice gift, but Hemingway wrote the first drafts of his books in
pencil. So what is Hemingway's connection to cigars? Well, the
Tabacalera A. Fuente y Cia. produces a line of stogies in different
sizes _ Short Story, Best Seller and Masterpiece. Papa would have
been proud.

   &QR;  Eye-opener: Nicole Kidman reveals almost all in the July 8
double issue of Rolling Stone ($4.95). Devastated by the death of
Stanley Kubrick, Kidman talks about working with the director of
``Eyes Wide Shut'' and her marriage to co-star Tom Cruise. ``The
shock for Tom and me is that nobody knew us the way Stanley did.
Not even my mom and dad.'' And while the film is being touted as
the summer's sexiest movie, Kidman denies that it's going to be a
sex romp. ``The sex is such a small part of the story. ... Tom and
I aren't exhibitionists.'' Other articles of note: Johnny Depp
writes about the night he met poet Allen Ginsburg, and ``South
Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone take on Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Not listless: Magazine editors apparently love lists, even if
they're meaningless. Entertainment Weekly's ($3.50) latest ranking
is the ``It List'' of the 100 ``most creative people in
entertainment.'' Among those profiled are Nicole Kidman, Heather
Graham, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rupert Everett and Ricky Martin, as
well as behind-the-scenes artists including ``Titanic'' costume
designer Deborah Scott. Other trendsetters include creators at the
Cartoon Network and choreographers for the swinging Gap
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Essence ($2.75) explores reactions to the
long-held taboo of black women dating _ and marrying _ white men.
Research shows that the trend includes working-class women as well
as upwardly mobile professional females. ... What will marriage be
like in the next millennium? According to John Gray and other
experts quizzed by Bride's ($4.99) magazine, couples will get
married later in life and most couples won't start families until
their mid-30s. Gray sees more breakthroughs such as Viagra that
will keep the marital fires blazing. ... In addition to the typical
cover story on how to have great abs, the August Men's Health
($3.50) has a thirst-quenching article on beverages to beat
fatigue, anxiety and hangovers. According to one nutritionist, club
soda with lime will boost your energy, nonalcoholic beer will calm
you, and V-8 vegetable juice or tomato juice will help you recover
from too much alcohol.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m. Monday, the temperature at Washington, D.C., was just
67 degrees, or about 20 degrees below normal. The laden overcast
that has covered the Middle Atlantic States the past few days will
slowly erode Tuesday, allowing temperatures to rebound closer to
seasonal levels. A few locations in eastern Virginia, however, will
stay cloudy and cool as damp winds from the Atlantic persist.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy fog near the Northeast Seaboard will dissipate yielding
sunny skies by early afternoon as high pressure builds across
upstate New York. Abundant sunshine and warm conditions will cover
the interior Northeast. Farther south, scattered thunderstorms will
again plague Florida, especially just inland from the coast where
developing sea-breeze fronts undercut and lift sultry air.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of humid air from the Gulf of Mexico will fuel
showers and thunderstorms over Texas and the southeast Plains. Some
flooding is expected. A cluster of showers and storms will also
affect the Middle West as an approaching jet stream disturbance
augments the ascent of humid air covering the region.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated potent storms will erupt over eastern Wyoming the
central high Plains ahead of a cold front crossing the region. Some
of the storms will contain large hail and damaging winds.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore breezes will direct cool air with spotty showers into
the western Washington. The Southwest deserts and interior
California will broil beneath abundant sun. Local thundershowers
will develop near the higher mountain ranges of the Rockies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Mountain Clouds
</P>
<P>
   Like clockwork each afternoon during the past several days,
billowy clouds have boiled up along the crests of the central and
southern Rockies, muddling the mostly clear skies that have
dominated hours near dawn. At the top of a mountain, air in contact
with the warming ground quickly becomes warmer and less dense than
the free-floating air that surrounds the summit. Like a hot-air
balloon, bubbles of heated air rise, sometimes leading to cumulus
clouds. When the sun sets, air in contact with the mountainside
cools rapidly and the rising air currents that sustain the clouds
cease.

<P>
   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia _ President Clinton travels Tuesday to
Macedonia, where he will meet with refugees just miles from the
border of war-shattered Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to go from there to Aviano Air Base in Italy, where
he'll thank U.S. pilots and air crews for their participation in
NATO's 78-day air war against Yugoslavia, wrapping up the final leg
of a week-long victory lap through Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Journeying Monday to the flashpoint that set off a decade of
Balkans bloodshed, Clinton praised Slovenia's fledgling democracy
as a beacon of hope for the wounded region and a model for the
future of southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He received a rock star's welcome from several thousand Slovenes
who braved a summer downpour to jam into the central square in this
ancient crossroads along Europe's southern underbelly. They waved
small rain-soaked American flags and applauded his vision of Balkan
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must build a Europe with no frontline states, a Europe
undivided, democratic and at peace for the first time in history,''
Clinton said, as cheers welled up from beneath a kaleidoscopic sea
of umbrellas. ``Slovenia can lead the way -- and America will
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Bonn, Germany, Clinton said he and his European
counterparts are planning a summit later this summer -- perhaps in
the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo -- to discuss a
multi-billion-dollar mini-Marshall Plan to help rebuild the Balkans
and set the region on an ambitious course of integration with the
rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that money, Clinton said, would go toward providing
emergency food and medicine to Serbia, and to restoring essential
heating services and electrical power there, even if it remains
under the control of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it is important that if the Serbs want to keep Mr.
Milosevic, and don't want to be part of Southeastern Europe's
future, that at least they not freeze to death this winter and that
their hospitals not be forced to close,'' Clinton said. ``Babies
will be born, people will get sick, and people shouldn't be cold in
the winter if we can help that.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected, however, the rebuilding of dozens of road and rail
bridges NATO bombs destroyed across Serbia, saying those do not
qualify as humanitarian needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of rebuilding the bridges so people can go to work, I
don' t buy that,'' Clinton said during a news conference following
a meeting with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and European
Commission President Jacques Santer in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of their economic reconstruction,'' said Clinton,
``and I don't think we should help -- not a bit, not a penny,''
unless Milosevic first leaves office in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbia must reject the murderous rule of Mr. Milosevic and
choose the path that Slovenia has chosen,'' Clinton said here in
Ljubljana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial and religious hatred has not a place in a civilized
society,'' Clinton said. ``That is why free nations stood against
Mr. Milosevic's ethnic cleansing and killing in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke in English, a group of several hundred young
Slovenes enthusiastically applauded, even before an interpreter
translated his words into Slovenian.
</P>
<P>
   Among his admirers was a young biology student, who said she was
glad Clinton had come to show the world that Slovenia is a Balkan
nation dedicated to democracy, peace and progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they will know who we are -- the whole world,'' said Tina
Sedmak, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others in this region, she said she harbors
complicated feelings about the air campaign waged by NATO
warplanes, which roared within earshot of this placid riverside
city on their nightly raids.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, she said there was no other way to combat
Serb repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't right,'' she said of the air campaign. ``But was the
only way.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia was the first republic to break away from the former
Yugoslavia, opting for independence in 1991, just as the former
Eastern Bloc country was beginning to crumble under Milosevic's
emerging policies.
</P>
<P>
   In a bloody prelude of the broader tragedy to follow, Yugoslavia
sent troops to fight Slovenia's secession in a 10-day war that left
66 dead. The forces withdrew three months later, leaving the tiny
Alpine republic to go its own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years ago, Mr. Milosevic triggered a military assault on
your nation,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you resisted. You secured your freedom. And you
proclaimed, 'It will never be the same again,''' Clinton said to
rousing applause. ``Now all the people of every part of Europe must
be able to say the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In some sense, Slovenia's secession helped touch off the powder
keg that was Yugoslavia in the waning days of the Cold War
structure in central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia, Croatia and Macedonia
soon followed in declaring independence, eventually leaving only
Serbia and Montenegro to form the rump Yugoslavia, but not before
several hundred thousand people were killed and more than 3 million
others were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent chapter in the Balkan nightmare unfolded in
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, where Serb repression of ethnic
Albanians has resulted in an estimated 10,000 deaths and forced
more than 1 million people to flee their homes, thousands of which
were later destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been indicted on four counts of war crimes by the
United Nations tribunal investigating the atrocities in Kosovo. If
apprehended, tried and convicted, he could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton followed his speech here Monday with a state dinner
hosted by Slovenia's president, Milan Kucan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to wrap-up a week-long Europe tour late Tuesday
at Aviano, fly back to the United States aboard Air Force One and
return to the White House early Wednesday.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ So I'm walking down Lexington Avenue in Manhattan on
a gorgeous Saturday afternoon, and I stop to admire a church that
I'd never really noticed before: St. Jean Baptiste, on the corner
of 76th Street.
</P>
<P>
   I like its noble neo-classical fussiness, its four foliated
white marble pillars and two towers stacked with arches, columns,
crowns. I dart inside for a look, gaze up at the painted dome,
breathe in the rich, churchy air, and go back out to continue my
walk downtown.
</P>
<P>
   It's warm, I'm thirsty, so after about 10 blocks I cross
Lexington Avenue to buy a bottle of juice from a grocery. I drink
the juice as I stroll along, and soon I stop to admire another
lovely church. Four white marble pillars, dome, double towers.
</P>
<P>
   How can it be, I ask myself, that there are two such similar and
ornate churches on Lexington Avenue, and that I, a lover of
architecture and longtime New Yorker, hadn't realized it? I run up
to the entrance to explore this second interior, but stop short in
horror when I read the sign: St. Jean Baptiste. Holy deja vu all
over again! With considerable self-disgust, I reconstruct what
happened. The simple act of crossing Lexington Avenue for
refreshments had completely flipped around my sense of left, right,
north and south, with the result that, after leaving the grocery, I
had mindlessly retraced my steps back uptown.
</P>
<P>
   Some women are attracted to the wrong men; I'm attracted to the
wrong direction. I get lost driving, I get lost walking, I get lost
in the great outdoors, I get lost in corridors. A boyfriend once
observed that my internal compass was so dysfunctional as to be
almost useful: Watch which way Natalie turns, and then head in the
opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   I've found some comfort in the fact that many others suffer from
my little handicap. Not for nothing have ``global positioning
systems'' become one of the most popular frills in automobiles. The
mere mention of ``poor sense of direction'' in an Ann Landers
column invariably unleashes a floodtide of reader confessionals,
tragicomic tales of getting lost on the way to weddings, funerals,
the delivery room.
</P>
<P>
   More heartening still is the keen interest that scientists have
lately taken in the subject of how humans and other species
navigate _ or fail to. The study of what they call spatial
cognition, or way-finding, is attracting a growing cadre of
researchers from all sectors of the academic map, including
psychology, neuroscience, computer science, zoology, anthropology,
linguistics and geography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this business long enough to see my specialty go
in and out of style, and back in again,'' said Dr. Gary L. Allen, a
psychology professor at the University of South Carolina in
Columbia. ``Right now, spatial cognition studies are extremely
popular, and they're more interdisciplinary than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists are delving into the talents of the world's
great wanderers: birds, turtles, caribou and other creatures that
travel thousands upon thousands of miles a year without once
forgetting where they parked the car. Other researchers are zeroing
in on the specific parts of the brain that allow travelers to use
spatial layout or visible landmarks to guide their paths _ the
mind's placemakers, if you will. It turns out that the brain is a
compulsive categorizer and pigeonholer, in orienting itself
topographically as much as in sizing up new acquaintances or
judging ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   In a review that will appear in September in the British journal
Brain, Dr. Geoffrey Aguirre, a neuroscientist at the University of
Pennsylvania, describes a group of patients who, as a result of
stroke or brain injury, suffer from an unusual and eerily specific
type of topographic disorientation. He calls it ``landmark
agnosia'' _ an inability to recognize big, stable objects in the
environment, particularly buildings. Such patients can describe
where it is they need to go, but when they are outside, they cannot
use the most salient landmarks _ a neighbor's yellow house, the
local supermarket _ to anchor and direct them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll turn a corner,'' Aguirre said in an interview, ``and
the street will be completely unfamiliar to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the patients learn to compensate for their discrete
deficit. ``They pay attention to minor details in the environment
that most of us are unaware of,'' Aguirre said. ``They may notice a
particular doorknob on a building they've passed, or the number of
slats in a park bench. By focusing on these tiny features, they
manage to string together a path.''
</P>
<P>
   The patients were known to have lesions in an area of the lower
back portion of brain called the lingual gyrus. ``The general model
for this area of the brain is that it has a number of specialized
modules for recognizing different objects,'' Aguirre said. ``So you
can have agnosias where you can't recognize faces, or farmers with
damage here may have a sheep or cow agnosia.''
</P>
<P>
   Through neuro-imaging studies of normal people, Aguirre has
found that when subjects are presented with a series of pictures,
the right lingual gyrus fires most avidly in response to images of
buildings, and barely at all when viewing pictures of faces, tools
or cars.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are also studying the psychology of human
way-finding, the often illogical reasons why people decide to take
Route A to get to their destination, rather than Routes B or C.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of operations research and other math models have
assumed that people want to take the shortest path to where they
are going, and that the particular route they choose, and the
sequence of turns they make, will be tied in with the principle of
minimizing time and distance,'' said Dr. Reginald Golledge, a
professor of geography at the University of California at Santa
Barbara. ``Well, an increasing amount of research shows that people
don't act like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, people make their way-finding choices based on what
``feels'' right. For example, people like to head off in the
direction of their destination. If their endpoint is east, they
hate to start by going west, even when an initial jog westward may
deliver them to a more efficient route.
</P>
<P>
   Another preferred strategy is called ``longest leg first.'' When
conceptualizing a route, Golledge said, ``people try to start off
going the longest and straightest distance possible before making
the first turn.''

<P>
   Choices can also be idiosyncratic. Many drivers seek out roads
with the fewest stop signs and traffic lights, no matter how
circuitous the route. Drivers like me will always take the most
familiar course, and if that road is closed off, will go home and
call a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows yet why people make the navigational choices they
do. Nor do they know why some people never get lost, while others
always need to get found.
</P>
<P>
   One creature that never goes astray is the bobolink, a member of
the blackbird family that carries out the longest migratory journey
of any songbird in the world. Bobolinks breed as far north as upper
New York state and Canada, and then migrate as far south as the
southern pampas of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``These birds travel 10,000 miles a year,'' said Dr. Robert C.
Beason, a professor of biology at the State University of New York
in Geneseo. ``But I catch banded birds year after year in the same
location.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally impressive is the honeybee, which navigates chiefly and
almost unerringly by the sun. It does this by its detailed grasp of
the so-called solar ephemeris, the geographic position of sun as a
function of time of day. After just a few hours of flying around in
the sunshine, a bee has mastered the local solar arc. It then maps
that geographic information onto its surroundings, a transfer that
allows it to find its way around even on a cloudy day, and to tell
its comrades, by waggling and dancing, how to locate a sweet patch
of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet good as the great migrators may be, it turns out that they
are not very different from people. ``The most interesting thing
about animal navigation is that it appears to be done in ways
similar to the principles taught in marine navigation classes,''
said Randy Gallistel, a professor of psychology at the University
of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There are two fundamental ways of navigating, he explained. One
is called path integration, which most people know of as dead
reckoning, a corruption of the term ``ded. reckoning,'' for deduced
reckoning. In this method, you estimate your direction and speed,
and use that to calculate how far you have gone. ``If you keep a
scrupulous account of what direction you're going in, you can keep
adding it up as you go, so you're reckoning, or calculating, your
position in this way,'' Gallistel said. ``This method of navigating
doesn't require anything out there you recognize, which is why you
can use it in the open ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   The other method of navigation is piloting, relying on landmarks
or maps of known objects to locate yourself in space.
</P>
<P>
   How a given traveler reckons its course, or which landmarks it
pilots by, varies from species to species and moment to moment.
Animals can navigate by the position of the sun and stars, by the
polarization of light, by smell, by echo-location. Some can use the
earth's magnetic fields to direct them, and others attend to
currents in the air or water. Researchers have learned that the key
to migrational brilliance is versatility, the power to exploit
different environmental cues depending on which is the richest in
directional information at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   Homing pigeons, for example, have the capacity to detect the
earth's magnetic field and respond to it, through specialized
receptors in the front of their brains, between their eyes and
nasal organs. But in regions that are magnetically flat, Beason
said, the pigeons pay greater heed to the sun, or to chemical cues,
to get home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to disrupt them,'' Gallistel said. ``Even if
you put Ping-Pong balls over their eyes, they get home again.''
Some evidence suggests that pigeons can be disrupted on their
course by extreme magnetic storms, disturbances in the atmosphere
caused by solar flares.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbyists race homing pigeons across North America, Beason said,
and those years when there is a poor return rate of the birds are
correlated with strong magnetic storms. Alternatively, the birds
may have found a more appealing park or gutter en route. ``The
pigeons you see on the street,'' Beason said, ``are homing pigeons
that didn't make it back home.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all animals are so savvy. Rodents, for example, can be
surprisingly limited in their ability to way-find. Through a famous
series of experiments, Gallistel and his colleagues discovered that
rodents, when introduced into a box and presented with a food
reward in one corner, use the shape of the box, and only the shape,
to relocate the cache later. If the wall near the food is painted a
different color than the other three, or similar visual cues are
provided, the rodent ignores them and depends on geometry alone.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Dr. Elizabeth Spelke, a professor of cognitive science
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and her
colleague Dr. Linda Hermer-Vasquez, discovered that toddlers are
like rats: They, too, use the shape of the environment to find
their way and disregard distinctive surface features. The
researchers studied children 18 months to 2 years old, placing them
in a rectangular room with three white walls and one a striking
shade of blue or red. They showed the toddlers a toy hidden in one
corner, near the colorful wall. Covering the children's eyes and
slowly turning them around a couple of times to disorient them, the
researchers then told the toddlers to look for the toy. The
toddlers ignored the brightness of the wall where the toy was
hidden, and used their sense of the room's shape in their searching
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   By the time children reach the age of 5 or 6, though, Dr. Spelke
said, they are quite capable of using color and other landmarks to
find their way. ``This is also the time when we see them start to
use spatial language to describe the environment, saying things
like `It's near the blue wall,' or, `It's on the left.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Spelke proposes that people's ability to use landmarks in
way-finding is intimately correlated with language skills. She and
Dr. Hermer-Vasquez experimented with adults, asking them to
relocate an object that had been hidden in a room, all the while
subjecting the adults to verbal interference tasks known to occupy
the brain's language processor. ``We turned the adults back into
toddlers,'' Dr. Spelke said. ``They continued to be sensitive to
the shape of the environment but were no longer using visual
landmarks to re-orient themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   With language skills, we have become superlative way-finders of
another sort, able to draw maps and atlases, lay out cities with a
grid pattern and numbered buildings, design subway lines, invent
chronometers and radar, and, most important, stop and ask for
directions.

peace in the burned and bloodied towns around them. A couple weeks
ago, the monastery was refuge to about 150 ethnic Albanians fleeing

the funds are spent over the next five years. Clinton's bill would

   VETOED-BILLS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush and his staff
worked into the wee hours Monday to finish up work on the 1,600
bills the Legislature passed this year. He cut $51 million in
spending from the state budget, vetoed 29 bills, let several become
law without his signature and signed hundreds more. Among the
casualties: a bill allowing county commissions to appoint legal
counsel for indigent defendants. Among the successes: a law that
could take some of the sting out of the Hopwood court ruling. It
allows Texas universities to match scholarships offered by other

Gov. George W. Bush got what he wanted from the 1999 Legislature.
But few people even knew First Lady Laura Bush also had a

Laura Bush quietly worked for passage of a bill creating special
Head Start programs for reading. Are these the beginnings of her
own White House career? (Brooks, Austin American-Statesman)

   BISON-TURNER _ Ted turner is merging the marketing arm of his
bison operations with that of a national industry coop in the
Dakotas. He is not leaving the business and will continue to raise
bison. His herd now numbers 15,000 head. (Atlanta

   FLA-SMOKE _ Closing arguments in the Florida class action
lawsuit against the tobacco industry may come this week. The
marathon trial began last summer, with Miami attorney Stanley
Rosenblatt trying to stick the industry with billions in payments
to every sick smoker who has ever lived in Florida. Rosenblatt won
a partial victory last year in a precedent-setting second-hand
smoke trial in which airline flight attendants argued that
smoke-filled planes made them sick. This trial has the potential
for billions in damages, and is being closely watched. (Williams,

<P>
   TWISTER-CHASERS _ The boiling black and gray clouds have a
sinister spin as they slide east, hanging low over the lonesome
west Texas outback. Surface winds from the south feed the storm,
kicking up dust as they rush to the dark belly. A khaki-colored
column of dust rises toward the cloud, slowly at first, then with a
great rush as if being sucked up with a celestial Shop-Vac. ``This
is it,'' shouts an excited Matt Crowther. ``This is it. A tornado
is imminent.'' Each May, Crowther and his wife take time off from
their jobs as meorologists at the metro Atlanta-based Weather
Channel to chase storms. (Williams, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those long lines at U.S. airports are not just on the runways.
As the number of airline passengers swells _ to 614 million last
year, up from 488 million in 1993 _ and airports remain the same
size, waiting in line has become a frustrating experience. The
airlines, hearing growing complaints and eager to cut costs, have
begun adopting new techniques to speed people on their way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines and Alaska Airlines have kiosks with
computer screens where passengers, using credit cards for
identification, can check themselves in, answer security questions
about who packed their luggage and whether it has been under their
control at all times, and obtain boarding passes.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alaska also has ticketing agents who roam terminals with
portable computers that can print out boarding passes the way
rental-car agents can issue receipts from hand-held computers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are also upgrading their computer systems, which will
reduce the time it takes to issue tickets and boarding passes. TWA
recently installed touch-screen computers, like those at ATM
machines, that allow agents to issue boarding passes faster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continental is installing new software for ticketing and gate
agents because ``the computer software that drives reservations and
transaction process at the airport is 20 years old, if not 25,''
said Dave Messing, a Continental spokesman. Continental's new
system replaces lots of typing with point-and-click technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Penny Thomas, United's manager of in-airport service planning,
said: ``The most basic rule to reduce time in line is to arrive at
the airport in travel-ready condition. That means you do not need
to see anyone, to buy a ticket or to change a seat assignment. It
means your only requirement is to get a boarding pass.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other strategies to reduce waiting time, some from
airlines officials, some from veteran travelers: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Curbside baggage check-in. A skycap can tag your bags and
they'll be gone in a matter of seconds, allowing you to go straight
to the boarding gate, Miss Thomas said. At some airports
Continental's kiosks are at curbside, so besides obtaining a
boarding pass you can check your bags, which a skycap will then
take. Expect to tip at least $1 a bag for this convenience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Ticket counters. If you do go to a ticket counter, study the
way the lines are arranged, said Carolyn Fennell, a spokes-woman
for Orlando International Airport. Often ticketed passengers have a
separate line where only boarding passes are issued, and that line
usually moves quickly. Passengers in frequent-flier programs often
have a separate line, which is usually shorter and faster. And if
you have upgrade coupons for first class, get in the line for first
class passengers even if you expect to be told that no seats are
available. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Security gates. Standing and waiting to have yourself and your
luggage screened can be especially frustrating as people unfamiliar
with the process fumble with their gear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Orlando, where long lines are frequent because of families
with children on vacation, Ms. Fennell recommends looking for gates
to the left when approaching lines of people at security
checkpoints, since Americans tend to line up to the right. ``So
look to the left. Maybe it is less crowded.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many airports have more than one security checkpoint, and
knowing the secondary site can save time. The Delta-Northwest
terminal at La Guardia Airport, for example, has its main security
checkpoint on the right side of a gift shop. But a secondary site
on the other side of the gift shop is often open with no waiting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you have no carry-ons, look for a metal detector beyond
the X-ray machines. If there is one, then ignore the lines and go
straight for that detector, Ms. Fennell said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boarding gates. If your boarding gate has a long line you may
be able to get your boarding pass from another gate, or head for
the customer-services desk that airlines usually have in each
terminal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At San Francisco International Airport, United Airlines has two
mobile re-accommodation desks that it can push to a gate to rebook
passengers when a flight has been canceled. Joe Hopkins, a United
spokesman, said the desks will be installed at 49 other airports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If your flight is canceled and no extra desk is opened to rebook
passengers, consider going to a telephone and having a reservations
agent rebook you, Hopkins said. While you will still have to stand
in line to get a boarding pass, getting rebooked immediately cuts
the chances that you will end up squeezed into a middle seat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Airport clubs. The most expensive, but most effective, way to
shorten waits is to join one or more airline clubs. Members can get
boarding passes in the clubs. When flights are canceled, heading to
the airport club is often the fastest way to get booked onto
another flight. Clubs cost from $200 annually for TWA to $400 for
United, with spouse memberships available at a discount, or you can
pay with frequent-flier miles.

   Giant Western Murals: Tall in the Saddle
</P>
<P>
   When the bucking broncos leap from their stalls at the Fourth of
July Rodeo in Toppenish, Wash., the spirit of the event will be
echoed by the mounted cowhand in the 16-by-20-foot mural on the
other side of town. In this town of 7,500 in the Yakima Valley, two
and half hours east of Seattle, nearly 60 huge murals on the sides
of buildings record the history of the rodeo and the West.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roger McCarthy, a local artist, had the idea for the murals in
1989 as a revitalization project after a number of agricultural
businesses closed. Along with Joseph C. Murphy, a lawyer and
friend, he raised nearly half a million dollars from local citizens
to commission various Western artists, including Fred Oldfield and
Mavis Willson, to paint murals based on local events. Each summer
several new murals are added to the town's collection, which totals
57. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The viewer can view the murals in a horse-drawn wagon or stroll
around town to savor details, like the snap of the crisp white
tablecloth in the wind in Ju-hong Chen's ``Old Lillie Mansion'' or
the eye of a lead steer in Don Gray's ``Cattle Drive.'' The town's
latest mural _ as yet unnamed, and completed in one day this month
by a team of 12 artists _ depicts an early service station. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rodeo runs all day and all evening from Thursday to Sunday.
Tickets are $10, $5 for ages 5 to 12, under 4 free. Information:
(800) 569-3982. Call the Toppenish Mural Society, (800) 569-3982,
for information on the wagon tours, which cost $10, seniors $8,
children $3.

<P>
   Two Airlines Seek Timelier Passengers
</P>
<P>
   Passengers on United Airlines and US Airways flights who are
running late to the airport will have to run a bit faster to make
their flights under new policies designed to have more planes
arrive at their destinations on time. Both airlines are trying to
close plane doors five minutes before the scheduled departure
time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to improve on-time performance and also to reduce
the hassle in the boarding process,'' said Joe Hopkins, a United
spokesman. ``If you get the plane out on time, it is going to
arrive on time, which all our market research says is very
important to customers. And why penalize the 179 people already on
for one person?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under United's Time to Go policy, all ticketed passengers should
be seated 10 minutes before the scheduled departure time, giving
gate agents five minutes to board standby passengers and handle
standby upgrades to first class. Each airline sets its own rules on
when passengers with reservations can lose their seats. At United,
reservations are subject to cancellation 20 minutes before
departure, Hopkins said. The US Airways deadline is 10 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   US Airways adopted the new rules on June 15, copying a policy
United Airlines began in April.
</P>
<P>
   A Eurailpass Gift For the Big Four-O
</P>
<P>
   Users of Eurailpasses who turn 40 in 1999, the 40th anniversary
of the first Eurailpass, will receive a 40 percent discount on
train fares. The passes are offered by the national rail systems in
17 European countries, and are good for travel in all 17. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The basic Eurailpass is good for unlimited first-class travel
for periods ranging from 15 consecutive days to 3 months. Other
versions of the Eurailpass, including Eurail Flexipass, Eurail
Saverpass and Eurail Saver Flexipass, also qualify for the
40th-anniversary discount. They have varying time periods and
conditions. The Europass, a more restricted type of Eurailpass,
allows unlimited travel in five countries _ France, Germany, Italy,
Spain and Switzerland _ to which up to four other countries may be
added. The 40-percent anniversary discount does not apply to the
Europass, however.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Users of both Eurailpasses and Europasses will once again have a
grace period of up to six months _ not three months, as was the
case earlier this year _ before having to start their first trip.

COURT UPHOLDS DEATH SENTENCE OF TEXAS MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the death
sentence of a Texas killer, dismissing his complaint that jurors in
his case were so confused by the judge's instructions that they
mistakenly sentenced him to death.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the court agreed that Louis Jones Jr. should
be executed for the kidnapping and murder of Air Force Pvt. Tracie
Joy McBride.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the
instructions incorrectly,'' Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision helped clarify the federal law that was used to
convict Jones. So far, 20 death row inmates have been sentenced
under the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the court ruled for Jones, it would have opened the door
to flood of appeals from those 20 inmates,'' said Kent S.
Scheidegger, lawyer for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a
Los Angeles-based conservative group.
</P>
<P>
   But David Bruck, a lawyer for the Death Penalty Resources
Council, a Columbia, S.C.-based anti-death penalty organization,
said the court's decision could leave jurors confused on what their
choices are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in any case jurors should completely understand what
their decisions mean,'' Bruck said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a U.S. District Court jury in Lubbock, Texas, found
Jones, 45, guilty of kidnapping McBride, 19, from a laundry room on
the Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, beating her on the
head with a tire iron and leaving her dead body under a bridge on
the night of Feb. 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Jones' ex-wife, who had been seeing him since
their divorce and who reportedly bore a strong resemblance to
McBride, had made a final break with him.
</P>
<P>
   After finding him guilty, the jury was asked to recommend
whether Jones, an Air Force veteran who was working at Goodfellow
as a civilian employee, should be sentenced to death or life in
prison without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors were told that if they could not reach a unanimous
decision on either sentence, ``the court shall impose any lesser
sentence that is authorized by law.''
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for nearly two weeks, the jury sentenced
Jones to death.
</P>
<P>
   Jones appealed the case, arguing that it was possible that some
of the jurors who favored life in prison without parole feared that
unless the jury reached a unanimous decision, Jones would receive a
lesser sentence, such as life in prison with the possibility of
parole. Because of this fear, these jurors opted for the death
penalty, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones contended that the jury should have been told that in this
case, there was no lesser penalty than life in prison without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Jones'
argument, saying that the judge's failure to make it clear that
parole was not an option had no legal effect on the jury's
recommendation for death. In its decision, the appeals court gave
little weight to affidavits from two jurors saying they would have
spared Jones' life had the judge said life in prison without parole
was the only alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing before the Supreme Court in February, Jones' lawyer,
Timothy Crooks, a federal public defender in Fort Worth, Texas, had
urged the justices to give his client a new sentencing trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these instructions, jurors who don't want the death
penalty will believe that if they don't cave in, the defendant
might get off with a lighter sentence that he didn't deserve,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Supreme Court affirmed the appeals court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even assuming that the jurors were confused over the
consequences of deadlock, petitioner cannot show the confusion
necessarily worked to his detriment,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It is just as likely that the jurors, loathe to
recommend a lesser sentence, would have compromised on a sentence
of life imprisonment as on a death sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, which
was joined by justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter and Stephen
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jurors may have been persuaded to switch from life to death to
ward off what no juror wanted, i.e., any chance of a lesser
sentence by the judge,'' Ginsburg said.

PANEL CALLS FOR STUDY OF SOME IMPLANT RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Calif.)  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of an expert committee of scientists that
assessed the safety of silicone breast implants formally issued
their report Monday, calling for more research on risks of rupture
and other local complications that can arise from the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no scientific evidence pointing to silicone
implants as the cause of major diseases, the scientists said, women
who have breast implants, whether they are filled with silicone or
salt water, have the right to know what the chances are that the
devices will slip or deflate or lead to infections or scarring.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was established by the Institute of Medicine, part
of the National Academy of Sciences, in response to a request by
Congress in 1997. Its members had no connection to companies that
manufacture implants or to lawyers representing women suing the
companies and had taken no prior positions on the safety of
silicone breast implants, said Dr. Kenneth Shine, the president of
the Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing thousands of papers and documents submitted by
scientists, implant makers and groups representing women who had
implants, the group reached a unanimous consensus: The primary
safety concern with implants is their tendency to cause local
complications like infections, pain and scarring and the
possibility that women might have to have second or even subsequent
operations as a consequence.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Dr. Stuart Bondurant, a professor of
medicine at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, said
the group heard women tell them in testimony and letters that they
had not known that their implants could cause local problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the notable things they told us is that they were told
the implants would last a lifetime,'' Bondurant said. While
emphasizing that that is the women's recollection, he noted that
there were never any data to support such an assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Virginia Ernster, a professor of epidemiology at the
University of California at San Francisco, said that the best she
could do in assessing the published data on the complications of
implants was to come up with a range of risks.
</P>
<P>
   Women who had implants to augment their breasts had about a 24
percent chance of needing to go back to the operating room in three
to five years to repair problems or complications with implants,
Dr. Ernster said. Those who had implants after a mastectomy had a
23 to 40 percent chance of needing a second operation in three to
five years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, most women who had implants have received
devices filled with saline _ salt water _ rather than silicone,
Bondurant said. Preliminary studies suggest that these devices have
fewer complications, with just a 1 percent to 3 percent chance of
deflation per year, he said, but more research is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sybil Goldrich, founder of Command Trust Network, an information
clearinghouse for women with silicone problems, said in a telephone
interview that rupture was ``not a trivial problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Women whose implants rupture, she said, can ``end up with a
lifetime of medical bills that can be staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee urged that women who have implants be tracked so
investigators can get reliable data on the incidence of medical
complications like rupture, scarring and infection. Such
information ``is an essential part of the informed consent
process,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee was insistent about what it described as its
``very firm conclusions'' on the diseases that some women and
doctors have said were caused by implants _ a list that includes
cancer, connective tissue diseases like arthritis and lupus,
neurological problems, a new disease characterized by symptoms like
fatigue and muscle aches, and pains and diseases in the children of
women with implants. These were the diseases at the heart of the
multibillion-dollar product liability litigation over breast
implants.
</P>
<P>
   Bondurant said that the group concluded that ``women with
implants are no more likely than other women to develop these
systemic illnesses.'' More than 60 women with implants testified
before the committee in a public hearing and hundreds more wrote
letters telling of the severe medical problems they had suffered
since having their implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very moved by the testimony we heard,'' Dr. Ernster
said. ``But it does not appear that the implants were the cause of
the systemic illnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if another group of equally qualified and objective
scientists could look at the same data and come to a different
conclusion, Bondurant said, ``No, I can't imagine that.''

TV REVIEW: WHEN A QUICK FIX BECOMES A LONGER-TERM PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass., Kan., Ga.)  (nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most parents and many doctors, antibiotics are a quick fix
for the colds, fevers and assorted ailments of childhood. As the
contributors to ``Epidemic,'' Tuesday night's ``Fred Friendly
Seminar,'' caution, worried parents and busy doctors are
co-conspirators in the development of drug-resistant bacteria that
threaten health around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert C. Moellering, an infectious-diseases specialist at
Harvard Medical School and the Beth Israel Medical Center, tells
how formerly ``first-line drugs'' like penicillin and ampicillin,
have lost effectiveness and some diseases are resistant to any drug
at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation that pops around from affluent America to
disease-stricken East Africa, where as one doctor says, ``hospitals
are running on Band-Aids,'' public health experts agree on the need
for a comprehensive approach to the appearance of frightening
symptoms like those connected with the Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Arthur R. Miller of the Harvard
University Law School, who tends to get a touch cute about dire
matters (a reporter is named Manfred Muckraker), the panelists get
into the problems of keeping reporters and politicians from
spreading pandemonium while researchers try to figure out what is
happening. Dr. Joshua Lederberg, an expert on bacterial genetics,
has compliments for the way journalists generally handle the
subject of antibiotic resistance, but warns that under deadline
pressures they have trouble dealing with potentially catastrophic
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the panelists have much of interest to contribute. Nancy
Kassebaum Baker, former senator of Kansas, comes out in favor of
bigger appropriations for health, and Dr. John D. Siegfried, who is
affiliated with the pharmaceutical industry, puts in a plug for
``an active and functioning pharmaceutical industry working in
conjunction with the federal government and academic researchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Moellering acknowledges the drug successes but expresses concern
over the financial incentive to bring new drugs onto the market:
``They have to cover their costs.'' (The program is sponsored by
Bristol-Myers Squibb.)
</P>
<P>
   The hour ends with a brisk exchange about the pressures on
public health specialists to deal with potential epidemics without
adding to panic among parents and elected officials, who, as Bill
Campbell, the mayor of Atlanta, notes, have to worry about legal
challenges no matter what they do, especially when children are at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. David A. Kessler, former commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration, warns that ``the riskiest thing we can do'' is
not to take any risks at all.

NOT FAR FROM THE ROSE GARDEN, ANOTHER MUSEUM FOR GEHRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Corcoran Gallery of Art has selected Frank O. Gehry as the
winner of a competition to design a new wing for its historic
Beaux-Arts building one block west of the White House. The addition
would nearly double the space that houses the museum and the
Corcoran School of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran Gallery officials expect the expansion to cost about
$40 million, half of which already has been raised. David Levy, the
president and director of the privately financed museum, hopes
construction will begin by spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry, who received this year's American Institute of Architects
Gold Medal, was chosen by the Corcoran from among two other
finalists, the architects Daniel Libeskind of Berlin and Santiago
Calatrava, a Spaniard. Gehry's design for the 140,000-square-foot
expansion, which includes renovation of the older building, will
not be published.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry was reached by cellular telephone in Prague, Czech
Republic, on the roof of the office tower he designed there,
popularly known as the Fred and Ginger Building. Of the design he
plans for the Corcoran, he said, ``I hope to take it to the moon,
try something else, go somewhere new.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy said it was Gehry's way of thinking rather than a
particular design that won him the commission. ``Frank's design is
responsive first of all to a very subtle, intelligent understanding
of the needs of the institution,'' he said. ``And then the exterior
of his addition is a logical extension of that thinking, not just a
piece of sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Corcoran's selection process differed from other
high-profile competitions, like the one completed in December 1997
by the Museum of Modern Art, because the selection committee's goal
was to choose an architect rather than a design.
</P>
<P>
   At 130, the Corcoran is the oldest art museum in the capital,
and its current building was designed in 1897 by Ernest Flagg, with
an addition by Charles Platt in 1928. Its collection of 19th- and
early 20th-century American art includes works by Albert Bierstadt,
Frederic E. Church and John Singer Sargent. An earlier plan to
defray operating and exhibition costs by developing an office
building on part of the Corcoran Gallery's site was derailed in
1990 because it was seen as too commercial. The approach was
similar to the Museum of Modern Art's selling its air rights for
construction of the Museum Tower condominium next door.
</P>
<P>
   Levy has been president since 1991. Over the last decade he has
bolstered the museum's reputation, which was battered by its
cancellation in 1989 of an exhibition of controversial photographs
by Robert Mapplethorpe in response to pressure from conservative
members of Congress. Since then he has increased the endowment to
$29 million from $8 million and broadened the museum's appeal with
exhibitions like a 1997 show of photographs by Gordon Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Levy has envisioned a building that would include new spaces for
the College of Art, new administrative offices, restored and
expanded galleries and a new conservation laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting an architect was not simple. Gehry is still taking
bows for his design of the titanium-clad Guggenheim Museum in
Bilbao, Spain, with its explosive sculptural forms. He might easily
be considered the most famous museum designer today. Yet the
Corcoran chose the architect, who is based in Los Angeles, only
after a methodical process lasting more than a year. Initially more
than 200 architects were considered, a number whittled down to 60
who were invited to submit their qualifications. In October that
list was reduced to 10.
</P>
<P>
   In January, three finalists were asked to compete: Libeskind,
whose Jewish Museum in Berlin has become something of an
architectural pilgrimage; Calatrava, who is completing his first
American commission, the Milwaukee Art Museum, and Gehry, who no
longer enters competitions, according to his office manager, except
when intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists' designs were intended only as the starting point
to a collaboration with the Corcoran's staff members and advisers.
Levy said he decided to publish neither the contenders' nor the
winner's submissions to avoid giving an impression that the
institution was committed to a specific plan.
</P>
<P>
   The decision may have disappointed those curious to see whether
Washington would be getting its own Bilbao on the Potomac. (Or
rather Bilbao off the Rose Garden; Levy's office is on axis with
the garden.) Submissions circulated within the Corcoran showed that
Gehry's plan incorporated wavy strips of metal seeming to flap with
sculptural gusto, akin to his design in Bilbao.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the confines of the triangular lot and the museum's
needs, the addition is both taller and deeper than the original
structure, with four levels of underground parking and a large
rooftop terrace for the donors' dining doom and a children's
museum. Neither garage nor rooftop additions will be visible from
the classically placid facade, which Frank Lloyd Wright said was
one of his favorites in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Considered among the most significant architects of the
late-20th century, Gehry, at 70, can be selective about the
projects he pursues. The work in his office includes a concert band
shell and pedestrian bridge for Millennium Park in Chicago, two
rehabilitation centers for hospitals in Britain and a complex for
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry said of the Corcoran design competition, ``I've been
through this a few times, and it was tough, certainly no
cakewalk.''

DYLAN, SIMON AREN'T FINISHED YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Watching Bob Dylan bound around the stage at the
Anaheim Pond on Sunday brings to mind a black-and-white picture of
him in ``Rolling Stone: Images of Rock &AMP; Roll.'' It shows a
youthful Dylan flying through the air. Dressed in jeans and a
short-sleeve pullover shirt, the legendary singer/songwriter has a
wispy beard and relatively short hair. His arms are spread wide,
his feet bare. His legs are bent, and only the sky and treetops are
visible in the background.
</P>
<P>
   As he was on Sunday, he is completely in the moment. So there we
have it, a record of the man once called ``the voice of his
generation'' defying gravity, free of expectations and free of the
weighty seriousness that many of his fans and critics have hung on
him during his nearly four-decade odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book's notes, the picture was taken in
Woodstock, N.Y., around 1970 by Elliot Landy, a friend who had been
invited over to help Dylan put together a trampoline, and Dylan,
like most of us would, enjoyed playing on it.
</P>
<P>
   The image brings to mind the words of a song: ``There is a girl
in New York City who calls herself the human trampoline. And
sometimes when I'm falling, flying or tumbling in turmoil, I say,
`Oh, so this is what she means. She means we're bouncing into
Graceland.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was not written by Dylan, of course, but by his current tour
mate, Paul Simon, another icon from the '60s. It is an apt
description of the pair's careers, which in their own ways have
been bouncing erratically toward Graceland, if, in this case, you
think of Elvis' former residence as some sort of pop-culture
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that the pair keeps popping up in
disconcerting ways (Dylan with his Grammy-winning ``Time Out of
Mind'' album last year, Simon with his Broadway failure,
``Capeman''). They are as much in the present as they are in the
past So unlike, say, Presley or Frank Sinatra _ neither of whom
were songwriters and whose artistic careers were limited to mostly
to being pop icons, and so essentially they were always seen
through that prism _ fixing Dylan and Simon's positions in the
entertainment firmament becomes tricky.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear watching them Sunday that neither of them is going
to make it easy. Before a crowd that ranged from those in their 20s
to graying middle-agers, a relaxed, playful Dylan performed a set
that was both crowd pleasing and, at times, unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a four-piece band, Dylan opened with a rousing
bluegrass piece and then moved to one of his best-known numbers,
``Mr. Tambourine Man.'' Like many of his most-famous tunes he
played Sunday night _ ``It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,'' ``Masters
of War'' _ Dylan had transformed the song so it was hardly
recognizable at first, but after a while this new ``Tambourine
Man'' had a life of its own. It was as if Dylan was saying, ``I'm
not yet finished with these songs.''
</P>
<P>
   By revising them, he has done what he has done throughout his
career _ challenge his audience's expectations. But more
surprising, he has added an element of showmanship and fun to his
performance. The man on stage Sunday mugged for the audience as he
played lead guitar and prowled the stage. His voice may be little
more than a growl at times, but he was a much more animated and
affable Dylan than the one who played last year at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   If Dylan is saying there is still something new to be found in
his songs, he is also saying it about himself. Dylan rocked out
with his final three numbers _ ``Highway 61,'' ``Like a Rolling
Stone'' and, perhaps most telling, a raucous version of the Buddy
Holly classic ``Not Fade Away.'' Holly had been an idol, so when
Dylan went electric, he wasn't abandoning folk music but following
a dream. Unlike Holly, though, Dylan didn't die young nor has he
faded away. He's just still following his dream, as if being older
has given him the freedom to do so. Ironically, it has given him a
youthful appearance, and, as one young member of the audience
remarked, ``He's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a marked contrast in styles when Dylan brought out
Simon _ and not just in the clothing. (Dylan was dressed in a
Holly-style black suit with a stripe down the side, and Simon was
in a workmanlike gray T-shirt, jeans and Yankees baseball cap.)
While Dylan has mined the folk, blues, rock and country genres,
Simon has expanded into world music, with Latin and African
influences. So they chose four songs in the folk-rock-country vein
to sing together _ ``The Sounds of Silence,'' ``I Walk the Line''
(a nod to Johnny Cash), ``Blue Moon of Kentucky'' (a nod to Elvis)
and ``Knockin' on Heaven's Door.'' Though even the most tone-deaf
couldn't mistake Dylan's voice for that of Simon's former partner,
Art Garfunkel, the duo did a fairly moving version of ``Silence.''
Dylan was much more comfortable on the other numbers.
</P>
<P>
   When Simon returned after an intermission, he launched into a
spacey, jazzy rendition of ``Bridge Over Troubled Waters.'' Backed
by a band that at times numbered 11, including three drummers,
Simon then did ``Can't Run But,'' the first of four songs from his
1990 ``Rhythm of the Saints'' album, which was seen as somewhat
disappointing after ``Graceland.'' It was interesting that Simon
chose to do them, as well as a song from ``Capeman,'' which Simon
made a point of saying was ``really good.'' He certainly has plenty
of hits to pick from, but he clearly wanted to keep pushing to more
difficult, less familiar songs because that's what he's interested
in. More importantly, songs such as ``The Coast,'' ``Further to
Fly'' and ``Cool, Cool River'' sounded vibrant, especially with
Simon's stellar backup band, which included drummer Steve Gadd.
</P>
<P>
   And, like Dylan, Simon was animated and playing to the audience,
enjoying himself as he waved his arms, acting out his songs on such
up-tempo tunes as ``Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard,'' ``The
Boy in the Bubble,'' ``Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes'' and
``You Can Call Me Al.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simon saved his most telling song for the end of his first
encore _ ``Still Crazy After All These Years,'' which he sang sans
guitar as he exhorted the audience to join in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy''? ``Not Fade Away''? If Dylan and Simon are
making a statement about themselves, they are also offering some
advice to their middle-age fans. They're showing they can change
and not rest on their laurels, going from icons to entertainers
without sacrificing who they are.
</P>
<P>
   There is some weird irony that the two poet-songwriters who
captured and helped propel the changes of the '60s in their music
are heading later this week to perform at the MGM Grand in Las
Vegas, a place where Elvis and Frank would feel at home. Few back
then, though, could have conceived of Dylan and Simon in the
playground of the Rat Pack.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one lesson to be learned from them, it's that
expectations are to be defied. As Dylan said, ``I was so much older
then, I'm younger than that now.'' &QL;

<P>
   Carole Danforth's asthma had gotten the best of her. No longer
did she have the energy for activities she loved, like playing with
her grandchildren or doing yardwork. Some days, her breathing was
so labored she could not get up from the couch. And there seemed
little she could do about it: Ms. Danforth, a 51-year-old
housecleaner in Taunton, Mass., had no insurance and little money
for doctors or the inhalers she needed when her condition was at
its worst.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years ago, her life changed. Friends told her about a
local doctor who was offering free examinations and drugs as part
of a study of an experimental asthma medication.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, Michael Lawrence, was soon providing Ms. Danforth
with free diagnostic tests _ including a chest X-ray she could
never have afforded _ to determine if she was eligible. Ms.
Danforth was accepted for the study and within days Lawrence gave
her a free, but unapproved, medication for asthma. Her breathing
returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Danforth had finally found her access to health care _
albeit one where a medicine she finds effective lasts only as long
as the study. As a result, she has become one of a growing number
of drug-trial nomads, wandering from study to study as they become
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't keep track of them all,'' Ms. Danforth said of the
drug studies in which she has participated. ``But I haven't felt
this good in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the need for test subjects in experimental drug
trials has exploded as the industry has brought to market an
ever-increasing number of new products. In response, drug companies
have developed new methods of finding patients for the trials by
turning to private-practice doctors who recruit from their lists of
patients. But even that influx of participants has not been enough
to satisfy the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Filling the gap, according to industry officials and
researchers, are people like Ms. Danforth: chronically ill patients
with limited or no health insurance. For these people, experiments
have become treatments; clinical investigators are their
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts recognize the shortcomings of this system. On
the one hand, the doctors are white knights, providing a critical
service that such patients cannot obtain any other way. Patients
``are better off getting experimental therapy than no therapy at
all,'' said Paul Menzel, a philosophy professor at Pacific Lutheran
University in Tacoma, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefit can be fleeting or nonexistent. Chronically ill
patients with no other options can be treated with an experimental
medication that does not work or that even worsens their condition.
Or they can end up with a placebo rather than the medication
itself. And once the study ends, usually after weeks, they are left
to their own devices. They can be barred by the rules of one
clinical trial from participating in another study for months,
forcing them to rely on samples of medications provided by drug
companies or to go without treatment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That leaves many patients in a sad position: Having tasted, for
a moment, how good life can be when their conditions are
controlled, they are plunged back into a life of disabling symptoms
as they count the days until they can enroll in a study again.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies are becoming like a stopgap'' with the private
doctors, said Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of the
psychopharmacology clinic at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center in New York City. ``And that's pretty bad, taking from them
what they need and then tossing them back.''
</P>
<P>
   That description underscores a hard fact of medical research:
The subjects of drug trials are not, technically speaking, being
treated for a disease. Rather, they are participating in an
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``One will often hear from physicians and economists that there
is always a way for them to get medical care, so this must be one
of the ways,'' said Norman Daniels, a professor of philosophy at
Tufts University who specializes in ethics and health policy. ``In
my view, it does not count as medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody keeps track of how many uninsured people seek health care
from clinical studies, but researchers agree that they number in
the thousands and that their ranks are growing. People with little
or no insurance are ``pretty much the name of the game,'' said Dr.
Benjamin Levy, director of Lovelace Science Resources Inc., a group
of doctors in New Mexico that conducts drug studies.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that researchers in areas with many poor people
often have the best chance of attracting research subjects.
``That's one of the reasons that we have been so successful,'' Dr.
Paul Chervinsky, medical director at New England Clinical Studies
in New Bedford, Mass., said. ``New Bedford has always been an
economically deprived area.''
</P>
<P>
   Even people with insurance plans that impose significant
restrictions _ like managed care programs that require pre-approval
to visit a specialist _ are circumventing the gatekeepers by
seeking out clinical trials, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of patients tell me that they feel frustrated with the
care that they receive from the HMO,'' said Dr. Norman Zinner, a
Los Angeles doctor who heads Affiliated Research Centers, an
organization of private-practice urologists who conduct drug
studies. ``They want to know if they might be eligible for a drug
study so that they could get relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the poor have long been participants in drug studies,
usually through university medical centers. But those institutions
often direct the patients to other university programs that provide
health care to the poor once the study is completed _ programs that
private doctors who normally see only paying patients have few
dealings with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities frequently have broader resources to assist
patients in finding appropriate follow-up care,'' said Dr. Suzanne
Oparil, who directs the high blood pressure program at the
University of Alabama in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for test subjects, the benefits are obvious. For many, a
clinical trial offers a rare opportunity for a full diagnostic
workup by a medical specialist. Better still, it can provide them,
at no charge, with the industry's latest methods of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arkansas is not a wealthy state, and most of the drug studies
that we do provide the patient with free medication,'' said Lin
Richardson, director of practice management at Baptist Health
Systems, which operates a network of private practices in Little
Rock that conduct drug studies involving a large number of
uninsured patients. ``It is amazing what I have seen happen for
some of our patients.''

COURT UPHOLDS DEATH SENTENCE OF TEXAS MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: CHANGES last word in lede from death to die and adds tagline
at the end of the story.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the death
sentence of a Texas killer, dismissing his complaint that jurors in
his case were so confused by the judge's instructions that they
mistakenly sentenced him to die.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the court agreed that Louis Jones Jr. should
be executed for the kidnapping and murder of Air Force Pvt. Tracie
Joy McBride.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the
instructions incorrectly,'' Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision helped clarify the federal law that was used to
convict Jones. So far, 20 death row inmates have been sentenced
under the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the court ruled for Jones, it would have opened the door
to flood of appeals from those 20 inmates,'' said Kent S.
Scheidegger, lawyer for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a
Los Angeles-based conservative group.
</P>
<P>
   But David Bruck, a lawyer for the Death Penalty Resources
Council, a Columbia, S.C.-based anti-death penalty organization,
said the court's decision could leave jurors confused on what their
choices are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in any case jurors should completely understand what
their decisions mean,'' Bruck said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a U.S. District Court jury in Lubbock, Texas, found
Jones, 45, guilty of kidnapping McBride, 19, from a laundry room on
the Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, beating her on the
head with a tire iron and leaving her dead body under a bridge on
the night of Feb. 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Jones' ex-wife, who had been seeing him since
their divorce and who reportedly bore a strong resemblance to
McBride, had made a final break with him.
</P>
<P>
   After finding him guilty, the jury was asked to recommend
whether Jones, an Air Force veteran who was working at Goodfellow
as a civilian employee, should be sentenced to death or life in
prison without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors were told that if they could not reach a unanimous
decision on either sentence, ``the court shall impose any lesser
sentence that is authorized by law.''
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for nearly two weeks, the jury sentenced
Jones to death.
</P>
<P>
   Jones appealed the case, arguing that it was possible that some
of the jurors who favored life in prison without parole feared that
unless the jury reached a unanimous decision, Jones would receive a
lesser sentence, such as life in prison with the possibility of
parole. Because of this fear, these jurors opted for the death
penalty, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones contended that the jury should have been told that in this
case, there was no lesser penalty than life in prison without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Jones'
argument, saying that the judge's failure to make it clear that
parole was not an option had no legal effect on the jury's
recommendation for death. In its decision, the appeals court gave
little weight to affidavits from two jurors saying they would have
spared Jones' life had the judge said life in prison without parole
was the only alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing before the Supreme Court in February, Jones' lawyer,
Timothy Crooks, a federal public defender in Fort Worth, Texas, had
urged the justices to give his client a new sentencing trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these instructions, jurors who don't want the death
penalty will believe that if they don't cave in, the defendant
might get off with a lighter sentence that he didn't deserve,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Supreme Court affirmed the appeals court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even assuming that the jurors were confused over the
consequences of deadlock, petitioner cannot show the confusion
necessarily worked to his detriment,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It is just as likely that the jurors, loathe to
recommend a lesser sentence, would have compromised on a sentence
of life imprisonment as on a death sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, which
was joined by justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter and Stephen
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jurors may have been persuaded to switch from life to death to
ward off what no juror wanted, i.e., any chance of a lesser
sentence by the judge,'' Ginsburg said.

<P>
   Ethical qualms arise from the fact that clinical trials are not
intended to be medical care. In this context, the doctors are
investigators, not personal physicians. The drugs are often
experimental, and no one knows whether they work. And because many
clinical trials compare an active drug with a placebo, the patients
often stand as good a chance of receiving a dummy pill as one that
is expected to work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials also raise a problem never experienced in true
patient care: Even if a test medication improves the health of a
chronically ill person, the drugs will no longer be supplied once
the study ends.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers and study coordinators are so bothered by this
sudden abandonment of test subjects that they do everything they
can to continue some form of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's a violation of human rights'' to keep patients
dangling untreated between studies, said Maria Lopez, a study
coordinator for Dr. Herbert Rubin, a gastroenterologist in Beverly
Hills, Calif. To deal with that, Rubin provides his uninsured test
subjects with drug company samples between tests, a practice that
Ms. Lopez said was frowned upon by the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug company representatives will be like: `Remember. You have
to give these to patients who will actually buy,''' Ms. Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers handle the problem by simply refusing to allow
the uninsured to use drug studies for medical care.

   ``It's not right that some people would give the patient the
false impression that they are getting full medical care when they
are not,'' said Dr. Thomas Littlejohn, who directs Piedmont Medical
Group in Winston-Salem, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the drug testing field, little attention has been paid
to this method used by the uninsured to gain access to doctors.
But, when informed of the trend, the reaction among medical
ethicists was split.

</P>
<P>
   Some ethicists expressed concern that vulnerable patients were
being coerced through the lure of medical care to put their bodies
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a further exploitation of the poor,'' John Paris,
an ethics professor at Boston College, said.
</P>
<P>
   But others were less certain about the ethical question, simply
because the trend presented new options for getting care to people
whose choices are limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nasty dilemma,'' Professor Menzel said. ``There is no
way you can win on this one.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Antonia Torres illustrates the dilemma perfectly. Ms. Torres
feared she would never get help for intestinal problems until she
saw an ad in La Opinion, a Spanish-language newspaper in Los
Angeles. The ad was placed by Rubin, the Beverly Hills
gastroenterologist, who was seeking patients for drug studies he
conducts out of his private office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got everything _ diarrhea, stomachache almost every day,''
Mrs. Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Torres, who is uninsured, had scraped together some cash to
see a doctor, but he wanted her to have an endoscopy to examine her
stomach. Since she could not afford the $350 she was told it would
cost, she went home and continued to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Torres arrived at Rubin's office on a recent drizzly
morning, the first thing he did was an endoscopy, at no cost to
her, to see if she qualified for his drug study.
</P>

<P>
   The paradoxes are not lost on patients. While most praise the
doctors who conduct the research, many also resent the compromises
they have to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health care they give you is really specific for what
they're testing for,'' said Elizabeth Elder, a 52-year-old
uninsured woman in Albuquerque, N.M., who has participated in a
number of studies, ``so it isn't really health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were simply grateful for whatever medical attention they
could get.
</P>
<P>
   When Victor Miranda saw Rubin's ad in La Opinion, he did not
even call ahead for an appointment. Instead, Miranda, a 37-year-old
house painter from Guatemala, hopped on a bus in the morning and
traveled an hour and a half to Rubin's office. He has had heartburn
and agonizing stomach pain for two years, he said through a
translator. He had not seen a doctor, unable to afford it, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Rubin, Miranda was enrolled in a test of
drugs made by Astra Pharmaceuticals to treat inflamed esophaguses.

   In Lemoyne, Ohio, Roland and Linda Gladieux were looking for
drug studies to get relief from a host of medical problems. They
could not afford insurance; the cheapest policy they could find
cost $500 a month with a $2,500 deductible and paid only 70 percent
of medical costs above that.
</P>
<P>
   Gladieux, a burly 51-year-old who manages a car-repair shop, has
a chronic wheezing cough. He had gone to a doctor who wanted to
test him for emphysema, but Gladieux declined, unable to afford the
tests. So when he saw an advertisement on television late last year
seeking people with chronic bronchitis, he jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was placed by Dr. John Winder, an asthma and allergy
specialist in Sylvania, Ohio, who does drug studies alongside his
private practice. The bronchitis study was already fully enrolled
when Gladieux called. But Winder's recruiters told him of studies
for other ailments. Learning that a heartburn study was opening,
Gladieux offered his wife, who has had severe heartburn for 20
years. She got into the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a godsend,'' Mrs. Gladieux said. The experimental
medication cleared up her heartburn and for the first time in years
she could eat foods like lasagna without suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Now the heartburn study is over and the Gladieuxes are looking
for other drug studies to join _ bronchitis for him, heartburn for
her. Or almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have arthritis real bad,'' Mrs. Gladieux said. She had seen
Winder for her last visit in the heartburn study and asked him to
keep her in mind. ``I told him if anything comes up, give me a
call,'' she said.

   The financial difficulties that lead patients to choose
experiments for their health care are not limited to people with
little or no insurance. Adriana Medina, a 24-year-old medical
assistant in Tucson, Ariz., has health insurance through a health
maintenance organization. The plan paid for her 8-year-old
daughter, Gabriela Garcia, to see a pediatrician for her asthma.
But when that failed to help, the plan would not pick up the cost
of a specialist.

 UNDATED: a specialist.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``She was on so many medications and she was constantly sucking
on the breathing machine,'' Ms. Medina said. ``It was just a roller
coaster ride. She was never well.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford the specialist, Ms. Medina enrolled Gabriela in
a drug study conducted by a local asthma expert, Dr. Jay Grossman.
``Just hearing that it was an asthma specialist I said, `Hey, what
do I have to lose?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental asthma drug changed Gabriela's life. The trial
``is allowing her to have a normal childhood,'' Ms. Medina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only worry,'' she added, ``is that the study will be over
and she'll be back where she started from.''
</P>
<P>
   The completion of a study can be a poignant moment, several
doctors said, especially when the subjects, like Gabriela Garcia,
finally received medical help that had eluded them. The subjects
have just spent weeks or months sitting in waiting rooms with
private patients, filling out the same forms and looking through
the same magazines as everyone else. Their diagnostic tests have
been conducted in the usual exam rooms, and they have received
drugs just like private patients. Then the study ends and the
subjects have to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had more medical care from me than they have had
from anybody for years,'' Winder said. ``It is hard for them to
understand that they are not my patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, if no new clinical trials are available to them,
that reality can leave patients feeling frightened and abandoned.
Josette Good, a 60-year-old widow, used to count on Winder to keep
her enrolled in study after study for asthma. But last year, she
moved to Lake Milton, Ohio, near her children but 200 miles from
Winder's office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, adequate health insurance is beyond her budget, and Winder
could not help her find a study in her area. She has only one
inhaler left, from the last study she participated in, so she uses
it sparingly, at times borrowing another from a friend. Hoping to
make her inhaler last through the summer, she limits her
activities, avoiding yardwork and even short walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so tough,'' Mrs. Good said. ``I pray nothing
happens.''

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To skeptics it is too big, too far, too speculative
and, coming at a time when sound stages are sitting empty across
Los Angeles, altogether too much: the kind of boom-era bubble
likely to pop as soon as it hits the first sharp object or
dissonant breeze.
</P>
<P>
   But like a particularly tangled Hollywood potboiler, the
proposal to build a mammoth movie-making complex at the Brooklyn
Navy Yard continues to lurch along, navigating a wall of worry
while it is propelled by a big-name steamroller.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not entirely clear whether the proposal backed by
Robert De Niro's TriBeCa Productions and Harvey Weinstein's Miramax
Films will go forward, and what it would mean for the other
sound-stage projects being proposed in New York. Potential lenders
are still studying the Navy Yard proposal, which was announced in
May and has commitments for less than half the $150 million in
financing it needs to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that there has never been more interest
in building movie studios in New York since the industry left for
California at the beginning of the century, and that the outsize
aspirations of the Navy Yard project parallel the growth of the
film business in the city over the last decade. Less clear is
whether that growth will continue and whether there is enough
business for the proposed projects.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, skeptics wonder if there would be enough
filmmaking for the 12 sound stages envisioned for the Navy Yard, if
people would travel to Brooklyn and if the current glut in Los
Angeles should be a warning for New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 20 years, there have been a lot of projects
announced, and most of them never happened, so until someone puts a
shovel in the ground, you can't be sure of anything,'' said Pat
Scott, commissioner of the city Office of Film, Theater and
Broadcasting. ``But we keep losing work because we can't supply the
facilities, and it's absurd to have the talent and the creativity
here and not have the right facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is some logic in developing some sort of studio project at
the Navy Yard, which was founded in 1801, saw employment peak at
71,000 in World War II and was shut down in 1966. The city
purchased the site between the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges
across from Manhattan's Lower East Side in 1970, and since then
employment _ in industries that include offices, ship repair and
manufacturing of products that range from housing to Sweet 'n Low
to shrouds _ has bounced around at a few thousand jobs. The number
has been creeping up in recent years, and the city has approved $40
million to upgrade the waterfront, buildings and electrical and
water systems on the site's 169 acres.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing in the hodgepodge of warehouses, offices and
industrial sites bears any resemblance to the ambitious plan to
build a movie-making complex on 15 acres that now stand largely
empty except for three hulking structures once used to store and
manufacture parts for World War II battleships and aircraft
carriers. The project, with a dozen sound stages and 700,000 square
feet overall, would be the largest by far in the city, and would be
expected to spawn spinoff businesses to create a permanent
filmmaking infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The best argument for the site is the current boom in film
activity in New York. City figures indicate that a record 221 films
were shot in New York last year, generating $2.57 billion in
economic activity. It was the fifth straight record-breaking year.
The number of days films were shot in New York increased by 50
percent over the past five years, and direct expenditures on
filmmaking have risen 78 percent. Over the last year alone, the
number of prime-time television series filmed in New York climbed
to 10 from six.
</P>
<P>
   But New York has only 600,000 square feet of sound stages for
major productions, Ms. Scott said, while Los Angeles has about 3.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   People in government and the industry agree that there is
enormous demand for the kind of stages being contemplated, and that
having people like De Niro, Weinstein and the developer Steven
Roth, chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, behind the project gives it
a credibility earlier projects did not have.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have people involved who can generate their own
production and co-production like Tribeca and Miramax, you're just
immediately on another level,'' Ms. Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers tend to come to New York to shoot on location and
then do indoor and post-production work in Los Angeles or
increasingly in Canada, where costs are lower than in New York or
Los Angeles. But if better space were available, it is likely that
more would be willing to do that work in New York as well,
filmmakers say. They say it makes enormous sense to do both in one
place, so if, for example, bad weather scuttles outdoor shooting, a
production can move indoors for the day. Working in one place also
cuts down on having two production offices and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And the Navy Yard, in many ways, is a tantalizing option. It has
the kind of vast expanses and room for support and satellite
businesses almost impossible to find in New York or Los Angeles.
Existing buildings at the Navy Yard have already been used for
filming. Because of the investment approved by the city, the
proposed complex would have the kind of advanced fiber optic and
telecommuncations equipment needed. And as a municipally owned site
it has an owner desperate to make the site work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I sound like a Pollyanna, but this is going to
happen,'' said Marc H. Rosenbaum, president of the Brooklyn Navy
Yard Development Corp., which was established by the city to run
the Navy Yard, as his van skirted potholes and puddles at the site,
which is as glamorous as a sewer pipe but nonetheless employs 3,000
people in 200 businesses that would coexist with the movie complex.
``All it takes is a little vision.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still, vision can be a little clouded for New York's film
industry. After all, the local film business boomed in the 1970s
and early '80s, collapsed in the face of disputes with unions in
the late '80s and early '90s and has come roaring back in recent
years. Similar deals with less high-powered backing have regularly
collapsed over the past 15 years. And some wonder if the digital
era will lessen the need for huge sound stages.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The most recent mega-plan, by an independent film production
company, the Shooting Gallery, called for building 15 sound stages
for $75 million in an old industrial park in Harrison, N.J. That
was scrapped for a much more modest project in lower Manhattan.
Similarly, the original proposal for the Navy Yard by two young
promoters, Louis Madigan and Cory Dean Hart, foundered, and without
the Miramax and De Niro names it seems unlikely that investors for
the project would have been found.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even producers who would like to see the additional space say
sound stages have little appeal to lenders, who would rather build
an office or apartment building than a sound stage with no
guarantee that it can withstand cyclical ups and down of the movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be great if it happened,'' said Ilene
Landress, producer of the television series ``The Sopranos,'' which
is filmed at Silvercup Studios, at a former bread bakery in Long
Island City, Queens. ``But I might be retired by the time it does,
and I'm not old. The problem is you need to find someone with a lot
of money for a project like this, and there are so many other
businesses that make more sense than building black boxes for sound
stages.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons to be wary. Filmmakers consistently
express a preference for Manhattan, and an aversion to fighting
bridge and tunnel traffic to Brooklyn. Even the two existing sound
stage complexes in Queens, Silvercup and Kaufman Astoria Studios,
have far better access to public transportation than the Navy Yard
does.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the city's efforts to spruce it up, the site is widely
viewed as an eyesore, and is sometimes referred to as Dodge City
because of the need to dodge trucks, cranes and heavy equipment.
And many people are skeptical about the project's scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by the notion of building 12 sound stages,'' said
Phil Dixson, managing director of Televest, which produces soap
operas for Procter &AMP; Gamble. ``It sounds awfully ambitious to me. I
could see three or four being booked up rather quickly. But I'm not
sure how they came up with the number they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the uncertainties are expansion plans at other
studios that could include five new studios at Silvercup, five at
the proposed Hudson River Studios at Houston Street and one at
Kaufman Astoria. Only Silvercup has begun construction.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the larger issues buffeting the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, studio space in Los Angeles is going begging, it's
empty,'' said Tom Pollock, former head of Universal Pictures and
currently the chairman of the American Film Institute. ``And sound
stages are not a way to make a lot of money. It's a rental business
of small margins and fixed costs. You don't make money by owning
the lot. You make it by owning the successful software, the
successful movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in question is the need for big sound stages at a time when
production can increasingly be done on computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The parties to the Brooklyn proposal are declining comment while
the major potential financer, Union Labor Life Insurance Co., a
union-supported pension fund, studies a potential $80 million
investment in the deal. Absent that commitment, the deal remains
nowhere near the financing needed to go forward. And for all their
nominal support, neither Miramax nor Tribeca has made any binding
commitments to use the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their announcement was the biggest non-announcement
announcement I've ever seen,'' said one person in the film
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to securing the rest of the money and the role of
all the principals, the project must deal with Madigan and Hart,
the promoters, who say they still hope to be a major part of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The plan has a lot of constituencies. The New York film industry
sees it as a catalyst for expansion. City officials see it as an
economic development plum. De Niro and Miramax see it as a project
that would make it easier for them to make movies in New York. And
Union Labor Life Insurance Co. would get both construction jobs and
the possibility of future union jobs, though company officials take
pains to say the project has to make economic sense on its own.
</P>
<P>
   And the proposal may benefit from coming at precisely the right
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing on this couldn't be better,'' said Dan Levinson, a
producer and director who moved to Los Angeles from New York in
1987 and returned two years ago. ``New York is hot. People really
want to come here again. If the unions are smart and make some real
concessions, I think New York can steal a lot of the business back
from L.A. Will it happen? I don't know. But I wouldn't bet against
Harvey Weinstein and Robert De Niro.''

MISSING PERSONS BUREAU TAKE NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Where was Scotland Yard when that little old tennis
tournament called Wimbledon was in need, with a missing persons
case? Not, however, in need of persons to fill the seats and every
available space on the grassy hillside facing a gigantic TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   No, that's never a problem at the Big W, where 36,471
communicants _ a record opening-day throng _ squeezed into the
premises Monday to eat a lot of strawberries &UR;  &LR; and &UR;  &LR; cream and help
start the 113th edition of the world's elder among such
celebrations. Many of them had camped overnight Sunday on sidewalks
outside the green walls to be early in the lines that stretched as
far as a half-mile from the black iron gates.
</P>
<P>
   English people care.
</P>
<P>
   But where were two of the people they care much about, Serena
Williams and Katharine Windsor? Missing. That's for certain; that's
the mystery. It made you want to ring 999 (the British version of
911) and request a posse of detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever she was, Williams is, as you may know, the younger of
the Sisters Sledgehammer, ranked No. 10 on earth. The other is No.
5 Venus, who trotted out onto Centre Court, following Pete Sampras,
to dismember Miriam Oremans, 6-1, 7-5, with a variety of stinging
shots including the second-fastest female serve ever launched on
these lawns: 123 m.p.h. The record is 125 _ set by herself a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unseen Windsor, as you also probably know, is the Duchess of
Kent. One of the few stars of the local dysfunctional royal family,
she is a stylish pillar of Wimbledon, customarily decorating the
front row of the Royal Box.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sampras, the champ, appeared on Centre along with
victim Scotty Draper to signal the beginning of another Wimbledon,
and turned to bend at waist in the ceremonial bow to whatever royal
birds roosted in their aviary just above and behind the court _ the
best seats in the house _ he looked puzzled for an instant. No
Duchess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed her,'' said Sampras after a sharp first act in his
quest for a sixth title, a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 decision sprinkled with
crisp volleys and forehands. Instead of the Duchess's sparkling
smile, the champ had to settle for her roommate, the Duke of Kent,
and Prince Michael. Chopped liver lined up against the prime rib.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the show went on. The Duke, who doesn't talk to
persons such as I, wouldn't reveal whether he'd ordered Katharine
to stay home and do windows, or whether she'd been abducted by a
sheikh of Araby.
</P>
<P>
   She hadn't called in sick as Serena did last Thursday, thus
withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena has the blue flu,'' said her mother, Oracene Williams,
with a Mona Lisa smile, not caring to define colorations of
influenza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the flu,'' said Venus. ``I miss her.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Williamses, the royal family of Palm Beach Gardens,
Fla., function very well _ though sometimes in secretive and
baffling ways _ there are some who believe Serena is an on-purpose
missing person, avoiding an entanglement with her big sister.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is nine-time champion Martina Navratilova, now a TV
babbler for HBO, who strongly challenges the disappearance: ``I
just wish they would tell the truth, because flu is not the truth.
She may be a little sick, but not that sick. You don't withdraw on
a Thursday when you may not have to play until Tuesday or
Wednesday. Either Serena has another injury or she didn't want to
play against her sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Aha.
</P>
<P>
   Serena did behave curiously in that respect last year. Facing a
lesser foe, Virginia Ruano Pascual, in the third round, seemingly
sure to collide with Venus in the fourth, Serena played
desultorily. She quit when behind, 7-5, 4-1, claiming a leg injury.
Yet she reappeared afresh to win the mixed doubles with Max Mirnyi.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, when the pairings were announced Wednesday, Venus
and Serena looked headed for a fourth-round head-on. Did papa
Richard Williams, who has plotted his kids' courses cleverly, feel
he knew best by withholding his 17-year-old to keep the progress of
his 19-year-old uncomplicated emotionally?
</P>
<P>
   Not even Scotland Yard, Sherlock Holmes, or Miss Marple could
solve that one.
</P>
<P>
   Papa did say after Venus beat Serena for the Lipton title in
April that the match strained the entire family.
</P>
<P>
   Bart McGuire, boss of the Women's Tennis Association, offers the
expected, and, you hope, correct opinion: ``I can't believe Serena
would give up Wimbledon if she's not sick.''
</P>
<P>
   A missing person in 1998, one-time top 10 inhabitant Anke Huber
has turned up again, not only here, but in the life of her
rebounding boyfriend, Andrei Medvedev. Medvedev, who has risen from
No. 100 to No. 31 by attaining the French final and almost beating
Andre Agassi, credits his rejuvenation to Huber.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently they were scheduled for back-to-back engagements.
He beat up on her German countryman, Bernd Karbacher, 7-6 (7-1),
7-6 (7-3), 6-4, then settled in for a long vigil as Huber went
against another found-again type, Jennifer Capriati. Not even a
sharp north wind that cooled the place to the 50s could discourage
these two battlers into the gloaming.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:05, after both had suffered numerous knockdowns on the
dewy, treacherous turf, referee Alan Mills interceded and stopped
the fight, sending them home all tied up in the third. From the
standpoint of Capriati, who trailed, 0-3, in the second, the score
is 5-7, 6-3, 5-5, with more to come today.
</P>
<P>
   Romantics surely must believe that Andrei will have fixed Anke a
nice, comforting cup of tea. Also that the Duchess will materialize
once more in her front row seat. And that Serena will recover in
time for the US Open, so we won't have to call 999 after all.

PINEHURST NO. 2, STEWART BOTH ON TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ There were two winners in the 99th US Open at
Pinehurst's cherished No. 2 course.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the course. ``I would very much like to see the
Open come back to Pinehurst,'' said Phil Mickelson, the runner-up
by a stroke. ``I felt this was the first Open course I played that
tested every area of the player's game from the driver all the way
to the short game.''
</P>
<P>
   The other winner, of course, was Payne Stewart. A few years ago,
he stood outside the clubhouse at Augusta National during the
Masters and talked dejectedly about his future in the game, citing
a loss of enthusiasm. That was light-years away from the emotion he
showed Sunday when he won his second US Open with a 15-foot par
putt on the 72d hole.
</P>
<P>
   He prevailed heroically over Mickelson, Tiger Woods, and Vijay
Singh in an enthralling finish to a tournament that tore apart some
of the game's best players with pin positions that many considered
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   What it ultimately came down to on this Father's Day was that
Stewart had to lay up out of damp rough and sink that 15-footer.
When he made it _ after Mickelson missed a putt that could have
forced an 18-hole playoff Monday _ Stewart went into an emotional
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe I accomplished another dream of mine,''
said Stewart, who also sank a 25-foot putt on the 16th to save par
and hit a 6-iron to 3 feet on 17 to set up a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   After losing by one shot last year at San Francisco's Olympic
Club, Stewart didn't want to return home to Orlando to confront the
same questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said, `Oh, man what a great try,' '' said Stewart.
``I didn't want to hear that when I got back to Orlando and all my
friends came up and said, `Boy, you sure tried. It was a great
effort. You're a great competitor, but bad luck.' I didn't want to
hear that, and it motivated me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mickelson, ``I think it was very exciting towards the end
with four players having a very good opportunity to win the golf
tournament. I felt with three holes to go I was in control of the
tournament because I was leading and it's a very difficult course
to make birdies on. Even until the last putt, I felt there was
still a very good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson had a future Father's Day in mind as wife Amy was due
with their first child; he had every intention of leaving on the
spot if she went into labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a disappointing day for me,'' said Mickelson, ``but
the fact that our first child is expected to come here in the next
week or so is awfully exciting. It will be a bigger change of my
life than had I won today.''
</P>
<P>
   As he played out the drama, Stewart was stone-faced and laconic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept playing,'' he said. ``I kept plugging. I didn't hit the
great shots at certain times and then I did hit the great shots.
Then I'd hit the great putts and poor chips. But I got the job
done, and that means a lot to me. I told you last night that if I
won again that I'm going to enjoy it a lot more, and I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the saga of Woods, who left long putts woefully
short and missed one from inside 3 feet on the 17th to stymie his
charge for a second major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' said Woods. ``It's pretty intense, and you've
got to get it done.''

   The New York Times plans 2 1/2 pages of stories on Kosovo for
Tuesday, June 22.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ The agreement reached early
Monday to disband the Kosovo Liberation Army included, at the
insistence of its commanders, a pledge by the NATO allies to
consider letting the rebels form a provisional army for Kosovo
modeled on the National Guard in the United States. By Steven Lee
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REBELS (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ Interview with top rebel
commander, Gen. Agim Ceku, who already has the formation of a
future army for Kosovo planned out, even as he is preparing to
disarm and demobilize his guerrilla force. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-WOMEN-ASSAULT (Zrze, Yugoslavia) _ In interviews over the
last two weeks, dozens of women and men in Kosovo and in refugee
camps in Albania told stories that suggest that sexual assault and
intimidation, if not rape, were widespread, common and used by
Serbian forces to strike at the heart of a society in which the
virginity and fidelity of Muslim women is central. By Elisabeth
Bumiller.
</P>
<P>
   With a map and photos.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Mitrovica, Yugoslavia) _ For the third consecutive
day, several dozen Serbs in civilian dress who call themselves
``warrior citizens'' prevented ethnic Albanians from entering the
predominantly Serbian sector of this northern Kosovo industrial
town Monday, jeering and threatening any Albanian who dared to
enter. In a direct challenge to NATO authority, the Serbs are
declaring their neighborhood, about a third of the city, and the
predominantly Serbian towns to the north a ``Serb zone,'' which
they say stretches from here to the border with Serbia. By David
Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CLINTON (Ljubljana, Slovenia) _ This tiny and new nation
perched on the Adriatic was held up Monday by President Clinton as
a shining example of what was possible if a people decided to stand
up to the ethnic terror of Slobodan Milosevic. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ A small group of
Yugoslav opposition parties said Monday that it would call
demonstrations this weekend to demand early elections and
democratic change. But Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is
considered highly unlikely to call early elections, senior
government officials said Monday. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBS (Pec, Yugoslavia) _ Three battle helicopters
hovered overhead, and there were nearly as many military vehicles
as plain cars. But that is what NATO decided it would take to bring
70 Serbs back to this destroyed city Monday, in a high-minded
attempt to enable Kosovo Serbs and Albanians to live together even
in the ruins. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Undated) _ It is hard to say which accusation
rankled the most: that Macedonia was trying to make money off the
Kosovo refugee crisis; that the Macedonian people as a whole
refused to treat the Kosovar Albanian refugees with the respect
they deserved; or that Macedonia was exaggerating the damage it
suffered from the conflict over Kosovo. But Macedonians from all
political points of view resented being portrayed as would-be
profiteers or even collaborating with the Serbs in the latest
chapter of eight years of Balkan wars that have brought them little
but an extremely tenuous independence. By Elizabeth Becker.

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives, unable to agree on
any realistic remedy for the very real problem of school violence,
has passed the political buck to God, allowing states to permit the
display of the Ten Commandments in public classrooms or government
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds harmless, right? Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an affirmation of the value of religious principles.
It is an alarming example of congressional fantasizing. It is a
sneaky attempt to force the language of one religion into the minds
of youngsters who may not yet have chosen their faith. And it will
not keep a single crazy kid with a grudge and a gun from hurting
others.
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Commandments are good words to live by, but they are
just words. They didn't prevent murders and hatreds and evil deeds
in Biblical times and won't do it now.
</P>
<P>
   Kids can hang the Ten Commandments in their rooms if they want;
parents can hang them over the sofa or the kitchen table. But
displaying them in locations like schools and courtrooms where
states exercise authority over individuals puts an unacceptable
official stamp of approval on them.
</P>
<P>
   What the new House measure means is that our elected nitwits
have chosen to hide behind pseudo-religion rather than fulfill
their proper duty, which is the hard work of dealing sensibly with
national issues in a huge nation of competing interests and needs.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, religious zealots have promoted the spread of
Christian symbols and prayers in public places as the way to
strengthen the American character. Their political sympathizers
prefer to try to legislate morality than come up with practical
secular ideas that might cost taxpayers money or irritate powerful
lobbyists _ but actually do some good.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the right moment to do the wrong thing came during the
tumultuous, emotional debate over gun control and juvenile justice
last week. In its confused, panicky response to the shootings at
Columbine High School in Colorado, Congress was at its very worst,
which can be really terrible.
</P>
<P>
   The worst of the worst was the House majority whip, Rep. Tom
DeLay of Texas, who blamed the gun violence in schools on day care,
abortion, the teaching of evolution, the absence of prayer in
schools, too many civil rights for children, irresponsible parents
_ everything but the kitchen sink, and nut cases who have easy
access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, considered the most powerful Republican in the House
these days, thundered ``the issue is God, not guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny. We thought DeLay was elected to participate in running a
government, not to anoint himself commander of our souls.
</P>
<P>
   And just when did God become a political issue? Religion,
according to most surveys, is doing very well. Americans still go
in large numbers to church, which is where God in any form belongs.
True faith should be a private matter, not a partisan plaything.
</P>
<P>
   The last we heard, God doesn't pick sides in elections. God has
nothing to do with the manufacture and sale of semi-automatics and
other weapons by which students are killing rival students. If He
disapproves of day care, He has overlooked the millions of tots who
benefit from such early attention and turn out great.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay sold the House on the concept of ``returning God to
the schools'' with the Ten Commandments. This is almost surely
unconstitutional, although the House tried to get around the
traditional separation of church and state by merely specifying
that states could ``allow'' displays of the Ten Commandments rather
than mandating the change.
</P>
<P>
   And the direct impact of the Ten Commandments upon the moral
behavior of schoolchildren seems dubious at best.
</P>
<P>
   Since religion is very personal, I am going to rely on my own
family Bible, which is a 1904 St. James translation. In this
version, the First Commandment is ``thou shalt have no other gods
before me.'' That's pretty dictatorial about who's the religious
boss but lacking in persuasive content.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image ... Thou shalt
not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.'' Again, it's
dictatorial but lacks persuasive content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.''
OK, no swearing would be an improvement. But over the decades human
ingenuity has expanded crude verbal opportunities beyond the
Bible's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy ... Thou shalt not
do any work, nor thy son.'' This one lost its meaning long ago in
most families, where church may fill mornings but the rest of the
day is occupied by jobs, studies, shopping, and other secular
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honor thy father and thy mother.'' This is generally a good
idea, but the Bible didn't know about deadbeat dads and parents who
beat up on their children and each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not kill.'' This is a timeless goodie, but hard to
explain if your parents favor capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not commit adultery.'' Also timeless, but there
doesn't seem any relevance here for schoolchildren not yet old
enough for adult temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not steal.'' Also a goody, unless you want to go to
jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.''
Assuming ``neighbor'' includes wives and mistresses, too bad
President Clinton didn't read this one. But this could be useful if
your kid tends to lie about stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, nor his wife ...
nor anything that is thy neighbor's.'' This could be useful to warn
off kids who want to steal their buddies' hot shoes or jackets. But
it doesn't cover lust for a gun that can be bought firsthand at the
local gun show.

SUMMERTIME AND THE NET HOAXES FLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ahh, summer. Time for sun, swimming and, sadly,
Internet hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the recent furor over real Internet threats, such as
the Melissa virus and the Worm.Explore.Zip trojan horse virus, many
e-mail users have been hit with a flurry of hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them are old, returning for an encore. Some are new, or
relatively new. But all share a common thread: They are untrue and
serve no purpose other than to scare people and clog the Internet
with junk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   An old one that's making the rounds again involves a claim that
Congress wants to pass legislation giving the government power to
impose a 5-cent surcharge on all e-mail delivered anywhere in the
country. This is a hoax!
</P>
<P>
   The ``Washingtonian,'' an actual publication quoted in the hoax
e-mail, says it never wrote about such a surcharge and that the
congressmen quoted in the hoax e-mail don't exist. You can read the
entire disclaimer at www.washingtonian.com/about/emailhoax.html.
</P>
<P>
   A new hoax _ at least one that I'd never run across before _
involves a story of how Stanford University began.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tale of how two ragtag people in threadbare clothing show
up at Harvard University one day, asking if they could donate a
building to the campus in memory of their son who was
``accidentally killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's president ``rolls his eyes'' and dismisses the two,
who end up going to California and building an entire university.
</P>
<P>
   The couple turns out to be wealthy railroad baron Leland
Stanford and his wife, Jane.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford University archivist Margaret Kimball said she's been
trying to kill this story for more than a year. Kimball says the
e-mail is entertaining but untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Leland Stanford Jr. died of typhoid fever, not by accidentally
being killed, she said. And after their child's death, the
Stanfords decided to found an institution that would ``serve the
children of California,'' where the elder Stanford had served as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanfords apparently visited Harvard, Cornell, MIT and Johns
Hopkins while trying to decide whether to build a university,
museum or technical school as a monument to their son.
</P>
<P>
   But, she says, the Stanfords were quite wealthy and certainly
did not show up in threadbare clothing. In addition, Kimball said,
it's hard to imagine that the Stanfords were treated with anything
but respect by Harvard University's president.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanfords ended up building a university and museum near
Palo Alto, Calif. The site apparently is near a tree where the
younger Stanford once ate his lunch.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other e-mail hoaxes that have made the rounds.
They include Good Times, AOL4FREE, the Internet Cleanup Day, the
Bill Gates hoax and one called It Takes Guts to Say Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do if you get an e-mail that makes some wild
claims? First off, try to verify the information before you
duplicate it and send it off to all your friends. Clogging the
Internet with unnecessary e-mails is one of the worst impacts of
online hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   There are many Web sites that can help you verify whether an
e-mail claim is true or a hoax. One is operated by the U.S.
Department of Energy's Computer Incident Advisory Capability. You
can find it at ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html. This site is
also good for getting reliable information on viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites with information about Internet hoaxes include
www.datafellows.com/news/hoax.htm (a very good site),
www.symantec.com/avcenter/hoax.html and www.4urbanlegends.com.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, and remember: Don't believe everything you read in
e-mail! &QL;

Nullsoft gets new parent
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regular readers of this column have read about Nullsoft Inc.
(www.nullsoft.com) before. It's the Sedona, Ariz., company that
produces WinAmp, the most popular software player for MP3 music
files.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I mentioned Nullsoft, the company was being sued
by PlayMedia Systems Inc. (www.playmediasystems.com) for alleged
copyright infringement. PlayMedia claimed that its playback
software was used in WinAmp, a charge Nullsoft denied.
</P>
<P>
   This time I mention Nullsoft because the company has been
acquired by none other than America Online. The purchase, which
also included San Francisco-based Spinner Networks Inc., was
announced this month.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never heard of Spinner, you should check out its Web
site (www.spinner.com). The company delivers virtually any kind of
music to your desktop. Download and install the Spinner player, and
you can have background music all day. About 1.5 million people use
it monthly.
</P>
<P>
   AOL said the purchase of Nullsoft and Spinner will ``enable
consumers to play all leading formats of Internet music.''
</P>
<P>
   The sad part for Arizonans is that the deal means Nullsoft will
be moving its headquarters from Sedona to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Nullsoft's president and founder, Justin Frankel, sounded happy
about the multimillion-dollar deal: ``Working with America Online's
tremendous resources and infrastructure will let us focus our
efforts on what's really important: Making cool software.''
</P>
<P>
   Way to go, Nullsoft! &QL; 
 &QL; 
Web sites of the week
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
- Are you in Scouting? There are a couple Web sites that claim to
specialize in finding information just for Scouts, whether they are
boys or girls (or adult leaders, for that matter). One is called
the Scouting Spider. It's at spider.scout.net. The other is the
Girl Scout Only Search Engine, at girlscout.jalyn.net/search.html.
(A tip of the hat to reader James W. for letting us know about
these two sites!)
</P>
<P>
   - Tired of paying $1.30 or more per gallon of gasoline? A group
of Phoenix residents wants to help. They've created a Web site
called Azgasprices.com, where you can check a long list of the
cheapest places in town to buy gas. It's updated frequently, and
relies on input from everybody who uses the site. A recent check of
the list showed several stations selling gas at $1.07 per gallon or
less. Find the site at www.azgasprices.com. (Thanks to reader Becky
B. for telling us about the site.) &QL;

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I've been working at a small company for
about five years, and I haven't had any real complaints. We just
hired our first human resources director. Through the rumor mill, I
heard that she suggested to the owner that the employees meet in
small groups to criticize each other and bring all our faults into
the open. The boss thought this was a terrific idea. How do I
convince the boss that this would be the beginning of the end? S.G.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Assuming that your company's rumor mill is grinding out
accurate information, it sounds like your new human resources
director has a less-than-resourceful idea. Unless your boss is
interested in a program that will generate dissatisfaction,
distress and disharmony, you should consider making some
suggestions on your own.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense, the idea of a new HR director conducting
some group sessions to learn about employee attitudes is a good
one. However, these discussions should focus on attitudes toward
such issues as productivity, teamwork, job design, rewards, and the
work atmosphere and culture.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell your boss that in sessions where employees are
encouraged to unleash negative feelings toward each other, such
feelings are not put back into a sealed bottle when the session
ends. Rather, many of the participants will feel hurt, attacked,
betrayed and defensive, and they will take these feelings right
back to their jobs. When a project calls for cooperation with
someone who slammed them in the group session, the outcome is not
going to be pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Let your boss see the costs of the new director's approach, and
the benefits of sessions that focus on performance rather than
personality. This may be the beginning of the end ... of a
questionable idea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am the manager of a department at a large company. There is
another manager who has a history of angry outbursts, mistreatment
of assistants and verbal abuse of co-workers, regardless of
warnings from upper management. He claims that people are yelling
at him, so he yells at us. His behavior is abusive and against all
company policies and harassment laws. I need some advice. J.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hopefully your company has some form of employer practices
liability insurance, because it sounds like it is just a matter of
time before someone gets litigious.
</P>
<P>
   In a company where yelling, screaming and abusive treatment are
found at the highest levels of management, it is not surprising to
find this type of behavior oozing down to lower levels of
management as well. In fact, many managers learn how to manage or
mismanage from their superiors. In addition, when such outrageous
behavior is practiced at the highest levels, the real message is
that such behavior is entirely acceptable, company policies and
laws notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   You should approach senior management, provide specific examples
of questionable managerial behaviors, and advise the topsiders of
the significant costs and risks associated with abuse, harassment
and bullying. The idea of risk management should not be entirely
foreign to the company leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Any possible improvement in your situation must come from the
top. If the company leadership does not make a move on the issues,
then perhaps you should make a move.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of my good friends at work is sort of a goof-off and a
clown. The other day, my manager came down very hard on me and said
that he has seen us fooling around too much and he wants it to
stop. I don't spend that much time with him, and I'm not sure how
to handle what the manager said. R.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: When you hang out with the office clown, people can think
that you are part of the act. According to what your manager has
seen, the two of you are together too much and working too little.
Whether this is an accurate perception or not, it is reality for
him. The best step is to cut back on the clown-time.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than getting into a debate with your manager over the
amount of time that you may or may not have spent with your friend,
it will be more helpful for you to focus on your productivity. You
should tell your buddy that you both are under the corporate
spotlight and need to make sure that your performance levels are
first rate.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that you can no longer be friends, nor does
it mean that there can be no more humor at work. It just means that
you both need to remember the real meaning of performance on the
job. After all, humor at work is very important. However, when
carried to an excess, it can cause both of you to be carried to an
exit.

TV REVIEW: WHEN A QUICK FIX BECOMES A LONGER-TERM PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass., Kan., Ga.)  (Production notes at end of review) 
(nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most parents and many doctors, antibiotics are a quick fix
for the colds, fevers and assorted ailments of childhood. As the
contributors to ``Epidemic,'' Tuesday night's ``Fred Friendly
Seminar,'' caution, worried parents and busy doctors are
co-conspirators in the development of drug-resistant bacteria that
threaten health around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert C. Moellering, an infectious-diseases specialist at
Harvard Medical School and the Beth Israel Medical Center, tells
how formerly ``first-line drugs'' like penicillin and ampicillin,
have lost effectiveness and some diseases are resistant to any drug
at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation that pops around from affluent America to
disease-stricken East Africa, where as one doctor says, ``hospitals
are running on Band-Aids,'' public health experts agree on the need
for a comprehensive approach to the appearance of frightening
symptoms like those connected with the Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Arthur R. Miller of the Harvard
University Law School, who tends to get a touch cute about dire
matters (a reporter is named Manfred Muckraker), the panelists get
into the problems of keeping reporters and politicians from
spreading pandemonium while researchers try to figure out what is
happening. Dr. Joshua Lederberg, an expert on bacterial genetics,
has compliments for the way journalists generally handle the
subject of antibiotic resistance, but warns that under deadline
pressures they have trouble dealing with potentially catastrophic
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the panelists have much of interest to contribute. Nancy
Kassebaum Baker, former senator of Kansas, comes out in favor of
bigger appropriations for health, and Dr. John D. Siegfried, who is
affiliated with the pharmaceutical industry, puts in a plug for
``an active and functioning pharmaceutical industry working in
conjunction with the federal government and academic researchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Moellering acknowledges the drug successes but expresses concern
over the financial incentive to bring new drugs onto the market:
``They have to cover their costs.'' (The program is sponsored by
Bristol-Myers Squibb.)
</P>
<P>
   The hour ends with a brisk exchange about the pressures on
public health specialists to deal with potential epidemics without
adding to panic among parents and elected officials, who, as Bill
Campbell, the mayor of Atlanta, notes, have to worry about legal
challenges no matter what they do, especially when children are at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. David A. Kessler, former commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration, warns that ``the riskiest thing we can do'' is
not to take any risks at all.

GIVING FAIRY TALES A FEMINIST TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In HBO's latest fracturing of fairy tales, ``The Three Little
Pigs'' as reinterpreted by Tama Janowitz will be set in a girls'
camp where ``You can never be too fat or too dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   The stars are three very chubby and very muddy little girl
piglets, whose voices are those of three notably unchubby (and
presumably unmuddy) young women: the actresses Courteney Cox and
Sandra Oh and the supermodel Tyra Banks. With Loretta Lynn in a
Dolly Parton-esque role as Deli Pork Chop, the camp leader, and
Sinbad as the Big Bad Wolf, Tuesday night's presentation of ``The
Three Little Pigs'' is the first of 13 new tales in a monthly
series called ``Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child.''
It began in 1995 as an effort to add other races to the white
European stereotypes of fairy-tale lore, but this season's stories
have also been given a feminist twist.
</P>
<P>
   To get attention, HBO and the co-creators, Donna Brown-Guillaume
and Meryl Marshall, went all out with celebrity solicitations. For
writers they attracted Erica Jong, Linda Fairstein, Anna Quindlen
and Roy Blount Jr. (his ``Frog Princess'' is one of three stories
by men). The voice-over actors range from Eartha Kitt to Angie
Dickinson, from Andre Braugher to Doug E. Doug.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Henny Penny,'' the story of Chicken Little as rewritten by
the tart-tongued political columnist Molly Ivins, a sky-is-falling
election debate in the barnyard features the voices of Sharon
Stone, Johnnie Cochran, Alan Dershowitz, the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
Henry Kissinger and, as Merle and Earle, Geraldine Ferraro and
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York. Naturally, HBO has scheduled
that one for November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharon Stone actually called and asked to do a voice,'' said
Ms. Brown-Guillaume, adding that the series' first two seasons gave
it a certain cachet among entertainers. Calista Flockhart, star of
``Ally McBeal,'' for example, plays Vanna, Rip Van Winkle's wife,
while Tom Arnold gives a resounding male-chauvinist spin to old
Rip.
</P>
<P>
   And if something seems askew in having a woman who earns
world-class paychecks by being slim and beautiful play a fat and
sloppy piglet, Ms. Banks does not see it that way. ``In my world,
you can never be too thin,'' she said disapprovingly, adding that
when she was seriously ill and lost 30 pounds, she was horrified at
the number of people who told her she had never looked better. ``I
kept calling HBO to make sure that this story was consistent:
skinny was ugly, and fat was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   For others looking for doctrinaire feminist interpretations,
Carole Rosen, the HBO executive in charge of this series, has
another message: Lighten up. ``These words may sound familiar:
militant, humorless, taking themselves too seriously,'' she said.
``These labels have been applied to feminists. Yet this series is
marked by tremendous humor and satire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blount, who wrote ``The Frog Princess,'' sounded earnest and
serious when he said writing a feminist tale was more complicated
than, say, replacing a white Cinderella with an Asian one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just flip-flop the roles,'' he said. In traditional
tales, the prince goes on a quest to win a princess, he said, ``And
you don't want your female characters going off on a quest for no
other reason than to find a prince. So you need to find a whole new
kind of story to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, this means letting girls have the adventures
or be the leaders or the rescuers. For example, Ms. Fairstein, head
of the Manhattan district attorney's sex crimes unit and a mystery
writer (for adults) in her spare time, said she had fun writing
``Aesop's Fables: A Whodunit Musical'' and making sure that ``a
smart female detective solves the mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Janowitz's ``Three Little Pigs'' (written, she said, with
her own lively 3-year-old daughter in mind) starts the series
Tuesday night at 8 p.m. (ET). Most episodes will be at 8, although
Ms. Quindlen's ``Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves'' (Ali is a girl, of
course), next Tuesday, is scheduled for 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more famous fairy tales that would seem ripe for a
feminist reworking _ ``Sleeping Beauty,'' ``Snow White,''
``Cinderella'' _ were used in the earlier two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind, said Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas,
who lends her voice as a wise old woman of the mountain (``It was
just typecasting,'' she said) in Ms. Jong's version of ``Rip Van
Winkle.'' Feminist infusions are still needed in children's
stories, she said, including modern ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took three of my grandkids to see that new `Star Wars'
movie, `The Phantom Menace,'' she said. ``Here we are in 1999,
moving into the new millennium. What does the central female
character do in this movie? She changes clothes, and she fixes her
hair in a different, very elaborate style in every scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what do the boys do? They drive fast cars, they win the
race, they sit with the guy who is the biggest hero of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message still is that women get dressed up and look nice,
and boys do brave, constructive, wonderful things. So you cannot
think that kids aren't still getting stereotypical messages these
days.''

<P>
   Carole Danforth's asthma had gotten the best of her. No longer
did she have the energy for activities she loved, like playing with
her grandchildren or doing yardwork. Some days, her breathing was
so labored she could not get up from the couch. And there seemed
little she could do about it: Ms. Danforth, a 51-year-old
housecleaner in Taunton, Mass., had no insurance and little money
for doctors or the inhalers she needed when her condition was at
its worst.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years ago, friends told her about a local doctor who
was offering free examinations and drugs as part of a study of an
experimental asthma medication.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Danforth was accepted for the study by Dr. Michael Lawrence.
Within days, he gave her a free, but unapproved, medication for
asthma. Her breathing returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Danforth had finally found her access to health care _
albeit one where her medicine lasts only as long as the study. As a
result, she has become one of a growing number of drug-trial
nomads, wandering from study to study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't keep track of them all,'' Ms. Danforth said of the
drug studies in which she has participated. ``But I haven't felt
this good in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the need for test subjects in drug trials has
exploded as the industry has brought to market an ever-increasing
number of new products.
</P>
<P>
   Filling the gap, according to industry officials and
researchers, are people like Ms. Danforth: chronically ill patients
with limited or no health insurance. For these people, experiments
have become treatments; clinical investigators are their
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts recognize the shortcomings of this system. On
the one hand, the doctors provide a critical service that such
patients cannot obtain any other way. Patients ``are better off
getting experimental therapy than no therapy at all,'' said Paul
Menzel, a philosophy professor at Pacific Lutheran University in
Tacoma, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefit can be fleeting or nonexistent. Chronically ill
patients with no other options can be treated with an experimental
medication that does not work or that worsens their condition. Or
they can end up with a placebo rather than the medication. And once
the study ends, they are left to their own devices. They can be
barred by the rules of one clinical trial from participating in
another study for months, forcing them to rely on samples of
medications provided by drug companies or to go without treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies are becoming like a stopgap'' with the private
doctors, said Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of the
psychopharmacology clinic at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center in New York City. ``And that's pretty bad, taking from them
what they need and then tossing them back.''
</P>
<P>
   That description underscores a hard fact of medical research:
The subjects of drug trials are not, technically speaking, being
treated for a disease. Rather, they are participating in an
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody keeps track of how many uninsured people seek health care
from clinical studies, but researchers agree that they number in
the thousands and that their ranks are growing. People with little
or no insurance are ``pretty much the name of the game,'' said Dr.
Benjamin Levy, director of Lovelace Science Resources Inc., a group
of doctors in New Mexico that conducts drug studies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the poor have long been participants in drug studies,
usually through university medical centers. But those institutions
often direct the patients to other university programs that provide
health care to the poor once the study is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for many test subjects, a clinical trial offers a rare
opportunity for a full diagnostic workup by a medical specialist.
Better still, it can provide them, at no charge, with the
industry's latest methods of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical qualms arise from the fact that clinical trials are not
intended to be medical care. In this context, the doctors are
investigators, not personal physicians. No one knows whether the
drugs work. And because many clinical trials compare an active drug
with a placebo, the patients often receive only a dummy pill.
</P>
<P>
   And even if a test medication improves the health of a
chronically ill person, the drugs will no longer be supplied once
the study ends.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers are so bothered by this that they do everything
they can to continue some form of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's a violation of human rights'' to keep patients
dangling untreated between studies, said Maria Lopez, a study
coordinator for Dr. Herbert Rubin, a gastroenterologist in Beverly
Hills, Calif. To deal with that, Rubin provides his uninsured test
subjects with drug company samples between tests, a practice that
Ms. Lopez said was frowned upon by the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers handle the problem by simply refusing to allow
the uninsured to use drug studies for medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Some ethicists expressed concern that vulnerable patients were
being coerced to put their bodies on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a further exploitation of the poor,'' John Paris,
an ethics professor at Boston College, said.
</P>
<P>
   But others were less certain about the ethical question, simply
because the trend presented new options for getting care to people
whose choices are limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nasty dilemma,'' Professor Menzel said. ``There is no
way you can win on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradoxes are not lost on patients. While most praise the
doctors who conduct the research, many also resent the compromises
they have to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health care they give you is really specific for what
they're testing for,'' said Elizabeth Elder, a 52-year-old
uninsured woman in Albuquerque, N.M., who has participated in a
number of studies, ``so it isn't really health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were simply grateful for whatever medical attention they
could get.
</P>
<P>
   The financial difficulties that lead patients to choose
experiments are not limited to people with little or no insurance.
Adriana Medina, a 24-year-old medical assistant in Tucson, Ariz.,
is in a health maintenance organization. The plan paid for her
8-year-old daughter, Gabriela Garcia, to see a pediatrician for her
asthma. But when that failed to help, the plan would not pay for a
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford the specialist, Ms. Medina enrolled Gabriela in
a drug study conducted by a local asthma expert, Dr. Jay Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental asthma drug changed Gabriela's life. The trial
``is allowing her to have a normal childhood,'' Ms. Medina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only worry,'' she added, ``is that the study will be over
and she'll be back where she started from.''
</P>
<P>
   The completion of a study can be a poignant moment, several
doctors said, especially when the subjects finally received medical
help that had eluded them. The subjects have just spent weeks or
months sitting in waiting rooms with private patients, filling out
the same forms and looking through the same magazines as everyone
else. Their diagnostic tests have been conducted in the usual exam
rooms, and they have received drugs just like private patients.
Then the study ends and the subjects have to leave.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Who's the Dummy?'' is the provocative title of an
exhibition that explores the evolution of mannequins from
dressmakers' forms to store-window displays to live runway models.
The show, opening Tuesday in the Museum at the Fashion Institute of
Technology, combines serious scholarship with humor. It grew out of
a yearlong seminar on exhibition planning for graduate students,
two dozen of whom worked on the displays.
</P>
<P>
   One room contains vintage mannequin heads, videos of how
mannequins are made and of live models in fashion shows, and photos
that demonstrate the use of mannequins by Salvador Dali and Giorgio
de Chirico (who called the mannequin ``a sad and monstrous
reality'').
</P>
<P>
   It's a thought-provoking exhibition that encourages viewers to
consider how mannequins stand in for the human body and in the case
of fashion forms, actually define each age's standard of beauty.
Contemporary fashion mannequins made by Pucci, probably the
best-known manufacturer today, demonstrate the current emphasis on
diversity, with a slender high-fashion type, a voluptuous model
inspired by Dianne Brill, Asian and black versions, and a size 18.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the crash dummies and medical mannequins that
can make you squirm (especially one with surgical scars and an
attached catheter).
</P>
<P>
   Dolled-Up Paper
</P>
<P>
   Another exhibition in the museum is a pure delight. Titled
``Papiers a la Mode,'' it consists of 25 paper dresses that are
nothing like the throwaway paper dresses of the 1960's. These are
painstakingly hand-painted, pleated, frilled, tasseled and braided
dresses tracing fashion from a panniered Venetian court dress circa
1745 in red and gold to a 1930's Fortuny pleated dress and jacket.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian artist, Isabelle de Borchgrave, painted, dyed and
stenciled the paper to resemble silk, linen and lace, which Rita
Brown, a Canadian costume designer and restorer, then assembled
into dresses. Ms. de Borchgrave also decorated the museum's walls,
painting trompe l'oeil curtains and even a little dog that sits by
a mannequin in an early 20th-century ``linen'' suit. &QL; 
Pancaldi Updated
</P>
<P>
   Pancaldi was once a leading purveyor of fashionably classic
women's shoes at stores like Bergdorf Goodman. But as styles became
more extreme, Pancaldi found its star fading. In the last year,
Pancaldi has updated its styling and is taking steps to become a
worldwide brand.
</P>
<P>
   The company now makes the currently popular square-toed shoes
and boots on molded soles as well as sexy metallic sandals and
shoes with Lucite heels that look like Lalique. Neiman Marcus has
sold 2,000 pairs of a $220 Pancaldi mule. Saks Fifth Avenue and
Bloomingdale's also carry the shoes and, this summer, so will three
Pancaldi stores in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market in Russia is picking up,'' Stefano Pancaldi, the
president of the family-owned Italian company, said on a visit to
New York last week. ``There are plenty of wealthy people in
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year there will be a Pancaldi store in New
York at 775 Madison Ave. And 12 more stores are due to open in the
next two years in Italy and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stores will be showcases,'' Pancaldi said, ``both to grow
the business and to show the potential customer the full line of
what we make, including accessories.''
</P>
<P>
   Pancaldi produces its own lasts, heels and components in
company-owned factories, he explained, just as it has since its
founding in 1888.

   FUNABASHI, Japan _ Elaborate tattoos of a carp and mythic
characters of great strength work their way from his pectoral
muscles, over his shoulders, down his arms and across his upper
back.
</P>
<P>
   The tips of his pinkie fingers are conspicuously missing. And
his teeth, capped to perfection, provide more evidence of Hiroyuki
Suzuki's organized-crime credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But while his flesh brands him a member of the yakuza, Japan's
storied underworld, he now says his allegiance is to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki, 43, formerly a member of the Sakaume gumi, a small
independent crime family best known for its role in gambling, is
the founder of Mission Barabbas, an evangelical Christian church in
this Tokyo suburb here, and a minister in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Mission Barabbas features the brand of tongue-speaking,
faith-healing, arm-waving Christianity popular in parts of America
but a distinct oddity in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Christianity in Japan has prevailed only among a
small number of highly educated people, never really reaching the
masses the way it has taken root in other countries. Masaru Hayami,
the governor of the Bank of Japan, is probably the most prominent
Japanese Christian at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 1.1 million Christians, including foreigners, in
Japan, according to The Christian News, a Tokyo weekly; that is
less than 1 percent of the population. Christians here typically
maintain a low profile, perhaps a carryover from the days of the
Tokugawa shogunate, when Christians were persecuted and the
religion was all but stamped out. Since then, Christianity has
spread largely through private schools and universities like Sophia
University.
</P>
<P>
   Mission Barabbas, on the other hand, takes its message to the
streets, a practice reflected in its membership, which is divided
between people who are handicapped, unemployed and otherwise
outcast from Japanese society and people who would disappear in the
crowd at an average train station.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this church, because I used to take drugs and commit
crimes, people who have problems but can't talk about them anywhere
else come here,'' he said. ``It's split about 50-50 between those
who change their lives and those who just drift on.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, which was started four years ago, has some 60
members, and its tiny, one-room sanctuary tucked away in a typical
neighborhood is packed for Sunday services. ``On average in Japan,
one church collects about 30 or 40 followers over a 20-year
period,'' Suzuki said. ``So we're pretty pleased with our
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki and his handful of fellow yakuza converts use a mobile
ministry, song and fiery preaching to win converts. They spent six
months lugging a cross from Okinawa to Hokkaido, a march they have
repeated on a tighter schedule in South Korea and Hawaii. ``Rather
than waiting for people to come in and find us, we decided we'd go
out to the people and talk to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has gained enough attention to earn a speaking engagement at
the president's Prayer Breakfast at the White House last year,
along with President Clinton and the Rev. Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Suzuki's conversion from gangster to minister is as
much a love story as a tale of an epiphany. As a young yakuza
member, he fell in love with a hostess in a bar in Osaka, a young
woman from South Korea who called herself Mariko but was born Han
Kumja.
</P>
<P>
   The two separated many times but always found themselves
reunited. They were a sad pair. Suzuki was struggling under a pile
of debt accumulated in heavy gambling binges, and Mariko was deeply
disappointed with her life in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   She began going to a Korean church, having sought solace in
Buddhism and fortunetelling but to no avail. She liked the people
she met at church, Suzuki said, and found that she felt buoyed,
although she could not explain exactly why.
</P>
<P>
   Some time later, Mariko broke her kneecap. The minister and
members of her church fasted and prayed for healing, Suzuki said,
and when Mariko went to church the next Sunday, the minister put
his hands on her broken knee and pronounced it healed.
</P>
<P>
   She walked away from church that day, and although Suzuki
regarded her religion as a silly waste of time, the recovery of her
knee fascinated him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In gambling,'' he said, ``you use dice. Dice are made from
bone, and if God could heal her bone, I figured he could probably
assist my dice and make me the best dice thrower in all of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of prayer, Suzuki's gambling skills did improve,
enabling him to pay off his debts.
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly lapsed back to his old ways, abandoning Mariko,
who had become his wife, shortly after she gave birth to their son.
``At that time, I was like a stone rolling down the hill into the
mud,'' Suzuki said.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, his debts mounted, and he drank and took drugs. He
fled Osaka and his young family, returning to Tokyo with his
favorite bar hostess in tow. He had his girlfriend call his wife
and taunt her and eventually demanded a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, he became ill. ``I thought my wife was
trying to kill me with a curse from God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring God had cured his wife's leg, he sought out a church
wedged between a brothel and a gambling parlor in a seedy section
of Shinjuku ward in Tokyo. Once there, he says, he collapsed in
front of the cross, where he stayed for three days, praying and
calling out to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carpet was soaked with my tears,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the minister finally approached him, Suzuki screamed out
that he was beyond redemption. ``I was shouting because I was
hurt,'' Suzuki said. ``I had severed two of my fingers by myself,
undergone the pain of tattooing, spent two years in jail and
deserted my wife and child.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister persisted, however, and Suzuki calmed down. He
returned to Osaka to confront his wife, and her immediate
acceptance of him despite his misdeeds clinched his faith, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that I could start over again, which I had thought was
impossible,'' he said. He was officially expelled from his gang
when he entered the seminary in 1990, but he doesn't fear reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``God is protecting me.''

 &HT;    JUDGE: MICROSOFT'S INTENT HOLDS KEY TO VERDICT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the last witness in the Microsoft antitrust
trial took the stand Monday, the presiding judge said the verdict
could well turn on whether Microsoft's indented to turn Windows
into a predatory monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's intended behavior would prove crucial in deciding
the landmark case, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
suggested to Richard Schmalensee, dean of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology business school and Microsoft's final
witness in the 21-week-long trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that's what courts do every day,'' Jackson told
Schmalensee, who had just testified that, when it comes to
measuring pricing policies, economists typically cannot
successfully measure corporate intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see for the court's purposes that intent might be
relevant,'' Jackson said, engaging Schmalensee in an unusually
spirited and prolonged dialogue over the basic issues in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we call a smoking gun,'' Jackson declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's rare, of course,'' Schmalensee shot back.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange took place during a courtroom discussion of
``predatory'' behavior that turned on whether Microsoft had crossed
the line between aggressive business tactics that are legal and
anticompetitive actions that are not.
</P>
<P>
   However Jackson should rule, his findings of fact and law will
serve as the basis of an expected appeal that's likely to be
ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. As a consequence,
both sides have sought to wind up the testimony phase of the trial
by presenting theirs strongest possible arguments.
</P>
<P>
   For Schmalensee, that meant showing Microsoft's business
practices had benefited consumers or, the very least, had caused
them no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Where Schmalensee saw Microsoft's decision to embed Internet
browser technology in the widely used Windows operating system as
the natural and normal flow continually seeking to improve the
product, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead lawyer, saw
matters quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking outside the courtroom, Boies said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they intentionally set out to lose money? Did they make
these hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars _ a billion
dollars perhaps _ (in designing the Internet Explorer browser) with
any business plan that they would very recover it other than
through the price of Windows?
</P>
<P>
   ``This witness,'' Boies concluded, ``came very, very close today
to saying that the only way they were going to recoup was through
the price of Windows. That's exactly what the government's theory
is. They can get their money back by maintaining their Windows
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies plans to cross-examine Schmalensee on this key issue
Wednesday(cq).
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states contend that Microsoft
abused its Windows monopoly power for personal computers, thereby
stunting innovation and keeping prices high. Microsoft claims it
has done no wrong in a dynamic industry where vigorous competition
remains the watchword.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara noted that the judge
wanted to know whether it was correct to also view computer makers
as consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, it's not appropriate,'' Schmalensee said. The
economist said the hardware vendors are in reality distributors who
resell Windows, ``close to the way a Chevrolet dealer resells
Chevrolets.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a Cadillac dealer alter the engine or Cadillac name on
the cars it sells, it might well serve that particular dealer's
interest by making the outlet stand out from the pack. But,
Schmalensee added, ``it would weaken the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as Schmalensee saw it, Microsoft was had every right to
impose strict conditions on the ``look and feel'' of the
Windows-loaded machines when they were shipped from the factory.

TAKING CHILDREN TO EXOTIC PLACES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 27) 
(jt) 
 By MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before I was married, in 1991, I traveled as much as I could in
what was then called the Third World. My husband, Jinx, shared my
fondness for these regions. We were determined that having children
wouldn't slow us down, so after our first daughter, Allie, was born
in 1992, we took a trial vacation to the Baja peninsula for a
couple of weeks, albeit with a rented house as our base. When Allie
was 18 months old, we departed for six months in Central America.
Our second child, Katherine, was an infant when we took off for
three years of combined work and vacation in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives were worried: What would we do in a health
emergency? Would they get enough nutritious food? Don't children
need stability and a bed they can call their own? We had questions,
too.
</P>
<P>
   I read and reread Lonely Planet's ``Travel With Children,'' now
in its third edition, by Maureen Wheeler, co-founder of the
guidebook series with her husband, Tony. It answered many of my
questions and offered crucial reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   These days, there is the Internet. Some Web sites I've found
recently include www.havechildrenwilltravel.com, a newsletter
available for $29 a year (four issues). It focuses primarily on
travel in the United States and Europe, but occasionally covers
destinations in the developing world. About.com, formerly
miningco.com, has forums and chat rooms that focus on traveling
with children at www.travelwithkids.about.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting Web site, www.familytravelforum.com, has
forums as well as links to child-friendly destinations and books. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We found that keeping the children happy was key. We didn't try
to do major jungle treks or long expeditions to ruined cities. We
went to the beach, a playground or pool. We ate outdoors when we
could. One excursion a day was enough, usually in the morning. When
we found a comfortable place, we stayed a while.
</P>
<P>
   For peace of mind medically, we joined the International
Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers, or I.a.m.A.T., a
nonprofit organization that publishes a directory of participating
doctors worldwide, all of whom speak English or French, have been
trained in a Western medical institution and pledge to charge a
fixed amount for a first visit; I used it a couple of times, with
gratifying results. The organization (membership is by donation)
also sells a freestanding mosquito net that I wish we'd had on our
trips.
</P>
<P>
   The SFO Medical Service, a joint project of the University of
California at San Francisco, San Francisco General Hospital and San
Francisco International Airport, has a Web site that covers some of
the basics of travel with children: itsa.ucsf.edu/sfomed. (Click on
``Travel Medicine.'') It also operates a clinic at the airport that
provides health care and advice.
</P>
<P>
   We continued to pay our Blue Cross premiums, to get catastrophic
coverage for expenses beyond $2,000 each. From previous travels in
Asia, I knew that doctors there are pretty good at treating local
maladies, if sometimes overly reliant on antibiotics, and that care
is inexpensive by American standards.
</P>
<P>
   If anything major were to arise, we'd fly back to the United
States, or head to Singapore, which has the region's best hospitals
and doctors. Before leaving, we had the usual vaccination updates,
as well as gamma globulin, an infectious-hepatitis prophylactic,
before our trip to Central America, and its recent successor, the
hepatitis A vaccine, before leaving for Asia. We declined the
rabies vaccine, though one doctor recommended it.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria prophylactics are a subject of some controversy; each
family should decide what's right for them with their own doctors.
Most urban and tourist centers in Asia are fairly safe from
malaria, and doctors there tend to know how to deal with it if
presented with an early enough case. To protect against mosquito
bites, we covered as much of the body as possible between dusk and
dawn, sleeping under mosquito netting and applying repellents,
first a commercial one formulated for children then a
one-to-three-parts mixture of citronella and coconut oils that we
mixed ourselves and seemed to work just as well.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of our stay Jinx did get dengue fever, a serious
disease carried by day-biting mosquitos; it cannot be prevented by
vaccination or treated except symptomatically. Jinx got his dengue
bite on a remote Thai island, but dengue fever is also on the rise
in many cities. (He was very ill for about five days and got good
care at a hospital in Chiang Mai, in northern Thailand.)
</P>
<P>
   Sanitation was a prime concern, as most travelers' ailments in
developing countries tend to be gastrointestinal. Breastfeeding an
infant, if possible, is the easiest and healthiest way to feed a
child. Well-known formula brands are easily bought _ but the
headache of washing and sterilizing the bottles along with the
questionable purity of even some of the bottled water makes it more
chancy than breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
   When my girls used bottles and cups, I washed them with tap
water and soap, rinsed them with bottled water and, when possible,
let them dry in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Asian toilets tend to be ceramic trough set in concrete, with
foot treads on either side of the hole. A basin or tank of water
nearby, with a little bucket, is used to flush. The basin water is
used only for this purpose, and you avoid touching the bucket,
except for the handle.
</P>
<P>
   Disposable diapers are widely available, although larger sizes
can be hard to find. Quality varied; we'd save good ones we'd
imported or bought in cities for nights or long bus trips, use
cheap brands for short-term duty, and, if possible (at the beach,
for instance), go without, as many Asian families did, keeping a
close eye on the toddler and cleaning up when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Diaper rash was a constant concern in the tropics; any skin
lesion is an entry point for germs. A good diaper cream is
essential, but even more so is antibacterial ointment. I applied it
to any skin lesion, on adult or child, until healed.
</P>
<P>
   When the children had a stomach upset, we followed the same
regime as for ourselves: bananas, plain rice with traces of ketchup
or soy sauce and plenty of clear fluids. (We drank bottled water;
if we ran out, in a pinch I would boil tap water.) We had come
prepared with packages of hydrating solution, a powder of
nutrients, salts and sugars that dissolves in water, but the
children refused it _ too yucky.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting a small island in southern Thailand that had a
water shortage, the girls came down with diarrhea and fever, Allie
so seriously that we were ready to take her to a hospital when the
illness subsided. During that one awful night I was tortured with
guilt; then I remembered that children in the United States get
ill, too.
</P>
<P>
   Another bit of hard-earned wisdom: Carry much less. On our first
trip with Allie, to Central America, we took an enormous backpack
stuffed with diapers, as well as a stroller, a portable crib and
other paraphernalia. On our second trip, to Asia, we abandoned the
crib, tried to get rooms with four beds and made little bunkers
with pillows and bits of luggage that managed to contain a sleeping
child fairly well. A good stroller, on the other hand, was crucial.
It allowed us to take an occasional daylong expedition that might
include a napping child and served as a high chair. I could loop
bags over its handle, and the canopy blocked the tropical sun.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy children's clothing as you go _ it's very
inexpensive, often well made and suited to the climate.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding the girls turned out to be less a problem than we'd
feared. Packages of corn crisps, rice cakes and other munchies can
be bought at every corner store and travel hub. At mealtime, our
children tended to stick with favorites available on the travelers'
circuit: pancakes, omelets, grilled cheese sandwiches and spaghetti
with tomato sauce. They shunned vegetables, but familiar fruits _
bananas, peeled apples, oranges _ helped balance their diets.

THE BIG CITY COLUMN: THIS HAZARD FOR VIRGINIA IS UNREPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Second of two John Tierney columns on Virginia and New York
City trash.) 
(jt) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Va. _ Under cover of darkness, the trucks rumble
out from an industrial complex hidden in a wooded ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Flouting the law, they speed along Virginia's roads,
distributing the environmental burden that is their cargo: bales of
newsprint amounting to 120,000 tons of solid waste per year. While
local communities struggle to pay the consequences, the profits
flow to an out-of-state corporation, The Washington Post Co.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, little attention has been paid to the perils involved
in delivering the 400,000 copies of The Washington Post printed
here each night. Virginians have been concentrating on another
out-of-state menace: the trucks delivering garbage from New York
City. The state recently put limits on the imports, in no small
part because of The Post's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper detailed the dangers of out-of-state trash last
November in a series of three front-page articles totaling more
than 12,000 words. The first article began with a grim scene of
trucks lumbering out of the Bronx, and went on to describe the
``terrifying'' and ``frightening'' hazards posed by speeding trucks
with bad safety records. It described one fatal accident on
Interstate 95 and included complaints about the incessant parade of
trash trucks, which were said to make 100,000 trips annually into
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   That statistic works out to about 275 trucks per day, which
seems less than frightening when compared with the total traffic in
the southbound lanes of Interstate 95 here: 133,000 vehicles daily,
including about 2,400 trucks not carrying trash. It doesn't even
loom large by comparison with the 1,500 trucks, vans and cars
delivering The Washington Post each day in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   How safe is the Post fleet? A New York Times investigation _
which consisted of my tailing 10 trucks leaving the plant here with
Friday's papers _ found that 90 percent of the trucks exceeded the
speed limit by at least 10 miles per hour. While those safety
violations posed little obvious danger _ the trucks were keeping
pace with other vehicles flouting the law _ records show that
trucks delivering The Post have injured people.
</P>
<P>
   My investigation did not impress Leonard Downie Jr., the
executive editor of The Post. ``It sounds silly,'' he said. ``Our
article reported serious safety problems with some trucks and
drivers, and they travel much larger distances than trucks in
Virginia making local deliveries of The Washington Post _ or The
New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, why focus on a few bad drivers hauling trash when many
others carry more hazardous cargo? In December, a tractor-trailer
ran off the road in central Virginia while carrying a bleaching
agent to the Bear Island Paper Company, a newsprint mill that
supplies The Washington Post. The chemical spilled and ignited,
forcing nearby residents to stay inside for hours to avoid toxic
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The trash industry ships generally innocuous cargo, consisting
chiefly of cardboard and paper, to be buried in new double-lined
landfills, surrounded by buffer zones of woods and fields, in rural
communities that willingly bear the environmental costs in exchange
for the economic benefits. For some reason, though, a lot of city
dwellers _ journalists, environmentalists, politicians _ are
convinced the countryside is being ruined. ``If we don't stop it
now,'' one Norfolk politician told The Post, ``we won't have any
space left but one big dump.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the big new Virginia garbage pits together amount to
only three square miles. That leaves more than 40,000 square miles
in the rest of the state, including 243 occupied by the timberland
that supplies the newsprint mill at Bear Island.
</P>
<P>
   That newsprint eventually turns into solid waste that must be
collected for either recycling or disposal. Based on the average
cost of collecting and processing solid waste, Virginia taxpayers
are spending at least $5 million annually to get rid of old copies
of The Post, and tens of millions of dollars to handle all the
other newspapers that ran articles about Virginians being exploited
by trash-exporting New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider that New Yorkers last year sent more than $50
million to Virginia along with their trash, you might wonder who's
exploiting whom. If Virginians really care about their fiscal
health and their roads and their environment, maybe they shouldn't
worry so much about out-of-state trash.
</P>
<P>
   It's an awkward question to ask in these pages, but is it time
for them to limit out-of-state newspapers?

MARKET PLACE: THE 2 FACES OF JANUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In April, Janus 20 sat atop the mutual fund world. It was the
best performer of any large stock fund, having doubled investors'
money since the start of 1998. And it had taken in so much money so
fast _ nearly $7 billion in four months _ that Janus said it would
close the fund to ``deliver superior performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the fund has once more earned a prominent place on the
performance charts _ this time, at the bottom. In fact, through
Thursday, it ranked as the 15th worst-performing general equity
fund of 4,008 funds in the second quarter, according to Lipper, the
Summit, N.J., mutual fund data company.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's concentration in 20 to 30 stocks _ mostly big growth
companies like America Online, Dell Computer, Microsoft and a
handful of pharmaceutical companies _ carried it to lofty heights
the last two years. But some of those same holdings proved a drag
on performance this spring, when the strengthening global economy
prompted investors to shift to shares of cyclical companies and
other value stocks that had lagged behind the broader market.
</P>
<P>
   So far this quarter, Janus 20 is down 4.4 percent, compared with
a 5.2 percent gain in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and an
10.9 percent gain in the Dow Jones industrial average. That was in
spite of a bounce the last week that lifted the fund's return from
a loss of 13.2 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The decline shows the pitfalls of buying funds that have
concentrated bets in one sector, especially in a volatile area like
technology. It also demonstrates what so often happens to investors
who rush into a fund before it closes: They regret it. In fact,
investors often pick exactly the wrong time to throw their money
in.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, new money had been accumulating at Janus 20, which
is managed by Janus Capital Corp., a unit of Kansas City Southern
Industries, at an average of nearly $500 million a week before the
fund was closed. According to AMG Data Services, an Arcata, Calif.,
fund-tracking company, the inflow peaked the week ended April 14 _
the height of IRA season _ with investors pouring in $654.6 million
just as the fund's performance began to slide.
</P>
<P>
   Fund investors ``tend to be very poor buyers in terms of timing,
and the more volatile the area, the worse their timing decisions
usually are,'' said Scott Cooley, an analyst at Morningstar Inc.,
the Chicago fund tracker. ``There is a lot of risk in having all of
your money pretty much in a specific style that is fairly volatile,
and Janus has a lot of shareholders who have come to it recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schoelzel, the fund's manager, said Monday that he is not
altering his strategy. The portfolio is invested largely as it was
at the start of the year, though Schoelzel said he has trimmed
holdings in drug companies like Pfizer and Eli Lilly. ``I should
have recognized we were going to go into a period of time when the
news flow from the pharmaceuticals was going to be less than
upbeat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To complement the fund's biggest names, like America Online and
Dell, Schoelzel said, he has been aggressively buying a few other
large-capitalization growth stocks. He's also sitting on about 15
percent cash, though he says that's not a reflection of any
bearishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, I kind of expected there would be a period of
time where the fund would have trouble,'' he said. ``For the most
part we didn't get shaken out of anything, but I've got to tell
you, I have a lot more gray hair than I had in March.''
</P>
<P>
   The average stock in the fund is trading at close to 50 times
earnings, according to Morningstar, high by almost any measure.
Schoelzel's justification: Old valuation yardsticks don't mean much
anymore. The market, he said, ``is going to vacillate from being
expensive to really expensive for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   He also doesn't buy the argument that investors ought to shift
to stocks with lower valuations and cyclical stocks that rise with
a strengthening economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me how panicky the market gets,'' he said,
``to think we can change the direction of a $7 trillion economy
with a 25-basis-point'' increase in short-term interest rates. His
reference was to the quarter-percentage point rise that the Federal
Reserve is expected to make at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Like Janus 20, many of the funds in the Janus group have their
biggest positions in large-cap growth stocks, with a strong
technology bent. The other funds have not taken such a beating, but
as Janus 20 goes, so may they.
</P>
<P>
   Janus has a deep stable of analysts and more stockpicking talent
than most firms, Cooley of Morningstar said. ``But it's still very
dangerous from a firm-wide perspective to have so many eggs in one
basket.''

ANALYSIS: WITH VOTING COMPLETED IN INDONESIA, THE MANEUVERING
BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesians have remained remarkably
patient as they wait out the slow, confused counting of the
parliamentary votes they cast two weeks ago. But it seems that
whatever the outcome, the will of the people may in large part be
denied.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, it has become clear that the 112 million votes
that were cast in the first free election in a generation were just
the starting gun in a rough-and-tumble scramble for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's excruciatingly complex electoral system is not due
to produce a new president until November. Analyzing the numbers
and the politics, though, some experts now predict a close finish
between the incumbent, President B.J. Habibie, and his main
challenger, Megawati Sukarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
   With Mrs. Megawati projected to win a clear plurality of the
popular vote, such an outcome would result as much from back-room
deals and unelected delegates as from the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Second, although the watchword of the election was ``reform,''
none of the leading contenders for the presidency is a reformer at
heart. It is possible, some analysts suggest, that once a new
government is in place, the momentum for political and social
change may peter out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too optimistic that a reform agenda will come from
this election,'' said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a leading political
analyst who is also an adviser to Habibie. ``The agenda that was
upheld by the students and several public figures will be delayed
for another five or 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That agenda includes a reduction of the military's political
role; amendments to the vaguely written and undemocratic
Constitution; reducing central government control with some form of
federalism; independence for the disputed territory of East Timor,
and an investigation and possible trial of former President Suharto
and his family for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some analysts go so far as to suggest that Habibie, who
leads Golkar, the party of Suharto, who was forced to resign last
year, is more liberal than Mrs. Megawati, the candidate of the
opposition Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, or PDIP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lot of sense of irony that Golkar is seen
as the status quo party but is headed by one of the most
Westernized figures in Indonesian political history, whereas PDIP,
the party of reform, is led by a lady solidly rooted in the feudal
past,'' said John Bresnan, an Indonesia expert at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie, though a lifelong acolyte of Suharto, spent 20 years
working as an engineer in Germany, where, Bresnan says, he absorbed
Western values of democracy and human rights. Mrs. Megawati is the
daughter of Indonesia's founding president, Sukarno, and has spent
her life within the country's political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Her reform credentials come from her opposition to Suharto _ or
rather, from his opposition to her rising political profile _
rather than from any personal philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always been very conservative and disappointing to many
of us,'' said Goenawan Muhamad, a writer and political analyst. He
noted that when students recently issued a mock ``Suharto Award''
to enemies of reform, Mrs. Megawati placed fourth, just behind
Habibie and two of his ministers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though she has remained exasperatingly vague about any political
beliefs she may hold, Mrs. Megawati appears to be resisting the
main demands of the reform movement that has flourished since it
helped to bring down Suharto. Much of her electoral support came
from people who yearn for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the election is over, I believe political reform will
slow down because the parties that are winning are basically
conservative parties,'' said Hidayat Jati, a political analyst for
The Castle Group, a consulting company for foreign investors.
``This is clearly not going to be the expected divorce from the
past that these college kids and activist leaders and
over-enthusiastic voters were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jati and the other analysts may well be right, but they are well
ahead of the game. Only about 75 percent of the ``quick count'' has
been completed so far, and the official count is only in its early
stages.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, electoral fraud appears to have played only a
peripheral role. Only a few small parties that have been left far
behind in the field of 48 are claiming that the overall vote was
invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, most analysts agree, has been inexperience,
poor planning, incompetence and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an interim report on Sunday, American election monitors from
the Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute praised
``the commitment to democracy, openness and transparency'' of the
election administration and local monitoring groups. But it said
the complicated vote counting system had aroused ``confusion and
some suspicion'' among the public.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the next stage of the process gets going, people may
have even more reason to be confused and suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   With the votes still being counted, the real action has moved
behind closed doors, where hard-nosed deals are being cut among
parties, factions of parties and interest groups, which notably
include the politically powerful military.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This undemocratic procedure is mostly built into the system. If
the process were to stop now with the counting of the popular vote,
a foreign diplomat said, Mrs. Megawati would be in a position to
form a coalition that, under political pressure, might reflect a
reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you bring in all these other elements, and it takes on a
very different look,'' he said. ``You get something in which the
people's sovereignty has been taken away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The popular vote involved only 462 seats in a 700-member
assembly that will choose the next president. The other, unelected,
seats will come from the military, from social and professional
groups, and from provincial assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   All the seats, both elected and appointed, are subject to
lobbying, coalition-building and illegal vote-buying. Parliamentary
delegates are not required to support the parties they represent.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all these variables, several analysts said they could
see a neck-and-neck race developing between coalitions built around
Habibie and Mrs. Megawati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are seeing two reasonably evenly-matched coalitions
that will emerge from this,'' a Western election expert said. In
such a case, the military _ which has remained studiously neutral _
could be the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps not. Having gone through an elaborate parsing of the
available numbers, the election expert stepped back and produced a
disclaimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in for a period of complete uncertainty, really,'' he
conceded. ``Complete uncertainty.''

   KOSOVO-WOMEN-ASSAULT (Zrze, Yugoslavia) _ In interviews over the
last two weeks, dozens of women and men in Kosovo and in refugee

Serbian forces to strike at the heart of a society in which the

   EXPERIMENTAL-PATIENTS (Undated) _ Chronically ill patients with
limited or no health insurance are increasingly filling a demand
for experimental drug study participants as drug companies rush
record numbers of new medications through the testing process. For
these people, experiments have become treatments; clinical
investigators are their specialists. But the benefit can be
fleeting or nonexistent. Chronically ill patients with no other
options can be treated with an experimental medication that does
not work or that even worsens their condition. Or they can end up
with a placebo rather than the medication itself. And once the
study is over, usually in a matter of weeks, they are left to their
own devices. By Gina Kolata and Kurt Eichenwald.

MILOSEVIC SEEN AS EASILY WITHSTANDING PROTESTS AND CALLS FOR
CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A small group of Yugoslav opposition
parties said Monday that it would call demonstrations this weekend
to demand early elections and democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   But Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is considered highly
unlikely to call early elections, senior government officials said
Monday. The term of the federal parliament does not expire until
2001 and the Serbian parliament until 2002, while Milosevic's own
single term runs through the spring of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic's political position is considered to be weaker
now, after the defeat by NATO in Kosovo, rumors of his removal
appear highly exaggerated, even opposition figures here admit.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Orthodox Church has called for his resignation,
there is unfocused unhappiness in the army, which considers itself
undefeated in Kosovo, and Serbian refugees from that province held
another small protest Monday in Belgrade, easily broken up by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic appears to retain a bedrock of popular support, 20
percent in recent opinion surveys, and there is no other political
figure who comes close to him. The most popular alternative is an
unpredictable former democratic opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic has moved into the government and outside of it,
and his political image is considered muddied, said Srbobran
Brankovic, a pollster and political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has turned his back on the idea of a transitional
Serbian government to be led by Draskovic, the officials say, and
appears to be planning to tough out the protests. The NATO air
campaign caused perhaps $40 billion worth of destruction, American
officials estimate, and did considerable damage to electrical power
stations, roads, bridges and factories.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials also say they can offer Yugoslav
opposition figures little more than advice, moral support, and
relatively small amounts of aid to independent media outlets,
presuming that diplomatic relations are soon restored.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, a senior Clinton administration diplomat, Robert
S. Gelbard, met Yugoslav opposition figures _ minus Draskovic _ in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking the opposition to be an opposition and to aspire
to be a government, and to take steps within the constitutional
framework to do that,'' another senior Clinton administration
official said by telephone Monday. ``But the help we can provide is
limited. It's partly moral support and partly advice,'' as well as
a continuing isolation of Yugoslavia so long as Milosevic, an
indicted war criminal, continues to lead it.
</P>
<P>
   The call for protest rallies comes from one of the smallest of
Yugoslavia's opposition groups, the Alliance for Change, which gets
only about 2 percent of the vote. Still, it follows Draskovic's
call on Sunday for a new interim government, early elections,
democratic reforms and a free press to try to reintegrate
Yugoslavia into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That call brought a quick attack on Draskovic by the state
television and other media as a corrupt opportunist who would do
anything to curry favor with the West.
</P>
<P>
   In general, said Brankovic, the political scientist, democratic
opposition leaders face the problem of calling for exactly the sort
of change publicly advocated by the Western alliance that has just
been bombing the country and its army and that has occupied Kosovo,
the historical heartland of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Change said demonstrations would start in
central Serbian towns where the opposition is already strong and
where there were protests against the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturday we'll gather in Cacak and Kraljevo to demand early
elections on all levels and freedom of media,'' said Vladan Batic,
the group's coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Another official of the Alliance for Change, Milan Protic, said,
``This is the last minute to reverse the present political course
in Serbia and to demand the responsibility of those who have had
unlimited power in the decision-making process over the last 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   But senior Yugoslav officials did not seem concerned about such
protests Monday. ``Milosevic is not going anywhere,'' one said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bratislav Grubacic, an independent analyst here, said Milosevic
was weaker in important institutions like the church, the Serbian
Academy of Sciences and even the army. But he said the opposition
was also divided and was afraid to shed blood, while being
convinced that Milosevic would do whatever is necessary to remain
in power.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1996-97, Milosevic waited out huge
demonstrations against him led by Draskovic and Zoran Djindjic of
the Democratic Party. But the two opposition leaders split and are
now sharp rivals. Milosevic has thus far successfully played off
Draskovic against the ultranationalist leader of the Radical Party,
Vojislav Seselj, who has agreed not to vote against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs from Kosovo staged a small protest in central Belgrade
Monday for the second day in a row, but there were more journalists
than protesters. After about half an hour, the police rather
politely led off the organizer, Svetozar Fisic, a Democratic Party
official from Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   The group called on Milosevic and the United Nations to protect
the Serbs of Kosovo, to stop violence by the Kosovo Liberation Army
and its supporters there and to treat the refugees with full
rights. They said they would be willing to return to Kosovo
eventually, as Belgrade urges, but only if their security can be
guaranteed.

CLINTON HOLDS UP SLOVENIA AS A MODEL FOR REFORM-MINDED YUGOSLAVS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia _ This tiny new nation perched on the
Adriatic was held up Monday by President Clinton as a shining
example of what was possible if a people decided to stand up to the
ethnic terror of Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   He came here, Clinton said, to draw attention to the fact that
Southeastern Europe, now the favored name for the Balkans, could
produce a country that is free and prosperous. Slovenia, Clinton
added, had shown that it was possible to reject ``the murderous
rule'' of Milosevic, the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia has to ``choose the path that Slovenia has chosen, where
people reach across the old divides and find strength in their
differences and their common humanity,'' Clinton said to a crowd of
several thousand in the city square who had waited for hours in the
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip to Europe has centered on finding ways to rescue
the debris caused by the conflict in Kosovo, patching together
plans for aid packages to Kosovo and the rest of the region and
mending the relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing the little known country of Slovenia, Clinton was
trying to stress the positive. In June 1991, Slovenia declared
independence from Yugoslavia, and when Milosevic sent in the
Yugoslav army, the Slovenians stood firm under the leadership of
Milan Kucan, who is now president and whom Clinton met Monday.
After what became known as a largely bloodless 10-day war, Slovenia
declared independence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton congratulated the Slovenes, saying: ``Eight years ago,
Mr. Milosevic triggered a military assault on your nation. But you
resisted. You secured your freedom. And you proclaimed it will
never be the same again.''
</P>
<P>
   But in singling out Slovenia, Clinton dwelled on a place with
unusual characteristics in the former Yugoslavia. Slovenia, a
country of two million people, is almost ethnically and religiously
unified. About 2 percent of the population are Serbs, and the
country is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. The Slovenes are proud of
their own language, which is Slavic, written in the Roman script
and dates from the 12th century.
</P>
<P>
   Since separating from Yugoslavia, Slovenia's economy has bounded
ahead. The European Union granted Slovenia associate status, and
the country is trying to meet targets that would allow it to join
the European Union early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Clinton's trip was a reward for a large
disappointment. Slovenia had banked on joining NATO, and its
rejection for membership, along with Romania, several years ago,
was a severe blow. Clinton tried to assuage the blow by saying
Monday that Slovenia was ``an excellent candidate for NATO.'' But
he promised no more.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO will formally decide to expand further, after
accepting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as members this
year, remains an open question.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived from Bonn, Germany, where he attended a meeting
of the United States and the European Union on trade and other
issues. Near the top of the agenda again was organizing the
reconstruction of Kosovo and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In Bonn, Clinton said he was in favor of German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's idea of bringing leaders together in Sarajevo,
perhaps as early as next month, to plan for the Balkans' future.
Clinton said the gathering should be modeled after the development
of the Marshall Plan, when the benefactors met with the devastated
countries in Europe after World War II and fashioned a far-reaching
rebuilding program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a separate donors conference would be organized to
finance the immediate reconstruction projects. Such projects would
focus on Kosovo. An additional conference would be planned for the
fall to gather the financing for long-term needs, Clinton said.
Clinton repeated that the United States opposed financing
reconstruction in Serbia while Milosevic remained in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it be a good thing if Serbia had a democratic leader who
didn't do things like what we've seen in Bosnia and in Kosovo?''
Clinton asked at a news conference in Bonn. ``Of course, it would.
And I can't wait for the day when that happens.''

<P>
   ZRZE, Yugoslavia _ The 22-year-old woman, married four months
ago, said she was taken from this small southern village by Serbian
forces, held for a day in the local police station, beaten, then
threatened with death. But she was not, she said, raped.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Behan Thaqi, thinks differently. ``I am 100 percent
certain that they raped her,'' said Thaqi, 34, a farmer imprisoned
by the Serbs for supplying weapons to the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the Albanian guerrillas who fought Serbian forces. ``I know that
when women get in their hands, there is no chance to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Thaqi says his wife denies the rape because ``she doesn't dare
tell that kind of story.'' If she admitted it to him, he said, ``I
would ask for a divorce _ even if I had 20 children.'' As his wife
listened, silent and shamefaced, in a corner of their empty home,
looted of all furniture and possessions by the Serbs, Thaqi added:
``I don't hate her, but the story is before my eyes. I feel very
cold toward her.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissing her, he said, ``is like kissing a dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few more harsh illustrations of the difficulties in
getting Kosovo Albanian women to talk about being raped by Serbian
forces than these words from Thaqi, a rough-spoken man with an
eighth-grade education. Not all Kosovo Albanian men share his
attitudes, but the majority of male villagers do.
</P>
<P>
   A horrific social stigma accompanies rape in Kosovo, bringing
lifelong shame to a woman and her family. It is the biggest problem
that human rights organizations face as they begin to collect
information on whether Serbian forces used rape as a premeditated
tactic. The act has been classified as a war crime by the
international war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the past two weeks, dozens of women and men
in Kosovo and in refugee camps in Albania told stories suggesting
that sexual assault and intimidation, if not rape, were widespread,
used by Serbian forces to strike at the heart of a Muslim society
in which the virginity and fidelity of women are central.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no solid evidence of systematic rapes by the
Serbs, as was reported in Bosnia, and not a single woman said in
the interviews that she was sexually penetrated by a Serbian
soldier. But one woman, Vase Racaj, 35, said she saw women being
raped. She said that on the afternoon of April 27, Serbian
paramilitary forces in black masks pulled 10 young women out of a
refugee convoy of trucks, cars and tractors that she was in. It had
been heading toward the town of Prizren and the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Racaj, who is from the small southern town of Kline, said 10
men then raped the women in an open field about 30 feet from the
road, in view of the women's families, who were held at gunpoint by
Serbian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, Ms. Racaj said, the paramilitary forces slashed
the women's pants around their thighs, then put the women on a
large truck heading toward the border with her and the women's
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were crying and saying, `Better dead than what they did
to us,''' Ms. Racaj said, as her own eyes filled with tears.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year-old teacher from the city of Mitrovica, who agreed to
be identified only by her last name, Avdullahi, said she was
threatened with rape on a bridge while a Serbian soldier held a gun
to her father-in-law's throat, but she eventually was allowed to go
free.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, who asked that only her first name, Zyrafete, be
used, said that she was sexually assaulted at knifepoint in the
village of Dragacin in southern Kosovo. Both Zyrafete, 23, and
another woman from the same village, Sherife Trolli, 48, said that
about 300 women were held in three houses for three days in the
village, with about one-third of them in each house.
</P>
<P>
   Every night Serbian soldiers dragged three to four women out of
each house for an hour or two each, Zyrafete and Ms. Trolli said.
The women were returned to the house sobbing and refused to tell
the other women what had happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees told of Serbian soldiers who took away the most
beautiful women from the groups driven from their homes, and five
men from Mitrovica said Serbs had written on a wall at a city high
school, ``We're going to rape your women, and they will give birth
to Serbian children.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no solid proof in Kosovo of the kind of
systematic rape of tens of thousands of women that was reported in
Bosnia, or of Bosnian ``rape camps'' where women were held captive
for days, repeatedly assaulted and often killed afterward. Nor was
there any mention of rape in the war crimes tribunal's indictment
last month of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, for
crimes against humanity, although the chief prosecutor has said she
expects to expand the charges.
</P>
<P>
   But just as in Bosnia, investigators expect that more evidence
and testimony from women will come to light over the next months,
after one million refugees settle back home and bury their dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too soon,'' said Valentina Gjuraj, a 24-year-old
journalist in the western city of Djakovica, where one of the worst
massacres of the Serbian terror campaign occurred. ``I found five
bodies yesterday,'' she said. ``They were the bodies of my best
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, State Department officials in Washington say they have
received refugee reports that Serbs were using the Hotel Karagac in
the town of Pec and an army camp near Djakovica as rape camps.
Human Rights Watch has reported the rape of two women in Dragacin.
And the United Nations Population Fund has released a report that
Kosovo Albanian women ``were individually raped by many men,'' and
``sometimes even for days.''
</P>
<P>
   But the report did not specify the number of women raped or
interviewed; nor did it give details of specific cases.
</P>
<P>
   Djakovica, once beautiful, is a city in the shadow of the
Accursed Mountains where last week shocked citizens asked reporters
they met on the street to come see the burned bodies in their
backyards. Virtually everyone who was questioned there reported
hearing talk about the existence of a rape camp, either near the
Serbian army barracks by a stadium or near additional barracks next
to a church.
</P>
<P>
   One woman said she had heard that 12 women committed suicide
after being in the rape camp. But no one had any real information,
either because they had just come back from refugee camps, had been
hiding for two months in their homes or, perhaps, were afraid to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the Djakovica offices of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
rebels who only days ago moved into the city's cultural center to
operate as an unofficial local government, there was no uncertainty
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there was a camp,'' said Shkendije Hoda, 28, a slight
woman with a revolver in her back pocket who described herself as
the commander for information and who said she had just come out
from hiding in the hills two days before.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoda based her assertion on information from women she
knows, describing them as witnesses to the camps, and she said that
the rebels would soon be collecting their own information on rape.
For now, Ms. Hoda said the women's stories are ``secret.'' She
added that rape was a strategy of war by the Serbs ``to destroy the
spirit of the brave soldiers of the Kosovo Liberation Army.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, she said, left many raped women alive as
psychological torture. Women ``are not as afraid of death as they
are of rape,'' Ms. Hoda said. ``This is the weakest side of
women.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Over in Cabrat, the once-lovely neighborhood that is Djakovica's
oldest _ where house after big house was burned to ashes and rubble
_ Afrim Domi spoke in a neighbor's still-standing home about his
daughter, Yllka, 17. He said she shouted, ``Better to kill me than
to rape me,'' while running out of the family house and into the
woods after Serbian soldiers surrounded the family on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Domi said his daughter was shot in the leg while fleeing, and
that he has not been able to find her. She ran, he said, because
Serbian soldiers had tried to rape her days earlier, though she
escaped at that time, after she witnessed the rape of another
Djakovica teen-ager in front of the girl's family.
</P>
<P>
   But that girl's father, whose hands trembled in an interview,
said the Serbs had not touched his daughter, who was at that moment
safe with him at home. As he spoke on the family porch, his
brother, the girl's uncle, came out to loudly interrupt that there
were no rapes in Djakovica, but, ``If rape was going on here, they
only raped women from other towns.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the most extensive accounts of sexual assault was given
by Zyrafete, the woman who was held with the 300 others in the
village of Dragacin. Zyrafete, 23, the mother of a four-year-old
boy, was herded with a large group of women and children into a
central area of the village on April 20. After she wound up with
100 other women held captive for three days in a house, Serbian
police pulled her out of the group one morning, she said, and
ordered her to make them coffee.
</P>
<P>
   When she told them she wanted to bring along her son, they said
no, then pushed the 4-year-old into the basement with some other
women. Her son became hysterical, Zyrafete said, and cried out to
his mother, ``Do they want to kill you?'' Zyrafete told him not to
worry, that she would be back.
</P>
<P>
   The police took her into another room, she said, demanded money,
asked if her husband was a member of the rebels _ she said no _
then ordered her at gunpoint to wash dishes, make coffee and clean
their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finished all these things, one policeman said, `Take
off your clothes,''' Zyrafete said. ``I said, `Better that you
should kill me.''' She said the policeman kicked her, slapped her
in the face, then ordered others to continue beating her. One
policeman, she said, put a knife to her throat. ``He said, `Take
off your clothes or I will kill you,''' Zyrafete said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Zyrafete said, she fainted, and regained
consciousness later, lying on the floor in only her underwear. ``I
was crying,'' she said. ``I didn't know what had happened to me.''
She put her clothes back on, and a policeman returned her to the
room with the women.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crucial missing details of her account, Zyrafete
said she is convinced that she was not raped. Two weeks after the
assault _ when it is unclear how much physical evidence there might
have been _ Zyrafete said she went to the gynecologist at her
refugee camp in Kukes, Albania. ``The doctor said I hadn't been
raped,'' Zyrafete said. Then she added: ``I think a lot of women
have been raped. But women don't want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Officials at the maternity hospital in Kukes, Albania, the grimy
mountain border town where 120,000 refugees made their temporary
home during the war, say that abortions tripled after the refugees
began arriving in April, going from around one a day to three. But
the director of the hospital, Safet Elezi, said no refugee woman
had said she had been raped and that many sought abortions because
their husbands were missing and they were living in tents.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, across the border in Zrze, the 22-year-old woman who
said she was not raped, and whose husband said she was, had just
arrived home from Kukes. The neighbors had been asking her, she
said, what happened when the Serbian soldiers took her away. She
told them she was beaten, not raped, but said she is still ashamed
that she was the one the soldiers singled out.
</P>
<P>
   To her husband of four months, everything is ``black,'' and the
future with his young wife is grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no will,'' he said, ``to have children.''

BUSH WILL NEED MORE THAN EXPECTATIONS TO CONTINUE CAMPAIGN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Although the law of gravity often catches up with
high-flying White House campaigns, there was no way Texas Gov.
George W. Bush was going to let anything _ or anyone _ spoil his
first for-real campaign tour.
</P>
<P>
   Not questions about his ``young and irresponsible'' past. Not
questions about abortion. Not challenges of his ``compassionate
conservatism.'' Not even the million and one logistical details of
handling the largest traveling army of reporters and camera crews
ever to accompany a presidential candidate on his first trips to
Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign had recruited scores of volunteers with
invaluable experience at handling presidential trips and national
campaigns to ensure that hotel rooms were ready, buses were on time
and stages for well-staged campaign events were properly set.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the technical machinery of the four-day foray
performed very well. So did the candidate, as most of America
probably knows by now.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to suggest that Bush can start writing his inaugural
address or planning his Cabinet. Although he is clearly the
candidate to beat for the Republican nomination, no one _ not even
popular, well-funded sons of former presidents _ can be considered
unbeatable this early in a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has left the friendly Governor's Mansion in Austin
to meet other contenders head-to-head in key nominating states,
Bush will be forced to more precisely define himself on taxes,
foreign policy, Social Security and other important issues _ and
his huge lead in voter preference polls will tighten.
</P>
<P>
   In most respects, Bush continued to enjoy something of a
honeymoon on his first out-of-state trip. In his first extended
news conference with the national media, he faced some pointed
questions on abortion, taxes and his own past, but he survived
them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his events were well-organized, well-managed media
affairs or fund-raisers for Republican congressmen, not the type of
personal, retail politicking that voters in Iowa and New Hampshire
have come to expect of would-be presidents.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to be up-close and personal when three bus loads
of reporters and media technicians are following a candidate
around, but Bush promised a greater degree of intimacy on
subsequent trips, when his press contingent will likely be smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Even on his first campaign swing, the Texan had several
occasions to work the crowd, and he did it well, obviously enjoying
the opportunities and even _ sorry, governor _ inspiring some
national media comparisons to Bill Clinton's masterful command of a
rope line.
</P>
<P>
   Bush kissed babies, shook countless hands, signed almost as many
autographs and posed for hundreds of snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   In a packed reception for his New Hampshire supporters at a
small college in Goffstown, it took Bush a full hour to make his
way from the podium after his speech, through the crowd and out to
a waiting bus.
</P>
<P>
   Grinning all the way, he paused at one point to thump a Texas
reporter on the stomach and exclaim, ``It's wild!'' Or something
like that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush even managed to handle what little dissent he encountered
along his well-scripted route.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief question-and-answer session with real people at a
fire station in Bow, N.H., a heckler standing on the back of a
camera platform tried to challenge the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the flag amendment?'' the man asked, referring to a
proposed constitutional amendment to outlaw desecration of the
American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for it,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the First Amendment and freedom of speech?'' the
questioner persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're exercising it,'' Bush shot back, to the delight of the
rest of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But when the heckler tried to ask a third question, the governor
cut him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not exercising free speech anymore,'' Bush cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not a spellbinding orator. But he delivered his stump
speech, an expanded version of what he has been saying in Texas for
a long time now, well enough. He misspoke a couple of times but
committed no serious gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   He remained in control and obviously enjoyed the excursion _
``sky high'' was how he described himself after his first day in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appropriately dubbed his first campaign plane, ``Great
Expectations,'' because great expectations _ his own and those of
many other Republicans _ have gotten him this far.
</P>
<P>
   He will need more than expectations, though, to carry him the
rest of the way.

CELLPHONE COSTS DOWN 38 PERCENT SINCE 1996 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wireless telephone costs have dropped by 38 percent since 1996
in North America, but cellular phones continue to be considerably
more expensive in the United States than in many European and
Canadian cities, according to a new study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As of the first quarter of this year, Boston-area wireless phone
owners were paying an average of 36 cents a minute, factoring in
monthly access fees and taxes, according to a study by The Yankee
Group, a Boston telecommunications analysis firm.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers _ particularly heavy users spending 30 minutes a day
or more on the cell phone _ have benefited from ``an aggressive
pace'' of cost reductions, the report said, but they are still
paying much higher rates than residents of two dozen other cities
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's 36-cent average compared to 32 cents in Chicago, 33 in
Los Angeles and 40 in New York. In some developed countries,
however, rates were far lower: 8 cents in Toronto, 12 cents in
Seoul, 15 cents in Tel Aviv, and 20 cents in Hong Kong and
Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those cities have lower rates in part because of fierce
competition and because they use a system known as ``calling party
pays,'' where incoming calls are charged to the person making the
call, not the cell phone owner. US authorities are proposing to
adopt calling party pays rules by next year.
</P>
<P>
   For people using a wireless phone 60 minutes a month, Boston was
the fourth most expensive city of the 31 studied, exceeded only by
Paris, Tokyo and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Expressed another way, the average Boston cell phone user would
pay 1.5 percent of his salary for 100 minutes of cell phone calling
per month. That compares to under 1 percent in Toronto, and just
over 1 percent in Helsinki, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv and Rome, but 3 to
5 percent in some Asian and Latin American cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simplification along with reduction of wireless tariffs is a
key factor to increase wireless usage,'' said Christiane Mahler,
principal author of the report. Globally, Mahler said, wireless
costs will drop by another 33 percent by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   In US cities and Toronto, the greatest cost declines have been
enjoyed by heavy users, those racking up 500 minutes a month or
more, whose costs dropped by 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While relatively high compared to rates in other developed
countries, compared to land-line calling, US wireless charges have
dropped below the threshhold at which many analysts believe a
significant number of consumers will begin to switch over to using
a wireless phone full-time.
</P>
<P>
   In North American cities, heavy users spending more than about
35 minutes a day on their wireless phone, or 1,000 minutes a month,
paid 106 percent more per minute than they would have for land-line
calls.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe the premium was 185 percent, while in much of the rest
of the world wireless calls continue to cost 5 times more than
land-line.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Yankee research found that US wireless users estimate
they have used wireless phones to replace 12 percent of their
land-line calling, and expect to increase that share to 17 percent
by 2001. ``Dramatic rate reductions are making wireless an
affordable alternative'', said Mark Lowenstein, senior vice
president of the Yankee Group's global wireless practice.

COURT AGREES TO REVIEW ANTI-SMUT LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether a
federal law designed to protect children from sexually-explicit
cable channels violates the free-speech rights of cable TV networks
such as Playboy Television.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said they will review a Clinton administration
appeal aimed at reviving the 1996 law, which was struck down last
year by a three-judge U.S. District Court in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   That court said the law went too far in trying to keep children
from seeing sex-oriented programs on networks that are only partly
scrambled for non-subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The law required cable operators that don't fully scramble, or
block, sex-oriented networks for non-subscribers to show those
channels' ``indecent'' programs _ even to paying subscribers _ only
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, cable operators have several types of technology for
scrambling and unscrambling TV signals, but the effectiveness
varies depending on the weather, the quality of the equipment, its
installation and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The government's appeal of the three-judge panel's ruling said
society has an interest ``in seeing to it that children are not
exposed to sexually explicit materials.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-smut law was enacted as part of the 1996 Communications
Decency Act after complaints arose that even though sex-oriented
channels are scrambled for non-subscribers, the picture and sound
sometimes get through in what cable operators call ``signal
bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's appeal cited testimony from a Cape Coral, Fla.,
woman who said she found her seven-year-old daughter and
eight-year-old son and a playmate ``transfixed'' one afternoon at 4
p.m. as they were watching scenes on the Spice channel of a couple
seemingly having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy had challenged the law in 1996, saying it violated the
Constitution's First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy's lawyers said that under the law, cable operators
already give subscribers, free of charge, the ability to completely
block any channel once they request such action.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge court agreed with Playboy, saying that giving
customers adequate notice of their ability to block any channel for
free would be a less-restrictive alternative to barring all daytime
adult-oriented programming.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Justice Department argued in a brief that relying
on individual households to request the blocking of sex-oriented
channels failed to guarantee that children would not have access to
this material.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would certainly be parents _ perhaps a large number of
parents _ who out of inertia, indifference or distraction, simply
would take no action to block signal bleed, even if fully informed
of the problem and even if offered a relatively easy solution,''
Solicitor General Seth Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   The invalidated law ``imposes a very limited restriction on
speech and is a very effective approach to the substantial evil it
addresses,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy's lawyers disagreed, saying it was ``far from obvious''
that adult-oriented channels were more harmful than other premium
channels that show movies with profane content. They said a film
called ``Another 48 Hours,'' shown on HBO, averaged one profanity
every 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After the high court's decision to hear the case was announced,
Playboy Television lawyer Robert Corn-Revere said that the law was
``unnecessary overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the law requires ``turning off Playboy Television for
two thirds of the day'' even though two thirds of American
households don't have children. Many televisions these days have
technology allowing the owner to block a particular channel, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voluntary solutions are far more effective to block unwanted
programming,'' Corn-Revere said.
</P>
<P>
   The court, nearing the end of its 1998-99 term, planned to
announce more decisions Tuesday, and the justices could release all
remaining decisions and begin their summer recess later this week.

 &HT;    JUDGE: MICROSOFT'S INTENT HOLDS KEY TO VERDICT
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects ``Microsoft's'' to ``Microsoft `` in lede.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the last witness in the Microsoft antitrust
trial took the stand Monday, the presiding judge said the verdict
could well turn on whether Microsoft indented to turn Windows into
a predatory monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's intended behavior would prove crucial in deciding
the landmark case, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
suggested to Richard Schmalensee, dean of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology business school and Microsoft's final
witness in the 21-week-long trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that's what courts do every day,'' Jackson told
Schmalensee, who had just testified that, when it comes to
measuring pricing policies, economists typically cannot
successfully measure corporate intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see for the court's purposes that intent might be
relevant,'' Jackson said, engaging Schmalensee in an unusually
spirited and prolonged dialogue over the basic issues in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we call a smoking gun,'' Jackson declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's rare, of course,'' Schmalensee shot back.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange took place during a courtroom discussion of
``predatory'' behavior that turned on whether Microsoft had crossed
the line between aggressive business tactics that are legal and
anticompetitive actions that are not.
</P>
<P>
   However Jackson should rule, his findings of fact and law will
serve as the basis of an expected appeal that's likely to be
ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. As a consequence,
both sides have sought to wind up the testimony phase of the trial
by presenting theirs strongest possible arguments.
</P>
<P>
   For Schmalensee, that meant showing Microsoft's business
practices had benefited consumers or, the very least, had caused
them no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Where Schmalensee saw Microsoft's decision to embed Internet
browser technology in the widely used Windows operating system as
the natural and normal flow continually seeking to improve the
product, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead lawyer, saw
matters quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking outside the courtroom, Boies said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they intentionally set out to lose money? Did they make
these hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars _ a billion
dollars perhaps _ (in designing the Internet Explorer browser) with
any business plan that they would very recover it other than
through the price of Windows?
</P>
<P>
   ``This witness,'' Boies concluded, ``came very, very close today
to saying that the only way they were going to recoup was through
the price of Windows. That's exactly what the government's theory
is. They can get their money back by maintaining their Windows
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies plans to cross-examine Schmalensee on this key issue
Wednesday(cq).
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states contend that Microsoft
abused its Windows monopoly power for personal computers, thereby
stunting innovation and keeping prices high. Microsoft claims it
has done no wrong in a dynamic industry where vigorous competition
remains the watchword.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara noted that the judge
wanted to know whether it was correct to also view computer makers
as consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, it's not appropriate,'' Schmalensee said. The
economist said the hardware vendors are in reality distributors who
resell Windows, ``close to the way a Chevrolet dealer resells
Chevrolets.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a Cadillac dealer alter the engine or Cadillac name on
the cars it sells, it might well serve that particular dealer's
interest by making the outlet stand out from the pack. But,
Schmalensee added, ``it would weaken the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as Schmalensee saw it, Microsoft was had every right to
impose strict conditions on the ``look and feel'' of the
Windows-loaded machines when they were shipped from the factory.

 &HT;    PEACEFUL ERA FOR KOSOVO OPENS WITH TWO NATO, TWO CIVILIAN
DEATHS; KLA REBELS BEGIN HANDING OVER WEAPONS
 &HT;    With CLINTON-KOSOVO-0622; KOSOVO-MONASTERY-0622.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Warring ended here Monday and the hard
job of nurturing peace paradoxically began with the deaths of two
NATO peacekeepers and two Kosovo civilians blown up in an ordnance
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   On the day NATO declared its air assaults finished and
Yugoslavia's government moved to end its state of war, the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army also began to carry out terms of a new
demilitarization agreement. KLA guerrillas turned over maps of
minefields and, in some cases, their guns and grenades, giving the
movement toward peaceful renewal a tap forward.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers killed, members of Great Britain's 69th Gurkha
Field Squadron, were Nepalese ordnance experts who hold among the
most dicey jobs in the military. And on Monday they were carrying
out one of the most important tasks necessary for reconstruction of
war-torn Kosovo even to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The troops were clearing explosives found near a school in the
village of Negrovce, about 20 miles west of Pristina, when the
munitions exploded at 1:25 p.m. (local time) and killed the two
soldiers and two civilians, according to NATO spokesman Lt. Col.
Nick Clissett. Another injured civilian was in stable condition at
a military field hospital here.
</P>
<P>
   The ordnance at first was said to be a mine, but later reports
raised the possibility that what exploded was bomblets from a NATO
cluster bomb or other left-overs from the allied air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was in the former Yugoslav republic of
Slovenia Monday, telephoned British Prime Minister Tony Blair to
offer his condolences, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   British NATO peacekeepers said they were investigating the cause
of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   The Gurkhas, compact, brown-skinned men from the rugged
mountains of southwest Asia, did not let the fatal accident impede
their work. A few hours later on a road just south of the
explosion, soldiers from the bomb squad were surveying roadside
properties, talking with landowners, and putting up new warning
markers with red-and-white striped roping to keep people out of
minefields.
</P>
<P>
   Mines and unexploded bombs are perhaps the most deadly legacy of
the Serb ethnic cleansing campaign that pushed an estimated 1.3
million Kosovar Albanians out of their homes. Military experts have
estimated hundreds of thousands of mines were laid throughout
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian agencies are running an information campaign,
putting up posters everywhere showing types of mines people might
encounter. The group Doctors Without Borders also is briefing
villagers on mine dangers at every mobile clinic stop, when a nurse
gives graphic descriptions of how unsuspecting Kosovars have been
killed or had their feet and legs mangled.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was a grim way to usher in the new stage of peace
in Kosovo. On Sunday Serb military and police forces completed
withdrawal under terms of a military technical agreement negotiated
with NATO, and in the early morning hours Monday NATO completed a
pact for the demilitarization of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Those two events released NATO to declare an end to the air war
against Yugoslavia that began March 24, and led the Yugoslav
government to request that its parliament revoke the state of war.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the KLA pact achieved after protracted negotiations,
NATO commander Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson said he hoped the world will
``look back and see it as a turning point in every way.''
</P>
<P>
   Very soon, KFOR will be the only military security presence
here, Jackson said, referring to the NATO-led Kosovo Force of
peacekeepers. ``That is how it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   But with returning Albanians forced to confront the grisly
evidence of months of Serb atrocities, ``It's going to take a lot
of leadership and a lot of self-discipline for those who have come
home not to retaliate,'' said President Clinton in Bonn, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke to the
issue in a brief phone call Sunday night to KLA leader Hashim Thaci
and expressed their appreciation and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should not do it. They should not do it,'' Clinton said
of Albanian retaliation against Serbs. ``In the end, it will not
satisfy anyone, and it will only compound the horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Thaci, appearing at a news conference here Monday with U.S.
State Department spokesman James Rubin, hailed the demilitirization
pact as marking ``a new epoch beginning for the people of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Thaci said, ``We ask all Serbs that have fled from
Kosovo and haven't done any crimes here to come back and live in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to disarm the KLA and get it out of power positions have
been aimed not only at securing peace, but also at convincing
ethnic Serbs to continue living in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement that gives the KLA 30 days to turn over heavy
weapons and 90 days to give up automatic firearms also mandates
that guerrilla fighters not carry weapons within two kilometers
(1.2 miles) of main towns or borders.
</P>
<P>
   It was having some impact already on Monday, when KLA officers
handed over to German peacekeepers in the southern city of Prizren
some maps of minefields primarily located in the border area with
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   KLA troops also began heading home.
</P>
<P>
   One truckload of at least two dozen fighters was standing
outside a post of Italian peacekeepers in Djakovica Monday
afternoon, after the NATO troops extracted a cache of weapons from
them. Inside the post, a range of rather old looking rifles and
automatic guns, machine guns and hand grenades, was laid out on the
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Italian troops had surrounded the truck with arms at the ready,
even though the KLA men had readily given up their weapons and
seemed pretty relaxed as they waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to disarm,'' said Emin Tuqi, the 27-year-old
commander of the squad. ``Our mission was to get out the Serbs and
now they are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The men, mostly young fighters who smoked and talked easily with
the few journalists there, said they had just come down from a
mountain posting near the Albanian border and were anxious to get
home to find out how their own families fared.
</P>
<P>
   At other places around the province -- in Pristina and Pec and
Klina and along the roads between -- KLA soldiers were plentiful
but not obviously armed in public.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas who fought for Kosovo's independence had become a
potential barrier to waging peace in this Yugoslav province, taking
over villages, setting up road checkpoints and swaggering around
cities heavily armed. They also engaged in several kidnappings and
are accused of vengeance killings of Kosovar Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs were not much convinced, although 70 of them came back
across the border Monday under NATO escort from Montenegro to their
home city of Pec. They did not immediately go to their houses, but
stayed at a NATO post.
</P>
<P>
   At Patriarchate of Pec monastery, where 300 Serbs have taken
refuge, there was no sense the KLA agreement gave comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the same as yesterday. There is no difference,'' said
Metropolitan Ameilohije Radnic.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Bonn, questioned about fears of retaliation against
Serbs by returning Albanians and KLA forces inside Kosovo,
President Clinton shifted the focus to the mounting evidence of
anti-Albanian atrocities inside the war-ravaged province.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be fair, the real story coming out of there is still the
staggering number of civilians that have been murdered,'' said
Clinton, who plans to visit refugee camps in Macedonia on Tuesday.

 &HT;    HOUSE GOP TO UNVEIL 'STRAIGHT A's' EDUCATION PLAN
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans offer the states more
control over federal funds in their alternative to President
Clinton's plan for assisting elementary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's five-year bill, to be introduced Tuesday, places more
stress on flexibility for the states, and less on making sure that
the grants are used for reforms mandated by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   A law passed earlier this year gave all states the right to
mingle funds from six federal programs that distribute about $10
billion in education grants annually. Clinton's bill places a few
new restrictions on that procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ``Straight A's'' bill, the Academic Achievement
for All Act, loosens existing restrictions and widens the pool to
include about $3 billion annually from another 12 education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic president's insistence on lots of ``rules and
regulations'' continues programs that have shown ``little or no
academic results,'' said Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of
the House Education and Workforce Committee. But Clinton says
schools that take federal aid should have to meet federal standards
such as reduced class sizes or testing new teachers on their
mastery of subject matter and skills.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side has been able to recruit congressional sponsors
from the opposite party for its bill.
</P>
<P>
   The new GOP bill is supported by such prominent Republicans as
House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi, as well as a few Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
   But most governors would prefer a bipartisan compromise. For
that reason, the Republican Governors Association _ like the
National Governors Association and the Democratic Governors
Association _ has yet to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the Senate education
committee, said he will try to draft a bipartisan bill, but not
until later this year, after he has held more hearings.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the final struggle to avoid a damaging stalemate is
likely to take place next year amid the political pressures and
partisan posturing of election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill gives states the right to mingle funds from
18 of the 20 largest education programs. To do that, states would
have to sign contracts with the federal government spelling out
their goals for improving the academic achievement of all students,
low-income students and students who have fallen behind.
</P>
<P>
   States that met their goals would get extra federal money, and
those that missed their goals several years in a row would risk
losing their right to mingle the funds from the different programs.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the president nor the Republicans would tamper with two
existing programs _ special education aid and impact aid, which
helps school districts that include large amounts of non-taxable
federal land.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 billion that states can already mingle includes $7.7
billion in Title I aid for disadvantaged students and $2.3 billion
from five other programs: Perkins vocational education grants,
teacher training, safe and drug free schools, immigrants and
innovative education.
</P>
<P>
   About $3 billion a year is spent on the 12 programs that the
House Republicans would add to the pot. They range in size from the
president's $1.2 billion plan to reduce class size by subsidizing
the hiring of new teachers for grades one through three, down to
$24 million to prepare facilities to be used by public-school
specialists who provide services to low-achieving children in
private schools.

SHAKESPEARE TWINBILL GIVEN THE ROYAL TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
Our rating: ``Measure for Measure'' _ 3 1/2 stars 
``Midsummer Night's Dream'': 2 stars 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Youthful lust and hormonally driven hypocrisy are
the themes the Ahmanson Theatre is using to promote its double
scoop of Shakespeare this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Hollywood lately has shown, sex can indeed be a useful
marketing tool when you're trying to make iambic pentameter
palatable to a mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ahmanson hired Sir Peter Hall to stage its Bardian twin
bill, the esteemed British director vowed to assemble a company of
actors who could deliver Shakespeare with American-style passion
plus an Anglican flair for making Elizabethan verse intelligible to
modern ears.
</P>
<P>
   Hall has responded with a split decision: a stark and stirring
``Measure for Measure,'' and a high-strung, stylistically fuzzy ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Although his company does, as Hall
promised, speak Shakespeare's verse in a uniform style, they do so
with widely varying degrees of ease.
</P>
<P>
   Hot-blooded emotion is allowed to run its course in both
productions _ or, in the case of ``Dream,'' to overflow its banks.
Yet finally, it's graybeards like Brian Murray and David Dukes,
veterans of many dues-paying years of stage service, who keep
Hall's best-laid plans on track.
</P>
<P>
   Murray delivers a first-rate performance as the wily Duke of
``Measure,'' the benevolent dictator who, during a leave of absence
from Vienna, entrusts his high-minded deputy Angelo (Richard
Thomas) to mete out moral justice _ with chilling results. Murray
also appears, less commandingly, in a comic role as Bottom the
bewitched weaver of ``Midsummer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dukes, another experienced trans-Atlantic performer and a
longtime member of L.A.'s Matrix Theatre Company, etches a superb,
complex portrait as the Duke's devil-may-care antagonist Lucio. He
also turns up as an understatedly regal Theseus in ``Dream.'' But
both these fine actors, like the company as a whole, do their best
work in the morally murky ``Measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly cognizant of recent events in the Oval Office and the
debates in Congress, Hall and designer John Gunter have set
``Measure'' in a period that's both classical and abstracted, a
conflation of imperial mid-19th century Vienna and the infant U.S.
republic of roughly the same era. A glowing, miniaturized Capitol
building hovers at the rear of the stage, symbolizing the tensions
inherent in any political system pitched between order and liberty,
duty and pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Hall makes those contrasts deliciously theatrical, using the
opening scene to emphasize the aging Duke's almost petrified
authority as he turns over temporary command to his ardent young
protege, Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   The action then switches to Lucio and his rakish friends whoring
it up with three bare-breasted bawds dressed in crotchless
underwear. Later, when these ladies of the evening get hauled off
to jail under Angelo's punitive rule, Hall includes several darkly
lit flashes of the women being raped by prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   This is the ugly, morally two-faced world in which the young,
impulsive Claudio (Hamish Linklater) finds himself arrested and
sentenced to death for fathering a child out of wedlock, once
Angelo's ruthless monasticism has seized control of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Boyish and almost painfully earnest in his ethical exactitude,
Thomas' Angelo suggests a baby-faced House Judiciary Committee
chairman. Licking his lips and nervously gnawing his index finger,
he is caught in a self-constructed web of self-righteousness when
Claudio's chaste sister Isabella (Anna Gunn) arrives from a nunnery
to plead for her brother's life and instead arouses Angelo's carnal
desire.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas smoothly engages Angelo's tortured duplicity, making him
sympathetic even at his most sadistic. Unfortunately, Gunn's
stiffly imperious Isabella rarely takes the wraps off the parallel
inner conflicts that make her such a tempting foil for Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes cuts a terrifically droll and depraved figure as the
impertinent Lucio, a Mephistophelean fop defiantly wagging a
walking stick that looks as if it might turn into a snake at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
   But the production ultimately belongs to Murray. As the Duke who
must abandon his kingdom in order to save it, he seems to shed
years before our eyes, metamorphosing from a pompous, prematurely
gray ruler into a wise, robust law-giver. There's other fine work
in this ``Measure,'' notably from George Dzundza's delightfully
degenerate Pompey and Charles Janasz as the humane Provost.
</P>
<P>
   In the Shakespearean canon, ``Midsummer'' may be the closest
thing going to a can't-miss crowd-pleaser. Judging by the roars of
approval, it didn't miss with Sunday's opening-night Ahmanson
crowd, either.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind, however, this production lacks poetic beauty and
dynamic subtlety. Rising quickly to a shrill pitch, where it hovers
for most of the next 2{ hours, it's more frenzied than sensual,
more fussy than voluptuous.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four young moonstruck paramours, the distaff duo of
Hermia (Jennifer Dundas Lowe, a compacted bundle of energy) and
Helena (a wistful, poignant Kathryn Meisle) come off better-spoken
and more complicated than their beaus (Linklater and Mark Deakins),
which is partly the way Shakespeare wrote them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the fairies, Kelly McGillis' quivery Titania seems
insufficiently magisterial, while Peter Francis James' harsh,
sneering Oberon carries the added burden of a beehived hairdo and
glittery duds that make him look like Little Richard doing
``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Shakespeare's nigh-infallible machinery gets cranking, the
production picks up energy, but much of that energy gets spent in
ways that don't always illuminate the text. Richard Thomas' Puck is
especially distracting, his words often lost amid gleeful squeals
of other-worldly androgyny and hip-wiggling paroxysms of mischief.
Even the Mechanicals' performance feels slightly perfunctory.
</P>
<P>
   Putting together a classical theater company from scratch, in a
matter of months, is no job for the faint-hearted. Sir Peter and
friends are about halfway there, which means L.A. is about halfway
to what could be the start of a splendid summer tradition. &UR;  &QL;

MYSTERY OF MURDERED NANNY UNRESOLVED AFTER THREE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- She could have been a nurse or a skydiver. A pianist
or a gardener. A mother, and even a great-grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   But to anyone who followed the investigation into her murder,
and even those who knew her, Karina Holmer will forever remain 20
years old. And she will always be an au pair.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after friends last saw the Swedish au pair wandering
outside a night club in the early morning hours, police Monday said
a murder in Florida last month _ an eerily similar case that seemed
to hold the most promising lead in finding Holmer's killer _ was
unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   ``After speaking with the police in Florida about both cases,
there doesn't appear to be any connection whatsoever,'' said Boston
Police Sgt. Det. Daniel Coleman, referring to the murder of Delia
Lorna Mendez, a 34-year-old prostitute whose body was found severed
and dumped in a pet store trash bin in Hollywood, Fla., on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Her slaying marked the first time a body had been mutilated that
way since Holmer's torso was found in a trash receptacle in Boston
in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The au pair had been in Boston only three months when she was
murdered. The crime stunned the city, and hinted at the
helplessness of parents who lodge young female foreigners thirsting
for downtown excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez' murder sparked conjecture that her killer and Holmer's
were the same. Not only were both women discarded in trash bins
after being cut in half, but both seemed to have been severed with
some kind of power instrument.
</P>
<P>
   But Coleman Monday said the differences in the circumstances
which led Holmer and Mendez to become victims _ and the details of
both crimes _ had all but eliminated a connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dealt with what we know about our case, and what they know
about their case, and the two incidents did not have a lot of
similarities,'' said Coleman, one of three homicide investigators
currently assigned to find Holmer's killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a young girl in a nightclub district who was reported
to have been drinking, and she was alone,'' he said. ``Their case
was very different from that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mendez was about 14 years older than Holmer. Mendez
was beaten to death, while Holmer was strangled. And while police
recovered both halfs of Mendez' body, Holmer's legs and lower torso
were never found.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the Mendez murder, Boston police said
detectives in Hollywood had received three anonymous calls alluding
to the Holmer case. Coleman said those were general calls pointing
out similarities to the Holmer case, ``but there was nothing
specific connecting the incident in Florida to what happened in
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about how investigators reacted upon learning the cases
are not connected, Coleman said, ``As investigators, we try to be
methodical and analyze whatever we've got. But we don't really get
hopeful unless the investigation leads us down that road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't go into this saying, `This is it,' because often
times it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coleman said the case remains open, and that each
possibility that is ruled out is at least some progress in finding
the killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, everybody remains committed to this case,''
he said.

A FEW UNEASY SERBS RETURN TO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ Three attack helicopters hovered overhead, and
there were nearly as many military vehicles as plain cars. But that
is what NATO decided it would take to bring 70 Serbs back to this
destroyed city Monday, in a high-minded attempt to enable Kosovo
Serbs and Albanians to live together even in the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties were clear just from the amount of military
hardware. ``It's to send a message,'' said Col. Vincent Diaz de
Villegas, the NATO officer who oversaw the operation Monday. ``We
will use all necessary means to accomplish our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   That mission, he said, is to let any Serb return to Kosovo
without being harassed _ or worse _ by Kosovo Albanians in reaction
to the killing, burning and looting during a year of ethnic purging
at the hands of Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians here said they were in no mood to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they won't be safe here,'' said Gazmend Amati, 21, a
Kosovo Albanian who lives here. ``You can't live anymore with
Serbs, not after all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pec, in western Kosovo, is one of the cities most damaged by
Serbian forces in the last two months, and it remains one of the
most tense. On Saturday three Serbs in civilian clothes were shot
to death in a nearby village, in what military officials say
appeared to be the work of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the Albanian
separatist rebel force.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days more than 18,000 Serbs have fled into the
neighboring Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, which is nearby, the
U.N. High Commission for Refugees reported. The agency said a total
of 50,000 to 60,000 Serbs have fled Kosovo in that time.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 Serbs have expressed the wish to return to the area
around Pec, and the operation Monday was aimed at accomplishing
that. But by Monday many seemed to be having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz de Villegas said 50 cars had signed up for an escort from
the border with Montenegro Monday, but only 27 had showed up. A
group of Serbs also arrived at the border for a second convoy, but
in such small numbers that the Italians who control the sector said
they would not run a second convoy until more Serbs came, perhaps
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs in the convoy were decidedly polite. Many of them
flashed the victory sign used by Albanians returning to their homes
in the last weeks. Only one boy made the Serbian victory sign _ an
extended thumb, index and middle finger _ used by so many Serbs on
their way out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They did not go immediately to their houses, but to a car parts
factory occupied by NATO troops to wait while soldiers make sure
that it is safe for them to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the Yugoslav president and Serbian leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, made a plea for Serbs from Kosovo to stay put or to move
back to their homes. Kosovo is the southern province of Serbia,
which is the larger of the two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible to interview the Serbs who returned Monday,
so it is hard to know whether Milosevic's statement played any part
in their decision to return.
</P>
<P>
   But Zlatko Arsovic, 41, a Serbian businessman who fled Pec in
fear two days ago, said he would never again listen to anything
Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't remind me of him,'' Arsovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Arsovic drove to the border between Montenegro and Kosovo Monday
afternoon to speak with Italian soldiers about how safe it was to
return to Pec, where he owns a mini-market and has plans to open a
small brewery. He said he still had not decided whether to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll be safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz de Villegas said the Serbs would be safe and would feel
secure enough to return in greater numbers in convoys in the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we will be able to do it with more Serbs and less
forces,'' he said.

DEARTH OF PRINCIPALS SENDS SCHOOL OFFICIALS SCRAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As Massachusetts public school officials scramble to
find enough classroom teachers, they're discovering an even more
critical shortage in the school office: principals.
</P>
<P>
   Low pay, long hours and eroding authority in recent years has
meant scores of principal vacancies in schools next year. Boston
will have about 18 openings for principals in the coming school
year out of 129 schools.
</P>
<P>
   And the picture is repeated across the country as an estimated
30 to 35 percent of school administrators are expected to retire or
resign _ particularly in urban districts where job stress is high
and the pay can be only nominally better than a veteran teacher's
salary.
</P>
<P>
   The search for qualified applicants may go on for as long as
eight months as officials search for the perfect fit for a school.
Meanwhile, assistant principals pinch hit, retiring principals are
asked to stay or former principals in other jobs are asked to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out three times just to make sure I had quality,
quantity and the applicants were culturally diverse,'' said
Cambridge School Superintendent Bobbie D'Alessandro.
</P>
<P>
   It took her six months to attract 52 qualified applicants before
finally hiring Paul Evans from the Annenberg Institute at Brown
University to head the Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go to the Internet, the New York Times,''
D'Alessandro said. ``There is significant accountability now with
principals. It's tough to get people to take the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, under the 1993 education reform act, principals are now
not only responsible for the usual tasks of running the building
and dealing with parents, but they also must hire and fire staff,
redesign curriculum _ and even make sure the new state MCAS test is
boxed properly for scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal has to accept all the responsiblity and they
will be on the line again for underperforming schools,'' said Linda
Davin, an eighth-grade English teacher in Malden who got her
principal certification in 1990, but has never been a principal.
</P>
<P>
   She would love to run a school, Davin says _ if she could also
teach a class. She knows that's all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   And as the state begins to grade schools based on MCAS scores,
many principals say they will ultimately be held accountable for
their students' scores. Principals, unlike teachers, do not have
strong unions so they can be hired and fired more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Many principals also say despite the added responsibilities,
their authority is eroded by school site councils and faculty votes
that sometimes override their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job has changed tremendously,'' said Robert Salamone,
retiring principal of the Emerson School, who has been in the
Boston Public School system for 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people involved in the decision-making is now a very wide
base,'' he said. ``Everybody wants to be involved in the
formulation of policy but the ultimately responsiblity rests in the
hands of the principals. There is a contradiction in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although reform efforts differ in other states, shortages are
just as pronounced, national educators say. A survey conducted last
year by the National Association of Elementary School Principals
and their secondary school counterpart found that half of 403
school districts had shortages for K-12 principals. Some national
statistics say school districts will see an additional 10 to 20
percent need for school administrators through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear more about this problem even more than teacher
shortages,'' said Michael Casserly, head of the Council of Great
City Schools, a national organization of urban school districts.
``Other than recruiting folks from inside the district, there isn't
a lot districts can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Public School Superintendent Thomas Payzant has tried to
lure principals and headmaster by raising their salaries _ some
$10,000 for high school chiefs. Still, the raise is merely
competitive with suburban districts where the job is often
perceived by candidates to be easier and less stressful.
</P>
<P>
   Since Payzant began his job four years ago, almost half of all
principals have resigned, retired or moved to other jobs. So he
also has embarked on an agressive ``grow your own'' policy of
training teachers for management positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real sanguine about being able to attract people to
relocate from other parts of the country,'' Payzant said. Unlike
other professions, schools usually do not pay moving costs and
salaries aren't competitive enough to entice someone to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll focus on growing our own and regional recruitment,''
Payzant said.
</P>
<P>
   The true competition, however, remains the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the classroom there are more rewards for teaching. You see
the light go on in a child's eye,'' Davin said. ``Often, these
days, I don't think principals see that.''

`BUFFY' FINALE IS A REAL BLAST, DESPITE BEING POSTPONED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Spoilers of the finale of ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' are revealed in this story. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the season finale of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'':
</P>
<P>
   -- Faith lies mortally wounded in the Sunnydale hospital, having
been stabbed in the stomach by Buffy, then jumping from a building
onto a moving truck.
</P>
<P>
   -- Angel ``necks'' with Buffy so that he can survive a
potentially deadly wound of his own (and go on to star in his own
series this fall).
</P>
<P>
   -- Angel sucks so much of Buffy's blood that Buffy nearly dies.
</P>
<P>
   -- As the mayor addresses the graduating class of Sunnydale
High, he transforms into a serpent at least 60 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   -- Buffy, Angel, Xander, Cordelia, Willow and Oz lead the rest
of the Class of '99 in battle against the serpent and his vampire
bodyguards. Flame throwers, harpoons, arrows and axes are the
weapons of choice.
</P>
<P>
   -- Per usual, Buffy and her cohorts make prodigious use of the
show's signature fighting technique: fierce, acrobatic,
hand-to-hand, foot-to-head combat.
</P>
<P>
   -- The serpent, which appears to be all head and long neck,
literally devours one student and a recurring character.
</P>
<P>
   -- Several vampires get staked to death.
</P>
<P>
   -- In a quick but frightening scene, the serpent chases Buffy
through the school, the serpent's size causing considerable
destruction to the school, particularly doorways.
</P>
<P>
   -- Buffy leads the serpent to a room stocked with explosives.
The resulting kaboom destroys much of the school.
</P>
<P>
   That's entertainment?
</P>
<P>
   For this reviewer, yes, absolutely. In fact, I am such a fan of
this well-written, well-acted, well-produced show, it's my Emmy
pick for best drama series of the year. It is certainly the most
original broadcast network series on TV today.
</P>
<P>
   For other viewers, especially the uninitiated, the acts listed
above could suffice for Examples 1-10 of media violence run amok.
This, you might ask, is what our teen-agers are watching? Then no
wonder kids are shooting kids at school.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the folks at the WB were worried you might think that,
too, which is why they postponed the finale, moving it from May 25
to July 13. (An earlier episode that was also pulled has yet to be
rescheduled.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision to delay the air date had to do with many issues,
the foremost of which was being sensitive and respectful to the
communities and individuals devastated by recent acts of violence
in their local high schools,'' said WB CEO Jamie Kellner. ``The
timing of the finale also coincided with over 35,000 junior high,
high school and college graduation ceremonies being conducted
nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   However, from this vantage point, Kellner and the WB made a
mistake with that decision. By pulling the episode, they
acknowledged, however slightly or inadvertently, that there might
be a relationship between their show and the school tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   If ever a show were a fantasy, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' is.
Buffy, after all, is a series about vampires, demons, slayers and
werewolves. There is violence, sure, but it's fantasy violence,
usually conducted using stakes, crosses and well-placed body blows.
Guns seldom, if ever, appear.
</P>
<P>
   With government looking at the media with an intensity not felt
in years, networks are backing down on shows they feel might be
sending a wrong, violent message. CBS in May rejected a pilot about
a New York mob family for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   The mob is real. ``Buffy'' is not. The mob uses guns. ``Buffy''
does not. The mob is about greed and corruption. ``Buffy'' is about
the fight between good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   (``Buffy'' might qualify for censorship, but not for violence.
The show sometimes crosses the line where sex and language _
especially the double entendre _ is involved.)
</P>
<P>
   Kellner acknowledges that the move to postpone the show was
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received both praise and criticism for our decision,''
he said. ``If we erred, it was on the side of caution.''

 UNDATED: a specialist.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``She was on so many medications and she was constantly sucking
on the breathing machine,'' Ms. Medina said. ``It was just a roller
coaster ride. She was never well.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford the specialist, Ms. Medina enrolled Gabriela in
a drug study conducted by a local asthma expert, Dr. Jay Grossman.
``Just hearing that it was an asthma specialist I said, `Hey, what
do I have to lose?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental asthma drug changed Gabriela's life. The trial
``is allowing her to have a normal childhood,'' Ms. Medina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only worry,'' she added, ``is that the study will be over
and she'll be back where she started from.''
</P>
<P>
   The completion of a study can be a poignant moment, several
doctors said, especially when the subjects, like Gabriela Garcia,
finally received medical help that had eluded them. The subjects
have just spent weeks or months sitting in waiting rooms with
private patients, filling out the same forms and looking through
the same magazines as everyone else. Their diagnostic tests have
been conducted in the usual exam rooms, and they have received
drugs just like private patients. Then the study ends and the
subjects have to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had more medical care from me than they have had
from anybody for years,'' Winder said. ``It is hard for them to
understand that they are not my patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, if no new clinical trials are available to them,
that reality can leave patients feeling frightened and abandoned.
Josette Good, a 60-year-old widow, used to count on Winder to keep
her enrolled in study after study for asthma. But last year, she
moved to Lake Milton, Ohio, near her children but 200 miles from
Winder's office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, adequate health insurance is beyond her budget, and Winder
could not help her find a study in her area. She has only one
inhaler left, from the last study she participated in, so she uses
it sparingly, at times borrowing another from a friend. Hoping to
make her inhaler last through the summer, she limits her
activities, avoiding yardwork and even short walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so tough,'' Mrs. Good said. ``I pray nothing
happens.''

 &HT;    Inspection question points to problems of authority
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The European Union's ``suggestion'' that a new round
of inspections be conducted on two Coca-Cola plants is the latest
sign of bureaucratic wrangling as member states lurch toward
uniform food safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian and French health officials will team up with commission
representatives to conduct the inspections of the plants in
Dunkirk, France, and Antwerp, Belgium. Coca-Cola said the plants
are the sources of soft drink contamination that have left some
Europeans ill.
</P>
<P>
   Commission spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the inspections will
begin in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a proposal, a suggestion,'' Ella Krucoff, spokeswoman
for the European Commission's delegation in Washington, said after
the inspections were announced at EC headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission would still lack authority to order an
embargo of Coke products following the inspections, but could
propose such a step to the European Union Council of Ministers. The
council, the supreme decision-making body made up of top-level
representatives from the 15 member states, would have authority to
order such an embargo, which would be enforced by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The council took such a step in 1996 when cattle in Britain were
found to have Mad Cow disease, Krucoff noted.
</P>
<P>
   The latest development in Coke's soft drink scare is another
indication of the overlapping and sometimes confusing authority
over food safety enforcement in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Washington-based Institute for
International Economics, said the turn of events is understandable,
given the politically touchy nature of food safety and continuing
moves to impose uniform standards.
</P>
<P>
   Since its 1992 ``single market'' initiative, the EU has sought
to gain members' agreement a host of issues, health and safety
among them. Given that the 15 nations had formed a tariff-free
trading zone, the idea was to create a single market that would be
``the economic equivalent of the United States,'' Bergsten said.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been uneven. There is no European equivalent of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, though the recent series of
food safety scares could prompt establishment of such an agency.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission currently has authority to set broad
policies and has done so through directives that have dealt with
everything from limits on antibiotic residues in milk to the color
of paint on slaughterhouse walls.
</P>
<P>
   But it's up to member states to enforce the directives, and
countries have done so with varying degrees of rigor.
</P>
<P>
   The commission Monday launched legal proceedings against Belgium
for violating EU rules by waiting a month before warning the agency
about food contaminated with cancer-causing dioxin. That scandal
brought down Belgium's government last week.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Mad Cow controversy, the European Commission
in 1997 established a separate agency to deal with ``consumer
policy and consumer health protection.'' The agency, known as
Directorate 24, seeks to ``develop a consumer policy and contribute
to consumer health protection and food safety at the level of the
European Union.'' Authority over food safety was previously
invested in the agriculture directorate-general, one of 30
executive departments.
</P>
<P>
   It is Directorate 24 that that made the initial recommendation
Friday that led to the inspections of Coke's plants announced
Monday.

 &HT;    Home Depot's smaller creation focuses on goods for the home
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. _ If it's any consolation to hardware store
owners, they aren't the only ones in the cross hairs of Home
Depot's newest retail weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Villager's Hardware, opening here this week, makes a much
broader assault. In space about the size of a medium-sized grocery
store, Villager's Hardware takes a swipe at Wal-Mart, Target,
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. and any other retailer that sells home-related
goods.
</P>
<P>
   From toilet seats to tableware, Villager's Hardware has pulled
together everything Atlanta-based Home Depot thinks a consumer
would need for a small repair or home decor project. The new store,
the first of four test sites, attempts to fill in where Home Depot
left off with its warehouse stores and upscale Expo Design Centers,
said Bob Wittman, senior vice president of business development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Depot is home improvement, Expo is home design and
Villager's Hardware is home enhancement,'' Wittman said Monday
during a tour of the store. Villager's Hardware is going after a
$50 billion market that's currently served by hardware chains, mass
merchandisers and home centers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Home Depot announced the Villager's Hardware concept last
year, analysts and industry observers expected a format that would
compete directly with hardware chains such as True Value, Ace
Hardware and Sears Hardware. (Home Depot's Wittman is the former
chief operating officer of Orchard Supply Hardware, a large
California chain acquired by Sears in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Villager's Hardware seems to be going for the jugular in
some categories. Take fasteners, for example. Consumers can browse
6,152 types of fasteners with a computerized touch screen that
plays a video on the use and installation of each. There are more
than 600 light switchplates to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the 10 main departments, the idea behind the
merchandising was to go deep on so-called convenience items that
shoppers wouldn't want to shop for in a huge Home Depot warehouse
store. ``When people think of a convenience store, it usually means
a little bit of everything. The difference here is that we'll
dominate in selected areas,'' said Wittman, as he pointed to
several dozen hand clippers and pruners.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the 37,000 products at Villager's Hardware overlap
with Home Depot products, including tools, paint, window treatments
and lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are differences. Villager's Hardware carries fewer
power tools but more accessories. It sells shower heads and faucets
but no shower stalls or countertops. The product mix includes
cookware and even candleholders, and instead of the generic
fast-foot corner found in some Home Depot warehouse stores,
Villagers takes a softer approach with an in-store cafe that serves
muffins and bagels.
</P>
<P>
   While the traditional Home Depot orange is nowhere in sight,
expect Villager's to incorporate a good deal of the Home Depot
philosophy. About 10 percent of the new store's employees were
recruited from Home Depot stores, including the manager, Christine
Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   The second Villager's Hardware site will open later this year,
in Garwood, N.J. Two stores more stores will open next year in New
Jersey. If consumers like the new stores, they'll eventually come
to Atlanta, although there is no timetable.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to tell what impact Villager's Hardware could
have on other retailers. Home Depot was tight-lipped about the
store format and merchandise mix during the development phase, and
many industry observers weren't sure what to expect. Some analysts
are waiting to check out customers' reactions before giving their
verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   TruServ Corp., which counts itself the nation's biggest player
in hardware, is using Villager's Hardware as a motivational tool.
``We feel if Home Depot is moving into this marketplace, that means
there's a market to move into. This is a reinforcement that there's
a market out there for our business,'' said Don Hoye, president and
chief operating officer of TruServ, a Chicago-based cooperative of
more than 10,000 independent retailers.
</P>
<P>
   TruServ was formed two years ago when True Value Hardware,
ServiStar Hardware and Coast to Coast Hardware merged to better
compete with Home Depot and Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse.
(Ironically, Villager's Hardware takes the former site of Rickel
Home Centers, which closed in 1996 in part due to competition from
Home Depot.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the onslaught of the big boxes, local hardware stores
are plugging along. The number of hardware stores has dropped by
only 12 percent since Home Depot first opened in the late 1970s,
according to the National Retail Hardware Association. Nearly all
of the 21,400 hardware stores in the country are still
family-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the stores are still in business because they joined
co-ops such as TruServ or Ace Hardware Corp., which has more than
5,000 member stores. As part of the TruServ or Ace family, member
stores save money on merchandise because the co-op buys it in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   While there are still mom-and-pop hardware stores that look like
they're out of the 1950s and 1960s, most stores have expanded their
formats to compete with mass merchandisers, Hoye said. TruServ
wants its members to relocate or update stores every three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older stores only fill the market for the most convenient
items,'' said Hoye, who noted that it's nearly impossible to make a
living by selling screws and masking tape. ``Those stores are in
their last decade of existence.''

CLINTON LAUDS SLOVENIA'S BREAK WITH MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia _ Visiting this former Yugoslav Republic
that was the first to break from President Slobodan Milosevic,
President Clinton called on Serbs Monday to follow this nation's
lead by rejecting the Serb leader's ``murderous rule'' and becoming
part of the ``new Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   While promising help to Serbia should it break from Milosevic,
he vowed not to spend ``a penny'' reconstructing its bridges that
were damaged during NATO's 78-bombing campaign, as long as the Serb
leader remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, peacekeepers clearing land mines, booby traps and
unexploded ordnance from a school in Kosovo set off an explosion
Monday that killed two Nepalese soldiers and two civilians _ the
first allied fatalities since the NATO-led force entered Kosovo on
June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers from the 69th Gurkha Field Squadron _ riflemen from the
South Asian nation attached to the British peacekeeping force _
were helping clear ammunition in the village of Negrovce, 20 miles
west of Pristina, when a mine or booby trap went off, NATO said.
Two civilians also died and a third was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for the first time Monday, said he did not consider
repairing bridges part of the humanitarian aid that NATO has
promised to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of rebuilding the bridges so people can go to work, I
don't buy that,'' Clinton told reporters in Bonn, Germany after
attending a summit of the United States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of their economic reconstruction, and I don't
think we should help _ not a bit, not a penny,'' he said. ``I think
their hospitals ought to be able to function...and people shouldn't
be cold in the winter if we can help that. That's basically where I
draw the line.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton began preparing Americans for the price of peace,
saying that reconstruction of the Balkan region will ``probably
cost more than most people think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I promise you, it will be a lot cheaper than a
continuation of the war would have been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States bore most of the cost of the bombing
campaign, Clinton said he believes that European nations should
provide most of the peacekeeping force and pay for most of the
reconstruction in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects European leaders to keep their word to do so
but warned that ``in the next few days, all of you will hear
various things about how much the immediate reconstruction of
Kosovo will cost, what we're looking at in terms of long-term
development. Then you will see both Europeans and Americans say we
will or won't pay this or that amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said representatives of the
European Union and World Bank were currently in Kosovo gathering
estimates on the ground of humanitarian and economic costs, a
process the official said was likely to take a few weeks to
complete. Some initial projections put the figure at $1.5
billion-$3 billion to reconstruct Kosovo and southeasern Europe,
but that has been bumped up to a range of $3 billion-$5 billion a
year, the official said,
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said a ``donor's conference'' would be
held next month, possibly in Bulgaria, to examine the region's
short-term needs. A second conference that would bring together
Clinton, other world leaders and those from the front-line states
in Yugsoslavia may take place possibly as soon as next month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he expects ``some difficulty'' in getting Congress
to approve humanitarian and economic aid for Kosovo and other
Balkans areas, but that he had begun to lay the groundwork to try
to convince them. ``I think that if we can make the case, that they
will be willing to support it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who will visit a refugee camp in Macedonia and
then troops involved in NATO's bombing campaign at the air force
base in Aviano, Italy, said he was troubled by reports of returning
Kosovar Albanians attacking Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was critical to get all of NATO's peacekeepers into
Kosovo to prevent such conflicts. ``I hope there will not be any
retaliation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be fair, the real story coming out of there is still the
staggering number of civilians that have been murdered,'' he
continued. ``It's going to take a lot of leadership and lot of
self-discipline for those who have come home not to retaliate.''
Early Monday, just hours after the last Serb soldiers left Kosovo,
negotiators from the NATO-led peacekeeping force reached a
settlement with the Kosovo Liberation Army that called on the
rebels to turn over their heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The document calls for a 90-day demilitarization program in
which the KLA forces will place all heavy weaponry -- including
machine guns and anti-aircraft weapons -- in designated ``storage
sites'' that were agreed upon by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Pistols and shotguns are not covered by the agreement. They also
agreed not to use explosives, and to clear minefields and
booby-traps within seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The six-page document also spelled out parameters of the KLA's
future role in participating in the governing Kosovo. It recognized
the KLA's ``aspiration'' to form an organized security force that
would be similar to the American National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   However, the agreement makes clear that for now KFOR will be
responsible for all security in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The text also addressed the KLA's hopes to transform itself from
a military force to a political organization.
</P>
<P>
   After signing the agreement, one of the KLA's top officials and
a prime minister of a shadow government in Kosovo, Hashim Thaci
spoke by telephone to President Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will now start the new battle in Kosovo for the return of
the refugees to Kosovo and to speed up the process for democratic
elections in Kosovo,'' Thaci said.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference at the KFOR press center in Pristina,
commander Lt. Col Mike Jackson said that the agreement and the
final withdrawal of the 40,000 Yugoslavia Army forces from Kosovo
marked a ``turning point'' in KFOR's mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now get on with the next task of maintaining peace and
security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, meanwhile, was trying to defuse the potentially
destabilizing problem of Serb civilians fleeing from Kosovo,
convinced the NATO-led troops wouldn't protect them from revenge
attacks by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   His government has given little attention to their plight in the
official news media, prevented them from setting up camps in
Serbian cities and tried to force them back in convoys led by
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   A convoy of 150 people headed back from the Serbian city of
Kragujevac and 50 vehicles left from Krusevac, Belgrade news media
reported Monday. After confiscating their guns and grenades at the
border, Italian peacekeepers escorted a 50-car column of Serbs from
Montenegro to Pec.
</P>
<P>
   But refugees continued to flee Kosovo, and the UN refugee agency
said the situation of the 50,000 or so Serbs there was ``a very
grim one.''

 &HT;    Firm sends trusted fix-it man to restore faith
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charles S. Frenette, who virtually grew up in the
Coca-Cola family, is now charged with one of the biggest company
assignments in recent times _ the rehabilitation of the Coke name
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While a whole team is at work, headed by Chairman M. Douglas
Ivester, it is Frenette's responsibility to guide the message to
millions of European consumers that the company apologizes for
breakdowns in product quality and can be counted upon to work hard
to regain public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Frenette, the grandson and son of Coca-Cola bottlers in upstate
New York, is now senior vice president and chief of marketing for
the huge soft drink company. It is his job to put the health scare
behind the company.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Frenette is singularly qualified for his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a passionate leader, a good strategist and a very
effective executive,'' said Carl Ware, president of the Coca-Cola
African Division. Frenette reported to Ware for two years when
Frenette successfully rejuvenated the southern Africa business
between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Like no other executive, Frenette's experience over the last 25
years has been broad, embodying operations jobs, such as his
management of the fountain business in the 1980s, later management
of Coca-Cola USA operations and southern Africa and most recently
as manager of marketing on a global basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frenette has the ability to understand completely the internal
operations of the company and develop a feel for the consumers,''
Ware said.
</P>
<P>
   Frenette's fine hand was seen in a noteworthy 12-paragraph open
letter ``to all the Belgian people,'' published in 15 newspapers
today . The letter, from Chairman Ivester, apologizes for the
product difficulties and for the tardiness of the apology.
</P>
<P>
   But it then goes on to capitalize on the strength and power of
the precious Coca-Cola brand by saying Belgians and consumers
around the world partake of Coke's ``moment of pleasure'' a billion
times a day, engendering trust.
</P>
<P>
   And that foundation of trust is the bond between the company and
the public, which was put at risk by the health scare, and which
the company pledges to restore.
</P>
<P>
   In the formulation of the message, analysts say, the company
opens the door to restored communications, a healing process that
frequently takes place quickly between leading brands and their
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Frenette's assignment is one in a series of big assignments
passed along by his boss, Doug Ivester. For instance, he was called
on to straighten out problems in South Africa and environs, the
biggest market on the continent with more than 75 percent of the
local market share, and emerged with bottlers and consumers more
comfortable with Coca-Cola operations.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, when legendary marketer Sergio Zyman left the
company, Ivester tapped Frenette to fill the slot, quieting fears
and anxious feelings from Wall Street to Coke operations around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Ivester said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie's long experience as an operator, in both the
bottle/can and fountain arenas and domestically and
internationally, makes him the right person to lead marketing into
this new era.''
</P>
<P>
   Frenette's stock has been high for some time, and his name and
fortunes have been a source of hot speculation ever since debate
began over the succession of Roberto Goizueta, when the late
chairman moved past retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   His success at age 46 in the present crisis, which blew up as
rapidly as a summer storm, can do nothing but enhance his stature _
especially if the troubles grow calm in relatively short order.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Early one morning about 10 years ago, Jack Welch,
chief executive of General Electric Co., waited for an elevator in
the hallway outside his apartment in the Waldorf Towers in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Welch was feeling at the top of his game, bursting with
confidence. Then the elevator doors opened. Deflated, he stood face
to face with Walter Shipley, then head of Chemical Banking Corp.,
who at 6 feet 8 inches loomed a foot above him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of stuck my thumb in my mouth and said, `Gee, Walter,
thank you for adding to all of my insecurities,''' Welch recalled
in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although few might have agreed at the time, given Chemical's
financial woes, Welch accurately took Shipley's measure. Since that
encounter, Shipley has quietly pulled off two of the biggest
banking mergers in history, no mean feat in an industry that has
seen many careers and companies derailed by bungled mergers.
Chemical eventually became Chase Manhattan Corp. and is now one of
a handful of clear leaders in the rapidly changing financial
services business.
</P>
<P>
   And Shipley, who retired as Chase's chief executive on June 1
but will remain chairman for an undetermined time, now has some
advice for dealmeisters hoping to ride America's merger wave:
Slash-and-burn takeovers will come back to haunt you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people's philosophy is I win, you lose,'' he said. ``Our
philosophy is that the best is when both sides feel they've come
out winners.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Shipley, 63, is the least likely poster boy for
the merger boom that has reshaped financial services and other
major industries over the last decade. Deliberate in his speech,
modest and self-effacing to a fault and willing to share power,
Shipley has not enjoyed the renown of chief executives like
Citigroup's John Reed or Bank of America's Hugh McColl. But within
banking circles, and in the broader reaches of corporate America,
Shipley is widely admired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter has been able to do the deals he has because he has a
very contained ego,'' said Lawrence Bossidy, chairman of Allied
Signal Inc. ``But he's also been able to get people to work very
hard for him and get results. I don't think many other people in
his seat could have accomplished what he's accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, said executives who have worked closely
with Shipley, is that he is anything but Machiavellian.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who is quietly capable, bright, sensitive, and a
very good guy right down to his toes,'' Welch said. ``I haven't had
a dealing with him in which he wasn't completely straight up.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, despite Shipley's achievements, not all of Chase's
holes have been plugged during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   William Harrison, Shipley's successor as chief executive,
inherits a bank that is not big enough or profitable enough to be
competitive in some key consumer businesses. On the corporate side,
Chase still needs to buy an equity underwriting business at some
point, though the bank said it feels no pressure to rush into a
deal. And some community activists have criticized Chase's lending
record in low-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shipley leaves a formidable legacy. In 1990, the stock
market collectively valued the three banks that now make up Chase _
Chemical, Chase and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. _ at about $4
billion. Today, the market values the company at more than $60
billion, testimony enough to how the bank's fortunes have changed
since the dog days of the late 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   During those years, Chemical was often derided as ``Comical.''
The bank, along with many of its competitors, suffered through a
nightmare era of shoddy lending that called into question the
survival of some of the country's largest banks, including Chemical
_ and reaffirmed the popular image of bankers as slow-moving
fumblers.
</P>
<P>
   Bad overseas loans, many of them arranged when Shipley oversaw
Chemical's international division, were not the bank's only
problem. Deals that Shipley cut as Chemical's chief executive in
the 1980s failed to meet expectations. Chemical's acquisition of
Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. in 1987 was seen as too pricey at
the time and was undertaken shortly before Texas' high-flying oil
and real estate markets collapsed. Smaller deals, like Chemical's
takeover of Horizon Bancorp, a New Jersey bank, also misfired.
</P>
<P>
   But as the economy began to surge in the early 1990s, and as the
Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, adjusted interest rates
to help banks recover, Shipley had the foresight and ability to
place Chemical in the forefront of the merger boom. Much of his
approach toward mergers was learned the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Wall Street investment banker who regularly
surrounded his wife and four children with visitors from overseas,
Shipley attended Williams College to study economics and political
science. Although he shot hoops well enough to be named captain of
the basketball team, off the court he was slipping. Bad grades
forced him to leave Williams in 1956, during his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a family that put tight controls on kids, and so
when I went away to school it was kaboom, I'm free,'' Shipley said.
``I'd gotten through high school with ease, without ever having to
really apply myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipley referred to his departure from Williams as a ``wake-up
call'' that made him determined to prove to his family and friends
that ``I was better than I had demonstrated up until that time.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined New York Trust Co. in 1956 and later earned his
undergraduate degree from New York University. In 1959, New York
Trust was bought by Chemical, and many of Shipley's colleagues were
shunted aside because they did not come from Chemical _ a
disturbing episode he vowed not to repeat if he ever orchestrated a
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely influential in my thinking about how to do a
merger,'' said Shipley, who rose through the ranks to become
Chemical's chief executive. ``If you simply work to create an
environment based on meritocracy as opposed to one based on what
your pedigree is, you create an environment where no one is
unintentionally demotivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Shipley believed, mergers should be as friendly as
possible. So when Chemical hitched up with Manufacturers Hanover in
1991, the deal that raised the curtain on the 1990s merger boom,
Shipley agreed to take a back seat at first as president, letting
John McGillicuddy of Manufacturers be chief executive. But he also
insisted that the best people from each bank be given other top
slots.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley succeeded McGillicuddy in 1994 and a year later effected
his second blockbuster deal, the $10 billion union with Chase,
which secured the new bank's place in the top tier.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chemical clearly took over Chase, Shipley adopted the
Chase name and went out of his way to make a place for Chase's
chief executive, Thomas Labrecque. He ultimately asserted that he
and Labrecque should be considered equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create a new and better culture for a new and
better bank,'' Shipley said. ``Our idea is to create an environment
where no one feels self-conscious about themselves or where they
came from. I want them to feel self-conscious if their performance
is not up to standard.''
</P>
<P>
   For those employees further down the totem pole, thousands of
painful layoffs made the merger of Chase and Chemical far rockier.
But the union was marked by an effort to make the job losses as
humane as possible. The bank said that since the merger with Chase
was completed in 1996, enough new jobs have been added so that the
staff size has remained steady at about 72,000. Although plenty of
higher-paying jobs were undoubtedly replaced by lower-paying ones,
Chase also awarded stock options to remaining employees, options
now worth tens of thousands of dollars to many of them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, for all the drawbacks to the merger, Chase has been
spared much of the prolonged turmoil of other banking mergers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. bought First Interstate
Corp. in 1996 in a hostile takeover, service disruptions and
declining morale ate into the combined bank's profits. That forced
Wells into a merger last year with Norwest Corp., ending Paul
Hazen's tenure as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, First Union Corp., despite having a reputation as one
of the most astute acquirers in banking and being led by a
well-regarded chief executive, Edward Cutchfield Jr., badly botched
its acquisition of Corestates Financial Corp. Profits have been
hurt, employee morale is low, and First Union is now regarded as a
potential takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, while posting impressive earnings recently, is still
trying to overcome the divisive turf disputes it has encountered
since Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. merged last year. Other
banks that have simply sat out the merger boom, including venerated
titans like J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., now run the risk of being
marginalized because they are not large enough to compete.
</P>
<P>
   But Shipley has re-created Chase as a true financial powerhouse
with a global reach, particularly in areas like trading and
corporate finance. Despite lingering skepticism among some analysts
and investors about Chase's ability to maintain its robust
profitability and avoid financial pitfalls _ skepticism heightened
by the bank's role last year in the near-collapse of the Long-Term
Capital Management hedge fund and its heavy reliance on volatile
trading revenue _ the bank has repeatedly proved its mettle in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter understands people very well, and he has built a very
strong staff at that bank,'' said H. Rodgin Cohen, a lawyer
specializing in mergers and acquisitions with Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell.
``There's a very eclectic mix of people at Chase because Walter
looks at people in terms of their talent, not what bank they came
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, addressing hundreds of employees at an awards
ceremony at Chase's New York headquarters, Shipley realized it
would be the last time he appeared before the group as chief
executive. As he digressed and told the throng how proud he was to
have led them, he grew flustered. At that moment, the employees
rose and gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people in the company feel good, and it wasn't always
that way,'' Shipley said, recalling the incident. ``I think people
in Chase today feel proud.''

SUMI JO ENLIVENS RECITAL WITH FLAIR AND FINESSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CHARLES WARD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reasons some likely singers haven't appeared in a Houston
Grand Opera production can be myriad and mysterious _ as
complicated as scheduling, or as simple as not fitting in with the
program of general director David Gockley.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Korean soprano Sumi Jo, who made her Houston
debut Sunday in a recital co-sponsored by HGO and the
Korean-American Association of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Jo, a graduate of the Saint Cecilia Academy in Rome, sang a
program of art songs, opera arias and Korean folk songs at the
Wortham Theater Center in downtown Houston. She is a singer of high
artistic sensitivity and skill who engrossed almost everyone
present.
</P>
<P>
   From the first notes of the opening song, Rossini's ``La
promessa'' (``The Promise''), Jo prompted me to muse on what makes
some singers so magnetic in performance _ and also, what pre-empts
them from having a greater career.
</P>
<P>
   Jo is a specialist in coloratura and bel canto repertoire, music
from Mozart through Bellini and Donizetti that invites an almost
promiscuous display of technical virtuosity in runs, leaps and high
notes.
</P>
<P>
   In her two announced arias, ``Una voce poco fa'' from Rossini's
``The Barber of Seville'' (normally a mezzo-soprano's forte) and
``Ah, fors' lui,'' the miniscene that ends Act 1 of Verdi's ``La
Traviata,'' Jo scurried every which way with the nonchalance of a
virtuoso.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially for her success, she backed up display with
storytelling and emotion of exceptional depth and substance. The
audience indicated clearly that it sensed the skill in Jo's
performance of numerous folk songs.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the recital, William Vendice played the folk songs'
almost rococo piano accompaniments with exceptional grace and
beauty. He and Jo had the good fortune of using probably the best
piano heard publicly in the city, the Hamburg Steinway that the
chamber music society, Da Camera, keeps at the Cullen Theater.
</P>
<P>
   At least Sunday, Jo's voice had a tight though not pronounced
quiver. Yet, rather than distracting, that quality was part of the
distinctiveness of her voice. Jo was a master of subtly coloring
her sound to emphasize details of texts, while keeping the tone
consistently clear and focused.
</P>
<P>
   Those three elements _ technical virtuosity, interpretation and
vocal color _ were at the heart of Jo's allure as a recitalist.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there was a matter that is crucial in defining
the scope of a career: reliability. Rather consistently, Jo did not
land squarely in the center of the pitch of high notes that count _
the tops of phrases, the last two notes of the final cadence, and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   It is the singer who persuades the listener that there will be
no flaws, no questions about the voice at such moments, who will
have the stellar career and the most fiercely loyal fans.

 &HT;    HBOC: Troubled McKesson dismisses chairman
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ McKesson HBOC on Monday put the blame for its
accounting problems squarely on former executives of Atlanta-based
HBO &AMP; Co., firing Chairman Charlie McCall, who built HBO &AMP; Co. into
the U.S. leader in health care software.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson also fired four other executives of its health care
information technology unit _ the former HBO &AMP; Co., which was
acquired by McKesson earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   And the San Francisco-based company said that two McKesson
officers would resign. They are Mark Pulido, 46, chief executive
officer and president, and Chief Financial Officer Richard Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   The management shake-up won't affect the company's Alpharetta,
Ga.-based operations, said John Hammergren. He and David Mahoney
will be co-chief executive officers of McKesson HBOC.
</P>
<P>
   The purge came after a 14-hour board meeting Friday. It follows
a year-end audit in April that found $42 million in sales were
improperly recorded by HBO &AMP; Co. That news drove McKesson shares
down 50 percent in one day.
</P>
<P>
   The company said a month later that it would restate earnings,
and warned that HBO &AMP; Co. results may have to be restated for at
least two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson is conducting an audit of the accounting problems. But
the company revealed new details about those irregularities Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson spokesman Larry Kurtz said the HBO &AMP; Co. accounting
improprieties ``were outside of normal business practices, were
secretive and appeared to be intentionally kept from (McKesson's)
due-diligence team during the acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the four former HBO &AMP; Co. individuals were fired
``for cause,'' Kurtz said. The four are Albert Bergonzi, who was
president and chief executive of the information technology unit;
David Held, who was CFO and controller; Jay Lapine, who was general
counsel; and Michael Smeraski, who was head of enterprise sales.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's firing occurred because the problems ``happened on his
watch,'' Kurtz said.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting problems, Kurtz said, related to the practice of
contingency sales. Software contracts were signed for HBO &AMP; Co.
products, but the salesman and a hospital customer also would
create a ``side letter'' that stated a contingency for that sale,
such as a hospital board's approval, Kurtz said. Revenues were
nevertheless recorded at that point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kurtz said that sales can't be recognized until all
contingencies are satisfied. The side letters were kept secret even
from HBO &AMP; Co.'s auditors, Arthur Andersen, Kurtz added. The
improprieties date back at least one year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz would not comment on whether the accounting problems were
known by Jay Gilbertson, a former chief financial officer at HBO &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson joined Atlanta-based Internet company WebMD in
November. That company said last week that he was resigning.
Gilbertson denied the disclosure was related to the financial
problems at HBO &AMP; Co. From the start, the merger of McKesson, a $30
billion pharmaceutical distribution company, and HBO &AMP; Co. raised
questions about a lack of strategic fit. But McKesson officials
asserted the business combination would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we've changed is senior management,'' said Graham King,
who will be president of the information technology unit. ``We're
not changing strategy. McKesson HBOC remains absolutely committed
to the Atlanta market.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall, 55, could not be reached for comment Monday at his
Alpharetta office. Nor could the other four former HBO &AMP; Co.
executives be reached.
</P>
<P>
   McCall came to HBO &AMP; Co. from IBM in 1991. At the time, the
software and services company had high debt and a stock price stuck
in the single digits.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996 and 1997, HBO &AMP; Co. led all other Georgia public
companies in financial performance, as measured by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   McCall got much of the credit for the company's spurt. He owns
about 1.7 million shares of McKesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCall did a great job; he's a great leader,'' said Sheldon
Dorenfest of Sheldon Dorenfest and Associates, which analyzes the
health care information technology business. ``Everybody has their
strengths and weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet analyst Mike Krensavage of Brown Brothers Harriman noted,
``It's not every day that a company's board fires its chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Krensavage pointed out that in contrast to the firings, Pulido
and Hawkins, the McKesson holdovers, were allowed to resign. Both
McKesson and the former HBO &AMP; Co. remain the market leaders in
their niches, noted David Risinger of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
McKesson, he said, ``is clearing the slate to move the company
forward.'' McKesson shares fell $2.37 1/2 to close at $33.68 3/4 in
New York Stock Exchange trading.

EX-MISTRESS ADMITS `BITTERNESS' IN CISNEROS AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Linda Medlar told a hushed courtroom Monday that
she secretly taped telephone talks with former Housing Secretary
Henry Cisneros out of fear he would end his financial support
following disclosure of their extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was jealously, it was bitterness,'' said Medlar, 50. ``He
was going to Washington. I wasn't doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And she admitted in the federal court hearing to altering the
tapes to remove self-incriminating threats to ``tell the press, the
president, anyone who would listen'' about Cisneros' arrangement
that funneled $250,000 into her bank accounts before and after his
nomination to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar, also known by her married name Linda Jones, was poised
in her retelling of the publicity that swirled through San Antonio
in 1988 when Cisneros made their affair public. And she recounted
the pain of later being rejected by him.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros was not at Monday's hearing, but his lawyers are trying
to keep the tapes from being admitted as evidence when he goes on
trial on conspiracy charges after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the government has advised the court
already ... they were tampered with. End of story,'' Cisneros'
lawyer, Barry Simon, said of the recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The defense will have its turn with Medlar today during
cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes form the crux of Independent Counsel David Barrett's
conspiracy case against Cisneros, who is charged with lying to the
FBI about the payments to Medlar to protect his Cabinet-level
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin rejected the defense's
motion to close the hearing, saying, ``My courtroom is open.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sporkin complained about the ``blizzard'' of last-minute
filings made on Cisneros' behalf to quash testimony and potential
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin, who has set a Sept. 7 trial date, is expected to rule
on a portion of the motions this week. The proceedings are expected
to last through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackowski, a prosecutor with Barrett's office, brought
Medlar to the stand to open the hearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She told the court she edited the tapes with a ``boom box'' to
erase embarrassing sexual material, conversations about third
parties and to remove threats she made to Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said she edited the tapes shortly before she filed a
breach-of-contract lawsuit in 1994 accusing Cisneros of failing to
live up to a verbal agreement that gave her $4,000 per month in
support.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was later settled out of court for an undisclosed
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said her lawyers in the civil lawsuit, Bruce Magness and
Floyd Holder of Lubbock, Texas, instructed her to erase the threats
``because it looks like extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she used the ``stop'' and ``pause'' buttons to edit the
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no scientific method to it,'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar appeared as part of an agreement to reduce the 3-1/2-year
sentence she received after pleading guilty to 28 counts of money
laundering, bank fraud and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges also resulted from Barrett's $7 million
investigation into allegations that Cisneros lied to the FBI and
Internal Revenue Service about the $250,000 in ``hush money'' paid
to Medlar to protect his nomination to serve in President Clinton's
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged are John Rosales and Sylvia Arce-Garcia, aides who
moved from San Antonio to Washington to work for Cisneros at HUD.
Cisneros is a former mayor of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The three have pleaded not guilty and did not attend Monday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar was brought here from Carswell Federal Medical Center in
Fort Worth to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers are asking for a psychological examination of
Medlar, who admitted Monday that she was hospitalized for an
overdose of sleeping pills when her affair with Cisneros was made
public.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar testified that when Cisneros moved to Washington for the
Cabinet post in 1992, advisers to President-elect Clinton warned
that the payments ``looked like hush money, blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just very insecure about everything,'' Medlar said. ``I
knew at that point in time Henry could care less about me. He was
focused on getting to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros was HUD secretary from 1993 to 1996. He is now the
president of the Spanish-language, television network Univision.

COMMENTARY: ALL IN THE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Jewish Jerusalem used to just be divided between
secular and religious. Today the divide is so much more profound.
This city is now part Tehran, part Palo Alto. It has one foot in
cyberspace and the other in the Second Temple. Part of Jerusalem's
youth have Bill Gates as their role model and another part the
fiddler on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem's Har Hotzvim district, Israeli companies are
designing the next generation of the Internet. Indeed, outside of
Silicon Valley, Israel's Silicon Wadi is now the most dynamic
producer of Internet technologies _ notably Internet security
systems _ in the world. Yet a mile away from Har Hotzvim, in
Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox Mea Shearim neighborhood, wall posters
now regularly appear warning residents not to have Internet-linked
computers in their homes because of the worlds it might open. These
ultra-Orthodox don't like windows or Windows.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the recent Israeli election was actually two revolts
at once. The first was a revolt by the secular fundamentalists _
the high priests of high tech, who are powering the dynamic,
computer side of the Israeli economy. They voted in droves for
ultra-secular parties, as a way of saying to the no-tech, religious
fundamentalists that the secularists were no longer going to let
their tax dollars, generated from 21st-century innovations, be used
to fund 18th-century ghetto schools, where kids are given no math,
science or computing skills that might prepare them for the future.
(Israel has no core curriculum, so you can teach whatever you want,
even in state-financed schools.)
</P>
<P>
   The counter-revolt was by the ultra-Orthodox and traditional
Sephardic Jews, who rallied in droves to the Shas party, making it
the third-largest in Israel, just behind Likud. Their message was:
``Once again we are being left behind. We have been here for three
generations, but new Russian immigrants, many of them not really
Jews, have come in with their education and skills and leapfrogged
over us. So we're voting Shas to express our rejection of the
yuppified, Internet-obsessed, secularizing elites, who want to keep
us down and assimilate Israel into global mush.''
</P>
<P>
   How Ehud Barak manages these twin revolts will be the domestic
drama in Israel. It will be worth watching because how modern,
liberal democracies deal with such fundamentalist social-protest
movements is now a worldwide challenge. We've seen three
strategies: The first was used by Bibi Netanyahu (and his Labor
predecessors), which was to try to buy off Shas by plying it with
state funds in return for political support. But that resulted in
Shas sending thousands of kids to their own schools, where they
learned virtually no skills and became wards of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the Algerian model: Simply crush the
fundamentalists. The third model was tried (and failed) in Turkey:
Bring the fundamentalists into power, but set some real limits on
them to force them toward modernity. This is the model that Barak
will attempt by bringing Shas into his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   There is one reason for hope. Shas now has an internal
contradiction: It has been so successful at attracting non-Orthodox
Sephardic youth (Shas won 13 percent of the army vote!) that it
will have to be increasingly sensitive to their demands _ and these
non-Orthodox Sephardim want better schools and skills, so they can
compete with the Russians. So Shas itself needs to find a road to
modernity without losing its identity.
</P>
<P>
   The state has to help them do that. It should begin by changing
the law that says anyone who shuns army service for religious
reasons can't hold a job and must stay in yeshiva. Israel needs to
let those Shas youth, who for religious reasons don't want to serve
in the army, be able to work if they so choose. ``There is nothing
that says Orthodox people can't work with computers,'' says Shlomo
Kalish, the Orthodox founder of Jerusalem Global, one of
Jerusalem's most dynamic high-tech venture capital companies. ``In
fact, yeshiva graduates can make great programmers. They are used
to sitting for long hours working on logic problems. But the
government has to set them free to work, even if they choose not to
serve in the army.''
</P>
<P>
   My hope is that Barak's motto will be: ``Draft Shas into the
21st century, not the army.'' Nothing would do more to begin
healing Israel's internal divide.

   Barr throws support behind Forbes campaign
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Sherman
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) is supporting Steve Forbes's
presidential campaign, joining the magazine publisher's effort to
attract social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said Monday that he is endorsing Forbes because he is an
articulate conservative who ``addresses the
</P>
<P>
   issues _ he doesn't evade them.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said would take an active role in Forbes's campaign, to the
extent that his own congressional re-election campaign permits. He
cited Forbes's stance against gun control and his detailed proposal
to reform the Social Security system as reasons for his
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement is the first from an elected Republican in
Georgia, and reflects the view of some social conservatives that
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has been vague or too moderate on a
range of social issues.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of House Republicans and many Georgia elected
officials have lined up behind Bush. Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) is
a leader of the congressional contingent backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, however, said of Bush, ``I don't know an awful lot about
him. I know more about Forbes because he actually addresses
issues....He has not seemed to go out of his way to avoid
addressing issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign hopes Barr's support will give the candidate
a boost in the contest to emerge as the conservative alternative to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Barr has been outspoken in his condemnation of gay marriages,
his efforts to impeach President Clinton and his staunch support
for gun rights, among other issues that galvanize the right wing of
the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we have to do is energize those folks who don't
believe the pace of reform and pace of change is going fast enough
and are concerned that George W. Bush is not the person who can do
that. Barr can help us do that,'' said Rusty Paul, Forbes's
Southern political director and former Georgia GOP chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Paul also dismissed the notion that Barr, as a lightning rod for
controversy in his 4 1/2 years in Congress, will turn off potential
supporters of the wealthy candidate, who spent more than $30
million of his own money on his 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is win-win for us. We've got resources. We need to make
this a two-man race,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   They make, in some respects, an unlikely pair. Barr, a
Midwesterner of modest means, often drops the final ``g'' from
words to sound more Southern. Forbes lives in New Jersey's
high-priced horse country and travels in his private jet.
</P>
<P>
   But each praised the other's forthright stands, regardless of
their popularity. In a statement, Forbes called Barr ``a principled
conservative.'' Barr returned the compliment, saying Forbes ``is
not afraid to tackle the tough issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is expected to announce the support of other prominent
Georgians next month.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, along with most other Georgians in Congress, backed Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas for president in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nick Smith (R-Mich.) is the only other House member to have
announced his support for Forbes.

JUDGE TELLS FOREST SERVICE NOT TO CAST SHADOW OVER RAINBOW FAMILY
GATHERINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A federal judge in Springfield has decided
that America's hippies deserve a little less attention from the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In a 26-page ruling this month, Senior U.S. District Judge
Russell Clark barred the U.S. Forest Service from using checkpoints
and roadblocks to discourage illegal activity at the annual
gatherings of the Rainbow Family on public land.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Family is a large but loose collection of
counterculture enthusiasts who gather every summer at a national
forest.
</P>
<P>
   Their events draw people from throughout the country who pursue
spiritual rejuvenation, eat from rustic communal kitchens and shed
mainstream taboos about public nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Clark noted that a system of Forest Service checkpoints and
roadblocks at the Rainbow Family's 1996 gathering near Thomasville,
Mo. _ which drew 15,000 _ uncovered only four felony drug cases
worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Targeting a group _ any group _ and setting up a checkpoint in
close proximity to the site of their gathering in order to ferret
out a few lawbreakers cannot be done at the expense of trammeling
the rights of law-abiding citizens,'' Clark wrote. ``Basically
subjecting Rainbow Family members to a `shakedown' to achieve
ignominious results should strike fear into any citizen who values
their personal liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Tracie Park, who
attended the 1996 gathering and contended that the Forest Service
had violated her Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable
search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who now lives in Canada, could not be reached for comment.
Her lawyer in Kansas City, Fred Slough, said Clark's ruling was an
important addition to the law governing how police can use
roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   While the Supreme Court has allowed the use of roadblocks for
narrow purposes, such as to catch drunken drivers or illegal
aliens, it has not approved them for discouraging crime in general,
Slough said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement has taken this idea of using roadblocks to an
extreme,'' Slough said. ``This is a little finger in the dike
saying, `Hey, the courts have authorized roadblocks, but not
anytime you want them.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Steve Duncan of the Peace Conspiracy in Springfield
attended the 1996 gathering and was elated with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we wanted to hear!'' Duncan said Monday. Clark
``is a very insightful judge who upheld the Constitution and our
forefathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Davis, a Forest Service spokeswoman, deferred comment on
the ruling to the U.S. attorney's office in Kansas City, which
represented the agency. Davis noted, however, that the service was
not using checkpoints at this year's Rainbow Family gathering, now
getting under way at Little Bear Creek in Pennsylvania's Allegheny
National Forest. The service will depend on police patrols to
enforce traffic laws and federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Stephen Hill was traveling Monday and could not be
reached for comment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The agreement reached early Monday to
disband the Kosovo Liberation Army included, at the insistence of
its commanders, a pledge by the NATO allies to consider letting the
rebels form a provisional army for Kosovo modeled on the National
Guard in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, signed in the dead of night after a frenetic
weekend of military and political wrangling from a mountainous
rebel redoubt in central Kosovo to the capitals of Europe, gave no
timetable for creating an army and no details of its size or
mission.
</P>
<P>
   But the inclusion of the pledge ensures that even after laying
down its arms, the Kosovo Liberation Army can pursue its ambition
to remain an organized political and military force in the Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the rebels agreed to a phased demilitarization,
an immediate cease-fire and a cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO stopped far short of endorsing the idea, promising
only to give it ``due consideration'' as the future of Kosovo is
debated in the months ahead, the rebel group's leaders spoke Monday
as though an army for a free Kosovo was, in their minds, a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will form an army according to NATO's standards, while at
the same time staying loyal to our national and historical
traditions,'' Gen. Agim Ceku, the Kosovo Liberation Army's
commander in the war against Yugoslav forces, said in an interview
after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   What to do with the rebel group _ said to include 10,000
hardened fighters and some 30,000 irregulars who joined after being
driven from their homes by President Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown
this spring _ has proved to be one of NATO's foremost challenges as
its peacekeepers have moved to exert control over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The consideration of an army _ let alone the creation of one _
is sure to infuriate Yugoslavia, which accused NATO of aiding the
rebels' cause throughout 78 days of bombing. But even some NATO
members, particularly Germany, opposed including the pledge in the
final document. The objections, from NATO's political arm, delayed
its approval and signing until the early hours Monday morning, even
though rebel commanders and NATO military officials had reached
agreement late Saturday night, toasting it with Bushmill's Irish
whisky at Ceku's wartime home in the mountains of central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Germany relented only after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright met the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, over
dinner on Sunday night at the conference of the major industrial
powers in Cologne and explained that the rebel leaders would not
agree to disarm unless the agreement included the provision.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's spokesman, James Rubin, who appeared at a
news conference here Monday with the rebels' political leader,
Hashim Thaci, said the paragraph outlining the idea of an armed
force was ``an expression of the aspirations of the Kosovo
Liberation Army'' and, for now, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a decision for the future, as part of the process that
determines the final status of Kosovo,'' said Rubin, who took part
in the final flurry of negotiations with rebel leaders on Saturday
at their wartime headquarters near the village of Lapusnik.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war with Yugoslavia, the United States and other NATO
nations strongly opposed independence for Kosovo, but the abortive
peace accord negotiated in Rambouillet, France, on the eve of the
bombing called for an international consideration of the province's
future within three years. Milosevic rejected that deal, and now
with NATO in control of the province, calls for a resolution of
Kosovo's status could well come sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci signed the agreement on behalf of all the Kosovo
Liberation army's commanders just after midnight, only hours after
the last Yugoslav soldiers and special police officers left Kosovo
on Sunday, formally handing over control of the province to NATO's
growing peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The NATO commander here, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, said the
agreement was a turning point in the peacekeeping operation, known
as KFOR, enhancing the sense of security across Kosovo by ensuring
that the rebels' return ``to civilian life will begin rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very soon, therefore, KFOR, will be the only military security
presence here,'' Jackson said at a news conference in Pristina.
``And that is how it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the rebels must immediately respect a
cease-fire and renounce the use of force. They must also stop
setting up checkpoints, laying mines or conducting any other
``military, security or training-related activities,'' though the
agreement did not deny them the right to self-defense, a sign of
the on-going volatility in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Within seven days, the rebels and NATO will agree on storage
sites for their weapons, except for pistols and non-automatic
rifles. They must also clear any minefields or booby traps, vacate
any fortifications used during the war and assemble in locations
agreed to by NATO's commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 days, they will no longer be permitted to carry
prohibited weapons, including all automatic rifles like AK-47s, any
weapon 12.7 millimeter or larger, and all missiles, mines, grenades
or other explosives. Once those weapons are stored, they will be
under joint control of the rebels and NATO for 60 days, after which
NATO will assume complete control. NATO's military commanders had
initially proposed that the group's fighters stop wearing their
uniforms or other insignia within 30 days, but in another
concession to the group's leaders, they agreed to give them 90 days
before they must officially disband as a uniformed force.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Ceku said we had to ease them out of their role,'' a
senior diplomat involved in the talks said. ``We couldn't just
throw them out in the cold.''

   nn
</P>
<P>
   That will ensure that the visible presence of the group, which
spread to virtually every city and village in Kosovo as the Serbian
forces withdrew over the last 11 days, remains through the summer.
Thousands of Serbian civilians have fled Kosovo, citing the
presence of the fighters, whom they fear as terrorists bent on
violent domination.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Jackson again pledged that NATO would be
even-handed in enforcing the peace, protecting all of the
province's civilians, Albanians, Serbs and Gypsies. ``I hope all _
and I stress all _ who left in fear will return,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also apologized for the widespread looting and burning
of Serbian homes on Sunday _ in several instances under the watch
of NATO troops _ as the last Yugoslav army and police units
withdrew. Referring in particular to the village of Grace, where
several homes were destroyed by Albanians, he said, ``On that
occasion we fell short of what I would have wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took pains to emphasize that the document signed Monday
was a ``unilateral undertaking'' on the part of the rebels to abide
by the conditions laid out in the U.N. Security Council resolution
governing NATO's peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the sensitivity of appearing to endorse the
creation of a provisional army, he insisted that this was not a
formal pact with NATO, like the one with Yugoslav generals that
laid out the deadlines for withdrawing their troops.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the agreement proved to be the final obstacle in
talks that began on the military level in Albania on Tuesday and
continued straight through Saturday, when Thaci become involved as
the rebels' ``commander in chief.'' The paragraph dealing with an
army was repeatedly inserted and taken out, until NATO's
negotiators realized that the rebels would not agree without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to show them respect,'' the senior diplomat said.
``These are fighters who have been through a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   With the concessions, the rebel leaders clearly were pleased
with the agreement, even though, for now, it means handing over
their weapons to NATO. ``The KLA has been fighting to achieve what
we have achieved today,'' Thaci said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the KLA would be transformed ``in both the
political and military aspect.'' As for the military, he said the
group would seek only to ``become a defensive army.'' The agreement
also called for the rebels to be given ``special consideration''
for posts with a new civilian police force in Kosovo ``in view of
the expertise they have developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal was signed, President Clinton and Albright called
Thaci to express support for the rebels' willingness to abide by
NATO's demands and begin a transition to civilian life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understood that it was a very difficult decision for the
KLA after for so long pursing their objectives through military
means,'' Rubin said, ``that it was a difficult act of political
courage to transform this organization.''

AFTER ONE WEEKEND OF PLAY: WOMEN'S WORLD CUP WILL NOT BE A U.S.
CORONATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It is apparent after the opening weekend that the
Women's World Cup will be something more than a three-week
coronation for the United States, which must now face a Nigerian
team that has Patience and Mercy in its lineup but not in its
temperament.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds were record breaking, and the talent was impressively
deep and widespread in four weekend doubleheaders. The U.S.-Denmark
match drew 78,972 at Giants Stadium, the largest audience for a
women's sporting event in the United States. A doubleheader in San
Jose, Calif., drew 23,289 in a 26,000-seat stadium. Although
matches in Foxboro, Mass., (14,873) and Pasadena, Calif., (17,102)
drew fewer than 20,000 fans, the weekend total of 134,236 surpassed
the 112,000 for the entire 1995 Women's World Cup in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales have passed 500,000 _ including more than 60,000
for Thursday's United States-Nigeria match here at Soldier Field _
and organizers are hoping that the total might reach 600,000. That
would shatter the world record for a sporting event held for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm incredibly pleased,'' Marla Messing, president of the
tournament's organizing committee, said Monday from Los Angeles.
``Our mandate was to sell out, or have near sellouts, for the U.S.
games and to have respectable crowds at the other games. Having
14,000 at Foxboro for Ghana-Australia and Norway-Russia is
excellent. No one ever expected us to get out of single digits.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one game _ Brazil's 7-1 blowout of Mexico _ was not
competitive. There were no 0-0 ties, which non-soccer fans use as
an excuse to bash the sport. And, unlike the inaugural Women's
World Cup in 1991, the gap between the best and worst teams has
shrunk. Ghana is a 1,000-to-1 shot to win the tournament, but it
still managed a 1-1 tie with Australia, despite being down one
player for 65 minutes when Barikisu Tettey-Quao drew the
championship's first red card. Ghana's delighted fans responded by
handing the players $10 bills and $20 bills for good luck.
</P>
<P>
   The women's game has become increasingly sophisticated in terms
of goalkeeping, tactics and gamesmanship, such as melting the clock
and drawing fouls, which Italy smartly did to earn a 1-1 tie with
Germany, the 1995 runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping the field wouldn't be as good as it is,'' said
Tony DiCicco, the American coach.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, a team in the Americans' group, remains as unknown
after the first weekend as it was before the tournament began. Its
star, Kim Kum Sil, was yanked early in Sunday's match against
Nigeria and proceeded to sit in front of the team bench, not
speaking a word to her coach or teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if her coach was mad at her or what,'' said
Lauren Gregg, the American assistant coach who scouted the match.
</P>
<P>
   While Kim sat and sulked, Nigeria won, 2-1, with a style that
resembled a videotape set on fast-forward. There is only one gear
for this engaging team: pedal to the metal. The Super Falcons, as
they are known, beat China, 4-3, in a World Cup tuneup on three
goals by Patience Avre and are flying with extreme confidence.
Mercy Akide showed no mercy against North Korea, rocketing home a
goal and collecting an assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if we meet the Brazilian men's team, I believe in
attacking football,'' said Ismaila Mabo, Nigeria's coach.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco said that he might make a lineup change to counter
Nigeria's speed, mentioning that Sara Whalen, Christie Pearce or
Shannon MacMillan may be called on to pass the baton in what could
be a 90-minute relay race. To keep the Nigerian fast break in
neutral, the Americans say they must extend their own possession of
the ball. They also expect to exploit the gaps created when the
Super Falcons swoop forward in a swarming but risky attack.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, which received hat tricks from Pretinha and Sissi, looms
for a mesmerizing samba in the quarterfinals or semifinals. Norway,
the defending champion, dominated Russia, 2-1, as forward Marianne
Pettersen deftly pulled balls out of the air and fired them on
goal. China, the Olympic silver medalist, struggled to win, 2-1,
over Sweden and will need its top scorer, Sun Wen, who shoots
precisely from distance, to recover fully from a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Most important for this World Cup to succeed in the public
imagination, the identifiable American star, Mia Hamm, brilliantly
calmed a nervous team with a goal and an assist, dismantling
Denmark and her reputation of not always playing big in big
tournaments. ``Her unique finesse and her instinct for the game
separate her from the crowd,'' said Leo Cuellar, the Mexican coach.
``Her quickness off the ball, her passing, dribbling, cutting, are
up to the level of high-class men in the world.''  &QL;

ADMINISTRATION HOPES TO AVOID SHOWDOWN ON STEEL QUOTAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Mont.)  (lh) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Senate poised to act Tuesday on a bill
that would sharply restrict the amount of imported steel in the
United States, the Clinton administration took a series of actions
Monday to convince Congress that it could protect the jobs of
American steelworkers with far less drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   The actions, announced by Commerce Secretary William Daley,
appeared intended to stem the number of Democrats in the Senate
planning to vote for the steel quota bill, which would roll exports
back to 1997 levels and has been pressed by steelworkers and steel
manufacturers. The bill, which the administration denounces as
protectionist, has already sailed through the House by a vote of
289-141.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest in a series of confrontations over trade policy
with his own party, President Clinton has promised to veto the
measure if it reaches his desk. But the White House desperately
wants to avoid that step because it would cause create enormous
political problems for Vice President Al Gore, who is trying to
court the votes of the United Steelworkers of America, the AFL-CIO
and voters in steelmaking states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is agony for Gore,'' one senior administration official
said, ``because it puts him in the position of angering supporters
who he needs very much. And the Republicans know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House argues _ and many trade experts agree _ that the
bill's import quotas would violate global trade treaties. There is
little doubt it would be struck down if challenged before the World
Trade Organization _ though the legal arguments could drag on for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding a violation of America's trade commitments, however,
carried little sway with the House in March. And those arguments
may not overcome tremendous political pressure in the Senate.
Hundreds of steelworkers plan to raise the level of pressure on
Tuesday morning with a noisy arrival outside the Senate on a fleet
of Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a convergence of agendas here,'' said Gary Hubbard,
the spokesman for the United Steelworkers. ``This is an emergency
restraint measure to save high-wage jobs. And there are Republicans
who want to see Vice President Gore associated with the White House
position against this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley, in the midst of a day of lobbying against the bill on
Capitol Hill, announced Monday that as an alternative he was
beginning an investigation into whether steel from Japan, China,
Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand and other nations was being
``dumped'' in the United States at unfairly low prices. Four of
those nations received financial bailouts led by the United States
over the last two years and have been exporting aggressively _ in
part on the advice of the International Monetary Fund _ to get back
on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   But that export strategy has already begun to cost a relatively
modest number of jobs in smaller steelmaking factories nationwide.
Daley argued Monday that there were ways of dealing with that job
loss short of sending a message that the United States is closing
its doors to imports _ and opening the way to retaliation against
American goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of message would we send if we _ as the world's
leading economic power, riding the wave of an historic sustained
expansion and the one bright spot during the long months of
economic turmoil elsewhere in the world _ now send the message that
we intend to close our borders and violate international trading
rules?'' Daley asked Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As in many trade arguments, the White House has lost more
Democrats than Republicans. Chief among them is Sen. Jay
Rockefeller of West Virginia, whose state includes Weirton Steel
and other large steel manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing very well putting the votes together,''
Rockefeller said Monday afternoon. ``The White House is clearly
scared about how far this has come, because this has everything to
do with Gore's future.''
</P>
<P>
   But another Democratic senator, Max Baucus of Montana, said in
an interview that he had decided to vote against the measure
because ``it would encourage other countries to retaliate against
us, in agriculture and other areas.'' Baucus' state is a leading
exporter of farm goods, an easy target for retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has stayed silent on the issue, and his office declined
Monday to say what he thinks about the bill. But in private he is
trying to weave a line between the steel unions and the White
House, hoping to avoid a vote altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That was the strategy in announcing new dumping investigations
Monday, involving cold-rolled steel, which is used to make cars,
bicycles and household appliances. But it will take months before
the Commerce Department issues a final ruling on whether dumping is
taking place. In the far more lucrative area of hot-rolled steel,
the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission just
approved punitive tariffs against Japan, South Korea and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argues that its administrative actions have
worked and that steel imports are subsiding. But the unions and
steelmakers interpret the data very differently, and they have
demanded protection.
</P>
<P>
   It could turn out to be expensive protection. A study published
by the Institute for International Economics earlier this month
estimates that restricting steel imports will send prices up
significantly for cars, construction materials and other steel
products. The report, prepared by Gary Hufbauer and Erika Wada,
estimated that the bill would preserve the jobs of 1,700 workers at
an annual cost to consumers of $800,000 a worker.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would not ban all steel imports, but rather they would
limit them to 1997 levels. The administration argues that steel
imports are falling back to that level anyway. ``If that is the
case,'' said Rockefeller, ``then the penalties won't go into effect
and they have nothing to worry about.''

 &HT;    JUDGE: MICROSOFT'S INTENT HOLDS KEY TO VERDICT
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects ``indented'' to ``intended `` in lede.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the last witness in the Microsoft antitrust
trial took the stand Monday, the presiding judge said the verdict
could well turn on whether Microsoft intended to turn Windows into
a predatory monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's intended behavior would prove crucial in deciding
the landmark case, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
suggested to Richard Schmalensee, dean of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology business school and Microsoft's final
witness in the 21-week-long trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that's what courts do every day,'' Jackson told
Schmalensee, who had just testified that, when it comes to
measuring pricing policies, economists typically cannot
successfully measure corporate intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see for the court's purposes that intent might be
relevant,'' Jackson said, engaging Schmalensee in an unusually
spirited and prolonged dialogue over the basic issues in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we call a smoking gun,'' Jackson declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's rare, of course,'' Schmalensee shot back.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange took place during a courtroom discussion of
``predatory'' behavior that turned on whether Microsoft had crossed
the line between aggressive business tactics that are legal and
anticompetitive actions that are not.
</P>
<P>
   However Jackson should rule, his findings of fact and law will
serve as the basis of an expected appeal that's likely to be
ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. As a consequence,
both sides have sought to wind up the testimony phase of the trial
by presenting theirs strongest possible arguments.
</P>
<P>
   For Schmalensee, that meant showing Microsoft's business
practices had benefited consumers or, the very least, had caused
them no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Where Schmalensee saw Microsoft's decision to embed Internet
browser technology in the widely used Windows operating system as
the natural and normal flow continually seeking to improve the
product, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead lawyer, saw
matters quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking outside the courtroom, Boies said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they intentionally set out to lose money? Did they make
these hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars _ a billion
dollars perhaps _ (in designing the Internet Explorer browser) with
any business plan that they would very recover it other than
through the price of Windows?
</P>
<P>
   ``This witness,'' Boies concluded, ``came very, very close today
to saying that the only way they were going to recoup was through
the price of Windows. That's exactly what the government's theory
is. They can get their money back by maintaining their Windows
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies plans to cross-examine Schmalensee on this key issue
Wednesday(cq).
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states contend that Microsoft
abused its Windows monopoly power for personal computers, thereby
stunting innovation and keeping prices high. Microsoft claims it
has done no wrong in a dynamic industry where vigorous competition
remains the watchword.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara noted that the judge
wanted to know whether it was correct to also view computer makers
as consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, it's not appropriate,'' Schmalensee said. The
economist said the hardware vendors are in reality distributors who
resell Windows, ``close to the way a Chevrolet dealer resells
Chevrolets.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a Cadillac dealer alter the engine or Cadillac name on
the cars it sells, it might well serve that particular dealer's
interest by making the outlet stand out from the pack. But,
Schmalensee added, ``it would weaken the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as Schmalensee saw it, Microsoft was had every right to
impose strict conditions on the ``look and feel'' of the
Windows-loaded machines when they were shipped from the factory.
</P>
<P>
   `consequence, both sides have sought to wind up the testimony
phase of the trial by presenting theirs strongest possible
arguments.

HELLESTRAE GETS ONE-YEAR DEAL FROM COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Deep snapper Dale Hellestrae has agreed to a
one-year contract worth $400,000 with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Hellestrae's signing represents a change in thinking by the
Cowboys, who earlier this spring had considered going with a
younger, less expensive player at the position.
</P>
<P>
   However, that was before Cowboys coach Chan Gailey called
Hellestrae's agent Steve Weinberg last week and said the Cowboys
would like to bring Hellestrae back.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said Hellestrae, a 14-year veteran who played the past
nine years with the Cowboys, is pleased, as he will head into
training camp with a chance to retain his role as the team's deep
snapper.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also signed a fourth quarterback, rookie free-agent
Brian Kuklick of Wake Forest. Kuklick, 6-foot-5 and 205 pounds,
will compete with Mike Quinn for the third quarterback spot behind
Troy Aikman and Jason Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also announced they have released cornerback Omar
Turner of Montana State and offensive lineman Brad Winn of North
Texas.

PANEL CONCLUDES BREAST IMPLANTS DON'T CAUSE CANCER

<P>
   Silicone breast implants do not cause women to develop cancer,
immunologic disease or neurological problems, according to a report
released by a committee of the Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   While the report did not find life-threatening illnesses related
to silicone breast inplants, it did find that implants can cause
``serious problems,'' including pain and disfigurement that require
surgery. It also reported that many women said they had not
received adequate information about possible problems with the
implants before receiving them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee heard directly and indirectly from many women
who suffer severe systemic illnesses that they firmly believe are
due to their silicone breast implants. Many of these women are
seriously ill, and the committee was moved by their suffering.
However, the committee is convinced that in most instances the
silicone breast implants are not causally related to these
illnesses since such illnesses appear to occur at about the same
frequency in women with silicone breast implants and in women
without implants,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's findings are in line with several other studies
that also found no scientific evidence to substantiate a link
between the implants and the systemic disease claims made by women.
The institute, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, also
found no evidence that breast-feeding women with implants pass
silicone to infants.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of whether implants make mammogram tests for
beast cancer more difficult, the report acknowledged the problem
but said that with special procedures radiologists can still
``ensure accurate readings.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning, once the largest manufacturer of the implants,
called the new report ``good news for women with implants.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is half-owned by Dow Chemical and half by
Corning and was forced into bankruptcy by the implant litigation,
does not have plans to alter its $3.2 billion settlement with women
who say the implants made them sick.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, claimants would be able to get $5,000 for
implant removal surgery and $20,000 for ruptured implants. The
leaking and rupturing of implants led to many of the complaints of
pain and disfigurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reached an agreement, we are committed and we would like to
resolve this once and for all and put it behind us,'' Doug
Schoettinger, a Dow Corning lawyer, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Schoettinger said women can opt out of the
settlement and pursue their own litigation. However, Schoettinger
said, ``fewer will probably pursue their own litigation as the
result of this'' report.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will go before bankruptcy court next week.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1.5 million and 1.8 million US women had silicone breast
implants by 1997, according to the report. The implants are now
banned except for experimental use.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of those women received implants for cosmetic
reasons, while 30 percent received them for breast reconstruction
after surgery for cancer, fibrocystic disease or other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Keithley Johnston of the Toxic Discovery Network, a
grass-roots consumer-protection group, called the report ``a step
backward.'' Johnston is a nurse who had silicone breast implants in
1984 and has been diagnosed with several medical problems,
including lupus and connective tissue ailments. Several friends who
had implants also have lupus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a sick person and you were a healthy person
before and the only common denominator is the implants,'' Johnston
said, ``then it is obvious that we can validate these women's
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marcia Angell, executive editor of the New England Journal
of Medicine, called the report ``thorough and . . . unequivocably
consistent with the findings of other panels.''
</P>
<P>
   Angell, who wrote ``Science on Trial'' about silicone breast
implants, was one of the first to state that there was no
scientific evidence to link implants to systemic illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientifically, we know everything that we have to know about
whether it causes disease. There has not been one credible study
that has found a connection, so maybe it will finally be put to
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Angell called the Dow Corning settlement an example of the
``legal system run amuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Knowles, a plaintiffs' attorney in Atlanta whose firm has
represented more than 900 silicone implant clients, said that he
does not consider the new report to be the ``last word'' about
implant safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that there is causation'' for disease, Knowles
said. ``Obviously every instance has not been caused by implants,
but at the end of the day, once we get over the manufacturers' hype
and their studies, then everyone will say it was real.''

NORTH KOREANS FAIL TO SHOW UP FOR TALKS  
 (HLW)

<P>
   BEIJING _ North Korean officials failed to turn up for
high-level talks with their South Korean counterparts here on
Monday, complaining that the South had failed to meet a Sunday
deadline to deliver 22,000 tons of fertilizer to North Korea, South
Korean officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were the first government-to-government discussions in
more than a year. The countries planned to discuss food aid to the
North, which has had severe food shortages for the last five years,
and the re-unification of families separated by the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans said they would start the talks after the
fertilizer arrives, the South Korean officials said, though no time
has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The ship carrying the fertilizer was delayed by rain and was
expected to reach the North Korean port of Nampo at 2 a.m. on
Tuesday. North Korean officials were previously informed of the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very regrettable that they are using the fertilizer aid
to delay the talks,'' Yang Young-shik, the South Korean vice
minister of unification, said at a news conference here Monday
afternoon. The 22,000 tons of fertilizer were the last installment
of 100,000 tons the South pledged to send to the North.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean delegation said it plans to stay in Beijing.
``We eagerly hope that talks can start tomorrow,'' said Wi
Keyei-chul, a spokesman for the South Korean Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The delay was not unexpected. Relations between the countries,
which are never simple, have worsened in the last week after a
skirmish in the Yellow Sea last Tuesday resulted in the sinking of
a North Korean torpedo boat and the death of at least 20 North
Korean sailors.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean delegation to the talks, which is already in
Beijing, did not comment on the postponement. But the North Korean
Embassy here called a news conference to berate South Korea for its
``reckless provocation'' in sending warships into what is said were
the North's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   The North does not recognize the ``northern limit line'' in the
Yellow Sea, which separates the two countries. Each side accused
the other of firing first last week after North Korean vessels
repeatedly crossed the line.

TOURIST DETAINED IN NORTH KOREA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ North Korea has detained a young South Korean tourist,
South Korean officials said on Monday. They said that the tourist,
34-year-old Min Yung-mi, was detained on Sunday while hiking with a
group in the mountains in the North. South Korean officials said
they hoped Ms. Min would be released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The detention is likely to add to the mistrust between the two
sides at a time when relations have suddenly taken a turn for the
worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the environment of mutual hostility, the tour groups to the
North had been a rare example of cooperation. Begun late last year,
they have brought more than 50,000 South Koreans to the scenic
Mount Kumgang region in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai Corp., South Korea's largest conglomerate, operates the
tour groups, and it said on Monday that it was also talking in
Beijing with its North Korean business partners about the
detention.
</P>
<P>
   The tours have been a centerpiece of the ``sunshine'' policy of
engagement vigorously pursued by President Kim Dae-jung of South
Korea. In return for the right to operate the tours, Hyundai has
paid $125 million in cash to North Korea this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Min, whose 6-year-old son was with her on the tour, was
detained by North Korean authorities after she struck up a
conversation with one of the officials she met on the tour. Lee
Bo-yong, a spokesman at South Korea's Unification Ministry, said
that Ms. Min had told a North Korean tour monitor that South Korean
television programs described the comfortable life style of North
Korean defectors to the south. North Korean officials then detained
her, accusing Ms. Min of trying to persuade North Koreans to
defect.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government delayed the departure of a cruise
ship that was to leave on Monday for North Korea. Moreover, the
vessel that Ms. Min traveled on did not return on Monday to South
Korea as scheduled, mainly on the hope that Ms. Min might be
released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai's tours leave South Korea virtually every day. In the
six months that the tours have been operating, this is the first
time a South Korean tourist has been detained.

COMMANDER OF KLA PLANS FOR FUTURE ARMY EVEN AS HE DISARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The chief of general staff of the Kosovo
Liberation Army already has the formation of a future army for
Kosovo planned out, even as he is preparing to disarm and
demobilize his guerrilla force.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel official, Gen. Agim Ceku, arrived on Monday in
Pristina, the Kosovo capital, dressed in his military fatigues, the
red and yellow rebel insignia on his cap and sleeve, to mark the
signing of the agreement to demilitarize.
</P>
<P>
   Ceku, 38, has emerged in the last three months as the leading
military figure of the Albanian separatist force in Kosovo. He is
the man who negotiated the bulk of the agreement on
demilitarization, and who will be responsible for carrying it out
with Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, the commander of the Kosovo
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, he said he had no doubt that Kosovo
would need its own army for its future defense, and he mapped out
his vision for such a force in detail.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would seek to form ``a defensive army from a small
number of soldiers, respecting our economic resources, the level of
danger we face and the demographics of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that under his plan, a Kosovo army would have a small
active core of professional soldiers and a larger component of
reserves. He said he also envisioned an ``intervention unit,''
similar to the National Guard in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sees it, such a fighting force would be formed within the
contours of collective security in Europe, since Kosovo would want
to take part in Western European alliances, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will respect all the standards of NATO, at the same time
staying loyal to our national and historical traditions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ceku, a Kosovo Albanian, got his military training in the
Yugoslav army under the former communist government. In 1991, as
several of the republics that had been part of Yugoslavia declared
their independence, he joined the Croatian army and was rapidly
promoted to the rank of general. He resigned his commission there
to return, in March, to fight against Serbian forces with the
Kosovo rebels. He was appointed their chief-of-staff in April.
</P>
<P>
   The general said the decision to demilitarize had been a very
hard one for the rebels. He said that ``one of the biggest
victories of the war was that for the first time'' Kosovo Albanians
had their own fighting force, adding: ``And every decision that is
made to lower the standing of the army is really hard. But all the
soldiers of the KLA and the people of Kosovo, we all want to be
part of the democratic world, and every decision of the
international community is an obligation for us too, even when it
is not in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   The commanders and their men would comply with the agreement to
disarm, he said, because the international community had guaranteed
to take into consideration the rebels' experience and role in the
conflict when recruiting people for the new institutions being
established in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, the rebels' political leader, who signed the
demilitarization agreement, said on Monday that the general was
``respected by all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His association with the KLA was from the very start of its
organization in the early 1990s, and he was instrumental in
structuring the KLA into a more professional force,'' Thaci said in
a separate interview on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Western official who had seen Ceku in his mountain
headquarters said rebel commanders had appeared deferential to the
general.
</P>
<P>
   The general defended his headquarters over the last three months
from a major Serbian offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci appeared confident that the order to demilitarize would be
obeyed. ``A soldier did not get his weapon to keep in his hand or
in his house,'' he said. ``He got it to fight to liberate Kosovo
from Serbia. That objective is realized, and our objective now is
to restructure and integrate ourselves into society.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceku said the rebel force had swelled to 20,000 during the last
month of the conflict. Until March, when the NATO bombing began, he
said, the force had consisted of 12,000 fighters and 4,000 to 5,000
unarmed volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 rebels were killed and 4,000 wounded during the 15
months the rebels fought Yugoslav troops, he said. About 100 are
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The general contended that the Serbian offensive had
strengthened the rebel group. ``It drew more people to our ranks,
and it gave us new military experience,'' he said, ``and by
surviving the offensive we gained the faith of the people. Without
the bombing, the Albanian people would have suffered much more.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia had planned an ethnic purge of Kosovo Albanians whether
NATO had begun its bombing campaign or not.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he would move down to Pristina from his mountain
hideout. A headquarters has already been selected in the wealthy
suburb of Kojlovica, the gate guarded by uniformed soldiers bearing
no weapons.

GARCIAPARRA GAINS IN ALL-STAR BALLOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With a week to go before the polls close, Red Sox
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra closed the gap again on Derek Jeter of
the Yankees in the latest balloting for the American League
All-Star team. But apparently for the fans in Cleveland, in a
perfect world every AL starter would be an Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Four Cleveland players lead in the voting for their positions:
first baseman Jim Thome, second baseman Roberto Alomar, and
outfielders Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Indians rank no lower than runner-up at their
positions, including ex-Sox outfielder Wilfredo Cordero, who is
second in the voting for DH despite being on the 60-day disabled
list with a fractured wrist. Sandy Alomar is second at catcher,
Travis Fryman is second at third base, and David Justice is fourth
among the outfielders, trailing the three starters.
</P>
<P>
   Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel, meanwhile, is third at his
position, trailing Jeter of the Yankees by just over 55,000 votes.
Garciaparra, who last week was nearly 15,000 votes behind Jeter, is
now 7,344 votes behind Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland showing can be attributed to several factors. The
Indians have drawn nearly 1.6 million fans, most in the majors.
They have the best record in baseball (45-21, .682), and their
lineup is stocked with former All-Stars at every position. Finally,
their fans are encouraged to vote early and often.

 &HT;    Turner rounds up the herd
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ted Turner is merging the Atlanta-based marketing arm
of his bison-raising operations into a national industry
cooperative based in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal, which will fold Turner's U.S. Bison Co. into
the North American Bison Cooperative, were not disclosed.
Specifically, U.S. Bison will merge into North American
Provisioner, the newly formed marketing arm of the cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the North American Bison Cooperative established North
American Provisioner, we realized the best thing for both companies
was to create a strong, unified alliance,'' said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   The merger doesn't mark Turner's exit from the bison business.
He will continue raising bison on his many ranches across the West
and selling them to the cooperative. The cooperative will then
handle the slaughtering, marketing and sale of the bison.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Turner's bison operations continue to grow. He has more
than 15,000 head of bison now, making him one of the largest single
bison ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   But Turner's son, Teddy Jr., is leaving the business. He had
been chairman of U.S. Bison, but it will no longer exist as a
separate company. The younger Turner will remain involved with his
other companies, which include e.TV Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. Bison will no longer exist as a separate company, its
name will live on in the Southeast. North American Bison will
continue to market its meat under the U.S. Bison brand name.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, North American Bison will retain U.S. Bison's
current president, Hansell Roddenbery, as its sales representative
in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Roddenbery has been on a roll recently. In a significant coup,
he announced that Publix supermarkets would carry bison hamburger
and hot dogs at its 64 locations in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public demand for bison has been steadily growing,'' says
Roddenbery.
</P>
<P>
   He has also signed deals with various restaurants in Atlanta.

 &HT;    Hartsfield airport sees rise in theft
 &HT;    By Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The world's busiest passenger airport is trying to fix
a larceny problem.
</P>
<P>
   With 73.5 million passengers coming and going in a year's time,
it may have been inevitable that Hartsfield International Airport
would run into a bad patch of thievery. Larceny at the airport is
up 26 percent for the first four months of this year, compared to
1998, according to Atlanta police.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Ben DeCosta said he has taken steps to fight the
thefts. More police now patrol the terminal, and a special unit of
16 bicycle-mounted customer service representatives routinely scour
the parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves are particularly fond of luggage, cell phones and laptop
computers left unattended on the concourses or on car seats in
parking lots. They also move through restrooms and make off with
jewelry and other valuables lying on counters, Atlanta police
spokesman John Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   DeCosta is awaiting figures from later in the year that he
expects will show a slowing of the crime increase. ``The police are
doing a fine job at the airport, and they should know it's
appreciated,'' the airport chief said.
</P>
<P>
   But stopping crime has to start with attentive passengers and
visitors, he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are leaving valuables in plain view,'' DeCosta said.
``These are crimes of opportunity. If we can change (people's)
behavior, then we can get a handle on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Larceny and auto theft accounted for all but seven of 529
incidents reported to police during the first four months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime _ homicides, rape and robbery _ is rare at the
airport. No homicides have been reported in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Total crime numbers rose 45 percent from 1997 to 1998. The
biggest leap was in car thefts, which doubled from 107 to 215 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   DeCosta has requested a further analysis of the reports to
determine whether a theft ring has developed or if other factors
are at work. For example, he said, thieves may be targeting rental
car agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the volume of passengers _ and not counting 43,000
employees and untold thousands of non-passengers going through the
airport _ the chances of becoming a crime statistic at Hartsfield
are small, airport officials conclude.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when 73.5 million passengers made Hartsfield the
busiest passenger airport in the world, the statistics work out to
one crime for every 47,700 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, DeCosta said the surge in larceny needs attention and is
a customer service problem. He attributes the problem in part to
the soaring volume of people passing through: Hartsfield had 9
percent more passengers this year.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other suspects, the airport's general manager
said. The rise in theft comes from several sources drawn by the
same circumstance _ they have plenty of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Arrest records indicate professional criminals and some homeless
people who camp out at Hartsfield know they can find unattended
valuables in the terminal and concourses, DeCosta said.
</P>
<P>
   Sting operations _ where airport police have left decoy items
unattended _ have shown that employees at the airport make up a
significant percentage of the thieves, DeCosta said. Six of the 10
arrested in the sting were employees, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Police are increasing their presence throughout the airport,
including four officers on bicycles who can be seen in the
terminal. The 150 police officers at Hartsfield have been working
longer shifts on overtime to increase their visibility. Undercover
police also are at work, said DeCosta.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Chicago O'Hare International Airport said an
increase in the number of police kiosks there have contributed to
an 11 percent drop in property crimes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare, which handled 72.5 million passengers last year,
experienced a drop in auto thefts from 125 in 1997 to 80 in 1998,
said Monique Bond of Chicago's Department of Aviation.
</P>
<P>
   The exception to the good news at O'Hare is a wave of crimes
taking place in restrooms, where theft is up 99 percent over the
two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be a crime trend,'' said Bond. ``Thieves understand
that it's a vulnerable point. You can't put a police officer in
every washroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with crime is not new for Hartsfield's DeCosta. He was
previously the head of Newark International Airport where, he
recalled, criminals were more resourceful than in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Newark had a problem with thieves going into women's rest rooms,
reaching over stall doors and yanking pocketbooks from the hooks
inside the doors. The thieves moved fast, so they just reached over
any closed door and gambled that they'd luck onto a purse.
</P>
<P>
   DeCosta said the problem was solved by the airport installing a
little cover over the top of the hook.Gary Hendricks writes for the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga. John McCosh contributed
to this report.

   WASHINGTON _ For more than 10 years, two U.S. district judges in
Birmingham, Ala., have fought against paying an occupational
license tax imposed by Jefferson County on the earnings of all
public officials and many other people who work in the county.
</P>
<P>
   The two judges might have expected to find a sympathetic ear at
the Supreme Court. But Monday, by a vote of 7-2, the court ruled
for the county and held that because the tax did not single out
federal employees for discriminatory treatment, it was permissible.
</P>
<P>
   The judges, William M. Acker Jr. and U.W. Clemon, had invoked a
doctrine known as intergovernmental tax immunity to argue that the
tax could not lawfully be applied to them. The 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, agreed in a decision last year,
holding that Jefferson County was improperly trying to impose a tax
on the privilege of performing the federal judicial function.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing that decision Monday in an opinion by Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, the court said the tax was just an income tax under
a different name. Congress in 1939, under the Public Salary Tax
Act, made federal employees subject to ordinary, nondiscriminatory
state and local income taxes. Lacking authority from the Alabama
Legislature to impose an income tax, Jefferson County in 1987
enacted the occupational license tax instead, levied at the rate of
0.5 percent of a person's gross earnings within the county. For the
judges, who earn $136,700 a year, the tax amounts to about $700
annually.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion Monday, Jefferson County vs. Acker, No. 98-10,
Ginsburg said the important aspect of the challenged tax was not
its form, but its function. While it looked like an effort to
license or regulate the judges, she said, ``in practice, Jefferson
County's license tax serves a revenue-raising, not a regulatory,
purpose.'' She said the county ``neither issues licenses to
taxpayers, nor in any way regulates them in the performance of
their duties.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said, ``The
language, structure, and purpose of the ordinance indicate that it
imposes a fee upon the performance or work, not a tax upon
income.'' His opinion was joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
while Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul
Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, and
Clarence Thomas voted to uphold the tax.

<P>
   As the court pressed to finish its term by the end of the week,
there were these other developments Monday.
</P>
<P>
   INDECENCY ON CABLE: Returning to an issue it has struggled with
in the past, the court agreed to decide whether the latest federal
effort to regulate sexually explicit programming on cable
television was constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The case, an appeal by the Clinton administration, concerns a
technological problem that permits viewers who have not paid for a
premium cable channel to nonetheless receive a portion of the
channel's video or audio signal through what is known as ``signal
bleed.'' Signal bleed is the result of an effort that is only
partly successful at scrambling a station's signal. As sexually
explicit premium or pay-per-view cable channels proliferated in the
early 1990s, Congress received complaints that some of the
programming was available to children in homes that did not want to
receive it.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a section of the Telecommunications Act of 1996
requiring sexually explicit channels to provide fully effective
blocking or, if they could not do so, to limit their programming to
the late evening so children would not be exposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling last year in a lawsuit brought by the Playboy
Entertainment Group, which operates the Playboy Television and
AdulTVision networks, a special three-judge U.S. District Court
panel in Wilmington, Del., declared the provision unconstitutional.
The court said that because of the free speech interests involved,
Congress was obliged to choose the ``least restrictive
alternative'' to deal with the problem, such as requiring cable
system operators to make blocking devices available on request.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, U.S. vs. Playboy Entertainment, No. 98-1682, the
administration told that Supreme Court that the district court's
analysis was ``deeply flawed'' and that its proposed solution,
depending on parental action, would not be effective in protecting
children. The case raises the deeper question of what type of First
Amendment analysis applies to cable television, a question the
court has yet to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   KIRYAS JOEL RETURNS: The court granted a stay of the latest
ruling in the long-running case of the Kiryas Joel School District
in Orange County, N.Y., effectively enabling the district to
continue in operation while the justices consider the case further.
</P>
<P>
   New York's highest court ruled last month that the state
Legislature's most recent attempt to overcome the constitutional
problems involved in creating a special school district for the
benefit of Kiryas Joel's Satmar Hasidim had failed. As in earlier
versions _ the Supreme Court struck one down in 1994 _ the district
still amounted to ``preferring one religion over others,'' the New
York Court of Appeals said. The school district serves the
religious enclave's disabled children; the other Satmar children
are educated in private religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   The action Monday, sought by Gov. George Pataki as well as by
the state's Board of Regents, the Kiryas Joel school board, and the
school board of the surrounding Monroe-Woodbury Central School
District, allows the school district to operate at least until the
fall, when the court will decide whether to hear the appeal, Pataki
vs. Grumet, No. 98-1932. If the justices do agree to hear the case,
then the stay will last until they decide it, perhaps a year from
now.
</P>
<P>
   BARGAIN, NOT BRIBE: Without comment, the court let stand a
ruling that offering witnesses leniency in exchange for their
testimony at a criminal trial does not violate the federal bribery
law.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a federal appeals court panel's decision that such
everyday deal-making was the equivalent of an illegal bribe sent
shockwaves through the criminal justice system. The 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in Denver, quickly vacated its panel's
opinion and took the case up before the entire court, ruling 9-3 in
January that the panel had been wrong. The appeal before the court
Monday was Singleton vs. U.S., No. 98-8758.
</P>
<P>
   CAR SEARCH: Ruling summarily, without hearing arguments in the
case, the court overturned a ruling by a Maryland appeals court
that state law enforcement officials should have obtained a warrant
before searching a car that they believed was transporting drugs
from New York. Fourteen hours elapsed between the time the
officials received a credible tip about the car and its mission and
the time when they spotted it in St. Mary's County, Md. The
warrantless search revealed cocaine in a duffel bag in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland Court of Special Appeals ruled that the search was
invalid because the police had not demonstrated that exigent
circumstances precluded getting a warrant. In an unsigned opinion
Monday, the Supreme Court said that the general exception from the
warrant requirement that the court's precedents have given
automobile searches does not require such a separate finding,
because of the ready mobility of cars. Because there was probable
cause to search the car, the search was valid even without a
warrant, the unsigned opinion said.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer and Stevens, while agreeing with the legal analysis of
the case, Maryland vs. Dyson, No. 98-1062, said the court should
not have decided the case without finding a lawyer to represent the
defendant, Kevin D. Dyson. His lawyer had declined to file a brief
in response to Maryland's appeal.

CITIZENS FINANCIAL-UST CORP. SET $1.4B ACQUISITION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Citizens Financial Group Inc. agreed Monday to acquire
UST Corp. for $1.4 billion in cash, the latest merger to reshape
New England banking's rapidly changing landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction comes only three months after the region's
largest banks, Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp.,
announced their powerhouse combination.
</P>
<P>
   In buying one of the last local banks available, Citizens, the
number three player in the area, is staking ground in an industry
where consolidation is creating new competitors and dismantling old
ones.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, the birthplace of banking more than two
centuries ago, the winnowing has broadly left one giant institution
and scores of savings and loans. Medium-sized companies such as
Citizens, which will be the area's second largest bank after Fleet
and BankBoston merge, are increasingly rare, and may become portals
for big national players seeking to expand into one of banking's
most lucrative markets.
</P>
<P>
   But by acquiring UST only one month after snapping up State
Street Corp.'s commercial lending business, Providence-based
Citizens has almost instantly transformed itself from an
old-fashioned savings bank into a full-fledged financial
institution that aims to compete with players big and small.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transaction firmly establishes Citizens as the second
largest bank in New England,'' said Lawrence K. Fish, Citizens'
chief executive, at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A self-styled ``super community'' institution with $22.1 billion
in assets, Citizens has grown this decade by acquiring hometown
institutions throughout New England and touting personalized
service.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based UST, with $5.9 billion in assets, has carved out
its own niche, providing loans to smaller businesses in eastern
Massachusetts and cut-price retail banking to ordinary depositers.
</P>
<P>
   With USTrust, as UST's bank is known, Citizens will have $28
billion in assets. (By contrast, the combined Fleet-BankBoston,
which will be the nation's eighth largest bank, will have over $160
billion). The next largest bank after Citizens is People's Heritage
Financial Group Inc. of Maine, with $14.5 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   In the increasingly competitive world of financial services,
Monday's deal has several important implications.
</P>
<P>
   It raises questions over how so-called community-style banks can
maintain the personalized service they pride themselves on while
growing bigger. It leaves observers wondering whether the new
Citizens will not seek to grow through further acquisitions. And it
leaves some industry analysts thinking a heftier Citizens will
become a takeover target for bigger banks outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   With UST, Citizens adds 300,000 new customers to its 1.2
million, and boosts its branches by nearly one-third, to 370. The
company operates as Citizens Bank in Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut, and New Hampshire,
</P>
<P>
   More important, Citizens pumps up its nascent loan portfolio by
$4.4 billion, to $16.9 billion. The increase could give the bank
more leverage if it decides to make a play for some of
Fleet-BankBoston's cast-off assets, which are now being sold and
for which regulators want a strong lender as owner.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Citizens and UST said the $16 billion
Fleet-BankBoston combination _ and the ready-made competitor it
will create as it spins off assets to meet antitrust rules _ served
as catalysts for their own merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fleet-BankBoston transaction caused us to rethink our
strategy,'' said UST Corp.'s president and chief executive, Neal F.
Finnegan, under whose six-year tenure UST's market capitalization
swelled more than tenfold. ``We looked at all the options, and it
became very clear that making a deal with another company made the
most sense.'' Fish approached Finnegan six weeks ago, two months
after Fleet and BankBoston announced their deal.
</P>
<P>
   There are other implications.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Rosenblatt, a mergers and acquisitions attorney at
Nutter, McClennan &AMP; Fish LLC in Boston, said the new Citizens
provided ``a critical mass for regional banking.'' Fleet and
BankBoston have national and international, rather than regional,
focuses in their commercial lending unit, leaving banking
regulators worried about who will serve New England's smaller
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A combined Citizens-UST, Rosenblatt said, would provide ``a new
vibrancy'' to the region's banking needs.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators overseeing the Fleet-BankBoston divestiture _ the
largest in banking history _ are keen to have a single large bidder
acquire most, if not all, of the assets, which include $12.5
billion in deposits and nearly $2 billion in loans.
</P>
<P>
   With its acquisition of UST, the new Citizens may have a
stronger hand in making a play for the assets, which have attracted
an avalanche of bidders from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to wait and see'' if Citizens joins in the
bidding, Fish said.
</P>
<P>
   Fish, 54, will run the new company, which will be the nation's
33rd largest bank, while Finnegan will serve as nonexecutive
chairman of Citizens Bank of Massachusetts. Under the deal, which
still needs regulatory approval and is expected to close in
January, Finnegan, 61, is widely viewed to be easing into
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Privately owned Citizens, whose owner, The Royal Bank of
Scotland PLC, is bankrolling most of the acquisition, is paying $32
per UST share, a 32 percent premium to the company's closing price
on Friday. Shares in UST soared 6 on the Nasdaq market to end at 30
1/4. The Royal fell 2 pence to close at 1424 pence on the London
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts welcomed the deal, in which Citizens is paying
a relatively low 2.6 times book value.
</P>
<P>
   But The Royal may have more in mind for Citizens, which accounts
for one-quarter of its parent's profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Royal will eventually have an eye on the fact that it can
sell out Citizens to a larger bank,'' said Stephen Kirk, an
industry analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown in London.
</P>
<P>
   Fish said the combined bank, which has about 7,800 employees,
has identified 800 positions to be cut but that actual layoffs
would be lower due to attrition and new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens, which also gains investment management and insurance
brokerage units in the deal, aims to eke out $80 million a year in
savings by 2001, or cut costs by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fish declined to be drawn on just how large he wants Citizens to
grow, saying only that he is reevaluating his previous estimates
that Citizens needs to have $25 billion to $30 billion in assets to
do well _ a range it is now firmly in.
</P>
<P>
   But Fish admitted that the bank could not resist change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I get a little bit bigger I worry about our ability
to serve,'' he said. ``I don't want to get too big. I just want to
make sure this company is big enough to compete.''

UNDER PRESSURE FROM FDA, MANUFACTURER WITHDRAWS ANTIHISTAMINE FROM
MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hismanal, an antihistamine that has fallen out of
favor with consumers in the wake of warnings about its safety and
the emergence of less dangerous alternatives, is being withdrawn
from the market, the Food and Drug Administration announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer of the drug, Janssen Pharmaceutica of
Titusville, N.J., described the withdrawal as a voluntary business
decision.
</P>
<P>
   But FDA officials, who last year warned that Hismanal could
cause fatal heart rhythm disturbances in high doses or in
combination with certain other drugs, said they asked for the
withdrawal for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly indicated that we were very concerned about the
product,'' said Dr. John Jenkins, director of one of the agency's
drug evaluation offices, ``and that we would find it most
beneficial to patients if they would withdraw the marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said the decision was not prompted by any new reports of
patient deaths or injuries. Rather, he said, the agency had
concluded in recent months that with safer alternatives available,
the risks of Hismanal now outweighed the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, which has been on the market for 11 years, will not
disappear from pharmacy shelves immediately, but will become
difficult to obtain over the coming weeks. Greg Panico, a spokesman
for Janssen Pharmaceutica, which is owned by Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
said the that company had discontinued production of the drug and
that the withdrawal was effective worldwide. Patients who suffer
from seasonal allergies should ask their doctors for alternatives,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Panico had no estimate of how many patients might be affected,
but at least one allergist said in an interview on Monday that
Hismanal would not be missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a patient on it in years,'' said the allergist,
Dr. Harold Nelson, a senior staff physician at the National Jewish
Medical and Research Center in Denver. ``It isn't a very good
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal marks the second time in two years that an
allergy medication has been taken off the market for safety
reasons. Seldane, which could cause fatal heart rhythm disturbances
in combination with other drugs, was ordered removed from pharmacy
shelves by the FDA at the end of 1997, when its manufacturer
received approval to market Allegra, a similar drug that lacked
Seldane's dangerous side effects. But Janssen had no substitute for
Hismanal, so the FDA permitted the company to keep it on the
market, a decision that has drawn complaints from the agency's
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have long classified Hismanal as a `do not use drug'
because of its life-threatening interactions,'' said Dr. Sidney M.
Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, an
advocacy organization in Washington that publishes ``Worst Pills,
Best Pills,'' a consumer guide to medication. ``The evidence was
very strong several years ago for taking it off the market.''
</P>
<P>
   But Panico, the Janssen spokesman, said Monday's decision had as
much to do with the competitive $7 billion antihistamine market as
with safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to voluntarily discontinue Hismanal recognizes
that the allergy marketplace is crowded with a number of other
drugs,'' he said. ``It was a business decision.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hismanal, known by the generic name astemizole, first received
approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 1988. Four years
later, the agency issued a warning about ``rare cases of serious
cardiovascular events, including death'' that occurred when
patients exceeded recommended doses. In February 1998, the agency
repeated that warning and added some new ones to Hismanal's label:
The drug, it said, could be dangerous in combination with some
antibiotics; the protease inhibitors that are used to treat AIDS
patients; certain antidepressants, including Prozac, and even
grapefruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   Following those warnings, industry analysts said, international
sales of Hismanal dropped sharply, to $90 million last year from
$180 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, worldwide sales for Claritin, an antihistamine that
has been marketed since 1993 by Schering-Plough Corp., totaled
nearly $2.3 billion last year, said Sergio Traversa, an analyst
with Mehta Partners in New York City, which tracks the drug
industry. Claritin has been the subject of heavy television and
magazine advertising, and it lacks Hismanal's dangerous
cardiovascular side effects.

   European health officials today are scheduled to inspect
Coca-Cola plants in Belgium and France to determine whether it is
safe to drink Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   The inspections, which might last for the next few days, were
requested Monday by the European Union, which ensures the quality

<P>
   The entry of the EU is a clear signal the Coca-Cola controversy

   Belgian officials also are expected to decide today whether to
continue restrictions on the sale of canned and bottled Coca-Cola,
Coke Light (the European version of Diet Coke), Fanta and Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, meanwhile, is beginning a mea culpa advertising

<P>
   The company is publishing a letter from Chairman M. Douglas
Ivester in 15 Belgian newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have spoken with you earlier, and I apologize for
that,'' Ivester says to Belgian consumers. ``For decades, we worked
very hard to establish ourselves as leaders in providing

Belgian people, I want to say that I'm personally very sorry for
any discomfort or inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people in Belgium and France reported nausea,
dizziness and vomiting after consuming Coke products from plants at

 &HT;    CISNEROS'S EX-LOVER TELLS OF SECRET PAYMENTS, TAPES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking the witness stand against her ex-lover,
Linda Jones testified Monday that former Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Henry Cisneros secretly funneled more than
$250,000 to her.
</P>
<P>
   In a pretrial hearing, federal prosecutors are seeking to use 33
tape recordings that Jones made of phone conversations to show that
Cisneros lied to the FBI about the extent of the payments when he
was under consideration for President Clinton's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is facing trial in September for conspiracy to defraud
in a case directed by independent counsel David Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's tapes could be crucial, since they provide vivid
exchanges in which Cisneros urges Jones to go along with hiding the
true size of the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Cisneros vigorously objected to use of the
recordings, which are duplicates of originals that Jones destroyed
in 1994. Moreover, Jones admitted in court to altering five of the
tapes to delete conversations that would be embarrassing or
incriminating to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has advised the court that the tapes were
tampered with. End of story,'' Barry S. Simon, a Cisneros attorney,
told the court. Moreover, Simon held that the tapes should not be
admitted because they were made with the intention of extorting
money from Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin responded, ``There's a
fairness problem. I'm sensitive to that.'' Even so, he allowed the
prosecutors present their case for admitting the recordings by
bringing in Jones, who has been serving a 3-1/2 year sentence at
the Federal Medical Center at Carswell, Texas, where she has been
treated for depression and dependence on the drug Ativan.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her plea bargain, Jones agreed to assist the
prosecution of Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a black suit with long skirt and looking much younger
than her 50 years, the striking blonde spent more than three hours
relating the saga of her affair with Cisneros, which began in 1987
when he was mayor of San Antonio and she was a fund-raiser for his
political committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating,'' Jones said of her ordeal when the affair
was made public in 1988 in a blaring headline in the San Antonio
Express-News. She said that her political clients abandoned her
consulting business and her husband filed for divorce, leaving her
without a guaranteed financial support.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Cisneros alternated between promises to marry her
and giving interviews with the news media promising to reunite with
his wife, Mary Alice, which eventually he did.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutor Mark Jackwoski sought to show that Jones had
made the secret tapes of Cisneros not for extortion purposes but
out of her fears and financial insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   She repeatedly testified that she had taped Cisneros only when
she felt their relationship was rocky. However, she said she also
made threats to Cisneros, telling him that if he made no agreement
to support her, ``I (would) go to the press, the president, whoever
would talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Jones made good on her threats by filing a lawsuit
against Cisneros in her home town of Lubbock, Texas, and by taking
her story to the TV program ``Inside Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Those actions set in motion the investigation that landed her in
prison and led to charges against Cisneros and two of his former
aides, Sylvia Arce-Garcia and John Rosales, who are accused of
assisting in the cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who resigned from the cabinet in 1997 and is now
president of a Univision, a Spanish-language TV network, was not
present for the hearing.

 NEW REPUBLICAN GROUP SEEKS TO REIN IN ATTORNEYS GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a time of new activism among state attorneys
general, Republicans are creating a party attorneys general
association to promote government restraint and raise money to
elect more Republicans as states' chief law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the Republican National Committee in conjunction
with several Republican attorneys general comes as many of the
states chief law enforcement officers have aggressively expanded
their roles by bringing lawsuits against tobacco companies or
joining the Justice Department in bringing antitrust charges
against Microsoft. In the 43 states that elect attorneys general,
Republicans hold only 12 of the positions. Thirty-one states have
Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Condon, the attorney general of South Carolina and the
chairman of the new group, said it would serve as both a think tank
and a campaign vehicle and he raised questions about the new
activism by many of the states chief legal officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot speak for all the attorneys general,'' Condon said.
But pointing to the national battle over smoking as an example, he
said, ``I think everyone has his role and in terms of limited
government the idea of what should and shouldn't be done through
the legislature rather than through the judicial branch raises some
serious questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Attorneys General Association held its first
fund-raiser Monday night at the Capitol Hill Club, a bastion of
Republican fund-raising events, and was seeking donations of at
least $1,000 per person for an RNC fund that is used for party
activities that indirectly assist an array of state-level
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans declined to say how much money they were seeking to
raise for the fledgling organization and it was not clear who else
was attending the event. But one official said that donors would be
able to choose whether they supported the Republicans' view of
limited government or the Democrats legal activism.
</P>
<P>
   The money was to go to one of the party's so-called soft-money
accounts which are free to accept unlimited donations from
individuals or corporations. Tobacco companies have long been heavy
Republican donors and Republicans recently have been trying to
court the high-tech industry as well.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the group was being modeled on the Republican
Governors Association, which was founded in 1963 and has become a
force for promoting the party's governors and their ideas. Party
officials said that they also considered it important to increase
the ranks of Republicans in attorney general positions because such
officials later become candidates for governor or senator.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the move has prompted sharp debate, particularly with the
fund-raiser coming just a week before the annual summer meeting in
Tennessee of the bipartisan National Attorneys General Association.
In a letter pointedly addressed to ``Dear Republican Attorney
General,'' Mark Pryor, the Democratic attorney general of Arkansas
predicted that formation of the partisan association would prove
``disastrous and extremely divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The office of Attorney General is unique,'' he wrote. ``We are
the attorneys for our respective states, not hacks for our
political parties. We have ethical obligations to best represent
our clients that do not apply to governors and legislators. The
primary nature of the office we hold is legal, not political.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the law enforcement officers had made significant
strides in consumer, anti-trust areas and in the tobacco settlement
by working together. ``To put it bluntly,'' he wrote, ``how can we
expect our colleagues to work with us in the courtroom if we are
determined to work against them at the polls?'' Pryor also sent
copies of his letter to ``all non-Republican attorneys general.''
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives have a different view of the recent activism
by these state officials and some Republicans said that the states'
chief legal officers from their own party have felt that their
views are getting short shrift from Democratic colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Federalist Society, a conservative jurists
group, and the Manhattan Institute and the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform, have scheduled a conference
on state attorneys general and on the lawsuits against gun
manufacturers being brought by many of the nation's cities. The
conference, featuring some of the same people serving as hosts of
Monday night's fund-raiser, was to explore whether such suits
represent ``a useful balance in our political system or an abuse of
power?''
</P>
<P>
   Condon dismissed Democrats' complaints about the new group,
pointing to some of the controversy surrounding President Clinton's
own fund raising for the Democratic Party in 1996. ``Weren't they
raising soft money from the Chinese?'' he asked. He noted that most
attorneys general run for office. ``Now that we're raising some
money it's, `oh my gosh, attorney general, isn't this outrageous,''
he said., ``I think when they run their races, I tend to notice
they are a little bit political aren't they.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged that ``phone lines and fax machines
have been burning up'' over the new group. And he said there was a
``developing consensus'' that the group not get involved in races
against Democratic incumbents but only in the case of open seats.
</P>
<P>
   Only three attorneys general are up for election in 1999,
including Michael Moore of Misssiippi, the Democrat who was a
driving force behind the tobacco suits and who is the head of the
National Attorneys General Association. Condon said his group might
not get involved in that race. A spokeswoman for Moore did not
return a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   But in the original announcement of the new Republican
association earlier this month, Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the
Republican National Committee, did not draw any distinction between
incumbents and open contests. He said in a news release that the
new association would have a ``tremendous opportunity'' to increase
the number of Republicans in the ranks of the states' chief law
enforcement officers because 12 of the 13 attorneys general seats
up for election in 1999 and 2000 are held by Democrats.

FORENSIC SPECIALISTS TO SIFT KOSOVO KILLING GROUNDS

<P>
   VELIKA KRUSA, Yugoslavia _ It is what investigators are calling
the world's largest active crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a dirt road here, inside a burned stone shed,
blue-and-white police tape marks the beginning of a massive
forensic undertaking to investigate the killing of at least 10,000
ethnic Albanians in a methodical campaign of ethnic cleansing by
Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first of an international team of forensic experts has begun
the grim task of gathering evidence at seven key massacre sites in
Kosovo to support the indictment of the war crimes tribunal in the
Hague against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and four of his
top aides.
</P>
<P>
   The small stone structure here is the first.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators at the scene said Monday there are remains of 40
people, including the bones of what appear to be two small
children, who were shot at close range and then incinerated.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre took place March 26, witnesses said, two days after
the NATO bombing of Serb forces began in Kosovo. The town, a key
crossing point for fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army coming
from the Albanian border, appeared to be a target of Serb
paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first site we are focusing on,'' said Scotland
Yard Detective Sgt. Ron Turnbull as he emerged from the site of the
burned bodies, shed a white suit and bathed in chemical
decontaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbull is the crime scene coordinator for what will eventually
be a team of 350 investigators with varying expertise in gathering
and analyzing forensic and ballistic evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A 60-member FBI forensic team, the same task force that
investigated the bombing of the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, last
summer, arrived Sunday and is expected to begin working Tuesday
with Turnbull's team from Scotland Yard.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbull, who in 1996 led an investigation that unearthed mass
graves in Bosnia's horrific ethnic cleansing, said the
investigation in Kosovo was an ``actual crime scene'' in which
detectives have access to the bodies as they were.
</P>
<P>
   In this phase, investigators are gathering ``surface evidence''
before removing the bodies from the massacre scenes and exhuming
those bodies they believe are buried in at least 90 mass graves
throughout Kosovo. This is different he said from Bosnia, where
investigators were left to unearth the remains of much larger mass
graves for attrocities that had been carried out years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique opportunity for us,'' he said. ``We did not
have fresh crime scenes like this in Bosnia. And we hope this will
mean we can build a stronger forensic case of the atrocities and
prosecute those who carried them out.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the initial findings at this site are that more than 40
people appeared to have been herded into the one-story stone shed
and killed with AK-47 automatic rifles at close range using
.762-caliber bullets. The victims were kneeling, he said, judging
by the ``low shots'' against the stone foundation. Their bodies
were then covered with tractor tires and hay and set on fire with
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of clothing he said are all civilian and the
charred footwear are sneakers and shoes. They are also gathering
personal effects amid the remains, such as watches and mens'
wedding rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sign that these were military casualties. These
appear to be civilians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Risley, spokesman for the International Criminal Tribunal
for the Former Yugoslavia, said: ``This is the first time in
history for war crimes investigators to act in real time. And now
there is a very short window of opportunity for us to gather the
forensic evidence that we will need to indict those responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Risley said the seven massacre sites listed in the indictment of
Milosevic were the focus of investigators now. Milosevic, the first
sitting head of state to be indicted for war crimes, has been
accused of war crimes for years. The indictment is largely
symbolic, making Milosevic more of an international pariah than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   It is still considered a remote possibility that he will
actually be taken into custody in handcuffs and face trial in the
Hague. Instead, analysts believe, he will be left as a wanted man
in every nation of the United Nations. His homeland will be his
bunker unless he is overthrown _ as Western powers openly say they
hope he will be.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the seven massacre sites that are listed in his
indictment, Risley said investigators would also be fanning out
over 100 other ``priority sites'' in which there is evidence of
more massacres and systematic rape of ethnic Albanian women by Serb
forces.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most haunting of the ``priority sites'' is a silver
and lead mine north of the Kosovo capital Pristina where KLA
commanders and witnesses say they believe as many as 700 bodies of
ethnic Albanian victims were burned in deep shafts. Risley said the
allegations were credible enough that forensic investigators would
examine the site, which is now ringed by approximately 50 NATO
troops.
</P>
<P>
   It is known as the Trepca Mine, and it was the setting of
powerful Albanian-led labor strikes in the late 1980s that were
seen as galvanizing Albanian resistance to Serb domination.
</P>
<P>
   Regional KLA commanders and witnesses who live nearby said Serb
forces and paramilitary units operated there during the
nearly-three-month war. They claimed that scores of ethnic Albanian
men were taken there and have not been seen since. They also said
covered trucks, which they allege were loaded with the bodies of
massacre victims, were seen entering the mine. They said
smokestacks at the site, which had not operated for years, were
seen billowing with white smoke throughout the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   But Risley said the investigators will need to do more than
simply gather evidence of killing to successfully build a case for
prosecution of the leaders of Serb forces, a web of military and
paramilitary units that carried out most of the war's atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to find individuals who talk and then aim for the
very highest officials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That will be a difficult, perhaps impossible task, given that
most of the Serb forces fled into Serbia after the military
agreement for Yugoslavian troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tribunal investigators must act in the same manner as a
modern domestic law enforcement agency might going after the mafia
or a drug cartel,'' he added. ``It will take time and diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Risley said, the investigators will be relying on
corroborating accounts of the atrocities from individuals who
witnessed them.
</P>
<P>
   One witness critical to building the case in the massacre in the
shed in Velika Krusa is Avdi Duraku, 41, who lives in an apartment
adjacent to the building where the 40 bodies were found. War crimes
investigators from the Hague, Duraku said, had spent hours taking
down his account in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   With the smell of death in the air Monday, he recounted what he
saw on the afternoon of March 26.
</P>
<P>
   He watched from a crack between the curtain and a window as a
Mercedes three-ton truck rumbled down the dirt road flanked by
several cars carrying men dressed in the distinctive blue military
uniforms of the ``MUPs,'' or Serb special police.
</P>
<P>
   Over the sound of the truck idling, he could only hear faint
voices of men barking orders in Serbian. After several minutes, he
heard what sounded to him like three separate machine guns spraying
bursts of gunfire for at least two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then he could see thick acrid smoke and hear the crackling of a
fire.
</P>
<P>
   What appeared to be a commander with a hand-held radio shouted,
``Let's go. Let's go. We're done.''
</P>
<P>
   Duraku said he hid in his home for a half hour after the men
left and then ran out and saw the bodies engulfed in flames. He
tried to pull two bodies close to the entrance out but could see
that both were dead. He tried futiley to douse the flames with a
blanket and buckets of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nightmare. I couldn't believe the killing. I couldn't
believe anyone could do this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Velika Krusa was a central focus of the fury of Serb
forces and in bombed out homes throughout the rolling hills there
are small clusters of human skeletons. In one home, the skeletal
remains of Ramadan Duraku and his 16-year-old son were sprawled on
the floor. A tray with two cups and a tea pot was still sitting on
a kitchen table in the partially burned-out home. A skull of one of
the bodies lay in a nearby field, dragged there, neighbors said, by
a wild dog.
</P>
<P>
   The man and his son were from the same extended family as Avdi
Duraku.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they killed so many here,'' he said Monday,
watching the investigators work next to his home. ``The KLA were
way in the hills. These were just people. These were not fighters,
they were fathers and sons.''

U.S. APPROVES AETNA'S PURCHASE OF PRUDENTIAL, BUT ORDERS
DIVESTITURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the objections of doctors' groups and consumer
advocates, the federal government on Monday approved the $1 billion
acquisition of Prudential Health Care by Aetna Inc., which will
create the nation's biggest managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   Following a six-month review, lawyers at the Justice
Department's antitrust division approved the deal on the condition
that Aetna sell its NYLCare Health Maintenance Organization in the
Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston markets. That divestiture _ the
centerpiece of a consent decree that settles a civil suit filed by
the federal government and Texas _ will result in the loss of about
425,000 subscribers. Even so, Aetna will provide benefits to more
than 21 million individuals, or about 1 in 11 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition had been criticized by physicians' groups and
consumer organizations, which were concerned about the power of the
newly merged entity. When the deal closes, Aetna will control
between 30 percent and 60 percent of the HMO markets in some major
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas markets where Aetna must divest, the acquisition
would have given the company control of 63 percent of the Houston
market and 42 percent of the market in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna first announced in December that it would buy Prudential
Health Care from the Prudential Insurance Co. of America for $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Critics had petitioned the government to impose far more
conditions on the deal, saying it would vastly increase Aetna's
ability to negotiate fees and working rules for doctors and
hospitals, squeezing the medical profession for greater cost
savings while possibly raising premiums and controlling practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately for the patients and doctors around the nation,
this means the industry leviathan has control of the whole pond,''
said Jamie Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care, a
consumer group based in Santa Monica, Calif. ``We will likely see
doctors with more complaints and patients with fewer services.''
Court called the decision ``a black eye for the Clinton
administration in terms of patient protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Dickey, president of the American Medical Association,
said the divestitures required by the Justice Department were ``an
important first step'' but ``not the end of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will still leave Aetna with a tremendous piece of the
market,'' Dr. Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Monday that the government decided not to
challenge Aetna's presence in a number of other markets because it
was already so large and the proposed merger would not appreciably
alter that. Moreover, they said, federal law only gives them the
authority to examine the effects of the proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement demonstrates the department's commitment to
preserve competition in all sectors of the health care industry,''
said Joel Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of the
Justice Department's antitrust division. ``The required
divestitures will have two important effects. First they will
preserve competition and protect consumers from higher prices for
HMO and HMO-based point-of-service plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, the divestitures will deny Aetna the ability to
unduly depress physician reimbursement rates and thereby impair the
quantity and quality of physician services provided to patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In their complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Dallas on
Monday, the federal government and Texas said that Aetna's
acquisition of Prudential would have eliminated the competition in
Houston and Dallas, ``allowing the merged entity to increase the
prices and to reduce the quality'' of services.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also challenged the deal in Texas on the grounds
that it would give Aetna too much control over many physicians,
leaving them highly vulnerable in the event they became embroiled
in a dispute with the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna executives said they had decided only reluctantly to part
with some of the HMOs in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we do not agree with the Justice Department's
concerns about the effect of the acquisition, a divestiture was the
most expeditious way to bring closure to the comprehensive DOJ
review process,'' Richard Huber, the chairman and chief executive
of Aetna, said.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives said that even after the sale, the company
would remain the leader in the Texas market, with about 2.5 million
health clients, including 1 million HMO subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said that they plan to close the deal this
summer, though the regulatory process will likely continue through
at least the fall. Officials in six states _ California, Florida,
Georgia, New Jersey, New York and Texas _ are still reviewing the
acquisition, and could order further modifications.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dickey, of the AMA, said that state chapters of the group
would continue to press state regulators to scrutinize the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Aetna executives said they have no further plans to sell any
other parts of the company. ``It's not what we believe will
happen,'' said Patricia Seif, a company spokeswoman.

SERBS SEEK TO CHALLENGE NATO FORCES BY PARTITIONING A TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ For the third consecutive day, several
dozen Serbs in civilian dress who call themselves ``warrior
citizens'' prevented ethnic Albanians from entering the
predominantly Serbian sector of this northern Kosovo industrial
town on Monday, jeering and threatening any Albanian who dared to
enter.
</P>
<P>
   In a direct challenge to NATO authority, the Serbs are declaring
their neighborhood, about a third of the city, and the
predominantly Serbian towns to the north a ``Serbian zone.'' The
area stretches the width of a valley 30 or so miles from here to
the border with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say that for now their strategy is to avoid
confronting the Serbs and to hope that the situation will calm over
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to reduce tensions through maintaining
a physical presence there,'' Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, the
commander of NATO forces in Kosovo, said at a news conference on
Monday. ``The principal goal is to lower tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   French troops continued to provide escorts for Kosovo Albanians
and Serbs wishing to enter either part of the city. But they also
continued to allow small crowds of Serbs in civilian dress to stand
at the ends of the two bridges dividing the neighborhoods and to
berate any Albanian who tried to enter.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk on Monday, tensions appeared higher than on Sunday, and
the de facto partitioning of the city only seemed to be hardening.
Serbs were fleeing into the Serbian section of town while few
Albanians dared to enter that area. The Serbs made it clear that
partition was their goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be like Beirut,'' said George Petrovic, a
member of the Serbian group blocking Albanians. ``This is going to
be the green line.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff in Mitrovica is the latest in a series of incidents
where French troops appear to be acting less aggressively or
responding more slowly than other NATO troops. In Srbica, the
largest city in the Drenica region in central Kosovo, French
soldiers allowed the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers to take
over the town last week and to carry their weapons during an
initial grace period. And on Sunday and again on Monday, French
forces were slow to respond to looting by Kosovo Albanian civilians
in the abandoned Serbian village of Grace, 20 miles south of here.
</P>
<P>
   In general, British and American troops have been more
aggressive than other NATO forces in stripping the Kosovo
Liberation Army of its weapons. And British soldiers responded
first to the looting in Grace both on Monday and on Sunday, even
though it was two miles outside their area of responsibility here.
</P>
<P>
   French officers contend that they are being aggressive, but are
handicapped by the fact that their entire force has not yet arrived
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   How NATO chooses to respond to initial challenges is likely to
set a tone for the entire mission and could prove crucial in
determining its authority and effectiveness here. The series of
incidents, particularly the standoff here in Mitrovica, reflects on
a thorny problem that confronted NATO troops in Bosnia and faces
them again here.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is how heavily armed NATO troops should respond to
civilian crimes. NATO commanders in Bosnia, fearing that it would
go beyond the scope of their mission if they responded, generally
have not reacted to such crimes as looting, declaring them the
responsibility of civilian police.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made clear on Monday that he wanted to establish an
atmosphere in Kosovo that would not tolerate looting. But as he
spoke, abandoned Serbian houses in the village of Grace were on the
verge of being set aflame.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 on Monday afternoon, a half a dozen Serbian homes were
burning in Grace. Dozens of Kosovo Albanians were streaming out of
the town in tractors loaded with windows and roof tiles that
appeared to have come from the homes, as well as fences, stoves,
bureaus, water heaters, clothes, television antennas and scores of
other items. Some of the Albanians ignored questions from a
reporter, but others grinned and waved as they went about their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We burn the houses so they won't have a way to come back,''
said one young Albanian man. ``We cannot live with them. They leave
or we leave.''
</P>
<P>
   A half hour later, a British tank and dozens of French Foreign
Legionnaires swept into the town, sending the looters quickly to
their tractors. In a reflection of NATO's continuing confusion
about how to handle such situations, French officers at first
allowed all of the Albanians simply to leave with their tractors
and the goods. One French jeep even helped tow an apparent looter's
jeep from a ditch after it became stuck.
</P>
<P>
   But British forces who arrived at the scene sealed off the three
entrances to the village, catching about 40 tractors inside. Then
the French commanders called in French military policeman to
investigate the looters. The Albanians, surrounded by the NATO
troops they see as their liberators, expressed more confusion and
surprise than anger at NATO's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with all that is going on,'' said Ibrahim
Hajrudinaj, one of the looters. ``I think it's primitive. But I
need something to live with. I'm taking some things that are mine
and some things that are not mine to bake some bread.''
</P>
<P>
   The show of force did not apparently impress all the Albanians.
As the group waited for French military police to arrive, at least
seven Albanian men slipped back into the village and began lighting
fires in more abandoned Serbs' homes. They were arrested by French
troops and were being held for questioning on Monday night. The
looters were allowed to keep perishable food but forced to return
all other items they stole, NATO officials said.

</P>
<P>
   Twenty miles to the north in Mitrovica, where the Serbs were
making their own challenge to NATO authority, they stood beside a
spot where a small mosque was destroyed during the NATO bombing.
The Serbs cursed, jeered and shouted ethnic slurs at Albanians who
tried to enter the neighborhood, calling them ``terrorist'' members
of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, the French said they had reached an
agreement with the Serbs to allow women and children to pass. But
when one Albanian woman tried to cross, the Serbs kicked and spat
on her as French soldiers struggled to control the crowd. She was
finally allowed to enter when a Serb she knew stepped forward and
escorted her.
</P>
<P>
   Another four Albanian women tried to cross later on Monday
afternoon, but the Serbs jeered and taunted them. French soldiers
told the Serbs to quiet down, but at that point the Albanian women
were so frightened they refused to enter the area.
</P>
<P>
   One shooting incident occurred in the Serbian area during the
afternoon where French troops reported a shot being fired over
their heads by a someone in a gray coupe. Three Kosovo Albanian men
in a gray coupe were detained at dusk, but they insisted they were
not involved. The body of an elderly woman who was shot dead in her
apartment in the Serbian section was also found on Sunday. But she
appeared to have been dead for several weeks, French soldiers said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day three French police officers, the first of
135 to be sent here, quickly walked through the area. They said
they hope to handle such disputes in the future, but they had
little immediate impact on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun began to set, Serbs said they were determined to keep
the de facto partition in place. ``This river and this bridge, they
are a natural border,'' said Nikola Kabasic, one of the men there,
who said he was a municipal judge. ``We want to keep it that way.''

IN TEST OF NEW U.S. LAW, DEATH SENTENCE IS UPHELD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, La.)  (lh) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court Monday narrowly upheld the first
death sentence to come before it under the greatly expanded federal
death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4, the justices divided sharply over whether the jury
received adequate information about the complex procedures under
the 1994 law before it sentenced a retired Army ranger to death for
the kidnapping and murder of a 19-year-old enlisted woman. The
crime took place in 1995 near Goodfellow Air Force Base in San
Angelo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was the fairness of the sentencing procedure rather
than the guilt of the defendant, Louis Jones Jr.
</P>
<P>
   With its decision Monday, the court began what is likely to be a
long process of interpreting and applying the new federal Death
Penalty Act, which made about 40 crimes subject to the death
penalty. Even the majority Monday conceded that the statute was
marred by seeming contradictions and ``loose drafting.''
</P>
<P>
   The split among the justices mirrored the court's ideological
division and also underscored a more basic difference in approach
toward death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   The central question in the case was whether the jury was unduly
confused about its options and obligations. The defendant
challenged a judge's refusal to instruct the jury on the
consequences of a possible deadlock, arguing that in the absence of
the instruction, the jurors would get the misperception that if
they did not sentence Jones to death, he might someday be freed
from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas, speaking for a majority that also
included Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy, said there was no
``reasonable likelihood'' that the jurors were confused about what
would happen if they could not unanimously agree on a death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they were confused, Thomas said, the defendant
``cannot show the confusion necessarily worked to his detriment.''
If there was an error in the case, it was ``harmless,'' Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the dissenters, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg that was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter and Stephen G. Breyer, said there was enough evidence of
confusion to make the sentence inherently unreliable. ``I would
reverse and remand so that the life-or-death decision may be made
by an accurately informed trier,'' Ginsburg said, referring to the
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg said the lower court's ``tolerance of error in this
case, and this court's refusal to face up to it, cannot be
reconciled'' with the court's tradition of special solicitude
toward capital cases, reflected in Justice Potter Stewart's
well-known statement in a 1976 death penalty case that ``death is
qualitatively different.''
</P>
<P>
   There has not been a federal execution since 1963. Although this
was the first case the justices heard under the 1994 law, 15 people
have been sentenced to death under the statute, including the
Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. Jones is not likely to be the
first to be executed; he now has a round of habeas corpus review
available to him, while several other defendants have already
exhausted that second-stage process.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Monday, Jones vs. United States, No. 97-9361,
upheld a 1998 ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in
New Orleans. But the majority did not completely accept the lower
court's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   On an issue of statutory interpretation, the government had
argued, and the 5th Circuit agreed, that if a jury deadlocked over
whether to impose a death sentence, the trial judge had to impanel
a second jury and hold a second sentencing hearing, in effect
giving the government a second chance to get a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   All nine justices Monday agreed that this was an incorrect
interpretation of the statute. The court read the law to require
that in case of a sentencing deadlock, the judge had to impose an
authorized sentence other than death. Because of the kidnapping
involved in this case, the only alternative to a death sentence was
life without the possibility of release.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The defendant's lawyer had asked the judge to instruct the jury
on the consequences of a deadlock, arguing that unless the jurors
knew that Jones would not be getting out of prison in any event,
wavering members might be persuaded to vote for a death sentence.
The government opposed the instruction, and the judge refused to
give it.
</P>
<P>
   The majority upheld that refusal. Thomas said the jury was not
``affirmatively misled'' on the matter, adding that ``the proposed
instruction has no bearing on the jury's role in the sentencing
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lawyers had also argued that other aspects of the
sentencing proceeding, including a form the jury was given to fill
out that included a reference to ``some other lesser sentence,''
gave jurors the erroneous impression that the defendant could
emerge with a sentence short of life in prison. It was in response
to this argument that Thomas said Monday that Jones could not show
that the resulting confusion, if there was any, had ``affected his
substantial rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority also rejected the defendant's challenge to the
government's use of two aggravating factors: one asking the jury to
consider the victim's particular vulnerability as a young and small
woman, and the other referring to the impact of her murder on her
family. The defense argued that these two factors overlapped, in
effect allowing the prosecution to get double mileage out of the
victim's personal characteristics as a factor for the jury to weigh
in the death penalty calculus. But any error in this regard was
harmless, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   One expert on the federal death penalty, Professor Rory K.
Little of Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, said in an
interview Monday that the court's message to the lower courts
handling death penalty cases was that ``small mistakes are not
going to matter.'' The decision made it more likely that death
sentences will be upheld on appeal, he said.

 &HT;    Political wrangling ongoing on safety
 &HT;    (EDS: UPDATES previous version with sites of inspections.)
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The European Union's ``suggestion'' that a new round
of inspections be conducted on two Coca-Cola plants is the latest
sign of bureaucratic wrangling as member states lurch toward
uniform food safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian and French health officials will team up with
representatives of the European Commission to conduct the
inspections of the plants in Dunkirk, France, and Antwerp, Belgium.
Coca-Cola said the plants are the sources of soft drink
contamination that have left some Europeans ill.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is the 15-member European Union's executive
department. Commission spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the
inspections will begin today and last for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a proposal, a suggestion,'' Ella Krucoff, spokeswoman
for the European Commission's delegation in Washington, said after
the inspections were announced at EC headquarters in Brussels. The
European Commission would still lack authority to order an embargo
of Coke products following the inspections, but could propose such
a step to the European Union Council of Ministers. The council, the
supreme decision-making body made up of top-level representatives
from the 15 member states, would have authority to order such an
embargo, which would be enforced by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The council took such a step in 1996 when cattle in Britain were
found to have Mad Cow disease, Krucoff noted.
</P>
<P>
   The latest development in Coke's soft drink scare is another
indication of the overlapping and sometimes confusing authority
over food safety enforcement in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Washington-based Institute for
International Economics, said the turn of events is understandable,
given the politically touchy nature of food safety and continuing
moves to impose uniform standards.
</P>
<P>
   Since its 1992 ``single market'' initiative, the EU has sought
to gain members' agreement a host of issues, health and safety
among them. Given that the 15 nations had formed a tariff-free
trading zone, the idea was to create a single market that would be
``the economic equivalent of the United States,'' Bergsten said.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been uneven.There is no European equivalent of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, though the recent series of
food safety scares could prompt establishment of such an agency.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission currently has authority to set broad
policies and has done so through directives that have dealt with
everything from limits on antibiotic residues in milk to the color
of paint on slaugherhouse walls.
</P>
<P>
   But it's up to member states to enforce the directives, and
countries have done so with varying degrees of rigor.
</P>
<P>
   The commission Monday launched legal proceedings against Belgium
for violating EU rules by waiting a month before warning the agency
about food contaminated with cancer-causing dioxin. That scandal
brought down Belgium's government last week.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Mad Cow controversy, the European Commission
in 1997 established a separate agency to deal with ``consumer
policy and consumer health protection.'' The agency, known as
Directorate 24, seeks to ``develop a consumer policy and contribute
to consumer health protection and food safety at the level of the
European Union.'' Authority over food safety was previously
invested in the agriculture directorate-general, one of 30
executive departments.
</P>
<P>
   It is Directorate 24 that that made the initial recommendation
Friday that led to the inspections of Coke's plants announced
Monday.

TOP EXECUTIVES ARE REMOVED AT MCKESSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story has now been added to the Times business front
page) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the drug industry's largest corporate shake-ups, the
board of McKesson HBOC Inc. ousted its top executives Monday,
including its chairman, Charles McCall, over accounting
irregularities at HBO &AMP; Co., a software maker it acquired in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The removals come after the McKesson board discovered that
discrepancies in HBO's sales, once thought to be routine accounting
errors, were a deliberate attempt to inflate the company's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``These improprieties were intentionally kept from the due
diligence process when McKesson acquired HBO,'' said Alan
Seelenfreund, McKesson's nonexecutive chairman. ``I can certainly
say that we overpaid substantially for HBO as we know it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted coolly to Monday's announcement. Shares of
McKesson dropped $2.375, or 6.6 percent, to $33.6875. When
McKesson, which is based in San Francisco, first announced its
accounting troubles in April, the stock plunged 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts had expected HBO's woes to prompt several
management changes, few expected the carnage to be this severe.
McCall was dismissed and Mark Pulido, McKesson's chief executive,
and Richard Hawkins, the chief financial officer, were forced to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson's board also dismissed four executives who worked at
its Information Technology Business unit _ what was formerly HBO _
for their involvement in the improprieties. Among those dismissed
were Albert Bergonzi, the unit's president and chief executive;
David Held, the chief financial officer and controller; Jay Lepine,
senior vice president and general counsel, and Michael Smeraski, a
senior vice president and head of enterprise sales.
</P>
<P>
   After two months of investigation, what happened at McKesson has
only now become clear. The company announced in late April that it
would have to restate earnings for its last four quarters after it
uncovered $42.2 million in improperly recorded sales at HBO during
a routine audit.
</P>
<P>
   The situation then grew worse. McKesson, the nation's largest
drug wholesaler, disclosed last month that it would further revise
its earnings. The company first explained the inflated sales as
contracts that contained contingencies, such as board approval, but
were recorded as completed sales before the contingency was met.
</P>
<P>
   Seelenfreund said Monday that several of these account
contingencies were placed in separate letters that hid them from
accountants during a routine audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears now that there were severe problems at HBO,'' said
Michael Krensavage, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman. ``This
wasn't, `Oops, we made a mistake.' It definitely looks like a
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Seelenfreund declined to say whether McKesson would push for a
criminal investigation. After watching its stock drop 50.6 percent
since April 1, the company's management wanted to reorganize
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The board announced Monday that John Hammergren, 40, previously
the company's executive vice president, and David Mahoney, formerly
the head of McKesson's pharmaceutical services business, would
become co-chief executives.

 UNDATED: a specialist.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``She was on so many medications and she was constantly sucking
on the breathing machine,'' Ms. Medina said. ``It was just a roller
coaster ride. She was never well.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford the specialist, Ms. Medina enrolled Gabriela in
a drug study conducted by a local asthma expert, Dr. Jay Grossman.
``Just hearing that it was an asthma specialist I said, `Hey, what
do I have to lose?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental asthma drug changed Gabriela's life. The trial
``is allowing her to have a normal childhood,'' Ms. Medina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only worry,'' she added, ``is that the study will be over
and she'll be back where she started from.''
</P>
<P>
   The completion of a study can be a poignant moment, several
doctors said, especially when the subjects, like Gabriela Garcia,
finally received medical help that had eluded them. The subjects
have just spent weeks or months sitting in waiting rooms with
private patients, filling out the same forms and looking through
the same magazines as everyone else. Their diagnostic tests have
been conducted in the usual exam rooms, and they have received
drugs just like private patients. Then the study ends and the
subjects have to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had more medical care from me than they have had
from anybody for years,'' Winder said. ``It is hard for them to
understand that they are not my patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, if no new clinical trials are available to them,
that reality can leave patients feeling frightened and abandoned.
Josette Good, a 60-year-old widow, used to count on Winder to keep
her enrolled in study after study for asthma. But last year, she
moved to Lake Milton, Ohio, near her children but 200 miles from
Winder's office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, adequate health insurance is beyond her budget, and Winder
could not help her find a study in her area. She has only one
inhaler left, from the last study she participated in, so she uses
it sparingly, at times borrowing another from a friend. Hoping to
make her inhaler last through the summer, she limits her
activities, avoiding yardwork and even short walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so tough,'' Mrs. Good said. ``I pray nothing
happens.''

THE OPEN AT PINEHURST: DRAMA OF TONY QUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Instead of facing Phil Mickelson in an 18-hole
playoff Monday, Payne Stewart enjoyed being U.S. Open champion for
the second time.
</P>
<P>
   With one precious putt, Stewart captured one of the most
dramatic national championships ever, draining a 15-footer on No.
18 to defeat Mickelson by one stroke. It was the kind of major that
people dream about _ big names on the leader board, a great golf
course that featured danger on every hole and a dramatic finish
with a Hollywood-type conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart reaped many rewards, winning his second U.S. Open and
his third major championship, and clinching a spot on this year's
U.S. Ryder Cup team. But golf was a winner, as well. Not only will
people remember the 1999 U.S. Open for generations, but the world
became more familiar with Pinehurst Resort and Country Club's No. 2
course, which had never been host to an Open.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if the U.S. Golf Association brings the Open
back to Pinehurst in the not-too-distant future. You didn't have to
win at Pinehurst to love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this golf course proved that it's a championship
course,'' said Tiger Woods, who finished tied for third place with
Vijay Singh, two strokes behind Stewart. ``It deserves another U.S.
Open because it's a golf course that tests every facet of your
game. Most U.S. Opens don't. It was great to see.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Stewart, it was a great victory. At age 42, Stewart has
won three majors _ the 1989 PGA championship, the 1991 U.S. Open
and Sunday's triumph _ and that puts him in elite company. Consider
that Stewart has won more majors than a host of other fine golfers
of his generation, like Greg Norman, who has won two; Mark O'Meara,
who has two; Curtis Strange, two; Fred Couples, one; Tom Lehman,
one; Hal Sutton, one, and Corey Pavin, one.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart began Sunday's final round with a one-stroke lead, but
many thought he might be overtaken by Mickelson, Woods, Singh or
David Duval. Instead, Stewart saved his best for the final three
holes, when he salvaged a par at No. 16 with a 25-foot putt,
birdied No. 17 to take the lead for good, then won at No. 18 with
his memorable putt.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart proved something not only to others, but to himself.
Last year's U.S. Open was a bitter experience for him, when he took
a four-stroke lead into Sunday's final round, but lost to Lee
Janzen by one stroke. Stewart vowed that he would give himself
another chance to win the Open, and he returned this year more
confident, more determined and better prepared to handle the
pressure. Stewart is at peace with his life and with his game. And
it showed on Sunday's back nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to give thanks to the Lord for giving me the ability
to believe in myself,'' Stewart said. ``I wasn't thinking about
Phil, or Tiger or David or anybody. I was thinking about getting
the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mickelson and Woods were left with other things to
think about. For Woods, most of those thoughts were good. Though he
did not win, the third-place tie was his best finish at a U.S.
Open. And if not for missing key putts at No. 11 (2 and a half
feet) and No. 17 (8 feet), Woods might have won. At age 23, Woods
has won the Masters and finished third at the U.S. and British
Opens. And Woods left Pinehurst even more confident despite the
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This golf tournament has been one I've always wanted to win,
because I've won three U.S. Juniors, and three U.S. Amateurs and it
would be nice to win three U.S. Opens,'' said Woods, who has
finished first, first and third in his last three starts. ``I know
I can win a Masters. I know I can win a British Open. This makes me
feel like I can definitely win a U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also the best finish at a major for Mickelson, whose
wife, Amy, is expecting the couple's first child at the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart's final putt fell in, Mickelson knew he had lost to
a deserving player. It took something special to make that putt in
that situation. And Stewart had what it took.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the last putt, I felt there was a very good chance,''
Mickelson said. ``Payne Stewart made two exceptional putts, on No.
16 and No. 18. Those putts showed a lot of character.''

 &HT;    Pain of custody battle likely lead to suicide, notes reveal
 &HT;    By Lou Grieco
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In letters she left behind, Gena Roach wrote
about the strain of a custody battle over care of her adult son.
</P>
<P>
   Her death Sunday was ruled a suicide. Her son, Rodney Roach, 32,
severely impaired from a previous auto accident, was fighting for
his life Monday with a bullet wound in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Roach was found Sunday in his mother's Jeep Cherokee at
the Englewood Reserve MetroPark. His mother, also shot in the
chest, sat next to him. A pipe ran exhaust from the tailpipe into
the cab.
</P>
<P>
   While police are not certain that Mrs. Roach shot her son and
herself, ``it's pointing in that direction,'' said MetroParks
Rangers' Detective Monnie Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are awaiting ballistics tests, Bush said. But
rangers found ``several notes addressed to several people,'' Bush
said, in which Gena discussed the pain of the custody battle with
Rodney's wife Janet.
</P>
<P>
   A ranger found the two Sunday afternoon, after he noticed the
Jeep parked just off the main roadway. Mrs. Roach, 58, was in the
driver's seat. Her son was in the passenger seat. A gun was found.
</P>
<P>
   A couple passing by told rangers they had noticed Mrs. Roach
slumped over. Rodney was holding a teddy bear, the couple told
rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney was in critical condition Monday at Miami Valley
Hospital. He had required constant care, following a January 1998
traffic accident which ``left him pretty much unable to take care
of himself,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney was driving a sport utility vehicle when he hit a bit of
frost or black ice on the road, said Sgt. Carl Plummer of the
Butler Twp. Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost it right in the curve,'' Plummer said. ``It was a
freak accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney drove into a tree, which hit the passenger side, Plummer
said. Because Rodney wasn't wearing a seat belt, his head smashed
into the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   His mother and brother, Russell, fought often with his wife over
his care, Bush said. Each side accused the other of not taking
adequate care of Rodney, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ongoing battle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janet was unavailable for comment. A man who parked a pickup
truck at Mrs. Roach's home in Dayton declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Janet and Gena had sought to be Rodney's legal guardian,
but Probate Judge George J. Gounaris appointed attorney Christopher
Cowan on June 7, Cowan said. He met with Rodney, Gena and Janet for
the first time Friday, Cowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan said he could not offer many details about the parties'
``bickering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just getting started,'' Cowan said. ``I get on it, meet
my client. Two days later, he's shot, his mom's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney was in a wheelchair and could not speak, Cowan said. He
could point to an alphabet chart or signal yes or no by moving his
left thumb, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Hollencamp, attorney for Gena and Russell Roach, said
Rodney had been removed from his wife's custody in April. During
Friday's conference, the attorneys discussed Cowan's proposal to
offer alternating weeks' visitation for Rodney's wife and mother,
Hollencamp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent the weekend dictating an objection to it, which was
never filed because it's now moot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Russell will be applying to become Rodney's legal
guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Donald Hawkins, who represents Janet Roach, declined
comment.

COMMENTARY: THE QUESTION OF EVIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There can be no doubt, now, about the scale of Serbian
atrocities in Kosovo. Western reporters and war-crimes
investigators have begun to confirm what Kosovar Albanian refugees
described.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officers estimate that at least 10,000 ethnic Albanians
were murdered; the figure could be much higher. Families were
burned alive in their homes, children killed in front of their
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The details are so terrible that, in our safe lives, we are
inclined to turn away _ to stop reading, to change the channel. But
we must know what happened. For what the Serbs did in Kosovo
confronts us again with the question of the human capacity for
evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still hard to credit,'' said Geoffrey Hoon, a minister
in the British Foreign Office, ``that our fellow human beings could
be guilty of machine-gunning children, systematic rape of young
women and girls, digging mass graves ... But this has happened in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   How could a Serbian soldier or policeman do those things? I
asked a onetime war correspondent if he could explain it. In war,
he said, a blood lust may come over one who has a gun, so that he
sees even women and children as enemies. That may indeed happen _
may lead to an occasional violation of the laws of war. But the
crimes the Serbs committed in Kosovo were not incidental; they were
planned and systematic.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine, in its current issue, has a detailed report on
what it called Serbia's ``killing machine'' in Kosovo. The story
shows how the Serbs set out to destroy particular areas, obviously
on orders from above, sweeping through towns three times to kill
and burn.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation suggested to me was that the worst was done
in Kosovo by a few thousand Serbian paramilitaries, some of them
the same thugs who raped and killed in Bosnia. But many of the
atrocities described by Kosovar Albanians were carried out by
policemen and even Serbian civilians. One policeman threw a grenade
into a basement where 30 people were waiting, killing among others
a six-month-old child.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum everyone in the Serbian security forces had to know
what was being done. A veteran soldier named Marinko, interviewed
by Time, said he had killed 500 Kosovo Liberation Army fighters. As
for killing civilians, he said, ``there are wacky members in every
unit. And you just don't have the time to control them.'' Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic is not the only author of the war crimes in
Kosovo. Thousands of Serbs were involved. And hundreds of thousands
more back in Serbia proper were fixed in the belief that the Serbs
had done no wrong. They were subjected to Milosevic propaganda,
yes. But even when told of the atrocities in Kosovo, they argued
that the Serbs were only replying _ they were the real victims.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of victimization is said by specialists to be a central
feature of the Serbian national character. It is the belief that
Serbs have been treated unjustly again and again in history.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's genius has been the ability to manipulate those
feelings, to arouse fear and hatred of The Other. Thus he used
films of Nazi attacks on Yugoslavia to suggest, during the Bosnian
war, that Bosnians menaced the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The capacity for evil exists in any people, in any human being.
But national histories are different. And most crucially, I think,
leaders are different. Think of the difference Nelson Mandela made
in a country where there could have been a powerful desire for
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The question of evil and leadership is not going to go away in
Yugoslavia. Milosevic is still there. The country is not likely,
soon, to go through the process of reformation that made Germany a
trusted nation again.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is not limited to Yugoslavia. How could
Rwandans slaughter half a million of their neighbors with machetes?
</P>
<P>
   If we have learned anything at the end of this terrible century,
it is that we cannot ignore such evil. That should be the lesson of
Kosovo. Some of those who opposed the NATO action there said Kosovo
was not our business. But John Donne's words are writ large now:
``Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in
Mankinde.''

   FOR MANY, DRUG TESTING IS BECOMING MEDICAL CARE
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the need for test subjects in experimental drug
trials has exploded as the industry has brought to market an
ever-increasing number of new products. In response, drug companies
have developed new methods of finding participants for the trials
by turning to private-practice doctors who recruit from their lists
of patients. But even that influx of participants has not been
enough to satisfy the demand. Filling the gap, according to
industry officials and researchers, are chronically ill patients
with limited or no health insurance who rely on clinical trials as
their primary source of medical care. For these people, experiments
have become treatments.

   WHITE HOUSE TRIES TO STOP STEEL BILL
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate poised to act Tuesday on a bill that would
sharply restrict the amount of imported steel in the United States,
the Clinton Administration took steps to convince Congress that it
could protect the jobs of steelworkers with far less drastic
measures.

   U.S. CLEARS PURCHASE OF PRUDENTIAL
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of doctors' groups and consumer advocates,
the Government approved the $1 billion acquisition of Prudential
Health Care by Aetna, which will create the nation's biggest
managed-care company, on the condition that Aetna sell its NYLCare
Health Maintenance Organization in the Dallas-Fort Worth and
Houston markets.

</P>
<P>
   M. Douglas Ivester, chairman of Coca-Cola, apologized to the
people of Belgium in extraordinarily contrite newspaper ads over a
contamination scare that began there more than a week ago and
spread to other countries in Europe. But he stopped short of
conceding that Coke products made anyone sick. Coke's efforts to
end its image crisis came as officials from the European Union said
they wanted to review all data on the causes of the scare.

   HONG KONG TO CREATE MUTUAL FUND
</P>
<P>
   The government of Hong Kong, 10 months after plunging into the

shares by creating a mutual fund that tracks the Hang Seng stock
index.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ SURGES, BUT DOW SLIDES
</P>
<P>
   Optimism that second-quarter earnings will be strong pushed
technology stock prices up. The Nasdaq composite index soared 66.84
points, to 2,630.28. But a rise in interest rates hurt cyclical
stocks, and the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average closed down
39.58 points, to 10,815.98. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
rose 6.16 points, to 1,349.00.

REGULATORS OK AETNA'S PRUDENTIAL PURCHASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
and MARY SIT-DuVALL 
 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal and Texas regulators have approved Aetna's
planned $1 billion purchase of Prudential HealthCare, provided
Aetna sells its NylCare health maintenance organization business in
Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   In a consent decree filed in U.S. District Court in Dallas
Monday, Aetna agreed to sell the NylCare operations in Houston and
Dallas-Fort Worth by the end of the year to a buyer to be named
later.
</P>
<P>
   About 260,000 HMO patients in Greater Houston and another
167,000 clients in the Dallas-Fort Worth area will be affected by
the government-ordered divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna's acquisition of the health-care
business of Prudential Insurance Co. of America is expected to
close early in the third quarter. It will create the nation's
largest health-benefits provider, with 21 million members,
including 18 million enrolled in its managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's announcement last December of its intent to purchase
Prudential HealthCare, coming just six months after Aetna's
acquisition of NylCare, raised concerns at the U.S. Justice
Department and the Texas attorney general's office that it would
stifle competition for managed care in the Houston and Dallas-Fort
Worth areas.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger, regulators said, would have given Aetna
control of 63 percent of the HMO and related HMO-based
point-of-service business in Houston, and 42 percent of the market
in Dallas-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna will be able to keep the rest of its NylCare business in
Texas. Following the divestitures, Aetna will remain the
managed-care leader in Texas with 2.5 million members, including 1
million HMO members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement protects the consumer by preserving
competition,'' Texas Attorney General John Cornyn said in a written
statement Monday. ``Patients will benefit both from the lower
health-plan prices that competition ensures and the preservation of
quality health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, the assistant U.S. attorney general in charge of the
antitrust division, said regulators feared that, without the
divestitures, Aetna would have been able to unduly depress the
reimbursement rates physicians receive, ``and thereby impair the
quantity and quality of physician services provided to patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aetna that results from this agreement will be smaller, with
strong competitors that will have to behave and perform better than
the combined company, said Dr. Paul Handel, immediate past
president of the Harris County Medical Society in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna Chief Executive Officer Richard L. Huber said that while
company officials did not agree with regulators' concerns, ``a
divestiture was the most expeditious way to bring closure to the
comprehensive ... review process.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling off the NylCare business, Huber said, will be easier
than trying to carve out the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth portions
of the Prudential business.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Bernica, executive vice president of the Harris County
Medical Society, hailed the divestiture order as good for
consumers, businesses and physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The county medical society, which represents about 8,000 doctors
in the Houston area, estimates that a combined Aetna-Prudential
will still control about a third of the commercial HMO market in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Inlander, president of the People's Medical Society, a
nonprofit patient advocacy group based in Allentown, Pa., argued
that regulators have to be cautious about approving mergers too
quickly in this industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to watch them, and we have to be careful,'' Inlander
said. ``We have to be careful they're not expanding too fast, and
are able to absorb the needs of the patient and the needs of the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted L. Goldberg, a consultant for the Deloitte &AMP; Touche
Consulting Group, said the Aetna-Prudential merger poses ``a big
challenge'' for the companies involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very, very complex organizations,'' Goldberg said.
``And to quickly bring them together in one entity _ given the
differences in systems, processes and people _ will be a tremendous
challenge.''

U.N. COMMITTEE, UNDER PRESSURE, LIMITS RIGHTS GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Led by a small group of developing nations, a
U.N. committee has inflicted major setbacks in recent days on human
rights groups that seek to expose and combat political oppression.
</P>
<P>
   The reverses occur as support for enforcement of norms of human
rights appears to be growing, after a decision last year to set up
an International Criminal Court and with the creation of tribunals
to judge those responsible for genocide in the former Yugoslavia
and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Now a group of organizations led by Human Rights Watch of New
York plans a campaign modeled on efforts to extradite Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, from Britain to face
possible criminal charges in Spain. The plan of the organizations
is aimed at bringing more exiled dictators and other leaders
accused of human rights abuses to justice in their own countries or
in those that extend asylum.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Human Rights Watch presented the U.N. Human Rights
Commission with a list of exiled former leaders who it contends
should be tried on charges of murder, torture and other abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes Idi Amin of Uganda, now in Saudi Arabia; the
former Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Miriam, who has taken
refuge in Zimbabwe; Jean-Claude Duvalier of Haiti, who fled to
France; the former dictator of Chad, Hissein Habre, currently in
Senegal; Emmanuel Constant, former chief of a right-wing
paramilitary group in Haiti, who lives in New York City; Alfredo
Stroessner of Paraguay, now in Brazil; and Raul Cedras, former army
chief of Haiti, currently living in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Under its new international justice project, Human Rights Watch
plans to help victims of the former dictators whom it has named, as
well as helping rights organizations in the countries they ruled or
those giving them shelter, to persuade the authorities to bring
them to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the British House of Lords ruled in favor of Pinochet's
extradition, we started getting calls for victims of other
dictatorships all over the world asking us how they could do what
Spain has done,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human
Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Their action follows a series of setbacks for human rights
groups from the U.N. Committee for Nongovernmental Organizations in
a two-week session of the committee that ended on Friday. The
committee accredits private groups, allowing them to appear before
certain U.N. bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The de-accreditation of Christian Solidarity International was
one setback. On Thursday, the 19-nation committee voted to ban that
group, which is based in Zurich, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which says it has rescued 9,000 Sudanese from slavery
since 1995, infuriated the Sudanese government by inviting the
leader of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement, John
Garang, to address the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva,
Switzerland, this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is moving away from what we have just seen going on
at the United Nations,'' Brody said, referring to the setbacks.
``Where human rights abuses are concerned, parts of the United
Nations appear to be living in the past. There will be a backlash
against the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   In another action, the panel, after lobbying by China, agreed
overwhelmingly to refuse accreditation to Human Rights in China, a
group in New York that monitors abuses in China. Only the United
States, France and Ireland voted in favor.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee did accredit the Cuban Association for the
United Nations, which President Fidel Castro's government backs. It
followed up that decision by delaying action on an accreditation
request by a Mexican group, Centro de Derechos Humanos Miguel
Agustin Pro Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Rights NGO's are anathema to many members of this
committee,'' the U.N. representative of Human Rights Watch, Joanna
Weschler, said. ``They always have the hardest time gaining
accreditation.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also agreed to open an inquiry into the role and
status of all nongovernmental organizations at the United Nations
and particularly into whether too many were being accredited. That
was decided after the chairman of the Human Rights Commission, Anne
Andersen, who is the Irish representative to the United Nations in
Geneva, infuriated groups here by writing to the committee members
saying some U.N. delegates believed that too many of the
nongovernmental organizations attend its meetings.

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS CONTINUE UP; BLUE CHIPS CLOSE LOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Optimism that second-quarter earnings will be strong
pushed technology stock prices up for the fifth straight session
Monday. But a rise in interest rates hurt cyclical stocks, and the
blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average closed lower.
</P>
<P>
   Paced by gains in well known names like Microsoft, Cisco
Systems, Amazon.com and Yahoo, the NASDAQ composite index soared
66.84 points, or 2.6 percent. That, after the 4.7 percent gain the
index recorded last week, put the NASDAQ up just under 20 percent
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is that this earnings season will reflect a
very strong economy in the first half, and the bargain hunters are
going to technology stocks because they have the best prospects,''
said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   But upbeat talk about earnings did not lead to a surge in
business on the floor of the exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange remained fairly
light, with only 680 million shares changing hands. On the NASDAQ,
895 million shares were traded.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about second-quarter earnings also helped lift
brokerage stocks. A number of companies, including Goldman, Sachs;
Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, are expected to
report their second-quarter results this week.
</P>
<P>
   Among brokerage stocks, Charles Schwab soared 8 1/4, to 98 1/4.
Goldman Sachs was up 4 11/16, to 69 1/2. Lehman Brothers gained 4
1/4, to 60 5/16. And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose 4, to 99 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   However, the rise in interest rates, which pushed long-term bond
yields back above 6 percent, depressed cyclical stocks. Led by
Alcoa, Chevron, General Electric and Exxon, which each fell by more
than two points, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 39.58
points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,815.98.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.16, or five-tenths
of a percent, to 1,349, bolstered by gains in technology stocks,
including America Online and Lucent Technologies, and finance
company shares, including Chase Manhattan. America Online gained 3
3/8, to 115 3/8, and Lucent rose 2 7/16, to 65 3/8. Chase added 3
3/8, to 83 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Small company stocks also had a good day.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small company shares rose 4.39 points,
or 1 percent, to 449.44. And theStreet.com's Internet stock index
soared 30.17 points, or 5.4 percent, to 594.51.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates have been the dominant concern of stock traders
for the past few weeks. But anxiety about rising rates eased last
week after the release of reassuring news about inflation and a
comparatively straightforward talk by Federal Reserve Board
chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the overwhelming sense is that the Fed will tighten
at the end of the month, and at worst once more sometime after
that,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor
Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to have a better tone to the bond market.
If that happens, then we could have an explosive move to the upside
in stocks, and move to new highs.''
</P>
<P>
   Among big technology stocks, Microsoft gained 3 15/16, to 88
15/16. Cisco Systems gained 3 3/4, to 123 3/16. Sun Microsystems
rose 4 1/2, to 68 9/16 .
</P>
<P>
   Of the Dow stocks, technology stocks were the biggest winners.
</P>
<P>
   IBM gained 3 7/8, to 124 3/4. And Hewlett Packard rose 2 1/16,
to 94.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in crude oil and gasoline futures prices hit oil and oil
service stocks. Chevron, a Dow component, fell 2 5/8, to 90 9/16,
Exxon fell 2 1/8, to 78 1/4. Halliburton slid 2 1/16, to 43 13/16.
And Schlumberger fell 1 1/2, to 63.
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet stocks, Yahoo! shot up 14 7/16, to 158 7/8 on a
report it would raise investment in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Weyerhaeuser, the big forestry company, slid 2 9/16
to 67 3/16 after saying it had agreed to buy MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.
of Canada for $2.45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing fell 1 5/8 to 43 after the top sales executive of rival
Airbus Industrie said the company risked reviving a price war.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, plagued by continued worries and official sales bans
in several European countries after reports of illness last week,
saw its stock slip again Monday. At the close, Coke shares were
down 1 7/8, to 61 9/16.

LAURELS ELUDE PRESIDENT AS PUBLIC JUDGES A WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (White House Memo column) 
(sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Presidents ordinarily can expect a surge in public
support when they commit American forces to a foreign conflict and
an even greater reward in public approval when the war ends with
minimal loss of American life.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict in Kosovo is no ordinary one, and Bill Clinton
is no ordinary president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went on prime-time television 10 days ago to declare
that the United States and NATO had won the war in Yugoslavia after
78 days of aerial bombardment. Clinton said that President Slobodan
Milosevic's agreement to withdraw most of his troops from Kosovo
represented ``victory for a safer world, for our democratic values
and for a stronger America.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to polls taken in the last week, fewer than half
of Americans agreed with him. And just as public opinion surveys
during the conflict showed no rallying around the president, the
polls last week showed no ``victory bounce'' in Clinton's public
approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results reflect public ambivalence about the way the
war in the Balkans was conducted and about its ambiguous end, with
streams of traumatized refugees returning to the charred and
moldering remnants of their former lives. The survey results also
demonstrate a skepticism about the claims of a president who
acknowledged misleading the country about an affair with a former
White House intern and who escaped Senate conviction on impeachment
charges just four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's supporters and his critics agree that something has
changed in the way Americans view the nation's role in the world
and the respect they accord the commander in chief. But they differ
profoundly on whether this is the fruit of Clinton's behavior in
office or the natural result of the end of the bipolar world of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, for now, are the days when an American leader would see a
large spike in his poll numbers during and after any military
operation, even one with mixed results. Gone, at least for this
president, is the rally-round-the-flag instinct of the American
public.
</P>
<P>
   In two recent polls, about two-fifths of Americans expressed
belief that the allies had achieved the goals of 11 weeks of
relentless bombardment of Yugoslavia. A Gallup Poll revealed that
40 percent of Americans said that Milosevic's agreement to withdraw
his troops from Kosovo represented a victory for the United States.
A survey from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
found that only 46 percent of the public believed that Washington
and its NATO allies had met their goals.
</P>
<P>
   Why does the public grant Clinton so little credit for
completing an operation that has cost not a single American combat
fatality and achieved at least some of its stated goals?
</P>
<P>
   Depends on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all we've been through with him, it's impossible to have
Bill Clinton as a sustainable hero,'' said Douglas Brinkley,
professor of history at the University of New Orleans. ``Ever since
1992, when he was perceived as a waffler at best and a liar at
worst, he has never represented the best of the presidential
tradition. He's seen as an astute politician, a likable person. But
there have always been deep-seated suspicions about his motives.''
</P>
<P>
   A skeptical public ascribes Clinton's successes to luck, not
skill, Brinkley said. They admire the president's uncanny ability
to crawl out of a deep hole relatively unscathed, but they never
forget that Clinton usually dug the hole himself. They believe
some, but hardly all, of what he tells them.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley, it should be noted, is a sometime admirer of the
president and an occasional adviser to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, who runs the Pew center, said the public was
ambivalent about Clinton's ``victory'' in Kosovo because the
results so far had been messy and ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb withdrawal represents something less than clear-cut
triumph, Kohut said, and it is clear from news reports that a
fearsome slaughter took place in Kosovo that NATO was powerless to
prevent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People generally think we tried to do the right thing,'' he
said, ``but many people are wary about what we may or may not have
achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   The American public's ambivalence about the Kosovo conflict
reflected other factors as well. The remote-control nature of the
air campaign made the war feel distant and bloodless, with few
images of American servicemen in combat and few accounts of heroism
under fire. In addition, officials in Washington took pains to
portray the war as NATO's war, not Clinton's, an effort to spread
criticism when things went wrong that also diffused the credit when
the conflict ended.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut noted the oddity that Clinton's public approval ratings
rose after he admitted an adulterous relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, but fell markedly when he unleashed the first missile
attack on Yugoslavia in March. Clinton's job-approval rating has
hovered in the mid-50s for the last three months in Kohut's poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely not the Cold War era when a president goes
to lunch with some foreign dignitary and his approval rating goes
up three points,'' Kohut said.
</P>
<P>
   Such bounces in public approval used to be routine for
presidents who sent American forces into harm's way, even when the
threat was exaggerated, as in Grenada, or the results were mixed,
as in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's supporters, not surprisingly, have a different
explanation for why the president gets no respect as commander in
chief.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's press secretary, said that Clinton
was mercilessly criticized for his decision to pursue the war
solely in the air, but few of his critics have stepped forward to
admit error. The critics now say that Clinton achieved at best a
modest political victory that is certain to crumble over time,
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to the point where it's comical,'' he said,
displaying no sense of humor about the subject. ``People revise
their own history and disown their own opinions, twisting and
bending the facts to fit their own conclusions. The only good part
of this is that it has absolutely no effect on anybody. Nobody is
listening.''

USC TO HIRE HALEY AS VOLLEYBALL COACH
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mick Haley, coach of the U.S. women's national
volleyball team, has agreed to become coach of the USC women's
volleyball team.
</P>
<P>
   Several details are being worked out before Haley signs a
contract, but a formal announcement is expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   Haley previously coached at Texas, where he won national
championships in 1981 and 1988. Haley compiled a 522-137-1 record
in 17 seasons at Texas and won 13 Southwest Conference titles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he became coach of the U.S. women's national team. He
will coach the U.S. team through the 2000 Olympics, meaning USC
would have an interim coach, expected to be current assistant
Jerritt Elliott, for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Haley could conceivably join USC earlier if the U.S. team does
not qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Haley replaces Lisa Love, who resigned in April to concentrate
on being an associate athletic director at the university. His
selection concludes a longer-than-anticipated search for Love's
successor. UC Irvine men's coach Charlie Brand turned the job down,
and USC also interviewed Stanford assistant Denise Corlett and
Florida coach Mary Wise.

   The British and Irish governments urged Protestant and Roman

disarmament before the June 30 deadline set by Prime Minister Tony
Blair of Britain. The British Northern Ireland secretary, Mo

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOME, Togo _ A year after winning re-election in voting that was
widely considered tainted, President Gnassingbe Eyadema has
continued to tighten his three-decade hold on his nation's
politics, preserving his status as sub-Saharan Africa's
longest-ruling head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has announced, by presidential decree, the formation of a
new government made up of his longtime loyalists. The announcement
came three months after his party swept parliamentary elections
boycotted by all opposition parties and a month after Amnesty
International released a report describing widespread human rights
abuses in Togo.
</P>
<P>
   Togo is a sliver of a country just east of Ghana with about 5
million people. But despite its size, Eyadema's career has been
watched closely in West Africa for its particular role in the
region's history.
</P>
<P>
   As a 26-year-old sergeant, Eyadema staged post-colonial Africa's
first military coup, in 1963, eventually seizing the presidency for
himself in 1967. When Mobutu Sese Seko was toppled from power two
years ago in the former Zaire, Eyadema became the continent's
longest-serving ruler.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when West African nations began holding
multiparty elections and Eyadema's grip on power seemed shaky, Togo
experienced a political liberalization with a dilution of
presidential power. But Eyadema succeeded in clinging to power by
pitting opponents against one another and heading one of the
largest armies, per capita, in Africa, foreign officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, after presidential elections were held and returns
showed Eyadema trailing, one of his generals took over the ballot
counting. Since then, the West has withheld foreign aid that Togo
desperately needs, and relations between the government and
opposition parties have worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government line is brotherhood, reconciliation, peace,
love, make nice to everybody,'' said a foreign official here who
observed the March elections. ``But the March elections just
complicated matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the opposition declared that it would boycott the
elections, Eyadema's party, Assembly of the Togolese People, went
ahead with the voting. The party claimed a 66 percent turnout and
victory in 77 out of 79 seats, with the other two going to
independent allies of the president. Foreign observers described
the turnout as less than half that figure and the voting as
tainted.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that a new government has been formed even as
Eyadema is supposed to hold talks next month with opposition
parties. The opposition parties held seats in the former
parliament, though Eyadema's party held the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the government be considered legitimate when all the
members are from one party?'' said Emmanuel Akitani Bob, vice
president of the Union of the Forces for Change, the main
opposition party. Standing inside the party's headquarters, which
was ransacked and set on fire by soldiers last August, he added,
``We are pessimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob's organization is led by Gilchrist Olympio, considered by
most to have been the real winner of last June's presidential
elections and now living in exile in London. Olympio is the son of
Sylvanius Olympio, a wealthy businessman who was Togo's president
when he was assassinated in 1963 in the coup led by Eyadema.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Eyadema did not respond to requests for an interview.
In the past, however, the government has denied that the two
elections were rigged.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the government has also attacked Amnesty
International's charges of abuse and political repression. Late
last month, the government barred Amnesty International's secretary
general, Pierre Sane, from entering the country. After the group
accused the Togolese government of detaining and torturing one of
its Nigerian investigators for nine days, the government said the
Nigerian had been held as a suspected drug trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   Although events in the last year amounted to a setback for the
political liberalization in the early 1990s, even political
opponents acknowledge that the Togolese enjoy more freedom than in
the past. The government daily newspaper, Togo Presse, still
consists of photographs of the president and detailed descriptions
of his daily activities, but the cult of personality has died down
compared with the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there was the naming of two of the capital's most
famous hotels. In January 1974, the president incurred minor
injuries as his plane landed in the northern town of Sarakawa; on
his triumphal drive back to the southern coast, he announced on
February 2 that Togo's main commodity, phosphate, would be
nationalized. The hotels were named Hotel Sarakawa and Hotel 2
Fevrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that a decade ago, I would have never talked openly
about politics with a journalist,'' said Artheme Ahoomey-Zunu, the
secretary of the Togolese Union for Democracy, an opposition party.
``But to have Africa's longest ruling head of state, it's
shameful.''

ABBOTT LABS TO ACQUIRE ALZA FOR $7.3 BILLION IN STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abbott Laboratories, one of the world's top sellers of
antibiotics, announced Monday that it would acquire Alza Corp. for
$7.3 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will not only become a formidable maker of
cancer and incontinence medicines _ some of the pharmaceutical
industry's most competitive categories _ but it will be the
nation's leading maker of sustained-released drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised the acquisition, noting that it marked a strong
debut for Abbott's chairman and chief executive, Miles White. When
White became Abbott's chief executive in January and chairman in
April, he told Wall Street analysts he wanted to expand the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``White has done exactly what he said he'd do,'' said Sergio
Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners, a biopharmacology
research company in New York. ``The two companies are a perfect
fit. Alza has excellent drug delivery programs and good
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Abbott will trade 1.2 of its shares
for every Alza share, or $53.025 each, based on Abbott's closing
price of $44.1875 on Monday. Alza's shareholders will receive a
14.6 percent premium, on top of two weeks of healthy gains. Lifted
by rumors of a pending acquisition, Alza's shares have increased
29.6 percent since June 1. The deal was announced after financial
markets had closed Monday. Shares of Abbott closed down 50 cents,
to $44.1875, while Alza rose 25 cents, to $46.25.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Monday that the Alza acquisition would give Abbott
some badly needed momentum. While the company is one of the drug's
industry's most consistent earnings performers, its marks are far
from stellar. Abbott's earnings increased 12 percent last year,
compared with 16 percent for the industry. Warner-Lambert, by
contrast, raised its earnings by more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Abbott, which is based in Abbott Park, Ill., has
become successful at diversification _ the company also sells
hospital, nutritional and agricultural products _ these businesses
are usually not as profitable as pharmaceuticals. Analysts said
Monday that the Alza acquisition should increase Abbott's profits
quickly because Alza made most of the delivery systems for its own
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Alza, based in Palo Alto, Calif., has long been rumored as a
takeover target, but its deals with other pharmaceutical companies
made any acquisition tricky. Among the products that Alza has
developed and licensed to other companies are the Nicoderm CQ
Patch, sold by SmithKline Beecham, and Pfizer's heart drug
Procardia XL.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott has no trouble with licensing or acquisition agreements,
having recently made more than 40. The company recently bought
Medisense, a glucose monitoring company, for $876 million, and Novo
Nordisk's plant-protection business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies shied away from buying Alza because of its
agreements,'' said Neil Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst with
Southeast Research Partners. ``But the company started to develop
its own drugs, and that has made it more attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   While analysts noted that Abbott's research pipeline was thin
compared with those of some of its competitors _ the company should
release a new compound for congestive heart failure later this year
_ its existing portfolio of drugs is relatively strong.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Biaxin, its antibiotic, are expected to top $1.3
billion this year, a modest 5 percent increase. Yet sales of
Depakote, for manic depression, are projected to grow 20 percent
this year, to $780 million.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott executives are cautious of their need to bolster their
profits. The company said Monday that the Alza purchase would
dilute earnings by about 3 cents a share next year but should add
to the company's bottom line in 2001.

 &HT;    Multifront effort seeks to restore confidence
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr. in Brussels
 &HT;    and Henry Unger in Atlanta
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coca-Cola is running on at least three tracks at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the European health scare, the company is trying to
persuade politicians and scientists that all of its soft drinks are
safe and should be allowed back on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company also is going after the hearts and
minds of European consumers with advertising campaigns in several
nations, including Belgium, France, Italy, Greece and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Internally, Coca-Cola is trying to make sure its own troops
maintain high morale in the face of the public relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, company Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer M. Douglas Ivester met Monday with Belgian Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene to discuss ending the government's partial ban on
Coca-Cola products.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Randal Donaldson said it was a brief meeting
in which Ivester expressed his apology for the problems Coca-Cola
has caused the Belgian government. The government already had been
dealing with a health scare over meat and dairy products
contaminated with cancer-causing dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dehaene resigned this month after his party was
swept from power in national elections, he is considered one of
Belgium's most influential figures. He has been mentioned as a
likely successor to NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
   Dehaene also is a good friend of Luc Van den Bossche, the
country's tough-minded health minister, who has been critical of
Coca-Cola's reaction to the crisis and skeptical of the soft drink
giant's explanation for what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Bossche met with his staff on the Coca-Cola issue
Monday, but he didn't decide to remove the sales restrictions on
the company's major brands, including Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light
and Sprite. The government is expected to make a statement today.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola officials provided the Belgian government with copies
of studies commissioned by the company to determine whether the
contaminants it described posed a health risk. The scientists
determined that the substances were present in amounts too small to
pose any risk.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested that the symptoms reported by consumers were
perhaps psychosomatic reactions to the foul smell caused by the
substances.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, the European Union's executive body, the
European Commission, instructed Belgian and French authorities to
inspect the two bottling plants at the center of the crisis, said
Paola Testori, an EU spokesman. The organization was prompted to
move because it did not have satisfactory information on what
caused the illnesses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the EU is supposed to do in a situation such as
this when there is a food crisis,'' Testori said. The inspections
are expected to be completed in a few days, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The EU action could slow the process of getting Coca-Cola back
on the shelves because it may make officials in Belgium and France
reluctant to act before all the inspections take place.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Coca-Cola said it would welcome the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to facilitate them as soon as possible,'' said
Paul Pendergrass, the company's European spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has said bottles were infused with defective and
foul-smelling carbon dioxide gas at the Antwerp, Belgium, plant,
while cans from Dunkirk, France, were contaminated with a fungicide
administered to wooden pallets used in shipping products from that
plant to Belgium. The plants are operated by Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 people in both nations reported illnesses, mainly
nausea, vomiting and stomachaches, after drinking Coca-Cola
products. As a result, Belgium has instituted the partial ban on
Coca-Cola products. French officials have banned canned Coke
products made at the Dunkirk plant, while officials in Holland,
Germany and Spain have banned Coca-Cola products from plants in
Antwerp and Dunkirk.
</P>
<P>
   The public relations battle
</P>
<P>
   Eager to shore up its credibility with consumers, Coca-Cola ran
full-page ads Monday in major newspapers in France, Spain and
Italy. The ads said analyses by Coca-Cola and by independent teams
show that ``the drink is not in question ... Its quality is
irreproachable.'' The ads also display a toll-free consumer
hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Full page ads are running today in 15 Belgian newspapers
featuring a personal apology letter from Ivester to the country's
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the company's marketing chief, Charles Frenette,
has been holding strategy sessions to plan the company's
advertising, marketing and public relations campaigns in the wake
of this unprecedented crisis. Industry analysts predict a very
aggressive, multimedia approach.
</P>
<P>
   Employee morale
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ivester and CCE President Henry Schimberg are
trying to shore up employee morale. Both met Monday with all of the
Coke system's employees in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Both sent memos to employees to reassure them that everything
possible is being done to handle the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we had any quality issue ... is intolerable,''
Ivester said in an e-mail to employees around the globe. ``What I
can tell you, with absolute certainty, is that we will learn from
this mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company will do everything in our power to enforce our
high standards and consistently strive to raise those standards to
even higher levels.''
</P>
<P>
   In his memo, Schimberg thanked CCE's European employees for
working around the clock to try to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply grateful for their remarkable commitment to our
business,'' he wrote. ``The formidable task remains for us to
rebuild consumer confidence in the integrity of our brands, and we
are working with the Coca-Cola Co. on the development and
implementation of a strong marketing-public relations plan.''
</P>
<P>
   CCE, the world's largest soft-drink bottler, has about 9,000
employees in Western Europe and 57,000 in North America.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like many people who come to New York from somewhere
else, who have a heightened attraction to the city's openness, Todd
Oldham had an ideal, and it was John Badum. To Oldham, the
Texas-born fashion designer who made his name in the early 1990s,
Badum was a catalyst, a ringleader, someone who was not only openly
gay but who was also constantly at the center of everything.
</P>
<P>
   He was those things, too, to the photographer David LaChapelle.
And to Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York, who
met his future employers, the Pressman family, through Badum. And
to Beverly Mace, a friend, who said in the days following Badum's
brutal murder on Memorial Day weekend in upstate New York, that it
seemed to her as if everyone she knew in the city had started off
at Badum's East Village apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``John lived, lived for sure,'' Oldham said last week. ``He was
our own Auntie Mame. God, he was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the early hours of Sunday, May 30, in Batavia, 40 miles
east of Buffalo, Badum, 46, a former fashion industry executive,
was repeatedly stabbed by a person whom his friends knew slightly,
and whom it now appears Badum didn't know well enough.
</P>
<P>
   That person, Hamid Ouhda, a 23-year-old Moroccan immigrant, was
Badum's companion. He was also the husband of Badum's sister
Theresa, a teacher in Batavia, who admitted in an interview that
she had married Ouhda in Morocco last January to get him an
American visa.
</P>
<P>
   Although Batavia police investigators said they believed Ouhda
had intended to kill both Badum and his sister when he broke into
Ms. Badum's one-bedroom apartment, Ms. Badum, 40, escaped with
minor stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ouhda, too, died that night. At 4:55 a.m., an hour after fleeing
on foot, the man the police say killed Badum was himself killed by
a mini-van traveling on Route 33, about a mile east of Batavia.
Chuck Dudek, one of four Batavia detectives on the case, said that
Ouhda appeared to have thrown himself into the vehicle's path. His
death was ruled a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   While the events of May 30 are clear in the minds of the
detectives, what is not clear to them is what drove Ouhda to stab
Badum 31 times. The mystery has also consumed many people on
Seventh Avenue, where Badum once helped build a $30 million
business and where he knew, as LaChapelle said, ``the `411' on
everyone in the fashion industry.''
</P>
<P>
   No less confounding to Badum's friends, about 200 of whom
gathered last week for a memorial service, is how a man so
supremely good at connecting people could have made so fatal a
misconnection with Ouhda. The two had met while Badum was traveling
in southern Morocco in 1996, his sister said.
</P>
<P>
   To the victim's friends, Ouhda was little more than a handsome
stranger. He was 6 feet 2 inches tall, weighed 220 pounds and was
described by those who had met him as pleasant but immature. He
spoke little English and conversed with Badum in poor French.
Ouhda's family lives in Ouarzazate, a farming village 125 miles
south of Marrakesh, where the Sahara begins. Last week, an
English-speaking friend of Ouhda's father, who is a civil servant
with the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, said by phone that the
family was itself trying to comprehend what had happened. ``They're
just completely shocked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the opinion of several of Badum's friends that he ``died
for love,'' in Ms. Mace's words. Such an assertion, if true,
suggests that Badum was a rash and foolish person. But friends say
this was not the case. ``I've known John for 14 years, and I've
never seen indiscretion like this,'' said Jerry Hirsch, whose
company, L'Zinger, produced Go Silk, the washable silk sportswear
line that Badum, who was national sales director, helped turn into
one of the hottest labels of the 1980s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial, which drew a downtown contingent as well as
designers like Oldham and Thierry Mugler, Hirsch, who said he had
spoken to Badum three days before his death, was surprised by some
of the tributes. ``I heard people say that John was Auntie Mame and
a queen,'' Hirsch said, ``but they are. He was really more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   From a business point of view, which is really the only one on
Seventh Avenue, Go Silk was a tremendous success. Hirsch had
founded L'Zinger in the 1970s with a partner, Mitsu Aoki, and in
the early '80s, at the request of a retail client, Henry Lehr, they
produced some washable silk separates based on Lehr's designs. It
was a lark. But within a week, Lehr had sold all the clothes, and
in its first full season Go Silk sold 3,000 units, a number that
eventually reached 450,000 units annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just about every major retailer coming through our
door,'' Hirsch said.

 &HT;    Jury reaches verdict in rape-abduction case
 &HT;    (Attention: Ohio, Tennessee eds.)
 &HT;    By Rob Modic
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ After seven hours of deliberations over two days,
a jury Monday convicted Kevin Joseph Caes in a month-long
rape-abduction of a Nashville woman in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Caes, who had missed part of the trial because he yelled at the
victim as she testified, remained quiet and fixed his gaze ahead as
Judge Dennis J. Langer of Montgomery County Common Pleas Court read
each verdict of guilty for 28 felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Caes and his attorneys, Dana Martino and D.K. Wehner, had sought
to win verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity based on
evaluations of two psychiatrists and a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the jury didn't buy into the insanity defense, which
absolutely was inappropriate in this case,'' said assistant county
prosecutor David Franceschelli.
</P>
<P>
   Four psychologists testified for the prosecution that they not
only failed to detect signs of insanity, they concluded he was
faking a serious mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Caes, 35, was convicted of 22 counts of rape, one count of
kidnapping, three counts of felonious assault on a police officer,
one count of failure to comply with a signal by a police officer
and one count of possession of a dangerous ordnance. Franceschelli
withdrew one count of rape during trial after the victim failed to
testify about it.
</P>
<P>
   All of the charges stemmed from a week-long period that ended
Aug. 20, 1997, when a 21-year-old woman severed an alarm wire in
the Harrison Twp. home of Caes' parents. When Montgomery County
sheriff's deputies showed up, the woman told them Caes had been
holding her gagged, handcuffed and shackled to a bed in the
basement. She said she was a prostitute in Nashville and Caes had
abducted her with a stun gun a month earlier after he had solicited
her for sex in his car.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, whose street name is ``Susan,'' testified Caes first
held her in a small trailer in the driveway of what turned out to
be the home of Caes' brother, who lives near Clinton, Ind. After
convincing Caes she had been seen inside the trailer where he had
concealed her, she said Caes drove her to the Harrison Twp. home
after his parents had left for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   When Caes returned to the home Aug. 20 and spotted deputies
swarming over the street, he drove his car over front lawns and led
deputies on a chase through Harrison Twp. before he crashed his
car.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Langer said he will schedule sentencing and a hearing to
determine Caes' sexual offender classification sometime in July.
Franceschelli said Caes could face hundreds of years in prison and
one charge carries a mandatory, indefinite life prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Caes was offered a plea agreement in January 1998 that would
have required him to serve 10 years in prison. But he refused the
offer and the following day tried to cut his wrists with a safety
razor. The fit led to a ruling that he was not competent to be
tried. Six months later, Langer ruled Caes had faked the earlier
incident.

 NEW YORK: Hirsch said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Part of the draw was Badum, who had joined the company two years
before the start of Go Silk. A big man with an equally big gift for
gab, Badum, who grew up in Hagerstown, Md., had a ready grasp of
books, films and current events, all of which enhanced his
popularity _ and the label's _ with editors and stores like Neiman
Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Doonan of Barneys said: ``Sixty percent of the motivation for
going up to Go Silk was to see John. The rest was to buy the
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch agreed that Badum's personality was critical to the
line's success. ``John was a very entertaining person,'' he said.
``He knew the best restaurants, the best shows, and he could always
get someone a reservation. He really became a driving force behind
the collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Badum had no equity in the company, Hirsch said, he was
well compensated, enough so that in 1995, as Go Silk's luster was
fading, Badum resigned, telling friends he would travel for a year.
But a year turned into several years as he wandered from England to
North Africa _ ``wafting around the world in a djellaba,'' as
Doonan put it _ and relied on a network of friends. From India, he
wrote that he was staying with a prince, and, Hirsch recalled,
``Thierry Mugler took care of him in the summertime in the Greek
islands.''
</P>
<P>
   If Badum thought he was losing ground professionally or was
jealous of the success of friends like Oldham, he didn't show it.
Recently he had spoken of starting a home furnishings catalog based
on things he had found abroad.
</P>
<P>
   A number of friends, including Beverly Mace's husband, Alan,
said they detected a pattern in Badum's romantic relationships, and
it involved younger, often foreign-born men of little or no means.
And, Mace said, Badum believed that because he was a large, portly
man ``it would be easier to find someone from another culture to
accept him physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Mace said he had advised his friend against an involvement with
Ouhda, because of the age and cultural differences. And, indeed,
Badum may have underestimated how Ouhda's traditional upbringing
might affect him when he arrived in New York in March and settled
into Ms. Badum's apartment in Batavia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Badum said the marriage had been her idea. ``I really felt
that this was a person for my brother,'' she said. She said she
continued to think so through March, as Ouhda and her brother, who
also stayed at the apartment sometimes, talked about buying a house
near Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   But by late April, Ms. Badum said, she began to see emotional
stress in Ouhda. On May 6, she recalled, he stormed out of the
apartment, saying: ``You don't own me. I'm free.'' He went to live
on a nearby farm, where he earned money, Ms. Badum said, milking
cows.
</P>
<P>
   Badum told Hirsch and others of the deterioration of the
relationship in the days before the murder. His shame about
misjudging Ouhda and his fear of putting his sister in legal
jeopardy seemed to weigh heavily on him, Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of May 29, Ouhda left Batavia and traveled by bus
to New York, where, Detective Dudek said, he waited for nine hours
outside Badum's apartment. Based on statements Ouhda had made to an
acquaintance in Batavia, the detectives concluded that he was
planning to kill Badum and then himself. But Badum was not in New
York: he had gone to Batavia to be with his sister. Around 5 p.m.,
she said, Ouhda telephoned her brother on his cell phone. He
sounded frantic, and from what Ms. Badum overheard, ``it seemed to
me that he wanted to go back to Morocco.'' She said her brother
tried to calm him, telling him to go to a hostel and that he would
see him in New York the next day. Badum then booked an airline
reservation on the Internet for Ouhda to return to Morocco on
Sunday, his sister said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the police said, Ouhda boarded a Trailways bus for
Batavia, arriving at 2:20 a.m. An hour and a half later, as a
police dispatcher was responding to a ``911'' call from the
apartment, Ouhda heaved a brick through a sliding glass door and
entered the kitchen. There, the police said, he turned on a light
and picked up two knives. He proceeded toward the bedroom,
shattering a plywood door into four pieces. Detective Dudek said,
``He went through this door like it wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial service two weeks later, Ms. Badum told the
gathering that her brother had saved her life. And it was true, the
police said: Badum had absorbed the brunt of Ouhda's fury. But this
is not what Badum's friends dwelled on _ how he was killed. Rather,
it was the way that Badum, unknown to the larger world, was one of
those behind-the-scenes figures in fashion who knew how to connect
the dots, make introductions and be present at the start of so many
careers. The way he was so much a part of their New York.  &QL;

BOOST IN COUNTRYWIDE'S EARNINGS ANTICIPATED
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., the
nation's largest independent home mortgage lender, is expected
Tuesday to report a quarterly earnings increase of nearly 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus of 14 analysts surveyed by First Call put the
Calabasas-based company's earning at 88 cents a share vs. 78 cents
in the 1998 first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They also rate the company in northwestern L.A. County a strong
buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analysts are pretty positive on this one,'' said Chuck
Hill, First Call's research director.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly results will reflect the impact of Countrywide's
expansion of operations beyond its core home loan business.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the company branched out into the consumer
insurance business, offering a full range of products that include
home, life and auto coverage. The company does not underwrite the
policies but acts as an agent for major providers.
</P>
<P>
   But during this quarter, Countrywide said it would buy
Irvine-based Balboa Life and Casualty Insurance, which has 600
employees and wrote $234 million in policies during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Then in February, Countrywide and Woolwich PLC announced they
would form a European mortgage banking joint venture. Countrywide
will provide sophisticated technology and expertise to service the
portfolio held by Woolwich, which has operations throughout the
United Kingdom and in France and Italy. The joint venture will
market its services to other lenders. Woolwich's mortgage servicing
portfolio is worth $40 billion, with annual funding of about $10
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Houck, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. said
Countrywide has a good interim growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been executed over a long period of time,'' he said of
the growth plan. ``And you've got a growing earnings stream with
limited downside.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people might be concerned that as the refinancing boom
winds down the company's earnings could take a hit. But Houck
expects this will be more than offset by profits from Countrywide's
huge loan servicing portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the earnings will drop off as the refinancing
boom tapers off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the February fourth quarter, Countrywide earned $102 million,
or 86 cents per share, on revenue of $532 million. That was up from
net income of $85.1 million, or 74 cents a share, on revenue of
$410 million in the 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
   Countrywide shares closed at $45.25 on Monday, up $1.25, on
694,100 shares traded. That's about 50percent higher volume than
its 30-day average.

PARENTS' SUIT SEEKS END TO RACE-BASED SCHOOL PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Twenty-five years to the day a federal judge ordered
Boston to desegregate its public schools _ leading to one of the
most tumultuous and ugly chapters in the city's history _ a group
of parents asked a federal court Monday to abandon the last
remnants of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Saying four white students were unconstitutionally denied
entrance to schools because of their race, the lawsuit asks the
court to throw out a decade-old policy that assigns students to
schools based on choice and race.
</P>
<P>
   The suit comes as similar ones are filed around the country
asking federal courts to throw out any public student assignment
policy that uses race. The courts have largely been sympathetic to
such cases _ and in many cases have ordered entire desegregation
orders lifted in school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfair for my son to be denied anything because of his
race,'' said Rose O'Toole, one of the five plaintiffs and a mother
of a 4-year-old she says was denied entrance to his choice of
preschool because he was white. Boston's Children First, a
pro-neighborhood school group, spearheaded the lawsuit and also is
as a plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   The School Department and Mayor Thomas M. Menino's office
declined to comment on the 18-page lawsuit, saying it was received
too late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes after a three-year losing effort by Boston
public schools to defend race-based admission policies at their top
exam school. School officials argued that the educational value to
a diverse student body is so great, a race-based policy is needed
to ensure it.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court, however, ruled in December that the
city could not use race in assigning students to Boston Latin
School. Soon after, the School Committee abandoned a pledge to take
the case to the US Supreme Court, fearing it would lose the
precedent-setting case and jeopardize desegregation efforts around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   But how federal courts ultimately decide the latest Boston case
_ and the underlying question about the value of a diverse student
body _ could have implications for desegregation efforts
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The US Supreme Court has yet to rule on race-based admissions
policies in public school cases, although several cases are in the
pipeline and could eventually be chosen. The nation's highest court
already has ruled against using race in college-based admissions
and in awards for government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, courts were ruling much differently.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, 1974, federal Judge Arthur Garrity Jr. ruled the
Boston School Committee and the state Board of Education violated
the rights of black children under the 14th Amendment and ordered
desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was never the same. Racial tensions exploded in September
1974 when the first phase of busing began between Roxbury and South
Boston. Violent protests were commonplace, and Boston gained an
infamous entry in the nation's history books as a symbol of
desegration woes. Trouble continued through the years, and racial
tension occasionally flared, particularly in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1987, a federal appeals court said Boston schools were as
desegregated as possible. The school department was allowed to come
up with a new student assignment plan _ as long as it did not
return the city to segregated schools. The current plan, called
controlled choice, began in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, one of the designers of that plan, Michael Alves, said
controlled choice was intended in part to prevent discrimination,
not encourage it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge the notion that this is intentionally designed to
discriminate against white students,'' said Alves, a national
desegregation specialist. ``It is also miscasting controlled
choice. It is not race-based. It is choice-based, and race is
factored in to ensure racial fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the city spends an estimated $17 million a year busing
students for racial balancing, out of a total busing budget of
about $48 million. The city does not break out the number of
students assigned to school based solely on race, using instead a
combination of choice and race.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's lawsuit against the city was filed by Boston lawyer
Chester Darling, who used the 1st Amendment to persuade the Supreme
Court to uphold the rights of organizers of the St. Patrick's Day
in South Boston to exclude a gay and lesbian group.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the lawsuit aims at returning the city to
neighborhood schools; its plaintiffs say parents and students will
feel more invested in the district if they attend schools closer to
home. The group says 25 years of desegregation efforts in Boston
have gotten rid of inequalities between schools _ but to the
detriment of all schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents the possibilities for the future,'' said Ann
Walsh, head of Boston's Children First. ``This is the beginning of
reform of a system in chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Menino recently endorsed the concept of neighborhood
schools and said he would build five more. The question left
unanswered: Will race be abandoned in assigning students to
schools?
</P>
<P>
   But those who argue for busing say it is not segregation by race
they fear anymore _ it is segregation by class. With neighborhood
schools, richer areas like West Roxbury could end up with better
schools than poorer areas such as Mattapan, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A drawback of not busing is that you will have a group of
children in nicer neighborhoods with parents that are involved in
the schools,'' said parent Terina Davulis of Dorchester. ``Students
in poorer neighborhoods where the schools are not as good will get
shortchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents remain split on whether busing should stay. ``I like the
idea of busing because your child can get exposed to different
children from different backgrounds,'' Davulis said.
</P>
<P>
   But Carl Askins, a parent from Jamaica Plain, believes busing
has destroyed ``the fabric of the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   And once new neighborhoods schools that can provide equal
resources are built, busing should end, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you would go to school in your
neighborhood, where everyone knew everyone's child and the
neighborhood would keep you in line,'' Askins said.

BIOTECH, TOBACCO FIRMS LINK IN SEARCH OF LUNG CANCER THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A Seattle biotechnology company, Corixa Corp., has
entered into a research partnership with one of the world's largest
cigarette makers, Japan Tobacco Inc., to develop a therapy for lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Corixa expects to receive more than $40 million from Japan
Tobacco in return for granting the company _ the third largest
cigarette manufacturer worldwide _ rights to the biotech company's
experimental immunologic treatments for lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death of people
worldwide,'' said Mark McDade, president and chief operating
officer for Corixa. ``From a market standpoint, it's an obvious
target.''
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of anti-tobacco activists, however, the
partnership between a biomedical company and a tobacco merchant is
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obscene,'' said Dr. Michael Lippman, a Seattle family
practice physician and president of the anti-smoking advocacy group
Washington DOC. ``If Japan Tobacco wants to combat lung cancer,
they should just go out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Astrid Berg, executive director of the Washington state branch
of the American Lung Association, criticized Corixa for claiming to
be ``committed to saving lives and preventing diseases'' while
entering into partnership with one of the world's leading tobacco
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a little bit weird,'' Berg said. ``Here's a
company that purports to want to save lives and they strike a deal
with the agent that's responsible for creating the disease ... It's
a deal with the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Steven Gillis, chief executive officer at Corixa, and
McDade said they were surprised at the criticism, noting that
Corixa's partnership deal is only with the pharmaceutical division
of Japan Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Hironori Mizuguchi, a spokesman for Japan Tobacco in Tokyo, said
his company has diversified into numerous other fields and
products, some of which have nothing to do with tobacco
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the different divisions have their own business
missions,'' Mizuguchi said. He said Japan Tobacco, which calls
itself JT in its non-tobacco operations, decided to partner with
Corixa because of its interest in incorporating more biotechnology
into its pharmaceutical business.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Tobacco is becoming one of the bigger pharmaceutical
companies in Japan, McDade said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have top-notch researchers there ... We think it's going
to be a solid partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillis, who helped found Immunex prior to launching Corixa, said
it is simplistic to criticize Japan Tobacco for trying to shift its
business from tobacco into biomedical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many pharmaceutical companies developed initially as producers
of chemicals, chemicals used to kill,'' he said. The chemical
weapon known as mustard gas, Gillis noted, eventually gave rise to
some of today's chemotherapy drugs. Japan Tobacco should be lauded
for supporting drug development, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. tobacco manufacturers, though many have diversified into
food and other industries, so far do not appear to have invested
heavily in pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1994, Corixa focuses on using immune system therapies
to combat cancer and other diseases. Corixa researchers have been
exploring, among other things, experimental therapeutic
``vaccines'' aimed at treatment rather than prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In its research partnership with Japan Tobacco, Corixa
scientists have just started a program aimed at identifying how to
boost the immune system's response and therapeutic reaction to lung
cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Corixa's policy of finding financial partners
early in development to speed commercialization, the local biotech
company has given Japan Tobacco exclusive rights in North America
and Japan to market the lung cancer therapies Corixa hopes to
develop in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian firm, Zambon Group, has an agreement with Corixa to
market the same potential lung cancer therapies in Europe. In
China, Zambon and Japan Tobacco would share licensing rights.
</P>
<P>
   The goal at Corixa, McDade said, is to get the financial backing
needed to develop an effective lung cancer therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For big pharmaceutical companies, if they don't have an
exclusive right to sell the product they're not necessarily going
to give it a priority development and marketing effort,'' he said.
If Japan Tobacco or Zambon choose not to market the therapy, the
licensing rights revert to Corixa.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman and other critics said it's no surprise that a tobacco
maker might want to invest in a potential new treatment for lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make money causing the illness and then they get to make
more money selling a treatment for the illness,'' Lippman said.
``It's a great deal for Japan Tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the claims of diversification, Lippman quotes from Japan
Tobacco's web page describing tobacco as the company's ``core
business.'' On the page describing the company's interest in
pharmaceuticals, the company states that it ``encountered
pharmaceuticals through our studies toward acquiring a total
balance in human health.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan Tobacco's Mizuguchi said his company does not believe it's
been conclusively demonstrated that tobacco is the leading cause of
lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not proved that smoking is the sole cause of lung
cancer,'' Mizuguchi said. ``But we don't deny the possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Lung Association attributes almost nine out of 10
cases of lung cancer to smoking tobacco in the U.S. The World
Health Organization has reported that aggressive marketing of
tobacco in Asia has doubled consumption in the region since the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman said it's clear the company intends to continue
aggressively marketing cigarettes and smoking even if it also
intends to become a player in the ``lung cancer market.''
</P>
<P>
   John Banzhaf, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based
Action on Smoking and Health, said Japan Tobacco may have a real
interest in the pharmaceutical business but there are other
possible reasons a tobacco company might want to support research
into treatments for lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may think that they're going to soon have this vaccine
for lung cancer so, gee, I guess I can go ahead and smoke,''
Banzhaf said. ``At the very least, the industry can at least appear
to demonstrate that they're doing something about the health
risks.''

 &HT;    Bush calls for abstinence programs at latest campaign stopBy Ken
Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ He's conquered Texas politics and cakewalked
to the front of the presidential field. Now Gov. George W. Bush is
ready to go head-to-head with the influential forces of nature. He
has long supported sexual abstinence for unmarried couples, and on
Monday he announced that if he's elected president the federal
government would channel as much money into abstinence education as
it spends on sex education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The twin epidemics of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted
disease are a major problem for the future of America,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants government spending on abstinence programs, now $62
million a year, to equal the amount spent on contraception
programs, now about $135 million a year. He also said the two
programs must be taught separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like to me the contraceptive message sends a
contradictory message,'' he said. ``It tends to undermine the
message of abstinence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments came after he sat in on a course, offered by
Heritage Community Services, that teaches teens the risks of sex.
Bush's battle plan against premarital sex also includes an end ``to
hostile regulations and bureaucratic rules'' that deter religious
groups from seeking federal grants for abstinence programs, and a
long-term study to measure the effectiveness of all abstinence
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes, he said, are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for the American dream to touch a life if you've
had a baby out of wedlock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Monday began a five-day tour that also will take him to
Virginia, Washington, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida. In
Washington today Bush will visit Capitol Hill and hold a
fund-raiser that's expected to bring in more than $1.5 million, a
record for a presidential fund-raiser in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina primary, scheduled for Feb. 19, will be the
fourth contest, and the first in the South, next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has solid support here, including endorsements from Sen.
Strom Thurmond, Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler, House Speaker David Wilkins
and more than 50 state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, Bush will lose support from eight South Carolina
legislators he thought were on his side. The eight were among those
who signed a February letter urging Bush to run and calling him
``the best candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Those eight, with nine colleagues, today will endorse Arizona
Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suddenly became clear to a lot of us that the Republican
nomination should be earned not inherited,'' said McCain backer
Terry Haskins, speaker pro tem of the South Carolina House. ``And
John McCain is the one whose life of service really stands out.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskins was not one of the lawmakers who signed the February
letter encouraging Bush to run.
</P>
<P>
   Another South Carolina lawmaker who signed the February letter
to Bush opted earlier this month to endorse Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler, co-chairman of the Bush campaign here, discounted the
importance of the lawmakers' shift to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's making a mountain of a molehill,'' he said, noting that
more than half of the state's GOP lawmakers are Bush backers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's South Carolina stops also highlighted a key Bush asset:
Through his political and family ties he knows people everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sunset Restaurant in Columbia, where Bush spent an hour
shaking hands, he chatted with Toddy Atwater, mother of the late
Lee Atwater, who was the political guru behind the elder George
Bush's successful 1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He learned under the best, under Lee,'' Mrs. Atwater said
after Bush talked with her. ``He has learned from his dad, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, Bush showed another valuable asset: the ability
to raise money. He expected to raise about $175,000 at a reception
at the Spartanburg-Greenville Airport, one of 13 such events
scheduled this week.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Bush said he supported the gun-control measure that
died in a political crossfire in Congress last week. He also
defended his decision to sign into law a measure barring cities
from filing lawsuits against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (gun) manufacturers have manufactured a legal product. I
think the people who need to be held liable are the criminals who
misuse a legal product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said lawsuits filed against gun makers are different than
the suits _ including one filed by the state of Texas _ against
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies were deceptive about their product, and
their product _ while legally used _ caused disease,'' he said.

DEMOCRATS STALL BILL TO FORCE CONSIDERATION OF PATIENTS' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, was forced to set aside an agricultural spending bill on
Monday after Democrats sought to attach to it a broad proposal for
changes in managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   While those maneuverings were highly technical, the implications
were not. Democrats were serving notice that new protections for
patients enrolled in health maintenance organizations were among
their uppermost priorities, and that they were willing to disrupt
other Senate business to compel consideration of the issue as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, for their part, were confronted with another
roadblock in their intermittently hobbled efforts _ more so in the
House than in the Senate _ to make good on promises to shepherd
spending bills through Congress with dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for federally mandated changes in managed health care
_ or for what has come to be known on Capitol Hill as a patient's
bill of rights _ have been simmering on a back burner for several
years now.
</P>
<P>
   But in the House as well as the Senate, Democrats are turning up
the heat, eager to be seen as the principal champions of a popular
issue as the 2000 elections draw ever nearer. In the House,
Democrats this week began putting their names on a petition to
force a patient's bill of rights to the floor in the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was with the same goal that Senate Democrats staged their
maneuver, which they said Lott could expect again on other pieces
of legislation unrelated to health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be facing it on every bill that comes along,''
said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. ``This legislation will come to
the floor, and it'll come either in an orderly fashion or a
disorderly fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican proposal on managed care was voted out of committee
three months ago. It would have created new ways for patients to
appeal the coverage decisions of insurers, but Democrats complained
that it did not go far enough. For example, it did not eliminate
the hurdles that prevent patients from suing HMOs for denials of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said on Monday that Democrats would get a chance on the
Senate floor to amend that bill, but not before they narrowed their
wish list to a limited number of amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to go,'' Lott said on Monday, referring to himself
and other Senate Republicans. But, he added, ``there must be some
reasonable understanding, some reasonable agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said
that the kinds of constraints that Lott has suggested, like a limit
of five amendments for each party, are inappropriate for
legislation that would affect scores of millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle also said that Republicans were trying to truncate the
debate as a way of preventing any close examination of Republican
versus Democratic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symmetry with the gun legislation is really evident,''
Daschle said, still reveling in his party's victory in prolonging
that debate in the Senate and persuading several Republicans to
alter their initial views.

KURDISH REBEL LEADER TO SPEAK WHEN TRIAL RESUMES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The trial of the Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan is scheduled to resume on Wednesday after a 15-day
break; he could be sentenced to death within days.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers are expected to sum up their case when the court
reconvenes at the prison island of Imrali. The defendant is then
expected to make a statement. A quick guilty verdict is widely
expected on the charge of treason, which carries an automatic death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Until the trial began last month, almost every Turkish
commentator and politician predicted that the death sentence would
be carried out. Many still believe so, but after Ocalan's
surprising testimony on the opening day of his trial, there are
dissenting voices.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Ocalan said he regretted the violence his
rebels have used in their 15-year campaign against the Turkish
state. He said that if he is allowed to live he would work with the
authorities to bring his guerrillas down from the mountains and
work for a peaceful settlement of the Kurdish problem in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no official response from government or military
leaders, but some commentators have suggested that Ocalan's
sincerity should be put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's guerrilla group, the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK,
has said it will pursue ``total war'' if he is hanged. But it
endorsed his call for a peaceful solution and suggested that it was
ready to turn itself into a political organization.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Turkey's legal Kurdish political party, People's
Democracy, also endorsed Ocalan's call.
</P>
<P>
   ``A historic opportunity was born on Imrali,'' the party said in
a statement. ``The proposals of a solution to build social peace
are proposals we have advocated from the beginning. These proposals
are the only way out of the dead-end in which the nation finds
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the head of the German secret service urged that
Ocalan not be hanged, and said he hoped that German diplomats in
Ankara would do whatever possible to prevent an execution. Several
million Turks live in Germany, including many of Kurdish descent,
and the German authorities, like those in other European countries,
fear outbursts of violence if Ocalan is hanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it is not likely that the PKK would turn to
immediate violence, the execution of Ocalan would strengthen the
PKK and lead it to step up its campaign,'' Peter Frisch, who heads
the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, told a Berlin
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Although the death penalty remains on the books in Turkey, the
last execution here was 15 years ago. To be carried out, all death
sentences must be ratified by Parliament and the president. Senior
military officers might be able to exercise decisive influence if
they wished.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that may be lurking in the back of some minds here is
the Istanbul summit meeting in November of the Conference for
Security and Cooperation in Europe. The meeting is expected to
attract leaders from throughout Europe, in addition to President
Clinton, and the authorities view it as a chance to project
Turkey's image. They are anxious that the climate in Istanbul be
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   In line with an action of Parliament on Friday, a civilian judge
who has been present at every session of Ocalan's trial will
replace the military judge when proceedings resume.

WEYERHAEUSER TO ACQUIRE MACMILLAN BLOEDEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN AND JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two of the oldest names in the Pacific Northwest's
forest products industry are combining to make one of North
America's biggest timber and paper companies even larger.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser Co. said Monday it will pay nearly $2.5 billion in
stock for MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., one of Canada's largest forest
products companies.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition by the Federal Way, Wash.-based forest products
multi-national giant raised concerns among Canada's
environmentalists and nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is significant not just for its size, or for the fact
that it means the end of the MacMillan Bloedel name as an
independent company (although it may survive on products or an
operating division of subsidiary).
</P>
<P>
   It also signals the hastening consolidation of the forest
products industry, a trend that analysts say could mean more
cross-border deals. And environmentalists are concerned it could
mean an end to the Canadian company's shift toward more
environmentally friendly practices.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser will pay .28 shares of its stock for each share of
MacMillan Bloedel's stock. The deal needs the approval of MacMillan
Bloedel shareholders and regulators in the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting company will have annual sales of about $13
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser, already the world's largest producer of softwood
lumber and market pulp and the second largest manufacturer of
oriented strand board (a panel made by glue together large wood
chips), will become one of the world's biggest makers of cardboard
boxes. Already a major player in Canada, Weyerhaeuser would likely
become the largest forest products company in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser chief executive Steven Rogel declined to say how
many layoffs might result from combining the two companies,
including their corporate offices in Vancouver. But he said cost
savings from layoffs were not a major consideration in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser does think it can save $150 million a year in other
ways. For example, by combining the mills and box plants of the two
companies, it can cut millions every year in transportation costs
of shipping linerboard and corrugating medium from mills to the
plants where they're assembled into cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the specific gains for Weyerhaeuser, the deal is being
driven by major trends reshaping the industry. ``We want to create
a company out of this that is a global leader,'' Rogel told a news
conference in Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of companies in the forest products industry have the same
thing in mind, which is why there's been a flurry of big deals,
including Jefferson Smurfit Corp. combining with Stone Container
Corp. and International Paper acquiring Union Camp Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Rogel said consolidation is driven in part by what he called
``big-box syndrome,'' the growth of such giant retailers as Home
Depot and Wal-Mart. Companies that hope to supply those retailers
with merchandise have to be big themselves, ``if not globally at
least North American.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also the result of an industry marked by wide cyclical
swings, too much capacity in certain product lines and poor returns
compared to other industries. ``It's an industry that's ripe for
consolidation,'' said Paul Latta, analyst with McAdams Wright Ragen
Inc. in Seattle. ``It's fairly fragmented and there's little price
control.''
</P>
<P>
   To cope, most companies have decided to ``be large in particular
product lines rather than everything,'' said Susan Ryan Goodman,
analyst with the bond rating agency Fitch IBCA. Companies have also
decided they'll achieve the necessary size by buying other
companies, which is much less expensive than building new mills
that aren't needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every company is focusing on fewer businesses in which
it can excel,'' Rogel said. Weyerhaeuser itself recently announced
a deal to sell operations making particleboard and medium density
fiberboard, deciding it would never be big enough in those products
to make it worth the management time and investment capital
required.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser's stock price declined $2.63 to $67.13 yesterday.
The stock price of an acquiring company typically declines
immediately following a merger, as investors worry about how well
the combination will be carried out. Analyst Terry Schumacher with
Black &AMP; Co. in Portland said investors may also be wary that the
deal moves Weyerhaeuser into Coastal British Columbia, meaning more
exposure to environmental battles and to the still-fragile Asian
market.
</P>
<P>
   While the two companies hope to complete their deal by fall, it
could run into turbulence on several fronts, starting with the
traditional discomfort over selling a company, particularly one
with MacMillan Bloedel's history, to foreign interests,
particularly American.
</P>
<P>
   As British Columbia's best-known forest products company,
Macmillan Bloedel has long been a symbol _ notably to Canadian
nationalists who want British Columbia trees cut down by a British
Columbia company.
</P>
<P>
   Former B.C. Premier Dave Barrett termed the company's
acquisition by Weyerhaeuser ``a terrible mistake. ... If we are
going to maintain a Canadian identity, core parts of our economy
should be owned by Canadians, particularly in our resources
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a job loss, a loss of Canadian identity, and it makes
Weyerhaeuser too big a player in our own forest industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been non-Canadian firms in our forests,''
Barrett acknowledged. ``But what always follows acquisition is
consolidation of head offices, loss of significant skills through
job integration.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact MacMillan Bloedel has already been substantially
transformed by an American _ Tom Stephens, the company's president
and chief executive who was recruited by MacMillan Bloedel a year
and a half ago to turn around the financially struggling company.
Stephens sold off such pieces as MacMillan-Bloedel's pulp and paper
operations, and his downsizing helped return the company to
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential source of contention is environmental
disputes. MacMillan-Bloedel is the flagship name in British
Columbia's forest products industry, but as such has spent the
1990s under fire over the cutting of old growth forests in Canada's
Pacific province.
</P>
<P>
   While possessive toward Macmillan Bloedel, British Columbians
have not hesitated to protest against it. The company has been in
the vortex of three landmark environmental controversies. These
are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Carmanah: A small Vancouver Island coastal valley, marked for
logging by the company, was discovered to hold 300-foot-tall trees,
the tallest in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clayoquot Sound: Bearing Canadian flags, protesters set out
every morning during the summer of 1993 for the Kennedy River
bridge, the main logging access to valleys of Clayoquot Sound,
least-logged of Vancouver Island's great coastal fjords. The
government eventually accepting recommendations of a scientific
panel that there be no more clearcutting in Clayoquot Sound.
</P>
<P>
   _ Land Swap: MacMillan Bloedel has lost a considerable amount of
cutting rights with the provincial government's decisions to create
23 new provincial parks on Vancouver Island, and to preserve a few
unlogged valleys on British Columbia's lower mainland.The
provincial government has proposed to compensate the company by
giving it to 74,100-acres of public land. Environmentalists have
packed public meetings to protest the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also the first major British Columbia forest
products firm to make changes in response to threatened
international boycotts of B.C. forest products firms. Stephens,
last year announced it would phase out clearcut logging and seek
international certification of its operations as environmentally
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens also took his company out of the B.C. Forest Alliance,
an industry-funded public relations group known for its use of
heavyhanded tactics against environmental protests and critical
press coverage.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Friday, May 21,
about the indictment of Ihab M. Ali as part of the investigation of
Osama bin Laden misstated the charge against Mr. Ali. It is civil

perjury. The case is being handled under a court order of secrecy,

VIZCAINO KNOWS HE'LL SOON BE SITTING AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Mark Grudzielanek,
out with a broken right hand, is hoping to return in a week or so.
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said it'll probably be two weeks
beyond what Grudzielanek thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vizcaino isn't paying much attention to any of it. Mainly
because when Grudzielanek returns to the lineup, Vizcaino expects
to return to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   There are no delusions of grandeur here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing is going to happen again,'' Vizcaino said.
``I'm a professional, so I know he's going to come back and play.
Everyone wants to play every day. I have to be positive, so when
it's time for me to play, I can do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek's injury coincided with Vizcaino being activated
from the disabled list. Perhaps if Vizcaino hit .300 and performed
splendidly in the punchless No. 2 spot of the batting order, his
feelings would be different.
</P>
<P>
   But since the players passed by each other on the disabled list
June 4, Vizcaino is hitting .241 and seen his average dip to .263.
He also scored five runs and walked four times in the ensuing 15
games.
</P>
<P>
   However, Vizcaino said he's getting more playing time than he
expected because of Johnson's penchant for double switches and
Vizcaino's versatility. When Grudzielanek returns, Vizcaino will
miss the comfort of knowing he's in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play every day, you get in a rhythm, you feel
comfortable,'' Vizcaino said. ``You know you can go 0 for 4 and the
next day you'll be in the lineup. It's different when you play once
a week or twice a week or five times a month.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Better in the rotation: Johnson and general manager Kevin
Malone met Wednesday to discuss, among other things, the pitching
rotation. It was determined at that time that if Carlos Perez had
trouble in his start later that night, Jamie Arnold would relieve
and right-hander Darren Dreifort would rejoin the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was bombed, Arnold threw long relief, and the byproduct
was Dreifort allowing one run and pitching into the seventh inning
Saturday against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dreifort's start, Malone said he and Johnson agreed to
the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to be in a role where he can be the most
effective,'' Malone said. ``Because of his quality stuff, he can do
either (start or relieve). We'll look at continuing to try to
develop him as a starter. Right now, from where we're at, I think
he needs to be in the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking ahead: Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown will miss the
Padres in the three-game series that begins tonight at Dodger
Stadium, but he's set to face his former mates when the Dodgers
travel to San Diego next week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Padres fans _ and their employees _ don't figure
to be as wild as when Brown pitched there April 16. Brown, who
signed a $105 million contract during the offseason, was booed at
every movement, except when he was pulled after allowing three runs
on nine hits in 61/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also selected money-themed music to blare Brown's way
throughout the night and several of the Padres' pep team (or
whatever they call themselves) smashed a Brown papier-mache pinata
with a stick in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Dodgers rotation is set up this time around, Brown
will pitch Friday in San Francisco and next Thursday in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: A Dodgers win tonight would increase their winning
streak to three games, which would be their longest since winning
five straight April 27 through May 1. . . . Dodgers left fielder
Gary Sheffield (knee) is expected to return to the lineup tonight.

 &HT;    Bush's vetoes bring cheers, jeers
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Civil liberties and human rights advocates on
Monday criticized Gov. George W. Bush for vetoing a bill they said
would provide poor defendants better and speedier legal
representation, saying his action contradicts the compassionate
conservatism Bush is touting in his bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``By single-handedly blocking the unanimous will of the Texas
Legislature to improve laws for appointing counsel to poor people
accused of crime, Gov. Bush reveals that his brand of compassion
does not include justice for the poor,'' said Stephen Bright,
director of the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, would have allowed
counties to decide how to appoint lawyers for indigent criminal
defendants. The plan drew criticism from judges who now have that
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a perception by many district judges that the system
is not broken,'' said Travis County District Judge Bob Perkins.
``It was a shock to see this thing pass without any input from
district judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed the House and Senate without opposition,
but was vetoed by Bush late Sunday, the deadline for the governor
to sign or veto bills approved during the 1999 legislative session,
which ended May 31. Details of Bush's 31 vetoes were not released
until Monday. In all, Bush signed 1,586 bills, including a bill
aimed at blunting the Hopwood court ruling that triggered a ban on
affirmative action in college admissions, scholarships and
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows Texas colleges to match affirmative action
scholarships or grants awarded to Texas high school or college
graduates from out-of-state colleges.''Gov. Bush supports the bill
because it will help keep the best and brightest students from all
walks of life here in Texas,'' said his spokeswoman Linda Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The legal defense bill _ which again has thrust the Texas legal
system into a national spotlight as Bush campaigns for the
presidency _ could have shifted the power to appoint lawyers from
judges to county commissions. It would have given counties the
option of setting up a public defender's office, contracting with
outside agencies or allowing judges to continue making
appointments. The bill also would have required public defenders to
be appointed within 20 days of the defendant's request.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' handling of clemency cases involving death row inmates,
and its fast-paced executions, have been harshly criticized in
recent months by death penalty opponents in this country and
abroad. Bush's veto of Ellis' bill again set off a wave of
criticism across the country by people who say Texas' system of
appointing lawyers denies poor defendants a fair and speedy trial.
Too often, they say, poor defendants languish in jail because
judges do not quickly appoint lawyers, and the lawyers often do not
provide competent legal representation because they are paid
relatively little for such work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's action is neither compassionate nor
conservative,'' said Elizabeth Alexander, a spokeswoman for the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``For what could be more
compassionate than ensuring that poverty does not guarantee a
prison sentence, and what could be more conservative than adhering
to the constitutional guarantee of the right to a fair and speedy
trial?''
</P>
<P>
   But Perkins and many other judges and some district attorneys
say Bush did the right thing in vetoing the bill, which they said
could create a bigger and more expensive bureaucracy and result in
poor defendants getting lawyers who are unqualified or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that anyone has the perfect solution for
providing legal representation for vast numbers of indigents,''
said Williamson County District Attorney Ken Anderson. ``I don't
know why anyone would think taking the appointment of counsel and
moving it from district judges, who know better than anyone the
performance of (lawyers), and moving it to commissioners court
would help. At the very best (commissioners) would be removed. And
it would add another layer of bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In vetoing the bill, Bush agreed: ``The bill inappropriately
takes appointment authority away from judges, who are better able
to assess the quality of legal representation.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said poor defendants in Williamson County are appointed
lawyers within 72 hours and in Travis County, Perkins said
appointments are made within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also used his veto power to strike $51.1 million in
appropriations from the state's $98.1 billion budget plan for the
next two years. The money mostly was to fund bills that were vetoed
or didn't win legislative approval. Among the items he vetoed was
the second-year budget for the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal
Authority. Bush said the money is not needed because the agency's
functions will be transferred to the Texas Natural Resources
Conservation Commission by then.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bush's other vetoes:
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 2388, which Bush said would authorize county
commissioners to sell public property without public notice or a
competitive bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 2794, which Bush said would increase the fee
charged for annual vehicle safety inspection by two dollars.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 3635, vetoed because it was an unwarranted
expansion of the Travis County Probate Court's jurisdiction,
according to Bush. He said he addressed the probate court's
jurisdiction in House Bill 2580.
</P>
<P>
   _ Senate Bill 1703, which encourages more low-income housing.
Bush said he vetoed it because it is already addressed in another
bill that he signed.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m. Monday, the temperature at Washington, D.C., was just
67 degrees, or about 20 degrees below normal. The laden overcast
that has covered the Middle Atlantic States the past few days will
slowly erode Tuesday, allowing temperatures to rebound closer to
seasonal levels. A few locations in eastern Virginia, however, will
stay cloudy and cool as damp winds from the Atlantic persist.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy fog near the Northeast Seaboard will dissipate yielding
sunny skies by early afternoon as high pressure builds across
upstate New York. Abundant sunshine and warm conditions will cover
the interior Northeast. Farther south, scattered thunderstorms will
again plague Florida, especially just inland from the coast where
developing sea-breeze fronts undercut and lift sultry air.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of humid air from the Gulf of Mexico will fuel
showers and thunderstorms over Texas and the southeast Plains. Some
flooding is expected. A cluster of showers and storms will also
affect the Middle West as an approaching jet stream disturbance
augments the ascent of humid air covering the region.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated potent storms will erupt over eastern Wyoming the
central high Plains ahead of a cold front crossing the region. Some
of the storms will contain large hail and damaging winds.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore breezes will direct cool air with spotty showers into
the western Washington. The Southwest deserts and interior
California will broil beneath abundant sun. Local thundershowers
will develop near the higher mountain ranges of the Rockies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Mountain Clouds
</P>
<P>
   Like clockwork each afternoon during the past several days,
billowy clouds have boiled up along the crests of the central and
southern Rockies, muddling the mostly clear skies that have
dominated hours near dawn. At the top of a mountain, air in contact
with the warming ground quickly becomes warmer and less dense than
the free-floating air that surrounds the summit. Like a hot-air
balloon, bubbles of heated air rise, sometimes leading to cumulus
clouds. When the sun sets, air in contact with the mountainside
cools rapidly and the rising air currents that sustain the clouds
cease.

COCA-COLA CHAIRMAN USES ADS TO APOLOGIZE TO BELGIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chairman of Coca-Cola Co. apologized to the people of
Belgium in extraordinarily contrite newspaper ads Tuesday over a
contamination scare that began there more than a week ago and
spread to other countries in Europe. But he stopped short of
conceding that Coca-Cola products made anyone sick, and a study
released by the company suggested something else had caused their
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those people who suffered, especially the children, my
colleagues and I want to express a very sincere apology,'' the
chairman, M. Douglas Ivester, said in the ads, printed in Flemish
and French. ``We strive to make sure that Coca-Cola always stands
for good feelings, and we regret that it instead resulted in
feelings of illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester's statement was more penitent than his first apology
issued last Wednesday, after health authorities in four European
countries had already yanked Coca-Cola drinks from store shelves in
the biggest recall in the company's 113-year history. Ivester,
responding belatedly to a public outcry over how the company was
handling the mess, had said he was sorry for any problems and
promised an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that investigation was made public by the company Monday
in a toxicologist's report. It concluded that substances like
hydrogen sulfide were present in Coca-Cola soft drinks that people
drank before coming down with symptoms like nausea and headaches,
but that the amounts were too tiny to have caused illness.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's efforts to end its image crisis came as officials
from the European Union said they wanted to review all data on the
causes of the scare. That could prolong the ban on Coca-Cola
products, which entered its eighth day Monday in Belgium and began
last Tuesday in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, a total ban on Coke products remained in
Luxembourg; France and Belgium allowed the sale of some brands, but
not Coca-Cola, Fanta or Sprite _ the company's biggest sellers. In
the Netherlands, products shipped through Belgium remained
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola had a run-in with the European Union this year over
its $1.85 billion plan to acquire Cadbury Schweppes brands around
the world. After delays and bureaucratic hurdles, including some
presented by the European Union, Coca-Cola announced a
trimmed-back, $1.1 billion plan in which it would buy Cadbury
Schweppes brands almost everywhere except in the countries included
in the union.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola intensified its public relations effort in European
newspapers Monday, purchasing full-page ads published in France,
Italy and Spain. The French ads, which ran in Le Monde and
Liberation, among others, included a toll-free telephone number for
people with safety questions. The ads were signed by the president
of Coca-Cola France, Daniel Malcorps, and the president of
Coca-Cola Enterprises in France, Dominique Reiniche.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ivester said he met last week with James Burke,
the former Johnson &AMP; Johnson chairman who helped that company
weather a crisis caused by cyanide-laced Tylenol in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like Coke is stepping up to the line and accepting
responsibility, which is an excellent way to preserve and enhance
credibility and trust among consumers,'' said John Sicher,
publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped the slide in Coca-Cola's stock, which
fell almost 3 percent Monday, to $61.5625, partly on concern about
the ban's effects on sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, there is only a limited impact,'' said Marc
Cohen, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``But what is of concern
is that this isn't happening in the depths of winter. It's
happening in the peak sales period.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen reduced his per-share profit estimates for the current
quarter by 1 cent for Coca-Cola and 2 cents for Coca-Cola
Enterprises, the company's biggest bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, Martin Romm of Credit Suisse First Boston, has
estimated that Coca-Cola Enterprises is losing $3.4 million in
revenue a day as a result of the ban. Coca-Cola is expected to
announce second-quarter volume estimates, an important earnings
indicator, early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, who has been in Belgium off and on since Friday, sent a
lengthy companywide memo Monday in which he announced that he would
apologize. ``You need to know the context in which our issue is
unfolding,'' he wrote to the more than 28,000 Coca-Cola workers
around the world, calling the mood in Europe ``understandably
sensitive and cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Some smaller stores in affected countries have not removed all
of the banned products, shoppers said. One sign of the publicity
surrounding Coca-Cola's travails is on the Pont d'Iena in Paris,
where one resident reported that soft-drink vendors who normally
charge 15 francs for a cold Coke have now dropped the price _ to 5
francs.

THE NHL GETS RID OF CREASE REPLAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than two days after the Dallas Stars won the Stanley Cup in
the third overtime on a goal from inside the goalie's crease, the
National Hockey League eliminated the use of video replay Monday to
determine crease violations on goals, shifting the responsibility
to on-ice officials instead.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, said the rule change made by
the board of governors had nothing to do with Brett Hull's disputed
goal against Buffalo but was made from a desire to regain some of
the time and spontaneity lost to review. He said the delays caused
by the video system made fans unsure about whether to cheer an
apparent goal, a situation the league found disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To rely on replay too much isn't good,'' Bettman said. ``The
fact that so many people didn't understand the rule and how it was
applied in that situation _ and that you had controversy on a
correct call _ simply cemented the fact that there was a better way
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the replay rule was placed on the agenda of
Monday's board of governors meeting last week and that he had
discussed the change since February with Colin Campbell, the
league's director of hockey operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule was fine,'' Bettman said. ``It doesn't have
inconsistencies and it deals with zero tolerance.'' But he added,
``It's not as good a rule as the alternative, and we needed to make
a change.''
</P>
<P>
   On-ice officials will now have complete discretion on
man-in-the-crease calls, which will create the leeway to wave away
incidental intrusions into the crease that do not interfere with
the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving the crease to a judgment call,'' Bettman said,
adding, ``This way is better for the game and better for the
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Confusion reigned after Hull's goal, at 14 minutes 51 seconds of
the third overtime, even as Dallas players celebrated their 2-1
victory on the Marine Midland Arena ice in the early hours of
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The referees did not seek a review from the video judge,
although NHL officials said that they reviewed the tape several
times. They subsequently told the incensed Buffalo Coach Lindy Ruff
that although Hull's left skate preceded the puck into the crease,
Hull had continuous possession and the goal was legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule was absolutely, correctly applied,'' Bettman said.
``It was a non-issue. Everyone understands it was the right call.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, Ruff was still irate about the goal. He said his
players wanted the league to use the familiar procedure for
reviewing man-in-the-crease goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to hear the horn sound,'' Ruff said. ``They wanted
to hear the announcer say, `This goal is under review.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the video judge will no longer rule on
man-in-the-crease violations, he will still determine whether the
puck crosses the goal line, whether it crosses the goal line before
the cage is dislodged and whether it crosses the goal line before
time expired. He will also decide if the puck is directed into the
net by a hand or a foot; whether the puck deflected into the net
off an official and whether the puck is directed into the net by a
high stick. Video review will also continue to be used to establish
the correct time on the game clock.
</P>
<P>
   Video review has been used by the NHL since the 1991-92 season,
at the request of the referees. It was originally instituted to
protect goaltenders from injury but often drew criticism because
many goals were disallowed by infractions that were incidental to
the play, such as a teammate's skate in the crease away from the
action.
</P>
<P>
   For this past season, the policy was expanded to let the video
judge determine whether there was a man in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   The board of governors made two other major changes, altering
scoring and manpower during regular-season overtime periods.
Starting next season, each team will be awarded a point for a tie
after regulation. In a move to promote more offensive
aggressiveness, an extra point will be awarded to the winner in the
five-minute overtime period. In addition, overtime will be played
with four skaters a side, which is designed to create a more open
offensive flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have teams now that just want to play for the tie,''
Bettman said. ``From a fans standpoint this is going to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   In a test of the format during the final 243 games of the
American Hockey League's 1998-99 season, 27 of the 44 overtime
games were played to a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The league also voted to increase the number of games officiated
under the two-referee system from 270 last season to 700.
</P>
<P>
   And the league approved the purchase of the Washington Capitals
by Ted Leonsis, Jon Ledecky and Richard Patrick from Abe Pollin.

 &HT;    Security tops lists of concerns as computer industry meets at
expo
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ U.S. companies and government agencies lose at least
$100 million a year because of hackers, viruses and even employees
who breach their computer security systems.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands more companies remain blithely unaware of the
threat to their databases.
</P>
<P>
   That's the word Internet security experts are spreading at PC
Expo, the annual trade show for the computer industry, being held
in New York through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is expected to be one of the dominant topics at
this year's expo.
</P>
<P>
   Also on participants' minds is the increasingly intense price
competition in the PC business that is starting to show on the
bottom lines of some companies. Round Rock, Texas-based Dell
Computer Corp.'s growth, for instance, has slipped below 50 percent
for two consecutive quarters. And Compaq Computer Corp., already
facing a bevy of other problems, recently warned it may lose $250
million in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Chairman Michael Dell has scheduled a briefing with
journalists today, when he is expected to talk about steps his
company is taking to respond to changes in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, however, talk was of security. Recent studies have shown
that concerns about prying eyes are keeping millions of consumers
and businesses from buying more over the Internet. And recent
reports of viruses that invade and damage databases add to those
worries, said Scott Schnell of Security Dynamics, a Boston-area
company that sells security systems.
</P>
<P>
   While the PC hardware companies are coping with lower pricing
with varying degrees of success, the security software business is
growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Companies and government agencies spent $3.1 billion on security
software last year and will increase that to $4.2 billion in 1999
and to $7.4 billion by 2002, according to a recent International
Data Corp. study.
</P>
<P>
   Schnell said simple security systems that require only passwords
for employees or customers to log into a business's database have
numerous cracks that invite trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the weaknesses stem from human nature, such as the
tendency to forget passwords. In response to password
proliferation, employees often use the name of a spouse, child or
pet to gain access. Or they write the password on notes and affix
them to their desks or cubicle walls where they easily can be seen,
Schnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rely on people to take a reasonable password and be
secure,'' Schnell said.
</P>
<P>
   More reliable security systems use small devices, tokens, that
generate a random sequence of numbers that, with the password, make
a two-step security system. Some companies are offering a third
option involving recognition of eye patterns or fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Far more nefarious than forgetful employees are workers who hack
their employers' systems either to damage the database or steal
data for financial or other purposes. Such insider work is
especially difficult to stop because while many systems can track
when employees log in and how long they were on line, they don't
show what the employee did.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 computer fraud survey for the Computer Security
Institute and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, nearly 170
of 520 companies surveyed said they had suffered an attack on their
databases from employees. Two-thirds of the 520 admitted that their
security systems had been breached by hackers or viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Schnell said the burgeoning use of portable PCs is making life
more difficult for companies' security systems. For one thing,
portables are easily stolen, which gives would-be hackers plenty of
time to try to break into a database. They may even be taken only
long enough to install programs that reveal passwords that can be
readily called up on the screen. Schnell said such programs are
readily available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kid out there that wants to fool around with it can get
these tools and run with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the threats, an IDC survey of information technology
specialists found that half of them believe their employers'
systems will be more secure in the future. That stemmed from their
faith in their employers' willingness to spend more on continuing
technological improvements, such as those that will be shown at PC
Expo.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated $100 million in losses because of hackers, viruses
and dishonest employees probably is far lower than the actual
losses, said Derek Brink of Security Dynamics. The losses stem from
lost data, stolen computers, damage to data and lowered
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   But many companies don't report how bad they were hit because it
might worry customers, Brink said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're reluctant to report their losses, because they're
worried about trust,'' he said.
</P>

CHINA'S UNSAVORY RESETTLEMENT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The World Bank is scheduled to vote Tuesday on funding for the
China Western Poverty Reduction Project, a resettling of 57,800
poor Chinese farmers to the Tibetan and Mongolian Autonomous
Prefecture on the high, arid Tibetan Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   This is a project the World Bank should not fund. It would place
the bank in the position of helping to finance Beijing's policy of
transferring Han Chinese onto traditional Tibetan lands, reducing
the Tibetans to a small minority in those lands, and gradually
effacing their unique culture, their national identity, and their
way of life.
</P>
<P>
   The project would double the Chinese population in Dulan County,
the destination for the new Chinese immigrants. The population
shift would reduce the Tibetan portion of the population in Dulan
from 22 to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the Chinese project is funded, 2,500 nomads will have their
land taken from them and will be forced onto farms. Such an
involuntary or forced resettlement of indigenous people violates
the World Bank's own policy guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter appealing for help from the outside world,
Tibetans in Dulan said: ``There have been many conflicts and many
killings over pasture lands. In view of this, the settlement is
designed to create a dangerous situation in the region. Many of us
will die in the conflicts, and even if we survive, where do we
go?''
</P>
<P>
   The resettlement project also raises vexing questions about
environmental damage. Another concern, voiced in a letter from
members of Congress to World Bank president James Wolfensohn, is
that Dulan County has the highest concentration of prison laborers
in China. As Barney Frank and three colleagues said in their letter
to Wolfensohn, this raises ``the troubling possibility that the
project could, even inadvertently, use forced labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has exerted great pressure on the 24 World Bank
directors who will vote on transferring Chinese farmers to the
Tibetan Plateau. For the sake of persecuted minorities everywhere
and the bank's own reputation, the directors should resist China's
pressure.

A DEALING WITH DAVID DUKE HAUNTS LOUISIANA GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ The tranquillity that descended over
Louisiana politics for the last four years had become positively
Midwestern, and that is not a compliment in the state that invented
Tabasco. It had been years since anyone in office was indicted,
marriage vows were staying intact, and leading officials of the two
parties respected each other so much that they had actually agreed
to a non-aggression pact.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't last, and to the everlasting gratitude of the
state's Democratic Party, it didn't. For the last month, the
familiar rain of scandal has once again fallen on the state
capital, and this time it has drenched the popular Republican
governor, Mike Foster. Suddenly, there is talk that this year's
governor's race might be worth watching, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the change in weather, not surprisingly, is David
Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan wizard whose racist and anti-Semitic
beliefs have made him the bete blanc of state politics. Most
Republican politicians want nothing to do with him, so it came as a
surprise last month when Duke told a grand jury that during the
1995 governor's race Foster had secretly bought his list of
contributors and supporters.
</P>
<P>
   What was even more remarkable was the size of the payment Foster
had made to Duke: $150,000 for a list of 80,000 names, most of
which were available for just a few hundred dollars at the state
Ethics Board for anyone who wanted to find out who had contributed
to Duke's various unsuccessful campaigns. This amount so far
exceeded the standard rate for a mailing list that most people
assumed Foster had actually paid Duke to stay out of the 1995 race
and endorse him, which is one of the subjects the federal grand
jury appears to be investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury could indict Duke for failing to report the
payment on his income tax _ a charge that Duke says he expects _
and the Ethics Board is looking into whether the governor violated
any campaign-finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Foster has denied making a payoff to Duke, insisting that he
simply bought a list of voters that he never used and now regrets
buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't real cool to put out there that you are buying
something from David Duke,'' he said after Duke's grand jury
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, his overture to Duke makes it clear how pervasive
``Duke-ism'' remains in an extremely conservative state, where no
black candidate has ever won statewide office since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you say about Duke, remember that Foster would not
have won without his endorsement,'' said Jeff Crouere, who until
last year was the executive director of the state Republican Party
and who is now the host of a radio talk show in New Orleans, on
which he is sharply critical of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Duke ``has a core base of support that is very loyal, and after
he endorsed Foster in 1995, Foster went from 7 percent in the polls
to 17 percent,'' Crouere said. ``He can never win an election, but
he can determine who does, and that's why Foster paid 25 times what
that list was worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1995, Foster, then a recent convert to the Republican
Party, was not quite as confident running in a traditionally
Democratic state as he is today. Though he did not publicly welcome
Duke's endorsement, he did not disdain it, either, and the boost
helped him make it into the runoff against Cleo Fields, a black
Democrat he easily defeated. Even today, Foster has spurned all
efforts to get him to denounce Duke _ a fact noted with pride by
Duke, who has regularly pointed out that Foster may be the
highest-ranking public official who has not repudiated him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Duke said this week that Foster's money had essentially
financed his autobiography, ``My Awakening,'' which promotes white
supremacist views. Foster, who declined to be interviewed, wrote a
letter published today in The Baton Rouge Advocate in which he said
that buying the list was a mistake and that he disagreed with Duke
``on racial and anti-Semitic issues.'' Nonetheless, Foster wrote,
he does not make a practice of condemning people.
</P>
<P>
   Though Duke has run for office as a Republican, he has relied
more on blue-collar Democratic voters. White-collar Republicans,
who have struggled to eliminate Duke's tarnish on their state
party, were annoyed at Foster for once again connecting them to
such a divisive character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed, absolutely, and I expressed it to him,''
said state Sen. John Dardenne, a Republican floor leader for
Foster. ``I regret that he saw fit to enrich David Duke in any
manner. And it's even more disappointing that after all the reform
we've had in the last four years, this incident raises a question
in people's minds. I just hope it doesn't set back the momentum
that we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Foster seems safe, but his base may be eroding a
bit. After the news of the Duke connection broke, the governor
commissioned a poll from a well-known Baton Rouge firm, Southern
Media and Opinion Research, which showed that his approval rating
had slipped only to 78 percent from 81 percent. Foster retains the
approval of 90 percent of whites _ an astonishingly high number _
while his black support has fallen to 50 percent from 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Jefferson, a Democrat who is Foster's leading
opponent in this fall's governor's race, has drawn some courage
from the approval figures as has the state Democratic Party, which
plans to make the Duke connection a major campaign issue.
Jefferson, who is black, would have a hard enough time running
statewide against a popular governor, but he is likely to be joined
by several other politicians who have sensed blood and are talking
about running.
</P>
<P>
   Foster is doing what he can to court the state's moderate
center. Earlier this week, his forces tried to depose Mike Francis,
the state Republican chairman, who is aligned with the religious
right, stripping away his power to hire, fire and write checks.
(Francis called the move illegal.) The governor also appears to
have backed away from his opposition to gambling, and is trying to
use money from the state's current prosperity and forthcoming
tobacco-settlement windfall to improve in health care and
education.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Foster may hope that voters will thank him for
finally improving the entertainment value of state politics, a
traditional Louisiana diversion. Lance Hill, executive director of
the Southern Institute for Education and Research, a race-relations
center at Tulane University, notes that Louisiana neither expects
nor desires its politicians to be consistent in their ideology or
base of support. In that sense, a moment of political betrayal
might be seen as humanizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a unique political culture here,'' Hill said, ``and
I guess you could say it's come out of remission.''

BEER PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The same lobby that killed a proposal last year to standardize
blood alcohol levels for drunken driving is now trying to keep
underage drinking out of a youth education campaign sponsored by
the nation's drug czar, General Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   The National Beer Wholesalers Association opposes the inclusion
of underage drinking in the $195 million media campaign, claiming
that alcohol is a legal substance and should not be lumped with
marijuana, cocaine, and other illegal drugs. But drinking under age
21 is illegal in every state, and alcohol abuse is far more common
than any other drug among young people.
</P>
<P>
   General McCaffrey himself has said alcohol is ``the biggest drug
abuse problem for adolescents.'' But his office has been strangely
circumspect about adding underage drinking to the campaign, saying
the drug czar's charter limits his mandate to fighting controlled
substances. This is why Congress should favor an amendment
sponsored by Representatives Frank Wolf of Virginia, a Republican,
and Lucille Roybal-Allard of California, a Democrat, that
authorizes McCaffrey to include underage drinking in the education
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The alcohol lobby is terrified of being regulated like that
other legal killer, cigarettes, with warning labels on beer cans
and limits on marketing to teenagers. It points to its voluntary
public service ads that urge responsible drinking. But the alcohol
industry spends nearly $3 billion a year on marketing and
promotion. Against that backdrop, ``responsibility'' needs all the
help it can get.
</P>
<P>
   The facts about underage drinking are sobering. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports 16,100
alcohol-related fatalities in 1997 _ one person killed every 32
minutes. Intoxication rates were highest for the youngest drivers.
Although the universal drinking age of 21 has helped reduce
fatalities, motor vehicle crashes remain the number one cause of
death for teenagers.

   June _ prom season _ is the month when most of these tragic
deaths occur. It would be a good month for Congress to do something
about it.

   Don't Expect Jackpot From Class-Action Stock Suit
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How do I get included in a class-action lawsuit filed against a
company in which I own shares?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you are eligible to participate in the lawsuit, the
lawyers who filed the suit should have contacted you by now. Their
normal procedure is to send a form on which you enumerate your
holdings in the company and the dates you purchased your shares.
You may also be required to submit documentary proof _ for example,
copies of the confirmation slips you received from your broker when
you bought the stock.
</P>
<P>
   If the lawyers did not send you any material, it may be that you
did not buy or own the shares during the period covered by the
lawsuit _ the period in which the alleged financial skulduggery
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your broker whether it has any leftover copies of the notice
the lawyers sent to shareholders _ or perhaps it can simply tell
you who the lawyers are. You also might be able to find this
information by checking various media databases. Try the public
library.
</P>
<P>
   As a fallback, you might want to check the Web site of Milberg
Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach, a San Diego law firm, which is
heavily involved in class-action suits. There is a strong chance
that they are one of the firms involved in yours  &LR; your suit The Web
address is  &LR; www.milberg.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect the lawsuit to make you rich. Individual
shareholders usually get only a pittance from any class-action
settlement. The lawyers, who deduct massive contingency fees from
the settlements, are usually the big winners.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Index Fund Concerns
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have heard that in a market panic, index funds would likely
fare worse than other mutual funds because typically there is
great, built-up, unrealized appreciation, and as investors cash
out, this would build like a tidal wave and potentially wipe out
those slow in exiting. While a panic might have a similar effect on
any fund, index funds typically have more unrealized capital gains.
Index funds seem like a good choice because they perform so much
better than most other funds, but I would like to know the risks.
</P>
<P>
   A: Investors in index funds could indeed have a special problem
in a market crash, but you have the theory slightly muddled.
</P>
<P>
   You have got it correct up to a point: In a crash, index funds _
which normally sell stock only rarely _ might have to liquidate a
lot of holdings in which they have large, unrealized capital gains.
They would have to do this if so many investors flee the funds that
there is not enough cash in the portfolio to redeem the fund
shares.
</P>
<P>
   If the fund manager sells stock at a capital gain, the amount of
the gain must be distributed to the remaining fund shareholders.
Those shareholders would then have to set aside money to pay taxes
on their capital gains. In tranquil markets, when index-fund
shareholders are not cashing in, capital-gains distributions are
minimal or nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Actively managed funds, by contrast, sell stock all the time.
For their shareholders, capital-gains distributions are business as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   So for index-fund shareholders it would be largely a matter of
sticker shock, or culture shock, or whatever you want to call it.
</P>
<P>
   As you indicate, index funds have been a strong investment year
after year. It is even possible that the bulk of their shareholders
will remain faithful in a market panic, and therefore the funds
will not be overwhelmed by redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   So don't let potential tax considerations weigh too heavily. If
you expect a market crash tomorrow, the rational thing would be to
sell your shares today, not sit and ruminate about taxes.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, you can avoid the tax problem if you hold index-fund
shares in a 401(k) plan, an individual retirement account or any
other tax-deferred or tax-free vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Problems With Rollovers
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you please discuss rollovers of 403(b) and 457 funds into
individual retirement accounts. There are millions of folks who
work in the education and nonprofit sectors, which put them into
403(b) plans, or in local and state governments, which put them
into 457 plans. How do they roll these funds into IRAs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bad news for you government employees out there: 457 plans
cannot be rolled over, according to Internal Revenue Service
spokesman Jesse Weller. The reason: ``They're not the same as
qualified retirement plans _ they are deferred-compensation
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   As for 403(b) plans, in general you can roll them over to IRAs
if you leave your job, reach age 591/2 or become disabled. The
maximum amount you can roll over is the amount that would be
taxable if you withdrew the money without rolling it over.
</P>
<P>
   You may already know this, but as with any rollover, the money
must be moved from one account to the other within 60 days.
Furthermore, you will be subject to a 20 percent withholding tax if
the rollover is not done directly _ that is, from institution to
institution. If the money passes through your hands, the tax will
be withheld and you will not get it back until you file your return
for the year.

ADMINISTRATION HOPES TO AVOID SHOWDOWN ON STEEL QUOTAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert explanation of how trade rules would be violated in
graf 5, to insert words ``cold-rolled'' in graf 9, and to update
and insert a statement from Gore in grafs 15, 16 and 17)  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Mont.)  (lh) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Senate poised to act Tuesday on a bill
that would sharply restrict the amount of imported steel in the
United States, the Clinton administration took a series of actions
Monday to convince Congress that it could protect the jobs of
American steelworkers with far less drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   The actions, announced by Commerce Secretary William Daley,
appeared intended to stem the number of Democrats in the Senate
planning to vote for the steel quota bill, which would roll exports
back to 1997 levels and has been pressed by steelworkers and steel
manufacturers. The bill, which the administration denounces as
protectionist, has already sailed through the House by a vote of
289-141.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest in a series of confrontations over trade policy
with his own party, President Clinton has promised to veto the
measure if it reaches his desk. But the White House desperately
wants to avoid that step because it would cause create enormous
political problems for Vice President Al Gore, who is trying to
court the votes of the United Steelworkers of America, the AFL-CIO
and voters in steelmaking states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is agony for Gore,'' one senior administration official
said, ``because it puts him in the position of angering supporters
who he needs very much. And the Republicans know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House argues _ and many trade experts agree _ that the
bill's import quotas would violate global trade treaties. It is
usually a violation of trade rules to set a unilateral limit on
many imported goods, and the United States has protested similar
actions by other countries.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt it would be struck down if challenged
before the World Trade Organization _ though the legal arguments
could drag on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding a violation of America's trade commitments, however,
carried little sway with the House in March. And those arguments
may not overcome tremendous political pressure in the Senate.
Hundreds of steelworkers plan to raise the level of pressure on
Tuesday morning with a noisy arrival outside the Senate on a fleet
of Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a convergence of agendas here,'' said Gary Hubbard,
the spokesman for the United Steelworkers. ``This is an emergency
restraint measure to save high-wage jobs. And there are Republicans
who want to see Vice President Gore associated with the White House
position against this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley, in the midst of a day of lobbying against the bill on
Capitol Hill, announced Monday that as an alternative he was
beginning an investigation into whether cold-rolled steel from
Japan, China, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand and other nations
was being ``dumped'' in the United States at unfairly low prices.
Four of those nations received financial bailouts led by the United
States over the last two years and have been exporting aggressively
_ in part on the advice of the International Monetary Fund _ to get
back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   But that export strategy has already begun to cost a relatively
modest number of jobs in smaller steelmaking factories nationwide.
Daley argued Monday that there were ways of dealing with that job
loss short of sending a message that the United States is closing
its doors to imports _ and opening the way to retaliation against
American goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of message would we send if we _ as the world's
leading economic power, riding the wave of an historic sustained
expansion and the one bright spot during the long months of
economic turmoil elsewhere in the world _ now send the message that
we intend to close our borders and violate international trading
rules?'' Daley asked Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As in many trade arguments, the White House has lost more
Democrats than Republicans. Chief among them is Sen. Jay
Rockefeller of West Virginia, whose state includes Weirton Steel
and other large steel manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing very well putting the votes together,''
Rockefeller said Monday afternoon. ``The White House is clearly
scared about how far this has come, because this has everything to
do with Gore's future.''
</P>
<P>
   But another Democratic senator, Max Baucus of Montana, said in
an interview that he had decided to vote against the measure
because ``it would encourage other countries to retaliate against
us, in agriculture and other areas.'' Baucus' state is a leading
exporter of farm goods, an easy target for retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said little about the bill, apparently seeking not to
anger union members and others whose support he seeks. But Monday
evening, pressed to state a position on the bill, his office issued
a brief statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president believes legislated quotas on steel imports
are unnecessary. The administration has turned back the import
surge through tough enforcement of U.S. trade laws, and we will
continue working with the steel industry and unions on eliminating
unfair trade practices, on early-warning mechanisms, on companies
damaged by the import surge and other measures to deal with excess
capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   But clearly Gore's hope is to avoid a vote altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That was the strategy in announcing new dumping investigations
Monday, involving cold-rolled steel, which is used to make cars,
bicycles and household appliances. But it will take months before
the Commerce Department issues a final ruling on whether dumping is
taking place. In the far more lucrative area of hot-rolled steel,
the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission just
approved punitive tariffs against Japan, South Korea and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argues that its administrative actions have
worked and that steel imports are subsiding. But the unions and
steelmakers interpret the data very differently, and they have
demanded protection.
</P>
<P>
   It could turn out to be expensive protection. A study published
by the Institute for International Economics earlier this month
estimates that restricting steel imports will send prices up
significantly for cars, construction materials and other steel
products. The report, prepared by Gary Hufbauer and Erika Wada,
estimated that the bill would preserve the jobs of 1,700 workers at
an annual cost to consumers of $800,000 a worker.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would not ban all steel imports, but rather they would
limit them to 1997 levels. The administration argues that steel
imports are falling back to that level anyway. ``If that is the
case,'' said Rockefeller, ``then the penalties won't go into effect
and they have nothing to worry about.''

LEONARD P. STAVISKY, STATE SENATOR, DIES AT 73 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leonard Price Stavisky of Queens, a longtime
Democratic legislator in Albany and an outspoken advocate of state
support for public education, died Saturday in a hospital in
Queens. He was 73 and lived in the Whitestone section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a cerebral hemorrhage, said
Sen. Martin Connor, the leader of the Democratic minority in the
State Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A former professor of history and government who held
administrative office at various colleges for decades, Stavisky
made education the keynote of his 34 years in the New York State
Assembly and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an expert in the field of education,'' Connor said,
``and fought tirelessly throughout his entire legislative career to
insure that all of New York's children are provided with the
opportunity to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his peers, Stavisky, who represented the Flushing section
of Queens, was respected as an expert on educational affairs and
policies. In the Assembly, he served as chairman of the Education
Committee for eight years and was a sponsor of the Stavisky-Goodman
bill of 1975, which sought to prevent New York City's public
schools from facing steep budget cuts in the wake of the city's
fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the minority in the Senate, he was far less
influential, but he continued to speak out about education. He was
a champion of bilingual education, and conducted hearings on
matters like tuitions, student-aid programs and the fiscal autonomy
of the State University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, his committee assignments included memberships on
the education, higher education, civil service and pensions
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Stavisky was born in the Bronx and graduated from City
College of New York in 1945. He received a Master of Arts degree
from Columbia University in 1946 and topped off his studies with a
Columbia doctorate in political science in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   From 1945 to 1979 he taught history and political science and
worked as an administrator at Colgate University, Long Island
University, State University of New York, City University of New
York, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University at
Blacksburg, Va., among others. After that, until 1990, he was an
adjunct professor of political science at Columbia's School of
International and Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Stavisky earned his political spurs on the New York City Council
from 1954 to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the State Assembly in 1966 and advanced to the
Senate in 1983, first representing the old 12th District and, since
1994, the 16th as a Democrat-Liberal. In the 1970s he was a
commissioner of the New York State Charter Revision Commission for
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   He was a past commissioner of the Education Commission of the
States, formed as an interstate liaison among governors, state
legislators and educators. As such, he had a role in programs to
improve educational practices in the United States and conduct
training seminars for lawmakers and the makers of educational
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Stavisky is survived by his wife of 35 years, Toby Goldhaar
Stavisky; and a son, Evan M., of Queens.

 _ SF CHRON  
 The Check's on the Net  
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Computer-based bill paying is one of the most intriguing and least
noticed developments in consumer finance.
<P>
   Payment via the Internet has been widely available for a couple
of years, and for nearly two decades it has been possible to pay
your bills electronically with special software and direct modem
hookups to your bank.
</P>
<P>
   Online bill paying typically is available for a fee of $5 to $7
per month _ probably less than the amount you would save on &LR;   &LR; pay
in postage stamps and checks. If your bank or other institution
considers you a valued customer, you might get it for free.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ease and convenience, only about 3 percent of the
nation's 100 million U.S.  &LR; households have tried it.
</P>
<P>
   The service has been slow to catch on partly because it hasn't
been aggressively promoted, partly because most consumers are slow
to change, and partly because many people are afraid to transmit
confidential financial data over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is another large stumbling block as well: Online bill
paying is still in a rudimentary stage. While you can pay just
about any bill online, scarcely any bills are delivered online.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, consumers who opt for online payments still
receive the bulk of their bills as hard copy through the mail. They
must spend time keying the biller's name and address and the amount
of the payment into templates on whatever Web site they are using.
</P>
<P>
   But online bill paying may be on the brink of a major
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The computer world's proverbial 800-pound gorilla, Microsoft,
has created a joint venture with Citigroup and First Data that
plans to greatly expand the use of bill presentment _ the jargon
term for online delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado-based venture, called TransPoint, will act as a
billing agent _ an intermediary between billers and financial
institutions _ providing the software and technology support needed
to keep billing data flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Although billers must pay TransPoint to put their bills online,
the fees will amount to far less than the $1.25 to $1.50 average it
costs to prepare and mail a hard-copy bill. Ralph Young, executive
vice president of TransPoint, says billers will be charged ``less
than 35 cents per bill.''
</P>
<P>
   TransPoint moved out of the pilot development stage last month.
It now has five billers _ Consolidated Edison of New York, GTE, the
Orange County Register, PECO Energy and Xerox _ displaying bills
and receiving payments through their Web sites. Several dozen more
should emerge from pilot before long.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, TransPoint will connect billers with Web portals
and the Web sites of financial institutions, so consumers can get
their bills off the Web site of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's ``basically endless financial resources'' should
give online bill paying the much-needed marketing and advertising
that it has lacked until now, predicts Paul Hughes, an analyst with
the Yankee Group consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   TransPoint's principal rival, Georgia's CheckFree Holdings, has
been in the automated-payments business in one form or another for
18 years, and has a considerable head start.
</P>
<P>
   Its CheckFree E-Bill electronic billing program, launched in
March 1997, was the first Internet billing service. It is used by
51 billers _ among them Chase Mortgage, MCI WorldCom and the Small
Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bills from CheckFree's clients are being delivered
electronically to the Web sites of 20 banks and other financial
institutions _ including San Francisco's Charles Schwab brokerage
firm. Customers of those institutions can receive their bills and
pay them at the Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Solomon, a Schwab vice president, says the online bill
paying service is available to customers of the firm who open
special accounts for this purpose. (You can't make bill payments
out of the cash balances in your regular Schwab brokerage account.)
</P>
<P>
   The fee ranges from upwards of $6.95 per month for some
customers to nothing at all for those who maintain large account
balances or make a lot of securities trades through Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal world, consumers would be able to view and pay all
their bills electronically at a single Web site _ their bank,
broker or favorite Web portal (such as Yahoo or America Online),
for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend seamlessness _ the ability to take care of
multiple needs in one place,'' says Robert Sterling, an analyst
with Jupiter Communications, a New York consulting firm. `'People
don't want to bounce all over the Internet to pay their bills. They
want one place, with one password.''
</P>
<P>
   Something approaching seamlessness could happen before the end
of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   However, getting all bills from all billers online at all
financial-institution Web sites might prove impractical, if only
because there are a lot of billers that may never find it
worthwhile to sign up for electronic billing.
</P>
<P>
   Americans receive an estimated 18 billion bills per year, and
that includes bills from the gardener, the piano teacher and the
local delicatessen. These small fry may never make it to
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the problem of technophobia. Almost daily, the
media chronicles the exploits of computer hackers who invade
private databases or who infect computer systems with data-munching
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these systems have a lot of built-in security
technology,'' says Michael Killen, president of Killen &AMP;
Associates, a market-research firm in Palo Alto. ``I tend to think
that it is pretty good security.''
</P>
<P>
   Killen acknowledges that ``everything can be broken into,'' but
he adds: `'I don't see it as a big problem. I'm personally not
going to get upset if someone figures out how much I am paying
Pacific Bell. I don't know what economic benefit it is to someone
to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a consumer summons the interest and courage to try
electronic bill paying, he is apt to be hooked for good, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that they never go back to paper,'' remarks
Laurinda Wilson, a CheckFree spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Those who pay their bills online swear by it. ``I'd recommend it
for anybody,'' says Rosemary Bedene, a Los Molinos (Tehama County)
homemaker and Wells Fargo customer who for more than a year has
paid her 10 bills per month through the bank's Internet Web site.
``I hate paperwork, and this is just so much easier.''

 MCI Gives Ricochet a Big Boost  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Metricom Inc., the Los Gatos company that makes the popular
Ricochet wireless modem, got a $600 million boost yesterday from
MCI WorldCom and billionaire investor Paul Allen.
<P>
   MCI WorldCom and Allen's firm, Vulcan Ventures, said they will
invest $300 million each to fund a nationwide rollout of Ricochet _
a wireless modem that allows consumers to access the Internet from
laptop computers and other mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
   Metricom currently  &LR; offers the Ricochet service to mobile
workers in the Bay Area, Washington, D.C. and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   With this funding, the company plans to launch its wireless
modem service in 46 cities by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The $600 million investment will also allow Metricom to increase
boost  &LR; the speed of Ricochet to 128 kilobits per second, which is
about as fast as a dedicated ISDN line. Right now, Ricochet
accesses the Internet at roughly 28 kbps _ about the same as an
ordinary dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   The faster Ricochet will also allow users to access the Internet
while traveling at speeds up to 70 miles an hour _ something that
will come in handy for commuters who use BART and other public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area should get the faster Ricochet modem by the middle
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our target is the business professional and mobile
professionals who need to have their desktop information available
for them in other cities,'' said John Wernke, senior vice president
of marketing and sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metricom's technology is excellent ...but the one thing
they've missed to date is having a 50 city top metropolitan
statistical area footprint and this is what they will get with MCI
WorldCom,'' said Andrew Cole, head of the wireless practice at
Renaissance Worldwide, a Boston consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to investing in the company, MCI plans to resell a
co-branded wireless modem to its wide customer base under the
Ricochet and MCI names.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, MCI and Vulcan will buy 60 million new Metricom
convertible preferred shares, priced at $10 per share. Allen, a
longtime investor in Metricom, matched MCI's $300 million
investment so he could retain a 49 percent stake in the company,
Wernke said. MCI will own 38 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Metricom has been testing its faster wireless modem service and
expects to launch it in mid-2000 in the Bay Area, as well as in Los
Angeles, San Diego, New York and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company does  &LR; still faces face some  &LR; challenges. In
order to offer service in any city, Metricom must sign agreements
with municipalities for access to rights-of-way so it can install
antennas for its system. That could take time, Wernke said, so the
company is not committed to a start-date for any city.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said Metricom must gain that access quickly because it will
face competition from other wireless Internet devices, such as cell
phones, which can surf the Web and are expected to hit the mass
market in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the barriers for Metricom is their getting
rights-of-way and access. That is the key thing and it's filled
with bureaucracy,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Wernke said the company is positive it can secure the agreements
it needs.

MICROSOFT'S FINAL WITNESS STUMBLES A BIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp.'s final witness testified Monday
that in his view of the world, the very actions that landed the
company in court on antitrust charges have greatly benefited
consumers, computer manufacturers and every company that is doing
business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the last witness in
the long-running antitrust trial, and the company is trying to use
his testimony to rebut each of the principal charges the government
has raised in the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee offered arguments and evidence making the case that
nothing Microsoft had done had harmed consumers _ an important
factor in the case. But in at least one instance, his strategy
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the case without a
jury, sat impassively through the morning as Michael Lacovara, a
Microsoft lawyer, tossed easy questions at the witness. But the
judge stepped in with a telling question as Schmalensee was trying
to demonstrate that Microsoft had not engaged in predatory conduct
by including a Web browser with the Windows operating system at no
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee was standing before a sketch board presenting
theoretical examples of predatory and nonpredatory conduct. In his
first case, a company sold a product below cost, driving another
company out of business. That, Schmalensee said, was clearly
predatory.
</P>
<P>
   He had moved on to a more benevolent example, when Jackson
interrupted him, speaking up for the first time Monday to ask:
``Why isn't what Microsoft did in this case a more egregious
example of case one?''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee stumbled for a moment but then said Microsoft gained
many other benefits from including a Web browser in Windows. Later
he pointed out that in classic economic theory, a predator lowers
prices until the competition is weakened or destroyed and then
raises them to recoup his lost profits.
</P>
<P>
   But, he noted, Microsoft had not raised prices, even though
government witnesses have said the competition, Netscape
Communications Corp., has been so greatly weakened that the browser
war is over.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Lacovara said: ``He's the final witness,
testifying about the whole scope of the case. And our strategy is
trying to find out what is on the judge's mind so we can address
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Schmalensee took the stand, in January, David
Boies, the government's lead attorney, suggested that he was
Microsoft's ``house economist'' and compared his testimony in this
case with seemingly contradictory arguments he made in the past.
The effect was to suggest that Schmalensee offered whatever opinion
suited the need of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lacovara tried to turn the tables. He offered as
evidence a fat binder of comments, articles and opinions that the
government's economist, Franklin Fisher, another MIT professor, had
offered over the years. And Lacovara intended to have Schmalensee
help him demonstrate that they included contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   As Fisher sat just behind him in the audience, Boies objected,
complaining that it was not fair to try to impeach Fisher's
testimony after he had already left the stand. The judge appeared
ready to agree when Lacovara backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Schmalensee quarreled with Fisher's testimony that an
economist ought to consider a company's intent when determining
whether it was engaging in predatory conduct. That was not proper,
he suggested. But Jackson told him, ``You know, judging intent is
what we do every day. Juries are called on to do it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, however, the judge seemed to help Lacovara.
The lawyer was trying to make the case that America Online, now
that it has bought the Netscape company, was in a position to
challenge Microsoft's dominance in browser and operating system
software, despite America Online's protestations to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   He showed a document to the judge and the witness that America
Online had insisted be held under seal. But the judge summarily
unsealed it, saying there was no justification for the
classification.
</P>
<P>
   The document was the text of America Online's presentation to
the board of directors for the November meeting at which the board
would vote to approve the purchase. And it showed that the company
planned to aggressively promote Netscape _ even though, in public,
America Online executives have said the Netscape business is close
to dead.
</P>
<P>
   The company was ``willing to spend up to $10 per download'' of
Netscape ``via promotions, contests, incentives and advertising to
stimulate downloads,'' the report to the board said.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara asserted that America Online would be unlikely to spend
that money on a product that was dead.

JUAN DEL REGATO, 90, AN EXPERT IN RADIATION THERAPY FOR CANCER
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Juan A. del Regato, a pioneer in using radiation therapy to
treat cancer, died on June 12 at Munson Medical Center in Traverse
City, Mich. He was 90 and lived in a retirement home in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Del Regato, who had been visiting his daughters in Michigan,
died after surgery for injuries suffered in a recent fall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, del Regato helped start the first training center in
the United States dedicated to therapeutic radiology, the Penrose
Cancer Hospital in Colorado Springs. And in the late 1960s, he
helped coordinate one of the first cooperative clinical trials
evaluating the effectiveness of radiation therapy in treating
inoperable prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few American physicians have had as great an impact on the
development of a medical specialty as did Dr. del Regato,'' said a
former student of his, Dr. J. Frank Wilson, chairman of the
department of oncology at the Medical College of Wisconsin in
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Del Regato was born on March 1, 1909, in Camaguey, Cuba. He
attended medical school at the University of Havana and received
his medical degree from the University of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   While in France, he also studied at the Radium Institute and the
Fondation Curie, and he invented the ``del Regato localizer,'' a
device that facilitated the delivery of effective radiation
treatments in the early era of radiation oncology.
</P>
<P>
   Del Regato came to the United States in 1939 and worked briefly
at the Chicago Tumor Institute. He then left for Washington and the
private practice of Dr. Edwin Merritt, a leading radiologist. He
later became a research fellow at the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1943, he took a position as a radiation oncologist at
the Ellis Fischel State Cancer Hospital in Columbia, Mo. In 1948,
though, Spencer Penrose, a wealthy philanthropist, visited the
hospital and decided to build a similar one in Colorado Springs.
Del Regato became director of that institution, the Penrose Cancer
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Later he left Colorado for Tampa, accepting the University of
South Florida's offer of a professorship in radiology and serving
as a consultant in radiation therapy at the James A. Haley V.A.
Medical Center there.
</P>
<P>
   Del Regato wrote ``Cancer: Diagnosis, Treatment and Prognosis''
(C.V. Mosby Co., 1947) with Dr. Lauren Ackerman, and he published
many research articles.
</P>
<P>
   Among his honors were the Gold Medal from the American College
of Radiology in 1968 and the Bruning-haus Prize from the French
Academy of Medicine in 1979. In 1980, he was one of five American
radiation oncologists to receive the Beclere Medal from the Centre
Antoine Beclere in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Del Regato was also the founder of the American Club of
Therapeutic Radiologists, now called the American Society for
Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Inez, died this year. He is survived by a son, Dr.
John del Regato of Indianapolis; two daughters, Ann Jaeger of Lake
Ann, Mich., and Juanita Peters of West Bloomfield, Mich., and five
grandchildren.

SAMPRAS BRUSHES ASIDE THE FIRST-ROUND JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The defending champion was worried about
feeling like one, but only the grass was vulnerable on opening day
at Wimbledon. Pete Sampras' early round jitters proved fleeting,
and the rest of the seeded shoo-ins stomped and skidded their way
into the second round without any unmanageable slip-ups.
</P>
<P>
   All except for third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the 1999
Australian Open champion, whose temporary ascension to the No. 1
ranking this spring in the middle of a six-event losing streak
seems to have left him of two minds about his prospects as a world
beater. The mercurial Russian surrendered the first and fourth sets
Monday and had to save a match point held by Sweden's Magnus
Larsson in the fifth set before their match was suspended by
darkness with nobody ahead, 6-7 (4-7), 7-5, 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 5-5.
Kafelnikov had just broken Larsson when play was halted.
</P>
<P>
   The baseline slugfest on Center Court between Jennifer Capriati
and Anke Huber, whose 7-5, 3-0 lead became imperiled after she took
a second-set tumble, arrived at a cliffhanger similar to that
experienced by Kafelnikov and Larsson. The failing light and
increasingly slick conditions forced the suspension of their
spirited confrontation at 7-5, 3-6, 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   While revelers marked the summer solstice at Stonehenge, here at
the All England Club, where the tennis fanatics braved an autumnal
chill and slept overnight on the sidewalks to guarantee their spots
in the queue, Sampras, the seven-time champion Steffi Graf and the
host nation's twin terrors, Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, marked
their return to the epicenter of the tennis cosmos with convincing
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras struck a dozen aces, faced no break-point threats and
made 26 winning forays to the net in decimating Scott Draper, 6-3,
6-4, 6-4. Though Draper, the 75th-ranked Australian, possessed
enough grass-court gumption to grab last year's title at Queen's
Club, Sampras won that tournament this year and Monday improved his
latest streak of grass-court invincibility to 13 matches. ``I got
the early round jitters, but once I got out there, I felt like I
was back home on that court,'' said Sampras, who ended things with
a minor miracle, a lunging backhand half-volley that spurted over
the net like a piece of popcorn and fell to earth just in time to
glance off the sideline. ``I can do that sometimes; it's not that
complicated,'' deadpanned Sampras, a stickler for on-court
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   The grass was slippery from the start on Center Court, but
Sampras navigated the lawn with a familiarity that explained why he
has captured 5 of his 11 Grand Slam titles here. With six more
victories, he can win a third straight Wimbledon and move into a
tie with Roy Emerson for the career record in Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras wants to use this event as a turning point in a year
blemished by mediocrity. After passing up the Australian Open, he
succumbed in the second round at the French Open, the only Grand
Slam event he has yet to win, and until his triumph at Queen's Club
two weeks ago, Sampras had not reached a final or won a title since
October. Not good numbers for the man who longs to be known as the
greatest player of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to put things behind you, look at Wimbledon as my
next goal, come over to London early, play Queen's, and really try
to be positive and turn my year around here,'' he said. ``I did it
last year and hopefully I can do it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope springs evergreen, too, for Graf, who won the French Open
three weeks ago. She is wondering if she can reprise that trick on
grass and, at the creaky tennis age of 30, win her 23d Grand Slam
title at Wimbledon, the event she, like Sampras, sinks into like an
easy chair. Monday the second-seeded German disposed of the Slovak
Ludmila Cervanova, 6-1, 6-4. ``I still feel pretty good out there
for my age,'' Graf said.
</P>
<P>
   So does 19-year-old Venus Williams, who chastised herself for
overconfidence after her 6-1, 7-5 defeat of Miriam Oremans. ``At
least I don't have a problem to be underconfident,'' Williams said.
``I'm a little overconfident, which can be highly dangerous also.''
</P>
<P>
   Another teen-ager who has made a staple of confidence, the
18-year-old Anna Kournikova, moved ahead with a 7-6 (7-2), 4-6, 6-2
defeat of Barbara Schwartz, the Austrian qualifier who spoiled
Venus Williams' French Open and was originally scheduled to meet
Serena Williams in this round.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's hankering for its first home-grown champion (or in the
Canadian transplant Rusedski's case, its first adopted champion) in
63 years received a double boost. The sixth-seeded Henman ousted
Arnaud Di Pasquale, 6-4, 6-0, 3-6, 7-6 (7-1), and the ninth-seeded
Rusedski defeated the Australian Jason Stoltenberg, a semifinalist
three years ago, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2. Australia's seventh-seeded Mark
Philippoussis, who received a four-spot seeding upgrade, showed the
seeding committee its confidence in him was not misplaced: with 28
aces, he subdued Belgium's Xavier Malisse, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-3,
6-4.

KAMAL EDDIN HUSSEIN, 77, FIGURE IN COUP AGAINST FAROUK IN 1952 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kamal Eddin Hussein, a crusty Egyptian army officer who helped
to overthrow King Farouk of Egypt in 1952, became a vice president
of Egypt and then clashed with two presidents, died on Saturday. He
was 77.
</P>
<P>
   He had liver cancer, his family said, according to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was a leading member of the group Free Officers, headed
by Gamal Abdel Nasser, who led Egypt's revolution in 1952. In
addition to overthrowing Farouk, who went into exile, the
revolution put an end to Egypt's monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Nasser became president, with Hussein as a member of
his original Revolutionary Council. Hussein went on to hold
important Cabinet posts under Nasser besides serving as a vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   But he came to oppose many aspects of Nasser's leadership,
including his authoritarian mode of governing and what has been
called his favoritism, which Hussein said led Egypt to lose in the
1967 Middle East war. After falling out with Nasser in the 1960s,
he was put under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   He was released early in the presidency of Anwar el-Sadat, who
succeeded Nasser in 1970. After food riots in Egypt, in 1977, when
Hussein was an independent member of the Egyptian People's
Assembly, he publicly accused Sadat of ``punishing the Egyptian
people'' instead of ``punishing your government for dereliction.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein made his accusation in a telegram to Egyptian
newspapers, also deploring as unconstitutional certain punitive
law-and-order measures that Sadat had announced in a television
address. Hussein called the measures and ``an insult to the
intelligence of the Egyptian people.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Assembly then expelled him, by a vote of 281 to 28,
for having voiced ``insulting'' views of Sadat. Hussein was the
first National Assembly member to be ousted since 1971, when a
number of members had been expelled for plotting to overthrow
Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein is survived by three sons and several grandchildren.

STERN PUTS NBA'S PROBLEMS ON THE TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He discussed plummeting television ratings,
unprepared teen-agers continuing their migration to the National
Basketball Association and, finally, the dreadful quality of play
in this lockout-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   Given the transitional state of the game, NBA Commissioner David
Stern played defense Monday as well as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, making his annual championship-series address, prompted
serious discussion about instituting a minimum-age requirement _
perhaps age 20, he said _ for players' draft eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Stern also said a special committee would convene Tuesday to
discuss possible rule changes designed to address stagnant offenses
and low-scoring games. Yet faced with a major ratings drop from
last season's finals between the Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz _
a drop of 39 percent for the first two games of the Knicks-Spurs
finals _ the commissioner did not sound overly concerned about the
future of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is an absence of the world's most famous
person, no less that world's most famous athlete, Michael Jordan,''
said Stern, who appeared with the deputy commissioner Russ Granik
at a midtown Manhattan hotel. ``But I think we're seeing the
creation in front of our eyes of the kinds of teams'' that will
become known.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the state of the league is one that finds us very
optimistic about the future,'' Stern added.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA set new standards for modern offensive futility this
season, with teams averaging a paltry 91.6 points, down 4 points
from last season and the lowest average since the inception of the
shot clock in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   This season teams shot 43.7 percent from the field. Ten years
ago, teams shot nearly 48 percent from the field and averaged 109.2
points. Only one team this season, the Sacramento Kings, averaged
more than 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-member special committee, made up of coaches, former
players, team executives and owners, will spend all day Tuesday
discussing possible rule changes for next season. The four major
areas include:
</P>
<P>
   _Officiating. ``How the game is called and particularly whether
the players become too physical or not, and what can be done about
that in terms of officiating,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   _Dimensions of the key. The dimensions of the court will not
change, but proposals to widen the lane will be given
consideration. Previous proposals have been rejected twice in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   _Clocks. Saying the 24-second shot clock would probably not
change, Granik nonetheless said it would be discussed. ``All the
issues _ the 24-second clock, bringing the ball up court in 10
seconds and what to do with the ball when the clock goes out of
bounds, things like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _Defensive guidelines. Two sets of rule changes the past four
years involving hand-checking and illegal defenses have done little
to improve the game's offensive quality. Of all the issues
discussed, this one may elicit the most drastic change _ including
the possibility of allowing zone defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The board of governors will receive the committee's
recommendations and vote on possible rules changes in August for
use in the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a serious mandate for moving ahead if we come up with
a sort of overwhelming sentiment out of this committee to just
let's get it done,'' Stern said. ``The board indicated to us that
they don't need a lot of debate, that if we are comfortable with
the results of the committee, then we should just go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern would not go so far as to attribute the lack of scoring
and skill level to the proliferation of young players entering the
league, but added, ``I am prepared to go forward and try to put
some rule in that would have the effect of raising the beginning
age at which players come into the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what age that would be, Stern replied, ``That is a
discussion. We can pick a number. I have shown around 20. I asked
Isiah Thomas how he was when he left Indiana after his second year.
He said it was his birthday almost; he was 20. I don't profess to
have any magic number, but that seems to be a fair enough issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said such a rule might affect 1 out of 100 potential
players in the league. ``The better view is we should have some
rule that keeps people sort of growing, maturing and developing
their skills for an additional period of time,'' Stern said. ``But
there is no great answer here.''
</P>
<P>
   The feasibility of an age requirement would hinge on several
other factors, including an agreement with the players association
and perhaps forming an NBA-subsidized minor league or entering into
a minor league agreement with the Continental Basketball
Association. Stern said league officials had discussed both
options.
</P>
<P>
   To appease college players who enter the draft early for
financial reasons, the league has proposed $20,000 loans or
subsidies for those players deemed of NBA caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said the National Collegiate Athletic Association had yet
to get back to the league about the proposal, which he said was
made several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hope Stern professed, a concerned Spanish journalist
seemed to sum up the proceedings well Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very worried right now because I have seen in San
Antonio, especially the second game,'' the journalist said to Stern
in halting English. ``I think it is my particular opinion the worst
game that I have seen in the finals. It was boring for me. I am
worried about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about physical game, great defense, but I have
seen only a few highlight plays and a lot of mistakes. You can win
the NBA finals scoring 70, 75 points. This is only a few points.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a smiling veneer, Stern replied, ``Well, let me say, I
want you not to despair.''

DOLORES JIMENEZ ALCANTARA, SPANISH FLAMENCO SINGER, 90 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID _ Dolores Jimenez Alcantara, a blind singer who was one
of Spain's leading flamenco artists, died on June 14 in a hospital
in Malaga. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage Ms. Jimenez wore dark glasses and typically performed
while standing, supporting herself with one hand placed on the back
of a chair. She performed publicly until the late 1980s under the
stage name La Nina de la Puebla (The Girl From the Village) and was
best known for her rendition of ``Los Campanilleros'' (``The Bell
Ringers''), a popular Spanish ballad about children's folkloric
choirs.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a singing barber from Seville province, Ms.
Jimenez was born on July 28, 1908, in La Puebla de Cazalla, which
gave rise to her nickname. She had an eye infection when very
young, and improper treatment caused permanent blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jimenez began musical instruction at age 8 when her family
moved to Madrid. She warmed gradually to flamenco, received her
first contract at 14 and gained a following after a successful
performance at a festival in Moron de la Frontera, southeast of
Seville, at 20.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, she made her debut in Seville and a year later, in
Madrid. She took ``Los Campanilleros'' and moved it definitively
into the realm of flamenco.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow flamenco singer, Manuel Torre, earlier had converted
the same spirited ballad into a melancholy flamenco song. But Ms.
Jimenez's version was lighter, peppery, more accessible yet still
mournful. The song became her trademark, and she performed it with
traveling troupes known as flamenco operas, which appeared in
bullrings and theaters.
</P>
<P>
   She spent decades fashioning countless other songs in a style
that flamenco experts often described as dulce, or sweet. She was
comfortable performing much of the flamenco repertory and its
multiple forms of haunting melodies and staccato laments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934 she married a fellow singer, Lucas Soto Martin, known
professionally as Luquitas de Marchena. He died in 1965. Their five
children _ two of whom, Adelfa and Pepe, are professional flamenco
performers _ survive her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jimenez had been scheduled to receive a gold medal from King
Juan Carlos I for Merit in Fine Arts. The authorities will now
deliver the award to her family.

PHILADELPHIANS LOBBY FOR A MURAL OF THEIR `NATIVE STOOGE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo of Lyla Budnick with photographs of two Stooges,
her brother, Louis Feinberg, and Moe Howard, is being sent to NYT
photo clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Lyla Budnick remembers her brother Louis Feinberg
as a warm and caring family man, hardly the frizzy-haired,
wild-eyed rapscallion the world knew as Larry Fine, one of the most
famous of the Three Stooges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wasn't working, he was a different man,'' said Mrs.
Budnick, 78. ``He was 18 years older than me, so when I was born,
he was already an adult. After my father died, when I was 5, Larry
and his wife, Mabel, raised me. He really was my father. Being a
Stooge was his persona. It really wasn't him.''
</P>
<P>
   As the least antic of the Stooges in their heyday, the 1930s and
1940s, Larry was often an easy target for head bops and eye pokes
from his partners, Curly Howard and Moe Howard, who were brothers.
But Larry was no less popular among millions of fans who grew up
``nyuk, nyuk, nyuking'' their way into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Larry, who was born in a South Philadelphia row house in 1902,
died in 1975, five years after a stroke had ended his acting
career. He was buried in a simple grave near his Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Budnick, who still lives in South Philadelphia with her
husband, Nathan, 82, a sound man on Stooge movie sets, said it
always saddened her that Larry's hometown never honored him as a
native son, beyond a small plaque in Jon's Bar and Grill, which was
once a jewelry store the Feinbergs ran out of the first floor of
their house.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, she said, she had asked local officials to have
the building designated as an historic site, always to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   But all that could change soon. Early this year, Stooge-mania
hit Philadelphia like a custard pie, leading to the possibility
that a large mural of Larry might be painted on a wall overlooking
the row house. More than 1,800 murals decorate the city as part of
a municipally financed arts program to encourage neighborhood
pride.
</P>
<P>
   After The Philadelphia Daily News ran a picture of Frank Sinatra
on its front page on March 23, suggesting that the city paint a
mural to honor him, The Philadelphia Weekly newspaper protested,
inasmuch as Sinatra had been born in Hoboken, N.J. Under a parody
of The Daily News front page, with Larry's head replacing Frank's,
The Weekly pointed out: ``Frank Sinatra ain't from Philadelphia.
Why not create a mural for a true native son?''
</P>
<P>
   Little did Weekly editors know at the time that David McShane, a
local artist and Stooge fan who had painted murals for the city,
had been clamoring to do a likeness of Larry. Already adorning city
walls were murals honoring other Philadelphians, like Paul Robeson,
Mario Lanza, Patti LaBelle and Julius Erving. So why not a Stooge?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tim Whitaker's phones did not stop ringing. He is The
Weekly's editor, who said he had planned the Larry parody ``to poke
fun'' at The Daily News. Little did he know the joke would send
local Stooge fans into a Curly-spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'd say hello, and all I heard at the other end was,
`Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk,''' Whitaker said, reciting a line Curly used to
razz Larry and Moe. ``People loved the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Golden, director of the city's mural arts program, which
receives hundreds of requests for money each year, said that the
cost of a Larry mural could reach $25,000 but that the project
could get under way with $12,000. The city has agreed to finance
about 25 percent of the total expense, Ms. Golden said, but the
rest would have to come from private donations.
</P>
<P>
   The Weekly has led the drive, donating the first $1,000 and
arranging for a series of fund-raisers. The first was held Monday
night at The Inn Philadelphia, a Center City restaurant, where more
than 100 Stooge fans donated $10 each to meet Mrs. Budnick, who
still bears a striking resemblance to her brother, watch Three
Stooges movies, trade head bops and admire McShane's draft of Larry
looking as if Moe is about to gouge his eyes out.
</P>
<P>
   Frank E. Reighter, who stocks shelves at a local supermarket,
took up a corner of the restaurant to sell Stooge memorabilia,
including posters, ties, dolls and glossy photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great idea,'' he said of the Larry mural.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to Larry's role as a punching bag for Curly and Moe, he
added: ``As a native, he is a perfect typical type of
Philadelphian, always fighting the next level of people above him.
Stocking shelves at night, I think about this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Budnick, who knew the other Stooges well and became
something of an expert on the six men who played Stooges, said
Curly's famous ``Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk'' came about as a mistake. ``He
could never remember his lines,'' she said. ``Whenever he forget
them, he made noises.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she never cared for Moe, calling him ``a miserable,
mean-spirited man.'' Curly, she said, was ``1,000 percent
different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Curly,'' Mrs. Budnick said, ``what you saw was what he
was. He was a goofball, but a great goofball.''

POST-JORDAN RATINGS IN A PRIME-TIME TORPOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three weeks ago, NBC predicted that the absence of
Michael Jordan would cause ratings for the National Basketball
Association finals to slide by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Think again: they have tumbled 39 percent in Games 1 and 2. The
9.6 Nielsen rating for Game 2 is the second lowest in NBC's
nine-season NBA reign, the lowest being a 7.8 for Game 5 of 1994
Knicks-Houston finals when viewers were distracted by coverage on
other networks of O.J. Simpson's slow-speed Bronco ride through Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The new reality for NBC is that after a decade of Jordan as
high-rated prime-time entertainment, San Antonio versus New York is
boring America. The ratings would smell no better if they were
doused with Michael Jordan Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a MASH unit, with the Knicks' injuries to Patrick
Ewing and Larry Johnson, and it's been an uncompetitive series,''
said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports. ``The 39 percent
drop is in line with people thinking it will be a four-game sweep.
I always think in terms of six-game series, although I'd agree that
it'll probably take a miracle to get to six.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a reality check for NBC and the NBA _ a ``building
year,'' Ebersol said. In six of the first eight years NBC carried
the NBA, the Chicago Bulls won six titles. Last year, the
Chicago-Utah finals, Jordan's finale, soared to a league-record
18.7.
</P>
<P>
   To Ebersol, a permanent reduction of 15 percent from last year's
peak would be the best that the league can expect in future
post-Jordan finals. That would mean satisfaction is attainable at
15.9; the two non-Jordan finals in the last eight years rated no
higher than a 13.9, for Houston-Orlando in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The reduced NBA ratings may please Major League Baseball, which
saw World Series beaten three times in the ratings since 1993 by
the NBA finals, including last year (18.7 to 14.1). But no World
Series game has rated below an 11.3 during the same period that NBC
has carried the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   More new reality: what if San Antonio, the smallest-market team
to play for the title since Fort Wayne lost to Philadelphia in
1956, makes the finals for years to come? Would a more-familiar,
improving Spurs team lure viewers back?
</P>
<P>
   Well, NBC hopes that it got something out of this season, like
playoff exposure to Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, Kevin Garnett and
Jason Williams, whose teams will be seen far more in the regular
season than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a powerhouse San Antonio team rolling annually into the
finals is only peachy if Duncan &AMP; Co. become nationally popular and
casual fans want to see the Twin Towers wreak havoc. A dandier
reality would have the Los Angeles Lakers awaken to the rewards of
unselfish basketball under Coach Phil Jackson and tame the Spurs
for Western Conference supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   And in that future, wouldn't it be nice if teams could shoot
better? Bob Costas, who is calling the finals for NBC, said he was
not bored by the low scoring, but added: ``I recognize that this
isn't as free-flowing as it could be. The league wouldn't have a
committee meeting on this tomorrow if it were an ideal
representative of the game.'' &QL;

HONG KONG DECIDES ON A WAY TO SELL BIG PORTFOLIO OF SHARES

<P>
   HONG KONG _ For sale: $25-billion worth of shares in blue-chip
companies of Hong Kong. Seller seeks individual or institutional
buyers. Few other details available. Call Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months after plunging into the stock market to fend off what
it called an improper speculative attack, the government here said
Monday that it would sell off most of its enormous portfolio of
shares by creating a mutual fund that tracks the Hang Seng stock
index.
</P>
<P>
   The Exchange Fund Ltd., a company the government had set up to
manage the shares, said it would seek a listing for the mutual fund
in four to five months, depending on market conditions. Government
officials said they would sell the portfolio incrementally, but
they offered little in the way of details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary objective remains the disposal of the shares in
the Hong Kong equity portfolio in an orderly manner without
disrupting the market,'' said Ti-Liang Yang, the chairman of the
Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder relief was evident as the market reached its highest
close since Oct. 13, 1997. The Hang Seng index surged 585.96
points, or 4.37 percent, to close at 13,994.23.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hong Kong's buying spree last August, some investors had
worried that the government would not be able to dispose of the
shares without selling them on the open market, which could have
hammered their price and shaken the confidence of investors in this
already fragile enclave.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a portfolio of this size, even in a benign
market you need to think about how to create demand,'' said Richard
Margolis, first vice president of equity research at Merrill Lynch
&AMP; Co. here. ``This kind of structure prevents large amounts of
stock flooding the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials did not say how large the fund would be.
But Yang said it ``should be of a size that would facilitate
participation by the retail public in Hong Kong.'' He also
predicted that it would be attractive to foreign investors who are
interested in the Hong Kong market.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was not a surprise. Senior officials had hinted
for weeks that they would soon introduce a mechanism to sell off
the portfolio. In April, the Exchange Fund retained Goldman, Sachs;
Jardine Fleming, and ING Barings to devise proposals for disposing
of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement is another milestone in what has become an
unexpectedly profitable foray by the Hong Kong government.
Investors were stunned last summer when the traditionally hands-off
government began buying shares on a huge scale to prop up the Hang
Seng.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to foil hedge funds and other speculators, whom the
government accused of improperly manipulating the market by selling
short Hong Kong shares while simultaneously betting against the
Hong Kong dollar. The government's counterattack drove out the
speculators but left it holding $15-billion worth of stock at the
nadir of the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The move engendered lacerating criticism from economists,
including Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate, who said that Hong
Kong had soiled its reputation as the freest market in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   By buying at the bottom, though, the government was able to ride
the rebound in the Asian markets. After months of steady gains, its
portfolio has grown in value to $25.8 billion (U.S.) from $15.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here have resisted gloating over their good fortune.
But they note with satisfaction that currency traders like George
Soros have not been seen in the Hong Kong market since the
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In strictly monetary terms, it is a huge home run,'' said Mac
Overton, a financial consultant at Sun Hung Kai Trading Co. Ltd., a
local property developer. ``From a philosophical point of view, it
is a dangerous precedent to set. It becomes a credibility problem
at some point for Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolis agreed that it was difficult to judge Hong Kong's
intervention purely on its short-term profits. ``From a financial
perspective, it will be deemed a success,'' he said. ``But there
are other factors. And when the postscript is written, these
factors will mitigate the gains. The government did do violence to
its free-market reputation.''

   NEW YORK _ When President Clinton and other politicians come to
New York City to raise campaign money _ which they do frequently _
they tend to favor fund-raisers at elegant restaurants like Le
Cirque 2000, or special performances of crowd-pleasing Broadway
shows like ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   But next week, in one of the more unusual fund-raisers in recent
years, the president will join Democratic congressional leaders at
a $1-million fund-raiser built around a performance of ``The Iceman
Cometh,'' the grim if engrossing play by Eugene O'Neill that runs
close to 270 minutes. Notwithstanding its strong reviews and
sellout run, ``Iceman'' is not quite the
leave-your-troubles-outside evening most political donors expect
when they pay a minimum of $1,000 for a pair of theater tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Harry's bar,'' Kevin Spacey, the star of the
production, said Monday afternoon as he led Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the House Democratic leader, onto the stage in the dark
and empty theater. Gephardt, who was in town to do some advance
work on next week's event at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, and
Spacey settled into two rickety chairs. Behind them were half-empty
liquor bottles, not the usual backdrop favored by politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey, who described himself as an avid Democrat, suggested the
fund-raising event, which will help the party raise money for the
2000 congressional races. The special performance will begin at 3
p.m. on Monday, so as to end in time for a political dinner, which
will also include Clinton, at the Supper Club. Democrats said it
was not yet clear if Mrs. Clinton will come.
</P>
<P>
   All of which, though, begs the question: Is the notably
garrulous Clinton going to be able to sit through four and a half
hours of, well, other people talking?
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt straightened up in the president's defense. ``Look, no
one thought anybody would sit for four hours,'' Gephardt said. He
then amended his remarks. ``Over four hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey took over. ``You know, there's a kind of perception, they
hear, `Oh, four hours,''' he said. ``But in fact, there isn't a
person that I've ever spoken to who didn't think this play went by
like that.'' Spacey snapped his fingers.

EDITORIAL: DANGEROUS ESCALATION IN KASHMIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have long engaged in cycles of confrontation
and rapprochement, with war and threats of war followed by pledges
of cooperation. Now the latest promises of peace have yielded to
the worst fighting in decades. The provocation is the presence of
well-armed Islamic militants holding mountainous positions on
Indian territory, seeking independence for Kashmir, India's only
Muslim-dominated state. India, which has tried bombing and shelling
to dislodge them, is rightly demanding that Pakistan help in
removing the guerrillas as the first step toward defusing the
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their
independence and partition in 1947, two on Kashmiri territory. Past
uprisings in Kashmir have drawn in hundreds of thousands of Indian
troops and cost thousands of lives. India says that Pakistan has
aided the insurgents. Pakistan says it has merely supplied ``moral
support'' to indigenous ``freedom fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, however, just as the heavy snows were melting, a
guerrilla force seized positions in the mountains. It appears that
they could not have done so without Pakistani help. Pakistani
shells are being fired on a crucial mountain road, closing it to
civilian trucks that normally supply the area to the east.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, India has been lamentably slow in recognizing
that it could not crush the Muslim rebellion in Kashmir by force
alone. But the intervention of militants this spring has been
widely condemned as a provocation by Pakistan. Some say that the
Pakistani army engineered this crisis because it was unhappy with
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's earlier decision to meet India's
prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, in Lahore. Even Indian
officials have wondered whether the operation was carried out by
the government or rogue elements of the army. Sharif thus faces a
major challenge in demonstrating that he, not the military, runs
the country.
</P>
<P>
   India has so far shown commendable restraint, but warns that
time is running out. If the militants are not removed, India says,
it fears being unable to get supplies to places that need them
before the next snowfall in August. Frustrated by its failure to
dislodge the militants, India might be tempted to send troops into
Pakistani territory. That would be a serious escalation, all the
more worrisome because both countries possess nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   No rapprochement can occur without some sort of a political
resolution of Kashmir's status. Any such solution would probably
have to be a creative mixture of self-government for the Kashmiris
with some kind of political association with both India and perhaps
Pakistan. But no solution can be achieved under the threat of
military action. The next step must come from Pakistan, which
should encourage or perhaps even force the militants from their
incursion into Indian territory. Then talks can commence on steps
to improve relations and eventually settle the status of Kashmir.

LOBBYISTS ARE A LODE FOR THE LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is running as a
Washington outsider, but that is not stopping a galaxy of
Washington insiders from contributing more than $1 million to his
presidential campaign at a fund-raiser here on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail earlier this month, Bush criticized the
capital's deeply divisive culture, saying that as president he
would try to ``change the tone of Washington, D.C.'' On another
occasion, he derided the ``zero-sum politics'' of the capital.
``It's an `I win, you lose'-type attitude,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Washington Hilton on Tuesday night, the Texas
governor, a nonlawyer who wore black ostrich-leather cowboy boots
while campaigning in Iowa, will be eagerly embraced by hundreds of
lawyers and lobbyists wearing Gucci loafers. The list of 425
co-chairmen and vice chairmen for the Bush reception reads like a
who's-who of Republican lobbyists from K Street, this city's
corridor of power and influence.
</P>
<P>
   While he is in the capital, Bush will also meet with more than
100 members of Congress who have endorsed him, some of whom are
also raising money for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has essentially given the signal to the establishment here:
You can come on board, but you are not going to shape this
candidacy,'' said Wayne Berman, a Republican fund-raiser and a
lobbyist with Park Strategies, whose clients include PaineWebber
and Philip Morris. ``Bush has said: `I'm shaping it from the
outside.' The establishment here doesn't necessarily like it,''
Berman said, ``but Bush has been able to persuade them.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Vice President Al Gore, the early front-runner for the
Democratic presidential nomination, Bush is relying on lobbyists
and lawyers here to help raise the vast sums of money needed to run
for president. But the vice president has much deeper ties to K
Street, having dealt with and raised money from Washington
lobbyists since his election to the Senate in 1984. Many of Gore's
former aides and campaign advisers are prominent lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance of lawyers and lobbyists is distinctly important
in this early stage of presidential fund-raising, when there is a
premium on collecting $1,000 contributions, the maximum that
individuals can give to a candidate. Lobbying groups and law firms
bundle contributions from their employees, and lawyers and
lobbyists often tap their roster of clients for donations. Most
major lobbying firms have hedged their bets by having partners
raise money for different candidates. That way, no matter who wins,
the firms will have helped the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore have raised far more money from lawyers and
lobbyists than from any other profession, according to a study by
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group
here. Gore raised $1.4 million from lawyers in the first three
months of 1999 and Bush $750,000. The figures include contributions
from lawyers and lobbyists, their spouses and employees of their
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In building a national fund-raising network that is the envy of
the rest of the Republican field, Bush cultivated many top
Republican lobbyists from K Street, asking them to raise $100,000
each and to recruit others. Among the most influential lobbyists
who are helping Bush are Peter Terpeluk Jr., a managing partner at
the American Continental Group; former Rep. Thomas Loeffler, a
Texas Republican and lobbyist; and Haley Barbour, the former
Republican National Committee chairman who is now a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour said he met Bush in 1987 when he worked on the
presidential campaign of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to know him then, and I expect a whole lot of people got
to know him then or got to know him after he was elected
governor,'' Barbour said. ``He became their friend, and then he
earned their support for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is also assisted by a prominent Democrat, James Langdon
Jr., a partner at the law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP;
Feld. Langdon has been a close friend of Bush for years; he has
agreed to recruit 100 lawyers and lobbyists here to raise $25,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has another distinct advantage. Many contributors attending
Tuesday night's reception are former members of his father's
administration and the Reagan administration, including C. Boyden
Gray, the White House counsel for President George Bush; James
Miller III, the budget director under President Reagan; Nick Calio,
assistant to the president for legislative affairs in the Bush
administration, and Andrew Card Jr., the transportation secretary
in the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   After the reception, Bush will spend the remainder of the week
raising money in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than Bush, Gore is perceived by the public as someone
with very close ties to the Washington establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The influential Democratic lobbyists Peter Knight, Peter Kelly
and Daniel Dutko lead Gore's push for dollars. Already, Gore has
had at least 10 lobbyists raise at least $50,000 each for his
campaign. While helping Gore, Knight, for example, is lobbying on
behalf of Bell Atlantic and Lockheed Martin, though he has said he
will take a leave of absence from his firm later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are helping us throughout the country,'' said Roger
Salazar, a spokesman for the Gore campaign. ``The vice president
has many friends in Washington, too, and it is not unusual to have
people here who are helping him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic and Republican candidates are also being helped
by lawyers and lobbyists, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.;
Elizabeth Dole, a former president of the American Red Cross and a
Cabinet secretary in both the Reagan and Bush administrations;
Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee; Bill Bradley,
the former senator from New Jersey who is Gore's main rival for the
Democratic nomination, and former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has attracted the help of several lobbyists with clients
who have interests before the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee, which he leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not say lobbyists are the foundation of John McCain's
support,'' said Howard Opinsky, the spokesman for McCain's
campaign. Opinsky added that McCain had accepted contributions from
people on both sides of numerous issues before the committee, and
that the senator's votes were based solely on ``what is best for
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole has been assisted in her fund-raising efforts by her
husband, former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, and several other
influential lawyers and lobbyists, including Wayne Valis of Valis &AMP;
Associates and James Burnley IV, a partner in the Washington office
of Winson &AMP; Strawn, a law firm based in Chicago.

SURVEY FINDS CEO'S LUKEWARM ON ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next phase of a major multiyear communications effort to
promote the importance of advertising is getting under way _ and
not a moment too soon, judging by the results of a national survey
of top corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, commissioned by the American Advertising Federation,
shows surprisingly lukewarm support for advertising as a tool to
help companies grow. Even as the executives acknowledged that they
considered advertising a valuable sales stimulus, only 43.1 percent
of the survey respondents said that advertising would gain
importance for them over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked whether they were satisfied with their companies'
advertising efforts, just 6.8 percent replied that they were very
satisfied _ a fraction of the 69.8 percent declaring themselves
generally satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at companies with big ad budgets were much more
favorably disposed to advertising than were those with less to
spend. And large majorities of the respondents said they agreed
that advertising was a worthwhile long-term investment and could
help lift a company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the implications of the survey are clear. If chief
executives, chief marketing officers and other top managers are
skeptical about the effectiveness of advertising, they are more
likely to cut ad budgets in bad times and not increase them
significantly in good times.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, three out of four survey respondents said they expected
their companies' ad budgets to grow over the next three years, but
only by a modest average of 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What all that tells me is that these executives are not
enthusiastic about advertising,'' said Wally Snyder, president and
chief executive of the advertising federation in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an optimistic person,'' he added, ``I think the survey
leads us to a real opportunity for enhancing advertising's
positioning with top executives. There's an upside for us in
convincing them that advertising has much to offer strategically.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted in March by Erdos &AMP; Morgan among senior
managers at U.S. companies. The results were released last week at
the 1999 American Advertising Conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The results show that advertising decision makers at companies
``are not strongly in favor of advertising, but they're not
strongly against it, either,'' said David Park, president at DDB
Los Angeles, part of the DDB Worldwide Communications Group unit of
Omnicom Group, which took part in analyzing the survey results.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the lack of fervor for advertising among
respondents, Park said, was a frustration that while they were
defining advertising more broadly, they perceived that agencies
were still defining it in terms of traditional measures like
television commercials and print ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of advertising needs to be redefined as a strategic
partner, and broadened,'' Park said, to include measures like
direct marketing, Internet advertising, sales promotion and other
so-called integrated marketing communications.
</P>
<P>
   Only then, he added, can advertising ``assert its role at the
enterprise table, as it were, in terms of convincing executives of
the contributions it can make to business success.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Plans for the survey were announced at the federation's
conference last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason for the survey was our belief that too many CEOs
still think of advertising as something further down on the food
chain than it should be, an expense instead of an investment,''
said Lou Schultz, vice chairman at Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich.,
a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos., who made a presentation on the
survey at this year's conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually came out a little more positively than we had
anticipated,'' he added, referring to the survey results. ``Still,
there's a lot of work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the federation also announced plans to undertake a
campaign aimed at corporate executives to demonstrate the
importance of advertising. Now, as the survey results underscore
the need for such a campaign, the federation is selecting an agency
to handle the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, chosen by a steering committee after a review, is
Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, a creatively focused shop owned by
Interpublic that works for clients including Harley-Davidson,
Korbel champagne and Schwinn bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A campaign directed to CEOs would have a good chance, if it's
the right campaign, to elevate advertising in their minds as a
strategic discipline to help them,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gratified that the survey demonstrates that people are
pretty happy with advertising,'' he added, ``and we have high marks
generally. On the other hand, advertising is not getting mentioned
as much as it ought to in regard to sales and marketing goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder was referring to a survey question that asked the
executives to rank the strategic importance of various company
departments in meeting sales and marketing goals. Advertising
ranked sixth out of seven, ahead only of the legal department and
badly trailing operations like product development, strategic
planning and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael Lynch is providing its creative services for the
campaign pro bono. The federation will pay the production costs and
is asking magazines and newspapers to donate the equivalent of $12
million worth of space to run the advertisements, which will carry
the theme ``Advertising: A new brand of business.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Snyder said, publications including Adweek, Forbes, The
New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have agreed ``to run at
least some of the ads.''
</P>
<P>
   The federation, which represents advertisers, agencies, media
companies, local advertising associations and college students
studying advertising, is not alone in sponsoring efforts to beat
the drum for drum-beating advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Advertising Agencies, for example,
is conducting interviews with corporate leaders who are true
believers in the power of brand-building advertising. The
association, based in New York, plans to distribute tapes of the
interviews, with executives like Herbert D. Kelleher, the chairman,
president and chief executive of Southwest Airlines Co.

RIPKEN, BOGGS, GWYNN APPROACH 3,000 HITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a special place. Few baseball players have come this way
before, and certainly never like this.
</P>
<P>
   This is where immortals have gone and only a select few will go
again.
</P>
<P>
   This is the plateau of 3,000 hits. In more than 125 years of
baseball, it's a peak reached by only 21 players.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, three players _ Tampa Bay's Wade Boggs,
Baltimore's Cal Ripken Jr. and San Diego's Tony Gwynn _ have the
opportunity to reach 3,000 career hits in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   Five times a pair of players has reached the milestone in a
single year but never a trio. A year after the baseball world was
electrified by the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home run chase, three
storied players chase a new history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be just great for baseball,'' said Angels coach
Larry Bowa. ``It seems like every year now, something is coming up
that continues to solidify the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs, Ripken and Gwynn have haunted pitchers since 1982. They
have already accomplished enough to make Cooperstown a given _
Ripken with his consecutive-games record, Boggs with his five
batting titles, Gwynn with his NL record-tying eight hitting
crowns. All have won Gold Gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as they've done individually, they now have an
opportunity to accomplish something together, something never
before accomplished in their sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it more special,'' Gwynn said. ``If something
happens for the first time, it's a special thing. So I'm pulling
like heck for Boggs and Ripken to get there, too, because we'll go
down in history as the first trio to get 3,000 hits in the same
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, I want to get there first.'' &QL; 
__ History awaits
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn is first up. He enters tonight's three-game series at
Dodger Stadium 18 hits shy of 3,000. Boggs is 41 hits back and
Ripken 68.
</P>
<P>
   All three, however, have been plagued by injuries this season
and spent uncharacteristic time on the disabled list. Gwynn is
bothered by a sore left calf and sat out Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh. He is expected back in the lineup tonight but is
growing eager to put the record behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to get it so I can say, `OK, I did it, I
fulfilled my own dream. That's what I wanted to do. I did it,' ''
Gwynn said. ``Now I can go on and enjoy it. I've got to get it
done. I'm starting to put some pressure on myself, because tomorrow
is not promised to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The closer it gets, the more it weighs on their minds.
Particularly for Boggs and Gwynn, whose line-drive style has been
compared for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help ... thinking about it,'' Boggs said. ``I'm so
close. I didn't really think much of it when I was at 2,600, 2,700,
but being (41) away . . . it's right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, of course, has already achieved a milestone most thought
unreachable. When he asked to sit out the Orioles' final home game
last season, it ended his record 2,632 consecutive-games streak. He
knows all about pressure and rising media crowds. And he uses the
same almost boring one-day-at-a-time routine that served him so
well in his consecutive-games streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to do too much thinking about it,'' Ripken said. ``I
mean, in this society we can measure success in many different
ways. As a hitter, 3,000 hits represents success in a career, not
necessarily in one season. So when you think in those terms, it
would be nice to be able to get to that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I try not to cloud my approach or change my focus in any
way by thinking too much about it. If it happens, it would be
great. But if for some reason it doesn't, that would be OK, too. I
know that I've had a very fortunate, long, fulfilling career.'' &QL; 
__ Drive to succeed
</P>
<P>
   Texas closer John Wetteland, then with the Dodgers, remembers
coming to the ballpark early one afternoon in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got dressed and just wanted to sit in the dugout when no one
was there and just mellow out,'' Wetteland said. ``I walked out and
there's Tony. He's hitting. There's just him, a coach and one
person in the outfield shagging in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him stroke a couple of line drives right to
left-center field. That's all he was doing. He would hit one up the
middle and get upset. And I'm thinking, there's probably no one
ever in the game that's been as good as him taking a ball to
left-center field and here he is, spending the entire early BP _
just him and two coaches _ working on that very thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowa was Gywnn's manaer in San Diego for two years and has been
the Angels third-base coach for the past three seasons. And if
Ripken has more power and Gwynn more speed, Bowa has nonetheless
observed something identical in all three hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that goes unnoticed with all of them is how hard
they work,'' Bowa said. ``Gywnn hits extra every day. Obviously he
has God-given talent, but he just keeps trying to improve on his
previous night's work. His work ethic is unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is probably as prepared as any player I've ever been
around. When I was managing in San Diego, if we didn't know the guy
pitching, Tony would say, `That's OK, I have some tape on him.' He
has a satellite dish and gets every single game that's played in
the big leagues and tapes it. If a new kid is coming up, he knows
what he throws. On the road, he takes his VCR with him and
constantly studies his at-bats. People don't understand that he
works, man, he works hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, who managed in Baltimore for two
seasons, saw the same work ethic in Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody worked harder at conditioning than Ripken _ nobody,''
Johnson said. ``You can't do what he did. It's a lot of sweat
before and after games, as well as during.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland and Boggs were teammates for two seasons with the
Yankees; Wetteland used to talk hitting with the third baseman _
``he's like a computer chip'' _ while marveling at how Boggs
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the hardest workers I've ever seen,'' Wetteland
said. ``Everything revolves around him getting his job done that
night. His appetite knows no bounds in preparing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although all three have been hitting stars since Little League,
they have never taken their individual talents lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have some guys born with a gift and take it for granted,''
said veteran pitcher Mike Morgan, who has faced Gwynn, Boggs and
Ripken in his 17-year career. ``Think they have it mastered, think
they're better than the game. Well, you never master this business.
You'll always be learning. These guys don't take anything for
granted. They're working year 'round.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't go home in the winter and lay on the couch.
Those are the kind of guys you read about going home and they have
batting cages there, they've got video cameras, they've got the tee
set up. They work.'' &QL; 
__ A style of their own
</P>
<P>
   Boggs and Gwynn are about quick hands, using the entire field,
reacting quickly to each pitch, putting the bat on the ball. They
seldom strike out. Their approach and stance never seem to change.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs said he hasn't tinkered with his swing since he worked it
out with his father, Winfield, as a boy growing up in Tampa, Fla.
``I've had the same swing since I was in Little League,'' Boggs
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ripken is not afraid to experiment, Gwynn, too, has been
consistent at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rip changes his way, his approach, it seems like every year,''
Gwynn said. ``I'm pretty consistent with my approach, where I
stand, what bat I use, everything. I try to do the same thing every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, of course, used his speed early in his career. He has
more than 300 career stolen bases; Ripken and Boggs have not
totaled 40 steals in their CAREERS. But although Gwynn and Boggs
have career averages more than 50 points higher than Ripken's,
neither can approach his power numbers. Ripken is nearing 400
career home runs and 1,600 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken said that as a youngster, he used to try and hit like
each member of Cincinnati's Big Red Machine, like each of the
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's just enjoying the flavor of hitting, trying to put
things together myself,'' Ripken said. ``I always continued to be
that kind of hitter. When I got into the minor leagues, the big
leagues, I was not afraid to experiment a little bit, try to find
that individual feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting comes from the inside. It's a feel. You actually have
a natural talent to do it. If you apply certain fundamentals, you
revisit the feeling of how you hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson saw Ripken make that visit many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boggs and Gwynn, that's like falling out of bed for those two
guys,'' Johnson said. ``They use the whole field, neither
especially noted for their power. Gwynn is like Leonardo da Vinci
up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Ripken getting 3,000 hits _ basically a pull hitter,
playing the most demanding position at shortstop _ is more
remarkable than Tony and Wade. It's almost like Cal did it with his
mind. He willed it to happen, which he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels veteran right-hander Tim Belcher said there is something
similar in the mental approach of all three hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have just a great understanding of the game, the
strike zone and great confidence in their ability,'' Belcher said.
``You see all those things from the mound, too. There are certain
hitters that get in, and you know they have a plan, they have
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just never see any hint of panic in their eyes or their
body language. Whether it's 2-0 or 0-2, their demeanor never
changes. Whereas, some guys you can see light up when it gets to
2-0 and wilt when it gets to 0-2. You're not going to see those
three guys do that. You don't get 3,000 hits doing that. They're
never out of an at-bat, never giving in.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said that when he was with the Dodgers, pitching coach
Ron Perranoski wouldn't pretend there was a best way to pitch to
Gwynn when going over the hitters before a series with the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd get to Gwynn, and sometimes he'd just go, `Tony Gwynn
batting third. Good luck,' '' Belcher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal is probably the best bad-ball hitter of the three. I mean,
if he's in the swing mode and sees the ball well, he can hit one
eye-high or shoelace-high. A very good down hitter, very good
low-ball hitter. The other two guys don't swing at stuff like that.
If they do, they foul it off. How many times have you seen Wade
Boggs just foul off balls _ flick, flick, flick _ until you make a
mistake.'' &QL; 
__ The moment at hand
</P>
<P>
   Ripken has already lived some special moments. Breaking Gehrig's
record in '95, and then again when he sat down 501 games later.
</P>
<P>
   His career will always be defined by his consecutive-games
streak, not his 3,000 hits. For Gwynn and Boggs, however, the day
they reach 3,000 will be a crowning moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know that when I get there, I'm going to be able to
take a deep breath and say, `God, I finally got to where I thought
I could get to,' '' Gwynn said. ``Anything that happens after that
is going to be gravy.''

BUSH APPEALS TO SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES IN SOUTH CAROLINA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds: Toddy Atwater is cq) 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ The battle for the linchpin South Carolina
Republican presidential primary opened Monday as Texas Gov. George
W. Bush promised social conservatives he will promote
sexual-abstinence education if he becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, GOP candidate John McCain, a U.S. senator from
Arizona, tried to chip away at the impression that Bush is the
inevitable Republican nominee. McCain released a list of South
Carolina supporters, including eight state legislators who he said
had defected from the Bush camp. The eight had signed a letter in
February urging Bush to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishing signalled the importance of South Carolina, the
first major primary after Iowa and New Hampshire and a harbinger of
the critical Southern primaries a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has the backing of South Carolina's lieutenant
governor and House speaker, called the state ``friendly political
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know I've got to earn the support and earn the votes of
the folks of South Carolina,'' Bush said. ``It's impossible to get
the Republican nomination without carrying this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is on a five-day campaign and fund-raising swing that will
take him from South Carolina to Richmond, Va., Washington, D.C.,
Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, Bush will hold a fund-raiser and will
meet privately with his supporters in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   There was no public announcement of the meeting, but word was
spread by personal letter from Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``will be joined by 20-plus senators who have endorsed his
candidacy and who are hosting a meeting,'' Coverdell wrote in a
letter sent to all GOP senators except rival White House contenders
McCain and Bob Smith, R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has been pivotal in at least three recent
Republican presidential nominating contests.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush all but put the 1988 Republican nomination
out of reach of Sen. Bob Dole and evangelist Pat Robertson by
winning South Carolina. And Dole revived his struggling 1996
campaign with a victory here over Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   But former Texas Gov. John Connally had the endorsement of every
major Republican in the state except one in 1980, when Ronald
Reagan won the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina, since 1980, has always decided who the nominee
is going to be because of the momentum the winner gets from here,''
said J. Sam Daniels, executive director of the South Carolina
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   In past elections, the greatest threat to establishment
Republican candidates in this state has come from candidates who
appeal to social and religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush appealed to those voters Monday by laying out a
three-point promise to promote abstinence education, one of the
first specific plans of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised to provide as much federal funding for abstinence
education as is now spent on teen contraception programs, about
$135 million a year. He said he wants to guarantee that faith-based
organizations can obtain federal funds for abstinence training
without compromising their religious mission. He also wants the
General Accounting Office to study the effectiveness of federally
funded sex-education programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must encourage our children to make the healthy choice of
abstinence,'' Bush said after attending an abstinence-training
program in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also fired back at Democrats who have tried to portray him
as soft on gun control. President Clinton this week said Bush did
not do enough to influence passage of federal gun control
legislation, and last week Vice President Al Gore criticized Bush
for signing a bill prohibiting most lawsuits against gun
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the bill would allow the Texas attorney general to sue
gun manufacturers if it was in the public interest. Bush said
Democrats want to turn public policy over to trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in subcontracting out public policy to trial
lawyers,'' Bush said. ``This (Clinton) administration ... does
subcontract out a lot of public policy to some of their biggest
financial backers, the trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a Vietnam combat veteran who spent five years as a
prisoner of war, is practically abandoning any campaign in Iowa for
more emphasis on South Carolina because of the state's large
military population. The state is home to the Citadel military
school.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his strategy is to become a viable alternative for the
Republican nomination if Bush's campaign should falter.
</P>
<P>
   McCain released a list of legislative supporters, which included
eight of the 58 who signed a letter urging Bush to run for
president. One of the 58 had earlier signed on to the Elizabeth
Dole campaign.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Pro Tem Terry Haskins said the endorsements showed
that McCain is gaining momentum on Bush in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suddenly became clear that the Republican nomination should
be earned, not inherited,'' Haskins said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker David Wilkins, a Bush backer, called the
defections ``much ado about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is the majority of people who signed on are still
with, strong with Gov. Bush, and that's more than all the other
candidates put together,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across South Carolina, the average citizen likes him (Bush),
and they will like him even more when they get to know him
better,'' Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler added.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 enthusiastic Republicans turned out to see Bush at the
Sunset Restaurant in West Columbia, including the mother of late
Republican political consultant Lee Atwater. The younger Bush was
Atwater's assistant when Atwater ran George Bush's 1988
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got South Carolina,'' Toddy Atwater said of the Texas
governor. ``He learned under the best, under Lee. He learned a lot
from his dad, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the restaurant said they were inclined toward Bush
because they liked his father's presidency and because they like
what they have heard about his leadership in Texas. Several said
they also liked either Dole or McCain as second choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happens to him, Elizabeth would be the next best
choice,'' said Marian Rozier, 80, of Camden, S.C. ``She energizes
the women. Of course, he does too because of his looks.''

 &HT;    State officials expect early challenge to school voucher law
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Gov. Jeb Bush fulfilled his most important
campaign promise Monday, signing into law the nation's first
statewide program to offer private-school vouchers to parents of
children in public schools deemed failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the fun begins, when we roll up our sleeves and see that
children learn. And when they don't we're not going to blame them
anymore,'' Bush said at a ceremony at a Tallahassee middle school,
the same place he announced his ``A-plus'' education plan last
August.
</P>
<P>
   The first vouchers could be issued in a matter of weeks for some
800 children at two Pensacola elementary schools _ the only two
schools to have made the state's current ``critically
low-performing schools'' list two years running and, under the new
law, therefore eligible for vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the children is 5-year-old Jessica Merkman, who would have
started kindergarten at A.A. Dixon Elementary on July 1. ``I don't
want her there,'' said her mother, hotel clerk Dermita Merkman, 26,
who is glad for the voucher that will let her daughter attend a
Montessori school or one of three Catholic schools that have agreed
to accept the voucher _ worth about $3,500 _ as full payment of
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Merkman is one of 120 Pensacola parents so far who have
expressed interest in a voucher _ if the plan's opponents aren't
able to block it in court first.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's teachers unions, their traditional allies like the
Parent-Teacher Association and the American Civil Liberties Union
plan to file a lawsuit in Tallahassee this morning challenging the
constitutionality of allowing tax money to be spent at religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``A scheme to divert public money to religious institutions is
in blatant violation of the Florida Constitution,'' said Leon
Russell, president of the Florida NAACP and among 17 groups that
call themselves the Florida Coalition for Public Education.
</P>
<P>
   Lining up against them are Floridians for School Choice, the
group financed by corporate executives that helped Bush lobby for
the schools law, and the Washingtonbased Institute for Justice, a
non-profit group that helps defend voucher plans in courts all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, this program will not proceed unmolested,'' said Clint
Bolick, the group's litigation director. ``We expect to see a
challenge before the ink is dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, all children in grades three through 10 would
be tested annually, with schools receiving letter grades based on
the scores. Schools receiving an ``F'' grade in two of any four
years would have to offer vouchers to all parents of its students.
</P>
<P>
   The broad testing plan won't begin for two more years, but in
the interim, schools could be subject to those measures if they
fail the existing batteries of tests now given to fourth, eighth,
and tenth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   No Treasure Coast schools are eligible for vouchers this year.
In Martin County, no school has had more than one year of failing
scores and any St. Lucie schools that might have been on the
borderline saved themselves this year with adequate scores in
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he only wants schools to serve all their students,
including those traditionally written off, such as those in poor
inner cities or areas with large number of seasonal migrants. He
would prefer that schools meet ever-higher standards and therefore
never be eligible for vouchers, or, as he calls them, ``opportunity
scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is zero,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, that he plans to fight the lawsuit vigorously,
with his legal staff cooperating with lawyers in Attorney General
Bob Butterworth's office, as well as with those from outside groups
like the Institute for Justice.

AMERICA ONLINE TO PUT $1.5 BILLION INTO A HUGHES ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ America Online will invest $1.5 billion in Hughes
Electronics as part of a wide-ranging alliance that will allow the
online service to offer high-speed Internet access using the Hughes
satellite data delivery system, the companies said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which is a broadening of a deal announced
by the companies a month ago, Hughes will market AOL TV, an
interactive television service, to the 7 million subscribers of its
DirecTV satellite television service. In turn, America Online will
market DirecTV and DirecPC, Hughes' high-speed, satellite-based
Internet access service, to its 16 million American subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Hughes said Monday that it expects a loss of 20 to
25 cents in the second quarter because it will take a pretax charge
of $100 million to $130 million resulting from problems
manufacturing certain satellites. Analysts had expected a loss of 4
cents a share. The buyer of the satellites, Panamsat, a
communications company that is 81 percent owned by Hughes, had said
last month that its earnings and revenue would be reduced by the
manufacturing delays.
</P>
<P>
   For America Online, the largest provider of Internet access, the
Hughes deal offers a line of defense against cable television
companies. Cable is a natural channel for high-speed data delivery,
via modems. But cable companies want to offer their own versions of
news and entertainment, portal sites that will compete with America
Online. The Hughes deal follows several similar agreements by
America Online with phone companies involving digital subscriber
lines, a high-speed phone-line alternative to cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether cable companies should be forced to open
their lines to other Internet service providers has become a heated
one around the country. In Los Angeles, three of the five members
of a commission formed by Mayor Richard Riordan to look at the
issue have resigned in the last week because they favored open
access while the mayor opposed it. And last week, the chairman of
the Federal Communications Commission, in a speech to the cable
industry, said the federal government, not local governments,
should regulate cable access.
</P>
<P>
   Under Monday's agreement, America Online will be able to offer
high-speed access using DirecPC, which delivers data from
satellites to personal computers at 400 kilobits a second, compared
with 56 kilobits a second for the fastest conventional modem. A
major drawback is that transmission in the other direction, from
the user's personal computer to the Internet, is handled by phone
lines at a slower speed.
</P>
<P>
   While DirecPC's downstream speed is less than one-third the
speed of digital subscriber lines and as little as a tenth that of
the fastest cable services, it offers the advantage of being
available everywhere in the country, reaching two-thirds of
households that do not currently have access to cable modems or
digital subscriber line service from their phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a majority of customers who today have no broadband
options,'' Steve Case, the chairman of America Online, said in a
media conference call. ``Those people will finally have an
option.'' But Case said his company continued to look for deals
with phone and cable companies, adding: ``We want to work with as
many companies as we can. We're agnostic as to these underlying
technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   DirecPC has languished, with only about 100,000 subscribers
worldwide, mainly businesses, since its introduction because
Hughes, facing financial constraints, has not heavily invested in
it. But the infusion of cash from America Online is expected to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows us to bring it into the consumer forefront and put
some money behind it,'' said Michael Smith, the chairman of Hughes,
a unit of General Motors Corp. The investment from America Online
will also help Hughes develop Spaceway, a two-way, high-speed
satellite data service scheduled for introduction in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The cash infusion is the largest by America Online in another
company, though it has made larger acquisitions using stock. It
will receive a General Motors security that is automatically
convertible in three years to GM class H common stock, the tracking
stock for Hughes, at a price 24 percent above the current price.
That would give America Online ownership of about 5 percent of
Hughes' equity, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The investment will allow Hughes to cancel a $1 billion equity
offering it had been planning to help pay for its recent
acquisitions of U.S. Satellite Broadcasting and Primestar, two
satellite television rivals. GM was to contribute half of that $1
billion in equity.
</P>
<P>
   America Online and Hughes announced last month that they would
develop a set-top box that would enable consumers to receive both
DirecTV and AOL TV. AOL TV, which is to be offered next year, will
provide access to the Internet and to other America Online services
through a television set rather than a computer. For instance,
someone seeing a television business news program could at the same
time buy and sell shares online.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes Network Systems, a subsidiary of Hughes, said Monday that
it would use Intel microprocessors in the set-top box for the AOL
TV satellite service and for other set-top boxes as well. This
could provide a boost for Intel's efforts to expand uses of its
processors beyond the personal computer, for which it is the
dominant supplier. Intel also said it would license Hughes' DirecPC
technology to use in future products.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of America Online, based in Dulles, Va., were the most
actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange Monday, rising
$3.375 to close at $115.375. Hughes, based in El Segundo, Calif.,
rose $3.1875, to $56.625, while General Motors closed up 93.75
cents at $63.75.

QWEST'S NACCHIO ADDRESSES HIS CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the takeover battle for U S West, the smallest of the
regional Bell telephone companies, and Frontier Corp., the
long-distance telephone concern, were theater, it would have all
the plot twists of an Italian opera.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day, it seems, a new rumor pops up regarding these
two companies and the upstarts that are vying to own them. Global
Crossing Ltd., the fledgling concern based in Bermuda, wants to
build a worldwide telecommunications network and recently announced
agreements to merge with both U S West and Frontier valued at $47
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Qwest Communications International last week made a $55
billion hostile offer for the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, people close to the talks said U S West's board
of directors was meeting to discuss Qwest's bid as early as Monday
night, and a statement regarding the offer was expected soon. Last
week, Frontier said its board was taking no action regarding the
proposed bid from Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   But while U S West weighs the Qwest offer, Joseph P. Nacchio,
Qwest's chief executive, took the opportunity to address his
critics Monday when the company announced a joint venture with the
consulting and accounting firm KPMG LLP to sell Internet-based
business services. He angered investors recently, who watched the
value of the company's stock drop more that 24 percent June 14.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio told reporters in a conference call that he had sent
letters to both Frontier and U S West reaffirming his offers and
had filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission to
support the bids. Nacchio has been criticized for not supporting
both bids fully.
</P>
<P>
   In those documents, the company said that it was Philip
Anschutz, Qwest's board chairman and largest shareholder who placed
the call to U S West's chief executive, Solomon D. Trujillo, June
13 telling him a hostile bid was about to begin. Trujillo was also
informed, via letter, that he would be allowed to stay on as vice
chairman of Qwest's board and that up to four U S West board
members would be added to the combined company's board. What is
less clear is what would happen to Joseph P. Clayton, chief
executive of Frontier, who was not offered a position in senior
management, but was told that Frontier would get two board seats.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drubbing he has taken lately, Nacchio was relaxed
and confident when he sat down in one-on-one interviews to explain
his company's rationale. He scoffed at the notion that the battle
for U S West and Frontier was in any way ``personal,'' noting that
Jack Grubman, an analyst who works for Salomon Smith Barney, which
is advising Global Crossing, had attended his son's graduation
party the day before the bids were started. Grubman helped Nacchio
get his job at Qwest, and despite Grubman's defense of Global,
Nacchio said, ``The punchline is we'll still be friends after this
is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio said he spent the Friday before Qwest began the offer in
meetings with executives at BellSouth, which recently took a 10
percent stake in Qwest, including its chief executive, F. Duane
Ackerman. ``We asked them to kick the tires and see if the
synergies were there,'' Nacchio explained.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio said he has been willing to make personal concessions if
U S West agreed to be acquired by Qwest, even stepping down as the
head of a combined entity. ``If my board asked me to step down for
Sol, I'd be fine,'' he said, referring to Trujillo, U S West's
chief executive. ``This is not my company, but the shareholders'
company.''

EDITORIAL: THE LATEST BREAST IMPLANT VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   The most authoritative analysis yet conducted of the safety of
silicone breast implants has concluded that they do not cause the
kinds of health problems that have spawned a raft of lawsuits and
wrung a $4 billion settlement out of the manufacturers. The finding
should bring at least temporary relief from anguish and uncertainty
for more than 1.5 million American women who currently carry such
implants in their bodies and may have worried that they were in
grave jeopardy. But it is not the final word, and it will bring
little solace to the companies that have shelled out billions of
dollars to women whose illnesses appear, if this analysis is
correct, unrelated to the implants.
</P>
<P>
   The new report _ by a panel of experts assembled by the
Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences,
at the request of Congress _ does not mean that implants are free
of all risk. The panel said they could cause serious problems in
the breast itself when the implant ruptures, or the tissue around
it contracts, or infection occurs. This happens with ``relatively
high frequency,'' the experts concluded, a fact that manufacturers
and plastic surgeons tend to downplay. Although these localized
conditions are not life-threatening, they cause substantial pain
and discomfort for many women and often require surgery to replace
or remove the implants.
</P>
<P>
   But on the graver ailments that involve incapacitation or risk
of death and have been the main focus of lawsuits, the panel
generally absolved the implants. It found little or no evidence
that silicone implants cause breast cancer, connective tissue
disease, immunological diseases, neurological problems or, as some
have hypothesized, an entirely new kind of disease. It is true that
many women who have had implants are suffering from these terrible
diseases, the panel acknowledged, but these conditions are no more
common in women with breast implants than in women without them.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's report is probably the best judgment that can be
rendered on implant safety based on the current state of knowledge.
But such judgments are always subject to change should new
scientific findings emerge. The largest and most comprehensive
epidemiologic study of this contentious issue _ a National Cancer
Institute study of 13,500 women who have had implants _ is still
under way. If there are lingering doubts about the safety of
implants _ as critics insist that there are _ that study could go
far toward resolving them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, opponents of the breast implant litigation will seize
upon the new report as evidence that the tort system is badly
flawed, inflicting billions of dollars in unwarranted costs on an
innocent industry. But the court cases, and women's decisions about
implants, had to proceed at a time when evidence was sparse and
conflicting. The companies, marketing a product they could not
prove to be safe, elected to settle rather than risk heavy jury
verdicts. If the end result was unfair to them, that still does not
add up to an excuse for radical restriction of consumer recourse in
the nation's imperfect but indispensable legal system.

WEYERHAEUSER AGREES TO BUY MACMILLAN BLOEDEL FOR $2.45 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Canada)  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Weyerhaeuser Inc. said Monday that it had agreed to
acquire MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., one of the biggest forestry
companies in western Canada, in a stock deal valued at $2.45
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, if approved by shareholders and regulators,
would solidify the position of Weyerhaeuser, which is based in
Tacoma, Wash., as the world's largest producer of softwood lumber
and pulp and strengthen its business in fiberboard and packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser's chairman, Steven R. Rogel, described the
acquisition as ``an excellent strategic combination,'' which will
increase annual sales by about 25 percent, to $13.3 billion.
Weyerhaeuser has 35,000 employees in North America, with 5,900 of
them in Canada. MacMillan Bloedel, based in Vancouver, British
Columbia, employs 9,500 in Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of MacMillan Bloedel will receive 0.28 of a share
of Weyerhaeuser _ or the same amount of stock in a new Canadian
subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser, permitting favorable tax treatment for
Canadian shareholders. The boards of both companies have agreed to
the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser shares fell 3.8 percent, or $2.625, to close at
$67.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. MacMillan Bloedel shares
surged 23 percent, or $3.3906, to close at $17.8281 on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Majendie, a senior vice president at Canaccord Capital in
Vancouver, said the acquisition by Weyerhaeuser was good for
shareholders of MacMillan Bloedel because ``in the natural resource
sector, bigger tends to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that British Columbia's nationalistic New
Democratic Party government, which controls the province's forest
resources, could fight the takeover of MacMillan Bloedel, as it has
done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan Bloedel was once one of Canada's strongest forestry
companies. But like others with core operations in British
Columbia, it has been hurt in recent years by low commodity prices,
forest policies adopted by the province's New Democratic Party
government, lumber import restrictions by the United States and the
economic crises of several Asian economies, which ordinarily are
big buyers of North American wood products.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan Bloedel underwent a huge restructuring in 1997,
cutting its work force by 30 percent and selling certain fiberboard
operations. It had been seeking a buyer for its packaging division,
which led to the offer from Weyerhaeuser.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian company lost $368 million (Canadian) in 1997 but
earned $42 million (Canadian) last year.

 &HT;    Hawks join debate on low scoring
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lenny Wilkens and Steve Smith are in town today to
see if they can help save the NBA from itself. The Hawks coach and
the team's best player are members of a special committee that will
advise the league on how to reverse a disturbing trend toward ugly
play and low scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday that the league can
use the various summer leagues and then the exhibition season to
implement changes that would promote offense and a better flow to
the game.
</P>
<P>
   In nine years, the league has seen team scoring decline from 107
points to 91.6 points per game. Shooting has dropped from .476 to
.437. A number of elements are to blame, from a trend to younger
and less skilled players to tighter control by coaches, who want to
hold down scores, to excessive physical contact.
</P>
<P>
   (The NBA board of governors) indicated to us that they don't
need a lot of debate, that if we are comfortable with the results
of the committee, then we should just go with it,'' commissioner
David Stern said. ``Let's put it into effect in the summer . . .
and get teams ready to abide by those changes during the exhibition
season, so that nobody is surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, there appears to be a mandate to clean up the game,
ending more than a decade of brutish play that has seen hard
physical blows and holding used to compensate for lack of quickness
and skills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the foul lane could be widened at its base to open
up the middle, and there is some sentiment to shorten the time the
ball can be held in the backcourt, now 10 seconds. There is no
clear consensus on throwing out rules prohibiting zone defenses,
and the outer dimensions of the court will not be changed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Wilkens, the committee includes active coaches
Rudy Tomjanovich, Rick Pitino and Pat Riley and club executives
Kevin McHale, Billy King and Donnie Walsh. All are former players.
Antonio Davis of Indiana is the other active player on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Three NBA television anaylsts _ former coach Hubie Brown, former
player and coach Doug Collins and former player Isiah Thomas _ will
sit in. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski is a volunteer. The owners
involved are Phoenix's Jerry Colangelo, an advocate of an up-tempo
game, and Cleveland's Gordon Sund, who fired coach Mike Fratello to
change his team's walk-up style.
</P>
<P>
   The teen problem
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Granik said they will continue to address ways to
limit the influx of underclassmen into the league.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said that 20 appears to be the right age to begin a new
wage scale that discourages players from coming out, and that the
players association is sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA also is interested in having a league _ either the CBA
or a new one _ in which young players under contract could play
rather than sit on an NBA bench with no chance of gaining
experience.
</P>
<P>
   L.J.'s tantrum
</P>
<P>
   The league acted swiftly Sunday to fine New York forward Larry
Johnson $25,000 and the Knicks $25,000 more for his conduct.
Johnson cursed the media and was verbally abusive toward two
members of the NBA's public-relations staff.
</P>
<P>
   The fine is Johnson's second of the playoffs. He was fined
$10,000 during the Eastern Conference finals for refusing to
participate in a media session.

U.S. SAID TO GIVE ALBERTSON'S APPROVAL ON $8.3 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal officials have agreed that they will not
block Albertson's Inc. in its $8.3 billion purchase of American
Stores Co., now that Albertson has agreed to sell 144 stores in
three states, people involved in the review said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The divestiture, which is expected to be announced soon by the
federal government and the states where the stores are to be sold,
would be the largest ever ordered by the Federal Trade Commission
in the retailing industry. But it represents only a small part of
the proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would create a company with more than 2,300 stores in
37 states and nearly 200,000 employees. When the deal was
announced, executives expected the new company to have revenue of
about $36 billion, creating the nation's second-largest food and
drug retailer, behind Kroger Co. of Cincinnati, which has $43
billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is part of a wave of consolidation in the supermarket
business. Four weeks ago, Kroger became the largest supermarket
chain in the nation when it completed its acquisition of Fred Meyer
Inc. In that deal, regulators ordered the sale of eight stores.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the review of the Albertson acquisition would
not disclose the buyers for the stores that are being sold. But
they said that more than 100 of the stores were in California and
the rest in Nevada and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   American Stores, which is based in Salt Lake City, operates more
than 1,500 stores in 26 states, including 269 combination
food-and-drug stores and 539 supermarkets that operate under the
names Acme markets, Jewel Food Stores and Lucky Stores.
Albertson's, which is based in Boise, Idaho, operates 916 retail
stores in 23 states. Both chains' stores will retain their names,
and the company headquarters will be in Boise. Executives have been
planning to close the deal by the end of this month.

NEWEST KING WILL ELEVATE MURRAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings' Andy Murray just became a
better coach.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing, too, considering Larry Robinson's successor
absorbed more shots in his first week on the job than Kings
goaltender Stephane Fiset did all year.
</P>
<P>
   Come the fall, no one will care that Murray has never coached a
game in the NHL. Not now that sniper Zigmund Palffy has his back.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is in the trenches. When a coach has a proven
scorer within easy tapping distance, it does wonders for his
strategies and stature.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Wilson's image as a rink general was transformed almost
overnight when the Mighty Ducks acquired winger Teemu Selanne from
Winnipeg in February of 1996. The Ducks were 18-30-5 at the time
and Wilson was wilting from having to dodge so many slings and
arrows. With Selanne, the Ducks went 17-9-3 the rest of the way and
just like that, Wilson became an inspiration to his troops.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, a seventh-year veteran from Slovakia, has great
instincts, soft hands and superlative vision. He can make everybody
around him look better, including his coach. He is Luc Robitaille
without the crow's feet, Jozef Stumpel with a shooter's mentality.
He is L.A.'s answer to Teemu Selanne right down to his clipped
accent and mitigated joy at coming to Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   When Selanne was traded, he felt as though his foundation had
been rocked. His wife was within weeks of delivering the couple's
first child and he had just been assured by management that he
wasn't going to be traded. It was the first time he had been dealt
and the sensation was not unlike a sucker punch.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with Palffy, whom the Islanders claimed in the second
round of the 1991 draft. He made his NHL debut in 1993-94. Starting
two seasons later, he strung together three consecutive 40-goal
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   His ardor for the Islanders' management cooled as a result of
acrimonious contract negotiations that kept the 5-foot-10 right
wing off the ice for the first two months of the 1998-99 season.
But his love for the area and its fans never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five years there, it's hard to deal with (being sent
away),'' Palffy said.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding matters is the fact that not long after he was
finally signed to a six-year, $33-million deal, Palffy bought a
home on Long Island. It was his baby, if you will, but as of Monday
it was back on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can find somebody who'll be interested in it, let me
know,'' Palffy quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The laugh that followed was as infectious as a virus.
</P>
<P>
   If L.A.'s not careful, it could catch hockey fever hanging
around Palffy, who should warm to Southern California as quickly as
did Selanne. The good news is Palffy seems immune to the Hollywood
bug that has sapped the productivity of many athletes once they've
been exposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do nothing but play hockey,'' he said in a
conference call with reporters. ``The Los Angeles Kings have
brought me here for a reason, for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. To become the first King since Robitaille in 1992-93
to score 50 goals, for one thing. And mainly to get his first taste
of playoff experience. Palffy has played 331 NHL games, none of
them in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange but true: Right wing Dan Bylsma has scored 162
fewer NHL goals than Palffy's 168 and appeared in two more NHL
playoff games. No one ever said hockey was fair. (isn't that right,
Buffalo?)
</P>
<P>
   From what Palffy's heard, it can be stirring, playing in May and
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real difficult not to be in the playoffs,'' he said.
``I'm trying my best all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy figures it's time his potential was plucked. He feels
ripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the right age right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, 27, is the same age as two other scorers of note,
Shaquille O'Neal and Mia Hamm. It cheers us to report that Palffy's
priorities are closer to the team-oriented Hamm than the
me-oriented O'Neal. So there'll be no need to do any last-minute
tinkering with the blueprint to make room for another oversized ego
in the new Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hockey is 20 guys playing like a team,'' Palffy said. ``The
Kings want me to create offense. I'm ready for that. I like to
create a lot of offense. Hockey right now is two ways, so I play
defense, too. I play any way coach wants me to play now.''
</P>
<P>
   The breeze that just rustled the pages of your newspaper was
Murray sighing in immense relief.
</P>
<P>
   For all the fans who clamored this past season for the Russian
Rocket, Pavel Bure, consider this: When a Palffy-for-Bure trade was
floated this past fall, no one shot it down as though it were a
bunch of hot air.
</P>
<P>
   Kings general manager Dave Taylor tried prying Palffy from the
Islanders during the Slovakia native's contract holdout. His
persistence paid off on Sunday. The feeling is that come May,
Palffy's persistence finally will be rewarded, too.

EDITORIAL: REBUILDING RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   Americans should be encouraged by the constructive tone of
President Clinton's talks with Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin,
in Germany Sunday. Moscow seems almost as eager as Washington to
move beyond the tensions that resulted from NATO's bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But given the Russian leader's erratic policies and fragile
health, there can be no assurance of things going smoothly. Both
sides, but particularly Moscow, must follow through on Sunday's
pledges on nuclear arms reductions, Russian economic reform, new
talks on defensive missiles and curtailment of Russian nuclear
cooperation with Iran. Promises have been made before, without
results.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's most urgent need is Western financial support. Yeltsin
committed himself to achieve the improved tax collection and other
reforms Moscow promised the International Monetary Fund in
negotiations to release a new $4.5 billion loan installment. The
United States and Europe are right to declare that they will
reschedule their own loans to Russia only if Moscow first satisfies
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   On arms, Yeltsin once again promised to try to get Russia's
Parliament to ratify the long-stalled 1993 nuclear weapons treaty
with the United States. Ratification would lead to sharp cuts in
long-range missile forces and thus ease acute pressures on Russia's
budget. Before the Kosovo crisis there were realistic hopes that
the budgetary argument might sway enough votes to overcome
nationalist and Communist opposition. That case can be strengthened
if Washington and Moscow press ahead, as pledged, with talks on a
new treaty authorizing even deeper nuclear weapons cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin pleased Washington by agreeing to open negotiations on
modifying the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty in ways that might
accommodate future American plans for a limited missile defense
against countries like North Korea. He also renewed offers to work
with the Clinton administration on curbing Russian nuclear
technology transfers to Iran. Over all, he seemed to recognize that
Russia's own interests are best served by cooperative relations
with the United States.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   Heroic is a word that rarely leaps to the lips when talk turns
to golf. But if Payne Stewart's one-shot victory at the U.S. Open
on Sunday was not heroic in the physical-bravery sense, it
certainly met the competitive definition of grace under pressure.
He had won the tournament before, and he had lost before too, after
going into the final round last year with a four-stroke lead that
vanished by late afternoon. Stewart returned to the Open this year
much as Juli Inkster did to the U.S. Women's Open earlier this
month _ determined to redeem a painful loss.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster won comfortably, but Stewart did not win until the final
putt on the final hole, an interminable 15-footer that became the
longest winning final putt in Open history. If Tiger Woods, who
finished third, had made three putts that together totaled less
than 15 feet, he would have won the tournament. But what made
Stewart's victory valiant was not just his remarkable long putts on
16 and 18. It was having seen his lead slip away and refusing to
let it slip away for good. When Phil Mickelson, Stewart's playing
partner in the final pairing, pulled even and then ahead, nearly
everyone in the audience thought of last year, when Stewart lost a
chance to tie on the final hole. But this year, on a notoriously
difficult golf course in Pinehurst, N.C., Stewart demonstrated that
the course is only as difficult as the state of mind you play it
in.

JUDGE WON'T FREE MAN WHO REFUSED TO TESTIFY IN TERRORISM CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan has refused to free an
Orlando, Fla., man who was jailed last month for refusing to
testify before a federal grand jury investigating Osama bin Laden
and his suspected role in worldwide terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Robert Patterson Jr., issued his order last
Wednesday, after the witness, Ihab Ali, reiterated in court that he
would not testify. Ali had earlier cited religious reasons as a
basis for his refusal and has been held in the Metropolitan
Correctional Center since May 19. The case had been handled under a
secrecy order until last week's hearing. A transcript was made
public Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The jailing of Ali is just one of the latest developments in the
federal investigation of Americans suspected of involvement with
bin Laden, who has been indicted in the bombings of U.S. embassies
last August in Kenya and Tanzania as well as other acts of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, the government revealed for the first
time that it was investigating ``co-conspirators'' of bin Laden in
Orlando, Fla., according to a newly released indictment.
Prosecutors have also been investigating people in Texas and in
California, records show.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, moreover, a number of Muslims from Texas, the
Washington area and California have been subpoenaed by the grand
jury or questioned by the FBI, according to some of their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see if there's a network here,'' said Lynne
Stewart, who represents Khader Ibrahim, a Texas man who testified
for several hours last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart said that Ibrahim, a friend of Wadih el-Hage, a
Texan who has been indicted and is in custody, had nothing to hide.
``He is a small businessman who befriended a fellow Muslim, and
that's where it begins and where it ends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Cohen, who represents Moataz Al-Hallak, the imam of the
Islamic Society of Arlington, Texas, where el-Hage was a member,
said his client considered refusing to testify. But Al-Hallak then
decided to answer the questions ``because he felt an imperative
that the grand jury get a view of his world,'' Cohen said, ``a view
that they were otherwise denied, that as a man, a Muslim, an imam,
a community leader, there's nothing to fear from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added: ``He wouldn't know Osama bin Laden if he knocked at
the door and tried to sell him cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney
in Manhattan, had no comment on the criticism or the case.
</P>
<P>
   The five defendants who are in custody in New York are scheduled
to appear for arraignment Tuesday before Judge Leonard Sand of
federal District Court. Nine other defendants, including bin Laden,
remain at large, while another is fighting extradition from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Ali's lawyer, Ashraf Nubani, said his client denied any
wrongdoing. He said that Ali refused to testify last May 19 for
religious reasons, based on his conviction that he should not
answer questions that could unjustly harm other Muslims. In court
last Wednesday, after Ali again refused to testify, Nubani renewed
his arguments to Judge Patterson, the transcript shows, adding that
Ali also feared for the safety of his family in Egypt and
mistrusted the government's motives.
</P>
<P>
   Nubani said that his client believed that the government was
using ``guilt by association'' to harass Muslims, the transcript
shows.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Payne Stewart is a father, too. And a far more
knowledgeable one now than when he won his first U.S. Open in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of people pulling for Phil Mickelson to win his
first major championship Sunday at the Open at Pinehurst No. 2. It
would have made for a terrific tale, Mickelson breaking through on
Father's Day, then jetting home to Arizona to become one as his
wife will have their first child probably this week or next.
</P>
<P>
   But what was lost in the grand moment that was one of golf's
most riveting tournaments this decade was how much Stewart has
changed during the course of his career and particularly in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
   When he won the Open in '91, he did everything he could to
capitalize on the moment. Stewart flew overseas for all the
appearance money he could grab and signed endorsement deals. He
sold his soul but was rewarded with more money than most people can
even dream about. It is similar to what Mark O'Meara is doing this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with his third major championship coming at age 42 and with
his kids age 13 and 10, Stewart knows he will handle this U.S. Open
championship differently. And better. While O'Meara can be excused
for jumping at every financial opportunity because he had never won
a major until getting two last year, Stewart now can push away from
the feast rather than feel like he has to gorge himself while the
getting is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to enjoy this one a lot more,'' Stewart said.
``It's easier to understand now the obligations that come along
with being the United States Open champion. It will be easier to
understand that my family comes first, and then if I have time for
those obligations I'll take care of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a lot more prepared to deal with everything that
goes along with holding on to this trophy for a year. I don't plan
on changing my schedules. I plan on doing the same things that I've
been doing that got me in position to win this, which is working
out and spending a lot of time at home and playing at golf
tournaments I enjoy playing at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look forward to running after the elusive dollar,
because I've been invited to go play here and here and here and
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart can take this approach because he's more content now
than he was eight years ago. He also has learned the value of
values. His faith became a stronger part of his life in the past
two years, and with that he has found out how rewarding it is to be
a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had so much fun being at home, being a father, taking my
kids to school, going to school athletics,'' he said. ``That's what
my life is right now. And I'm not going to do what I did in '91
along those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in '91, Stewart could be forgiven for milking the
Open title for all it was worth. His kids were younger, and it was
a valuable time in his life for cementing his future.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday, Stewart not only can revel in the fact that he can
be a family man who just happens to have won one of the most
memorable U.S. Opens in history.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it on a course designed by Scotsman Donald Ross on a
Sunday that felt more like some dank, misty course in Britain than
in the sand hills of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Before Stewart had started his round Sunday, he cut off the arms
of what was no doubt an expensive rain shirt. Just before dusk, he
clipped off any question as to whether he deserves to be mentioned
with the top players this year in terms of what he has accomplished
in the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart became the only person other than David Duval and Tiger
Woods to have more than one victory on the PGA Tour this year. He's
the O'Meara of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was O'Meara who experienced a revival of his
career at the grand old age of 41. Stewart is 17 days younger than
O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Stewart has changed since his early days on
the PGA Tour. He often was gruff with the media and earned a
reputation for his sarcasm and his sometimes-caustic personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've learned that you guys have jobs, too,'' he said
earlier this year after winning at Pebble Beach. ``It doesn't make
any sense to make your life harder when it doesn't really take any
effort on my part to do an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart hasn't lost his outspoken ways. He says what he
thinks. And that's why he's going to be a strong member of the
Ryder Cup team in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about that, and there's going to be a lot of new
faces on both sides,'' he said. ``David Duval has never been on a
Ryder Cup team, which is really hard to believe. And there will be
a lot of new faces on the European team. I think I can bring some
knowledge to guys like Duval, who are not going to be used to
hearing people cheer when he misses a putt. I'm a rah-rah person.''

2 OFFICERS NAMED IN LOUIMA-RELATED INDICTMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal grand jury in Brooklyn indicted two New
York City police officers Monday and accused them of repeatedly
lying to FBI agents when questioned about the police torture of
Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, Rolando Aleman, 28, and Francisco Rosario, 34, are
not accused of having any role in the assault on Louima, who
suffered severe internal injuries when a stick was thrust into his
rectum while he was restrained in the restroom of the 70th Precinct
station house.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the seven-count indictment charges the officers with
covering up what they saw and heard in the station that night.
Specifically, it alleges that the officers lied when they denied
seeing Louima with Justin Volpe, the officer who ended his trial
last month by confessing to brutalizing Louima with the stick on
Aug. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A second officer, Charles Schwarz, was convicted this month of
restraining Louima during the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman and Rosario were arrested in December, but prosecutors
decided not to seek a formal indictment until after the trial of
the five principal defendants in the Louima case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said Monday's indictment reflected the determination of
Zachary Carter, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, to challenge the
culture of silence within police ranks that sometimes thwarts
investigations of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this indictment certainly sends a message that law
enforcement is not going to tolerate the blue wall of silence,''
said Edward Jenks, a lawyer for Aleman.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Rubenstein, a lawyer for Louima, said: ``It definitely
brings a clear message that you can't lie to the FBI when they're
investigating a case of police brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   According to federal investigators, Aleman told them at one
point that he was a ``good cop'' who did not want to be labeled a
``rat.'' Later on, after he was confronted with evidence that he
was withholding information, investigators said, Aleman admitted to
lying about seeing Volpe and another officer leading Louima to the
restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario, the indictment alleges, ``concealed and covered up the
fact that he was present'' when Volpe escorted Louima to a holding
cell moments after the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Neither officer was assigned to the 70th Precinct. They were
partners in the Street Crime Unit, working in plain clothes to
catch people carrying illegal guns. They were in the 70th Precinct
station house that night to drop off a man they had arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong
time,'' Jenks said.
</P>
<P>
   Both officers will plead not guilty, their lawyers said. For
each count, they face a maximum sentence of five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario ``is not a supporter of the blue wall of silence, and he
didn't support it here,'' said his lawyer, Richard Levitt.
</P>
<P>
   Jenks said Aleman has made hundreds of arrests and received
dozens of commendations. ``My guy's life has basically been ruined
by this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments, though, may have implications for two other
legal cases _ Louima's civil suit against New York City, and a
second criminal trial for Schwarz and two officers who were
acquitted this month, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese.
</P>
<P>
   The three officers face an additional charge of obstructing
justice by inventing a cover story of what happened in the
restroom. Stephen Worth, a lawyer for Schwarz, said Monday's
indictment made it ``virtually impossible'' for him to call either
Aleman or Rosario as a defense witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to take the Fifth,'' he said, referring to their
right to avoid self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   As for Louima's civil case, Rubenstein said the indictment could
bolster the claim that the attack on Louima was concealed by a
broad conspiracy of silence.

sEDITORIAL: THE LATEST BREAST IMPLANT VERDICT  
(sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   The most authoritative analysis yet conducted of the safety of
silicone breast implants has concluded that they do not cause the
kinds of health problems that have spawned a raft of lawsuits and
wrung settlements costing some $7 billion from the manufacturers.
The finding should bring at least temporary relief from anguish and
uncertainty for more than 1.5 million American women who currently
carry such implants in their bodies and may have worried that they
were in grave jeopardy. But it is not the final word, and it will
bring little solace to the companies that have shelled out billions
of dollars to women whose illnesses appear, if this analysis is
correct, unrelated to the implants.
</P>
<P>
   The new report _ by a panel of experts assembled by the
Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences,
at the request of Congress _ does not mean that implants are free
of all risk. The panel said they could cause serious problems in
the breast itself when the implant ruptures, or the tissue around
it contracts, or infection occurs. This happens with ``relatively
high frequency,'' the experts concluded, a fact that manufacturers
and plastic surgeons tend to downplay. Although these localized
conditions are not life-threatening, they cause substantial pain
and discomfort for many women and often require surgery to replace
or remove the implants.
</P>
<P>
   But on the graver ailments that involve incapacitation or risk
of death and have been the main focus of lawsuits, the panel
generally absolved the implants. It found little or no evidence
that silicone implants cause breast cancer, connective tissue
disease, immunological diseases, neurological problems or, as some
have hypothesized, an entirely new kind of disease. It is true that
many women who have had implants are suffering from these terrible
diseases, the panel acknowledged, but these conditions are no more
common in women with breast implants than in women without them.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's report is probably the best judgment that can be
rendered on implant safety based on the current state of knowledge.
But such judgments are always subject to change should new
scientific findings emerge. The largest and most comprehensive
epidemiologic study of this contentious issue _ a National Cancer
Institute study of 13,500 women who have had implants _ is still
under way. If there are lingering doubts about the safety of
implants _ as critics insist that there are _ that study could go
far toward resolving them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, opponents of the breast implant litigation will seize
upon the new report as evidence that the tort system is badly
flawed, inflicting billions of dollars in unwarranted costs on an
innocent industry. But the court cases, and women's decisions about
implants, had to proceed at a time when evidence was sparse and
conflicting. The companies, marketing a product they could not
prove to be safe, elected to settle rather than risk heavy jury
verdicts. If the end result was unfair to them, that still does not
add up to an excuse for radical restriction of consumer recourse in
the nation's imperfect but indispensable legal system.

13 FAILING SCHOOLS TO BE CLOSED BY 2001 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS and LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirteen failing schools in New York City will be
closed over the next two years, school officials said Monday, as
part of a shake-up that School Chancellor Rudy Crew is billing as
the biggest restructuring of the system in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Newly organized schools will eventually open in the same
buildings, but up to half of the teachers and many principals from
the 13 current schools could be removed or reassigned, officials
said. Three schools will close at the end of this month and the
other 10 will be phased out by June 2001, with no new students
admitted in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 schools have been placed on a list of failing schools by
the state Education Commissioner, Richard Mills, who has threatened
to close them himself if they do not improve. Crew has closed 24
schools since taking office in October 1995, although plans for
some of those closings predated him.
</P>
<P>
   As the city's Board of Education prepared to vote Wednesday on
the closings, superintendents and principals across the city waited
tensely for word of how many and which of them would be forced _ or
eased _ out by Crew, whose aides said last week that he would
remove at least five superintendents for poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   But there was confusion, too, as Board of Education officials
said some of the people said to be affected by the restructuring
had announced their intention to leave the system weeks or months
ago, either by retiring or taking other jobs. That prompted some
critics to ask whether Crew was actually taking tough steps to
change the system or was merely taking credit for changes that
would have happened anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one of those named by Board of Education officials
as among those being ousted is Joseph DeJesus, the Bronx high
schools superintendent. DeJesus announced his retirement last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the chancellor is trying to take credit for everybody
who's moving or retiring so he looks tough,'' said David Shulman,
the Bronx representative for the United Federation of Teachers.
``But I think this bucket is full of holes.''
</P>
<P>
   But another frequent critic of the board was more supportive.
Raymond Domanico, the senior education adviser to the Industrial
Areas Foundation, a community organizing group that has criticized
Crew for not moving more quickly in replacing the principals of
low-performing schools, said Monday that he was impressed by the
apparent breadth of the chancellor's plans. He said that his
group's review of test scores showed that 10 to 12 of the 32
community school districts, which supervise elementary and middle
schools, having a high concentration of failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has taken a while,'' Domanico said. ``But we are very
supportive of what the chancellor's doing. We think he's doing the
right thing for the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor decided last week to remove at least five
superintendents, according to a top aide. That number has grown,
officials said Monday, although Crew has refused to identify the
superintendents. Chiara Coletti, a spokeswoman for Crew, said he
would announce his final decisions Wednesday.

JAFRA COSMETICS RELOCATES, LAYS OFF WORKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ An international &UR;  &LR; cosmetics company
founded by a husband-and-wife team 43 years ago &UR;  &LR; has relocated its
Ventura County operations and laid off nearly one-fourth of its
employees, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jafra Cosmetics International has contracted out the
manufacturing of its skin and body care products to an unidentified
Southern California firm to improve competitiveness, according to a
company statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company's termination of 75 employees, including 14
managerial and technical workers and 61 others, becomes effective
60 days from June 10 of this year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Thousand Oaks company were out of the state
and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   City officials hope to soften the blow of the company's actions
by luring another company to the site, prime freeway-front property
off the Ventura Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly are going to miss them,'' said Gary Wartik,
manager of economic development for Thousand Oaks. ``The property
they own is very prime property. It's a nice area with medium- and
high-tech businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Wartik said he is working with a company from the San Fernando
Valley, which he declined to name, that is interested in relocating
to Thousand Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   He said the business, which is looking for a building with
office and storage space and shipping capability, likely would be
interested in the Jafra site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly want to make sure property like that doesn't stay
vacant long,'' Wartik said. ``We want to maintain the ability of
Ventura County and Thousand Oaks to attract companies from outside
the area and add to the economic base.''
</P>
<P>
   The relocation is not expected to be felt among the company's
self-employed sales force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jafra's independent sales force will not be impacted by this
action Jafra is taking,'' the statement read. ``Jafra is retaining
quality assurance, planning, purchasing and research and
development functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jafra operates primarily in the United States but has
subsidiariesin 11 countries. Last year its self-employed direct
sales consultants numbered 262,800 worldwide, of which 56,500 are
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Jafra site has been a fixture in the community for years.
The company's 317 employees handled manufacturing and distribution
from the Townsgate Road facility.
</P>
<P>
   The company will pay all laid-off employees salary and benefits
through the 60-day period, according to a company letter notifying
the city of the move as required by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has paid each affected employee $1,000 and
offered each a severance payment.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ With the basketball world gathered in the Big Apple for
the NBA Finals, the league today will use the opportunity to
address the state of the game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his annual address to the media Monday, NBA commissioner
David Stern spent part of the time discussing today's meeting of
the ``Special Committee.'' A total of 16 representatives from
different areas of NBA expertise will meet to recommend ways to
address the decline in scoring and shooting percentages over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other issues discussed were age limitations on players
entering the league and television ratings in the wake of the
lockout. But the main issue was the Special Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' Rudy Tomjanovich is one four NBA head coaches on
the committee, along with Boston's Rick Pitino, Miami's Pat Riley
and Atlanta's Lenny Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   There are also players (Indiana's Antonio Davis and Atlanta's
Steve Smith), front-office personnel (Denver's Dan Issel,
Philadelphia's Billy King, Minnesota's Kevin McHale and Indiana's
Donnie Walsh), owners (Phoenix's Jerry Colangelo and Cleveland's
Gordon Gund) and broadcasters (Turner Sports' Hubie Brown and NBC's
Doug Collins and Isiah Thomas). The only non-NBA representative is
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming the commissioner and some of the other people in
the league consider this a fairly substantial problem and want to
try and get it resolved,'' Issel said of the NBA's offensive woes.
``With the exception of Sacramento's, everybody's offense looks the
same. You find your best post player, and you throw it in to him so
that there has to be a double team. Then you kick it out and try to
find an open shot someplace. I think some changes need to be
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee will break the game up into four separate areas of
discussion _ how the officials call the game, changing the court
dimensions, tinkering with timing rules (the 24-second shot clock,
the 10-second rule for advancing the ball past midcourt, etc.) and
guidelines for how players play defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is something else that anybody has on the committee
that doesn't fall within those four groups, we will talk about that
as well,'' said NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik. ``But we have
sort of outlined those four things as areas to put in front of the
committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of age requirements is touchy, since some of the
league's better players, like Thomas and Magic Johnson, entered the
NBA at a relatively young age.
</P>
<P>
   But one problem with the league's four-year rookie scale (with
clubs holding a fifth-year option), which was implemented as part
of the new collective bargaining agreement with the players, is
that an increasing number of players might leave school early
simply to get their commitment over with sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The league is talking about a minimum age of 20, with the
possibility of extending the scale one year for every year before
that age a player enters the league. But it is subject to
discussion with the National Basketball Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``(There is) the issue of whether 17- and 18-year-olds are
subjected to too much pressure and the sort of difficulties of life
on the road,'' Stern said. ``There is some notion of players, once
they are drafted young and they don't make it that may end their
careers. But if they had somewhat better-developed skills (through
staying in college), their chances for a longer NBA career would be
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the flip side of the argument having to do with
allowing people who are gifted who don't want to attend college
having access to the place where they can earn a living.''

FARM FARMLAND INDUSTRIES BREAKS GROUND ON HEADQUARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Farmland Industries Inc. broke ground Monday
on the first building in a 122-acre headquarters campus near Kansas
City International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The six-story building will house about 1,000 employees who now
work in seven buildings scattered throughout the Northland.
Farmland executives said the building should be completed by
February 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Cleberg, Farmland's president and chief executive, said
heavy equipment would begin preparing the land for development
later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said the farmer-owned cooperative scheduled the
groundbreaking now to calm worries about Farmland's merger talks
with Cenex Harvest States of St. Paul, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are having discussions,'' Cleberg told about 50
guests, including Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes. ``Yes, those
discussions are progressing satisfactorily. We expect to have a
presence in Kansas City for as long as we can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to reassure you that you have our presence in Kansas
City and our major commitment to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The agriculture co-op proclaimed that commitment in December,
when it announced plans for its new headquarters near Interstates
29 and 435.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a Kansas City Council committee granted
zoning for the development.
</P>
<P>
   David Eaheart, Farmland spokesman, said the plan for the site
now included 1.2 million square feet of office space because zoning
changes caused the co-op to drop one building from the plan. The
original eight-building plan, announced at the end of 1998, called
for 1.3 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The first building to go up will have about 280,000 square feet
and include a cafeteria, credit union branch office, a product test
kitchen and an employee fitness center.
</P>
<P>
   Eaheart said he didn't know the cost of putting up the first
building.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland attorney Charles Miller said the co-op planned to seek
development incentives for the campus. Miller said the plan could
be submitted to the City Council in 30 days.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A man who told police that he was taking too
much cocaine and was on the run from black helicopters and stalkers
in his crawlspace wasn't completely out of touch with reality.
</P>
<P>
   He was right about the cocaine, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, the paranoia associated with cocaine use can be
overwhelming,'' Overland Park Police Lt. Doug Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone called Overland Park police to the QuikTrip at 10245 W.
79th St. about 8:15 a.m. Sunday and complained that a man was
acting suspiciously. The man was fidgety, but he seemed relieved to
see an officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he had been using cocaine for a year and he didn't
know if the FBI or the police were following him, but he was seeing
black helicopters,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   He went with police to his duplex in the 8200 block of Perry
Street so officers could check the crawlspace. Before they went in,
an officer asked the man whether he had any drugs. He turned over a
bit of white powder that a field test showed might be cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the home, police said, they found a woman who told
officers about being kept under surveillance. She gave police a
small bottle containing what a field test also showed might be
cocaine, Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Scott Allen Goebel, 38, and Chandra Kaye Dennison,
25, were charged in Johnson County District Court with possessing
cocaine. Bond for each was set at $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Goebel wasn't complaining about police spying on him during his
court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to look over his shoulder for us anymore,''
Dunn said. ``He's right there with us.''

PAYLESS CASHWAYS MAKEOVER APPEARS TO BE GOING WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Like the 900,000 customers who shop his
stores each week, Payless Cashways chief Millard Barron is in
fix-it mode.
</P>
<P>
   His crew is waxing floors, painting walls, sprucing up stock and
rearranging shelves. It's all part of an effort to turn around
Payless Cashways, including a remodeling and remerchandising of
Payless' 150 stores in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are almost $2 billion in sales, 10,000 jobs and the
investments of thousands of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Barron, a former Wal-Mart executive, can pull off the
ultimate remodeling job is still to be determined, but some recent
signs point to the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Since Payless returned to its long-ago roots of each store
serving both the professional contractor and the project-oriented
do-it-yourselfer, it's once again posting profits, increasing
same-store sales and making plans to open more stores.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years there were few reasons to celebrate at Payless,
once in the top three home improvement retailers and now a distant
fifth, and once one of Kansas City's few Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Payless was brought to its knees by an ill-fated management-led
buyout in 1988, leaving the retailer choking on $1.3 billion in
debt while new competition scorched the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993 Payless was forced to go public again to raise cash to
pay down its debt. To try to keep up, Payless management, led by
David Stanley, kept hiring consultants, each recommending a
different strategy, forcing it to zigzag all over the road.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all to no avail. By 1997, profitability was a thing
of the past. On July 21, 1997, at the behest of its bankers,
Payless filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Within five months the
company was out of bankruptcy, and the old management and board of
directors were out the door.
</P>
<P>
   In came Barron and a new board led by Chairman Peter Danis.
Under them, Payless has started to turn the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme since Millard Barron came on board hasn't changed,''
said analyst Deepac Raja of Wiley Bros.-Aintree Capital. ``It's
just a slow, steady turnaround, and Payless seems to be holding its
own, or even better.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, recent months have brought some small _ and some
not so small _ celebratory moments.
</P>
<P>
   To hail those moments, Barron hung a bell in the lobby of the
executive offices. The company isn't hitting any home runs, Barron
said, but it is hitting lots of singles and even some doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm an optimistic guy, a `the glass is half full'
kind of guy,'' Barron said. ``I bought a bell to celebrate our
successes. We ring it when something good happens. Lately, that's
been more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   To see the future of Payless, take a trip to its store on
Marshall Drive in Lenexa.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the gondolas soaring to the ceiling. Gone is the
slow-selling stock. Gone are the mazelike passages, making it
impossible to find employees.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the store is bright, aisles are wide and employees are
accessible.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Monday morning the whir of motorized dollies stacked
with merchandise could be heard throughout the store. Everywhere,
employees were restocking shelves with fresh merchandise after a
busy weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And when they weren't restocking shelves, they were asking
lost-looking shoppers if they needed help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't hire some new design studio or some national
consultant to tell us how to change the store,'' Barron said.
``Instead we talked to our customers and relied on our own
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the old Payless carried 120 different hammers. But
only about half of those were steady sellers, and because Payless
carried so many, it could stock only two of each.
</P>
<P>
   That meant the stores were often out of the strong sellers while
the weak ones sat there.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company carries eight each of about 60 different
hammers.
</P>
<P>
   It's that methodical analysis of each piece of merchandise, that
attention to detail, that has allowed Payless to cull about 20
percent of its stock while increasing sales.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the look of the store has changed. Walking in,
customers can easily see all the way to the back. White paint
brightens the walls. Big black, gold and red signs mark each
department.
</P>
<P>
   On opposite sides of the store are higher aisles, each capped
with a special promotion. One day it may be 100 heavy-duty,
33-gallon trash bags for $11.49; another an 18-gallon, 6-horsepower
Shop Vac for $59.99. No matter what the promotion, each end cap
carries the same message in big, bright letters _ PRICED RIGHT!
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two essential elements of a store experience,''
Barron said. One is ``the environment, the atmosphere, the ease of
shopping ... the availability of associates. And then there's the
other piece: the assortment, the breadth of product, the pricing.
We're reinventing both at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Separate from Payless' efforts to rejuvenate the stores' look is
its effort to increase sales to the professional contractor and
remodeler.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts there are paying off. In its latest quarter Payless
reported it earned $1.2 million. More important, sales to
professionals at stores open at least one year were up 13 percent.
Those same-store sales are regarded as retail's best measure of
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, about 53 percent of Payless' annual sales of $2
billion came from the do-it-yourselfers, 47 percent from the pro.
That has flipped, Barron said. But he hasn't set a target.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll focus on our program and let that lead us where it takes
us,'' Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   Payless has managed to increase sales to the professional by,
again, paying attention to detail. Pros shopping at Payless have
their own parking lot, their own door, their own order office. In
the past, their order office and door out to the lot were cramped
and small.
</P>
<P>
   The new order office is roomy. Best of all, there's a
10-foot-wide automatic sliding door that goes out to the pro
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, if they were carrying out long plumbing pipes or
trim, it was like wrestling with a bear to get it out the door,''
Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   The old Payless management had a last-gasp plan. It was called
dual path, and it called for some stores in each market to focus
specifically on the pro, the others on the do-it-yourselfers. The
strategy left analysts scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The per-square-foot cost to convert stores to the dual path was
$18 at the low end and as much as $35 at the high end. Payless' new
conversion costs are often less than $5 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the dual-path conversion usually took three
months, while the new ones are occurring in 30 days or less.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Lenexa store as a model, albeit a flexible one,
Payless expects to convert all 150 of its stores within three
years. Thus far, changeover costs are coming in under budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing you can do is make it look wonderful and great
and you get good sales but you're so leveraged with expense that
you don't make any money,'' Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Payless is meeting its goal of growing the company
with the pro, it's still bleeding sales on the do-it-yourself side.
In the latest quarter, same-store sales to do-it-yourselfers were
down almost 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So is the Lenexa prototype turning the do-it-yourself sales from
south to north?
</P>
<P>
   Grinning, Barron said pro and do-it-yourselfer sales were up at
the Lenexa store.
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't say by how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have six to eight of these with three to six
months under my belt before I give you too many particulars, but
just read my excitement,'' Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   Others besides Barron are excited about Payless.
</P>
<P>
   Take investment adviser Jerry Duggan, who is watching the
retailer with guarded optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Payless still has many hurdles to overcome, Duggan said,
including getting cheaper, more flexible financing.
</P>
<P>
   Once that is done, perhaps within a few weeks, Payless expects
to go back on industry-standard payment terms with its vendors,
which also should help the company. Already, Payless has told its
vendors that it expects such terms and that if they can't comply,
the company will look for goods elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan lauds the company for its cost-conscious stance,
including news last week that it was moving its corporate
headquarters from downtown Kansas City to less expensive real
estate in Lee's Summit.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect that is frustrating shareholders is Payless' stock
price. For months it has hovered in the low $2-a-share range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is at $2 for a reason, and that's because the
believers have not yet arrived at the table,'' Duggan said. ``But
when they do, I think it'll be an $8 stock.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Cell Phones to Beep Hot Deals to Owners  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
As if billboards, television and radio weren't enough, advertisers
have found a new way to reach out and touch consumers _ through
their cell phones.
<P>
   An Alameda company called Geoworks Corp. is launching a service
today  &LR; t &LR; hat will alert consumers about promotional deals at
various stores and eateries through their wireless phone or pager.
</P>
<P>
   Stores like Virgin Records, for example, will be able to send
customers a text message telling them that the ``Austin Powers'' CD
is on sale for a few hours only.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike direct mail or e-mail solicitations, which are
usually unsolicited, these pitches will only go to people who sign
up for the Discopro.com service. Discopro is short for discount
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to get the ads will choose which companies they
want to receive information from, as well as how often and what
time of day they want the promotions to reach their cell phone or
pager.
</P>
<P>
   Customers will then receive information about deals being
offered by the various companies that participate in Discopro.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers may get a message saying `Come into Noah's Bagels
and get three free bagels,''' said Dave Grannan, president and CEO
of Geoworks. ``If a customer is on their way to work, they can pull
right in and take advantage of the promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefit to the advertiser is that the customer will probably
buy something else while he or she is in the store and probably
return for another visit, Grannan said. Advertisers pay Geoworks an
undisclosed fee to participate in the service.
</P>
<P>
   Discopro.com is free for consumers and available to anyone with
an alphanumeric pager or a digital cell phone that has text
messaging.
</P>
<P>
   To sign up, customers must go to  &LR; www.discopro.com &LR;  and give
their name and mobile phone or pager number. They are alerted to
incoming advertisements by a beep or ring.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, about 20 companies have signed up to advertise with
Discopro.com, including Virgin Records, Noah's, Hollywood Video and
T.G.I Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Grannan said he expects to at least double the number of
advertisers soon. Companies pay Geoworks a fee to be included in
the Discopro.com database.
</P>
<P>
   While the service is the first of its kind, it is part of a
growing trend to match up advertisers and consumers via a mobile
device.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Vicinity Corp. of Palo Alto let customers find
the nearest Starbucks or Marriott Hotel simply by pushing a few
buttons on their cell phone. And customers who use the new Palm VII
from 3Com's Palm Computing can access retailers with the Palm's
wireless Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   But Discopro.com is the first service to send promotional
information to a cell phone, industry watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Grannan said Geoworks decided to launch the service after asking
customers what they wanted from their wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we think is compelling is that it's completely consumer
controlled. You decide what you want to receive, as well as when
and where you want to get the information,'' Grannan said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is targeting a wide range of consumers, including
professionals and teenagers, Grannan said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Grannan is bullish on the service's future, industry
watchers say it may not be an instant success.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Enderle, vice president of Giga Information Group in Santa
Clara, said the success of Discopro.com will depend on how the
information is presented to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how invasive the advertising is,'' Enderle said.
``If the right kind of companies use the service and the
advertising is more entertaining than obtrusive, then than  &LR; yes,
you can drive purchasing activity.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the types of advertising that will work with this
service are limited, Enderle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good for things people want instantaneously,'' he
said. ``Less reliable are ads for large capital purchases, like a
washing machine.''

McKessonHBOC Dumps Its Top Management &HT;    
 &HT;    By Tom Abate &HT;    c.1999 The San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the biggest corporate bloodbaths ever, McKessonHBOC
Inc. said yesterday that it fired five top executives and two
others resigned in the wake of an accounting scandal that has cut
its stock value by more than half.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkably blunt statement, McKesson said its board of
directors had ``removed'' Charles W. McCall as McKesson's chairman
and ``dismissed'' him as an employee _ without a severance package.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking over as McKesson's chairman in January, McCall had
been chief executive of HBO &AMP; Co., the Atlanta software firm that
drug-distribution company McKesson acquired in January for $13.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In April, McKesson announced that before the merger, HBOC had
improperly booked millions of dollars in revenues. The revelation
cut McKesson's share price in half in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   Four of McCall's HBOC lieutenants, who joined McKesson, were
also sacked yesterday. Albert Bergonzi, David Held, Jay Lapine and
Michael Smeraski were ``dismissed immediately for cause,'' McKesson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Seelenfreund, a McKesson director who took over as interim
chairman yesterday, said McKesson fired the five former HBO
executives because the board believed they intentionally hid
accounting irregularities before the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have identified the persons responsible and they have been
dismissed for cause,'' said Seelenfreund, a former McKesson
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McKesson Chief Executive Officer Mark Pulido and
Chief Financial Officer Richard Hawkins have resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Seelenfreund said the board thought Pulido and Hawkins were
blameless for the actions at HBO. ``But they were the company's
senior officers and this situation occurred on their watch,''
Seelenfreund said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Valiquette, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, said
Pulido had to accept responsibility for the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson has lost $8.8 billion in market value since the
problems at HBO surfaced and about $15.1 billion since the merger
plan was announced in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McKesson board was opposed to the acquisition of HBO but
Pulido was aggressive in wanting to pursue it,'' Valiquette told
Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson said yesterday it has promoted two executive vice
presidents, John Hammergren and David Mahoney, to share the job of
chief executive officer. Seelenfreund said their appointment was
permanent. Hammergren will run the firm's day-to-day operations
while Mahoney will be responsible for strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of McKesson dropped $2.38 yesterday, or 6.6 percent, to
close at $33.69. Although analysts cheered the board's action, they
were leery of the continued uncertainties. McKesson said it
probably will miss the June 30 deadline for filing its 1998 10-K
statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission, since
auditors continue to probe HBO's books.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really positive move for the board to take such
decisive action to rebuild investor confidence,'' said Amy Brodsky,
an analyst with Vector Securities International in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate governance experts said the number of executives and
the wording of yesterday's terminations were highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is exceedingly rare when a company says an executive is
fired or fired for cause,'' said Judith Fischer, managing director
of Executive Compensation Advisory Services in Virginia.
``Corporations usually more or less pay executives to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1997, Walter Forbes of CUC International and
Henry Silverman of HFS brought their firms together in a $14
billion merger that created Cendant Corp. That merger erupted in
accusations of pre-merger accounting improprieties at CUC. Even so,
Forbes walked away with $47.5 million in severance.
</P>
<P>
   Seelenfreund said yesterday that McCall ``doesn't have a
severance package and isn't going to get one.'' He said the other
four fired executives would get no severence pay ``unless we're
contractually obligated.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall, Smeraski and Held could not be reached for comment.
Bergonzi and Lapine declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   As for Pulido and Hawkins, Seelenfreund said ``no special
provision'' has been made for severance. But he said both should be
entitled to severance ``in the course of normal policies.'' Those
packages will not be reported until McKesson files its year-end
statement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Mark Pulido earned $2.6 million in salary, bonus and
other nonoption pay. In addition, he was awarded new options which
the company valued at $5.7 million.
