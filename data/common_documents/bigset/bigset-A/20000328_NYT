ERSTAD WILL HIT LEADOFF, PERIOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Darin Erstad has spent his career bouncing
around in the lineup, hitting leadoff one night, third the next,
fifth or sixth the next. But manager Mike Scioscia made it clear
from the beginning of camp that Erstad, despite his struggles last
season, would be his leadoff hitter in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad has been viewed as a No.3-type hitter in the past, but he
looks more like a leadoff hitter now, bunting and stealing bases.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's 6-2 loss to the Colorado Rockies, Erstad had two
hits, including a bunt single, and a stolen base. His four steals
this spring lead the team. He's hitting .400 (26 for 65) and his
on-base percentage is .414.
</P>
<P>
   ``It benefits me as a player all-around to be able to do those
things,'' Erstad said. ``It widens the range of what I can do.
During times you're not swinging the bat well, you need to find
ways to get on base.''
</P>
<P>
   ORTIZ IMPRESSIVE: Ramon Ortiz threw three scoreless innings _
allowing only one hit _ in a minor-league game at Mesa. Pitching
for Triple-A Edmonton against Tacoma, Ortiz struck out four, did
not walk a batter and was clocked between 90-94 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz made 30 pitches in the game, then pitched more in the
bullpen afterward. Diagnosed with a small tear in the tissue of his
right shoulder two weeks ago, Ortiz will pitch Saturday in Mesa in
another minor-league game and go four or five innings. Then on
April 6, he'll pitch the season opener for the Single-A Lake
Elsinore Storm, which will put him on schedule to make his season
debut April 11 in Anaheim. &QL;

MICHIGAN STATE TRIO THE PRIDE OF FLINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ In the foreground of the barren Buick plant in
this town that prosperity forgot, weeds cover asphalt basketball
courts like cobwebs and the bare rims rise like wraiths. To stare
at the starkness is to get no sense of the assembly-line efficiency
with which Flint has been cranking out sleek, high-powered,
reliable basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   Hope abandoned the auto factory years ago, but it didn't go far,
taking up residence at Berston Fieldhouse just a couple blocks over
and a few miles up the road. It is there, inside a Chuck Taylor
shoebox of a gym, that Glen Rice honed his basketball skills. And
Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson and Charlie Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, Peterson and Bell are known around the Michigan State
campus as The Flintstones because this is their home. It is by no
means a fashionable place to be from any more, not since General
Motors moved out and despair swooped in to fill the yawning void.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vehicle City'' is known more for crime than chrome these days.
Last month the city was back leading the national news, not for any
cutting edge feat of industry and engineering but because one of
its first graders cut short a classmate's life with the blast of a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   The city of 132,000 is routinely dismissed by outsiders as so
dangerous and downtrodden as to be unlivable. The John Rockers of
this world probably would place it a notch below Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Spartans from Flint wear their roots proudly, on
their sleeveless arms and strong shoulders but mostly on their blue
collars.
</P>
<P>
   This past Saturday, with time winding down in the NCAA
Tournament Midwest Regional Final at Auburn Hills, The Flintstones
formed the bedrock of Michigan State's 75-64 win over Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   With a little over two minutes to play, Cleaves lobbed the
basketball to Peterson for a rim-and-roof-rattling dunk that gave
the No.1-seeded Spartans the first bit of breathing room they had
enjoyed all night against the Cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   The alley-oop jam was the silver hood ornament in a 12-0 run
engineered by Cleaves, Peterson and Bell. A run that effectively
delivered Michigan State, which had trailed by as many as eight
points in the second half, to the Final Four this week in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The city that spawned the United Autoworkers' Union could
appreciate more than most the Spartans' comeback under Cleaves'
foremanship. Because in Michigan State's toughness and camaraderie
and unselfishness in its second half against Iowa State the people
of Flint saw themselves.
</P>
<P>
   You can take the boys out of Flint but you can't take Flint out
of the boys. That's what the The Flintstones' tattoos suggest,
that's what people here say and that's why this city is deriving no
small satisfaction from seeing Michigan State take its place among
college basketball's elite just as Flint once did among the world's
automakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Flint has become their village because they are a
team,'' said Cleaves' mother, Frances, referring to Michigan State.
``There's no big I's or little U's on this team. We learned that
from being union people.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Cleaves worked for General Motors for 22 years before
retiring in 1998, as the company was embarking on the final phase
of its massive downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a doddering town elder to remember a day
when General Motors utilized a transition break with shimmering
success. The automaker ran workers in and out of its plants here in
waves so there was never a lull in production.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the demand for bodies, both parents were likely to be
working, more likely than not a swing shift and quite possibly
alongside cousins and aunts and uncles. So early on, year-round
community sports programs became another link in the chain, their
formation driven by the need to occupy the children whose guardians
were otherwise engaged making cars.
</P>
<P>
   Berston Fieldhouse is a clean and compact case in point. A
historical marker planted just outside the entrance proclaims that
the recreation center was opened in 1923 and was the first of its
kind in the city to admit African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk recently of tearing down the building, which also
houses an auditorium and a swimming pool. But the community rushed
to the rescue of a place that has saved an awful lot of kids over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   On a morning last weekend, the gym stood empty. A worn leather
basketball sat on one baseline, waiting patiently for a pick-up
game. A kind of hush had settled over the room, the quiet broken
only by the strains of laughter and music wafting from a children's
dance class taking place across the hall.
</P>
<P>
   During the summers the gym is a hub for hoops. Everybody from
Flint who is anybody in basketball has at one time graced its court
(just as many now grace the center's picture-lined walls).
</P>
<P>
   Kids can learn the fundamentals and play in organized leagues,
starting in grade school. The Lakers' Rice was a scrawny seventh
grader when his raw skills came to the attention of longtime
Northwestern High coach Grover Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school senior, Rice averaged 28 points despite playing
little more than a half most nights for a Northwestern team that
went 28-0 and beat all its opponents save one by at least 30
points. The point guard who fed Rice was Andre Rison, the All-Pro
NFL receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Pendelton, who would go on to play at USC, was a junior
on that unbeaten team. Other prominent Northwestern products
include Jeff Grayer, who played at Iowa State and in the NBA for
nine years, and Desmon Farmer, who will attend USC this fall. Then
there's Kelvin Torbert, a junior, who is going to make some college
coach a very happy man in the fall of 2001 (unless he decides to
jump straight to the NBA).
</P>
<P>
   The kids who take part in the city programs are drilled in
everything from how to make a bounce pass in the lane to how to
make a passing grade in school. Coaches go one-on-one with the
players in the classrooms, trying to impress upon them from an
early age the need for good habits on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some of Flint's finest players fall through cracks as
ugly as the ones sprouting weeds on the courts in front of the
abandoned Buick plant. Kirkland, in an interview the other day on
the Northwestern High campus, recalled a kid who was Cleaves' equal
on the court but who couldn't get through high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of kids like that,'' Kirkland said. ``It's an
ongoing battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The ones, like Cleaves, who make it tend to be tougher for
having survived. Their resolve is reinforced on the playgrounds, in
the downtown YMCA, at Berston; wherever players gather to see who
gets next.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches are constantly on their kids to defend their turf.
``We're really tough on them,'' said Kirkland. He will admonish his
players not to let the wino with the sweet jumper make a few shots
off them, explaining, ``Then he'll come back and bring along his
buddies and suddenly you'll have lost the court to a leader going
the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   He lectures them to surround themselves with positive
influences, to steer clear of good friends with bad intentions.
Kirkland's day is made whenever he hears of kids picking their ball
up and going home when troublemakers come looking for a game and
possibly a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   For a city that has been slowly bleeding to death, the success
of Cleaves, Peterson and Bell at Michigan State on the court and in
the classroom has been as good as a tourniquet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing a lot of our industry and all the other things
that come along with losing jobs,'' Frances Cleaves said. ``The
Flintstones send to Flint the message that we have a respectable
place in the United States of America.'' &QL;

U.S. TAKES STEPS TO RETURN 6-YEAR-OLD TO FATHER IN CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs for updating, rewriting throughout; story is now an
added starter on The New York Times front page) 
 (sw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department threatened on Monday night
to take custody of Elian Gonzalez as early as Thursday to return
him to Cuba unless his Miami relatives agreed explicitly to
surrender the 6-year-old if they lost their court battle to keep
him here.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, a federal appeals court in Atlanta said it
would hear arguments in the case during the week of May 8, which
could complicate the department's plans.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives, Justice
Department officials wrote that if they did not get a specific
written commitment that the boy would be turned over for return to
Cuba, ``We would have no choice but to move forward with the
termination of Elian's parole as of Thursday at 9 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   That means immigration authorities would take control of Elian
at that time, although officials would not say how they would do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Justice Department officials have acknowledged that they
could use the U.S. Marshal's Service to take custody of the boy,
but they have insisted that they hope that in such an event the
relatives would not resist and make such a move necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Officials scheduled a meeting early Tuesday morning at the
regional offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
Miami with the lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives to try to
resolve the situation. But Justice Department officials warned that
they would insist on an unambiguous statement from the relatives
that if they lost the legal appeals they would not obstruct efforts
to return Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials laid the groundwork for taking
control of Elian by asserting that the boy's Miami relatives had
failed to comply with a government order to say explicitly that
they would not block his return to his father in Cuba if they lost
their court fight.
</P>
<P>
   Seeming to anticipate that some kind of conclusion might be at
hand, a crowd began forming outside the home of the boy's relatives
on Monday afternoon. Supporters of the family's efforts to keep
Elian in the United States staged a candlelight vigil on Monday
evening and repeated their intentions to prevent government
officials from taking him away.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters responded to a call by the Democracy
Movement, an anti-Castro group, to be prepared to form a human
chain around the home if the government tries to remove the child
and send him back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who aren't willing to kill but are
willing to die only for the child's rights,'' said Ramon Saul
Sanchez, head of the Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Scott, 50, arrived from Houston on Monday to join the
protest. ``Over our dead bodies, they will not take him,'' Scott
said.
</P>
<P>
   The rising emotions seemed also to be a result, at least in
part, of the first television interview with Elian, broadcast on
Monday morning by ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, Elian was not asked whether he wanted to return to Cuba.
But he described how the boat that was taking him and his mother
from Cuba sank, and he said he did not believe that his mother was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Elian drew crayon pictures of the voyage in which his mother and
10 other people drowned. He was found clinging to an inner tube on
Thanksgiving and placed with his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is not in heaven, not lost,'' he said in Spanish
through his cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez. ``She must have been
picked up here in Miami somewhere. She must have lost her memory,
and just doesn't know I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the relatives and their lawyers have said repeatedly
that they will not violate any laws in their efforts to keep Elian
in the United States. But they have declined to be more specific
and to comply with the Justice Department's demand.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, said in an
interview, ``We have said and we continue to affirm that the family
will obey the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether that meant that the family agreed to accept
sending Elian back if the courts ruled against them, Coffey replied
that he was ``reluctant to speak to that because we are far from
that moment.'' He said he thought the general statement that the
family would comply with the law was ``more than sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers disagree, regarding the careful
statements by the family lawyers as holding on to their options to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's letter from the Justice Department, Michael A.
Pearson, the executive associate commissioner of the immigration
service, told Spencer Eig, one of the lawyers for the Miami
relatives, that the immigration commissioner first ruled on Jan. 5
that Elian should go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly 12 weeks have passed since the commissioner's decision
and you have never provided us with a simple, clear statement that
your client is willing to produce the child when requested to do so
by the I.N.S.,'' Pearson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, David J. Kline, a lawyer in the immigration office of
the department, said the government had the authority to terminate
permission for Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to have
temporary custody of the boy. But Kline said the department would
agree to Gonzalez's having continued custody only if the relatives
said clearly that they would send Elian back three days after they
lost in the appeals court unless they obtained an injunction from a
court allowing them to file an expedited appeal with the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Kline also demanded that Elian's relatives in Miami agree to an
expedited schedule of arguments before the appeals court that would
have the case argued and ready for a decision by April 4. But the
appeals court on Monday may have made the department's case more
difficult by agreeing to a slower schedule.

L.A. OWES TAXPAYERS MILLIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mayor Richard Riordan announced Monday that the
city overcharged taxpayers as much as $17 million for a 1988 bond
issue and must pay back the money _ an unprecedented step that
escalated his struggle over power and policy with the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan cited the goof in stepping up pressure to make the
Finance Department created by the new voter-approved City Charter
responsible for virtually all money matters.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after Riordan announced how various agencies with
divided responsibility had fouled up the bond issue charges, the
City Council panel implementing the new charter rejected his
proposal to consolidate revenue projections, debt management and
related matters in the Finance Department.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the threat of a mayoral veto, the council's Ad Hoc
Committee on Charter Implementation recommended that the City
Administrative Office retain that authority and report to both the
mayor and the City Council when the new charter takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is one of providing information,'' Councilwoman
Jackie Goldberg said. ``And I have no confidence that this mayor or
any mayor would share information with the council.''
</P>
<P>
   Council members Laura Chick and Mike Feuer, both seeking
citywide office, supported keeping financial management in various
departments for now but said they would consider changes after the
new charter takes effect in July.
</P>
<P>
   About all the mayor and the council members could agree on was
that property owners had been overcharged by $12 million to $18
million for the $65 million bond issue and that refunds _ which
officials called an unprecedented act _ would need to be made to
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   While the final figures will be determined through an
independent audit, officials estimated residents will get a $12 to
$18 credit on their property tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   The bond issue was for fire and paramedic services and was paid
off last September.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and City Controller Rick Tuttle said the mistake _ in
which the amount needed to cover the cost of the bond's repayment
was miscalculated _ demonstrated the need for a strong Finance
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan initially blamed the City Administrative Office for the
foul-up, but later broadened that to include a number of city
agencies, which he said should have discovered the mistake earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem with the current system,'' Riordan said at
a news conference. ``There is no accountability. That's why we need
a new system. Something like this is intolerable and we have to get
away from the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle said keeping the current system will go against voters'
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the committee keeps the status quo, it will eviscerate all
the efforts that are being made to strengthen our ability to
efficiently pursue financial functions,'' Tuttle said.
</P>
<P>
   However, City Administrative Officer Bill Fujioka differed with
Riordan and Tuttle and said it was his office that discovered the
mistake and initially proposed the taxpayer refund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We identified this problem in late December and we brought it
to the attention of the Mayor's Office,'' Fujioka said. ``We also
went to the City Attorney's Office, who advised us we had to refund
the money. We went back to the Mayor's Office and they wanted us to
look at ways to keep the money and use it to balance the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Kelly Martin disputed Fujioka's account.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did ask if we could use the money, but we only got the
legal opinion last Friday telling us we needed to refund it,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only recently learned about all this. Last year, the CAO
was telling us we had this money we could use for the budget. Now,
they say we have to return it. This whole debate goes to the issue
of the quality of information we are getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said Riordan wants the authority over revenue projections
and debt management to make the city more efficient and place
accountability over the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is one of the most expensively run cities and one
of the least efficient,'' Martin said. ``That was part of the
reason for charter reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and Fujioka have been at odds for several months, with
Riordan asking him to step down from the job. Since then, Fujioka
has shown a strong independent streak, clashing frequently with the
Mayor's Office on policy issues.

   GUYANA-HAMMOCK-WEAVERS (Lethem, Guyana) _ This village in the
remote southern savannah could easily be taken for one of those
places untouched by the digital revolution. But it was here that an
organization formed by indigenous women of two tribes revived the
ancient art of hand-weaving large hammocks from locally grown
cotton _ and then took their exquisite wares online. They hired a
young member to create a Web site. And last year, they sold 17
hammocks to people around the world for as much as $1,000 apiece.
But threatened by the women's success, regional leaders moved in
and took control of the weavers' organization. The woman who
created the Web site quit in a fury, and the group has been

helped New Jersey companies create hundreds of thousands of jobs.

on drugs produced by genetic engineering. In partnership with
Aventis, the big European drug company, it wants to sell its own
version of Amgen Inc.'s Epogen, the biotechnology industry's
biggest drug with worldwide sales of about $4 billion. Amgen has

PRACTICE-FLOOR FIGHT PUTS FLOODLIGHT ON SONICS LACK OF LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What happened at Sonics practice Sunday was not, in
terms of team-building morale, Wally Walker's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   But that could have been only because just before bed the team
president ate a lot of pizza slathered with jalapenos and
anchovies.
</P>
<P>
   When a sagging team's volatile superstar and a volatile reserve
get into such a locker-room fracas that the starting center is
injured breaking it up, it is time to search out a new job or a new
team. Especially if everyone was pulling for the volatile reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Walker, besides the WNBA entry, there is no
new team in town. And so far, Walker has evinced no desire for a
new job.
</P>
<P>
   That means the only alternative for him and the Sonics is to sit
helplessly for the next five weeks until the Lakers put them out of
their misery in the playoffs' first round.
</P>
<P>
   Which will provide the answer to an unusual question:
</P>
<P>
   How many implosions can one sports market stand?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I suppose the Sonics have another option: Let Payton lead
the team out of the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Payton had an opportunity to lead his team Sunday. Instead, he
let a fairly common practice-court trash-talk session with Maxwell
unravel into a locker-room melee.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a shoulder injury to Horace Grant, which
contributed to a loss to San Antonio Monday night _ the Sonics'
fourth in a row _ which contributed to the steep plunge down the
playoff ladder, as well as to an impression that the Sonics are in
chaos because maybe only Maxwell (who earned well his nickname Mad
Max) in the entire organization has the guts to stand up to Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Although team sources said Walker fined Payton and Maxwell,
Walker reiterated Monday night that he never discloses fines. But
he did indirectly acknowledge that the fight, regardless of its
origins and responsibility, was and is a potentially dangerous
moment because of its long-term impact on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have teammates watching out of the corner of their
eyes to see if everything's OK,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the immediacy of Grant's injury, the loss of trust in
the team's leader is the primary casualty of the latest episode.
His teammates don't know when Payton is going to go off, the
identity of the target, or whether to ignore or take on the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The lame excuse, ``That's just Gary being Gary,'' no longer cuts
it.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and coach Paul Westphal had a chance to lay down some law
by suspending both players for a game for conduct detrimental.
Grant's injury, and his noble if misguided attempts to hide the
truth from many in the media Monday night, was the physical proof
that matters were so far out of hand that serious action is
required.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how Payton and his defenders spin it, and no matter
the degree of Maxwell's provocation, Payton has to know the line
between his ego and the team's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   A real leader averts foolishness. A real leader leaves the
argument on the court. A real leader breaks up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Payton did none of that.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicling Payton's mercurial moods has been a sports section
staple for much of his decade in Seattle. So has chronicling his
superb skills and toughness that make him one of the game's elite.
The conventional wisdom has been that a lot of superstars are the
same way, and anyway, the good Gary always outweighed the bad Gary.
</P>
<P>
   This season is different.
</P>
<P>
   The team was built around and for good Gary and took his input
that, ``We need more ghetto.'' It was Payton who advocated for
Maxwell. Walker even filled a roster spot with a veteran, Chuck
Person, whose primary job was to help Payton develop a little touch
on his emotional throttle.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Payton had to be more than he had been. He had to
not only take charge, but be supportive of teammates and coaches.
No longer could he defer the job to older players such as Nate
McMillan, Sam Perkins, Detlef Schrempf or even Shawn Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   The good Gary had to be so much more prominent than the bad Gary
that it would be a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, there were positive signs. But these days, the
Sonics are in a death spiral. They have fallen to the eighth and
final playoff spot and are 13-17 since the seasonal high point, a
27-13 record on Jan. 20. They have not beaten a club with a winning
record since Charlotte Feb. 28, a game the outplayed Sonics
admitted was a mystery as to how they won.
</P>
<P>
   Now is when Payton's leadership is needed most. Instead, he
abdicated.
</P>
<P>
   If Payton will not lead, Walker and Westphal had the chance to
show that they will lead by finally taking the risk of challenging
their star with a one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Really, what is the risk? That Payton will be mad? He is
already.
</P>
<P>
   That they will play worse? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   That they will lose his energy and spirit? As if they were going
to beat the Lakers in a first-round match up with him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard question for any sports franchise: How to punish a
star without blunting the edginess that made him great.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point for this team, they had little to lose.
Excusing and coddling Payton's excesses only embarrasses the
franchise and creates resentments in the other players.
</P>
<P>
   A comeback from a suspension also would have given Payton, at
31, an opportunity to show that he is a bigger player than his
numbers.

OSCAR SHOW TOO LONG? BLAME THE STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Television critic David Kronke contributed to this
story.) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe Sunday's record-long Academy Awards show
would have been shorter had winners taken a cue from last year's
Best Actor winner Roberto Benigni and climbed over seats to get to
stage.
</P>
<P>
   The cavernous Shrine Auditorium stage was blamed as one of the
reasons the scheduled three-hour show became the longest Oscar
telecast ever at four hours, eight or nine minutes, depending on
who you believe.
</P>
<P>
   Academy President Robert Rehme said Monday that it took more
time for presenters and winners to make their entrances and exits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge stage. That may have made the show longer
because the walks were longer,'' Rehme said. ``I think it was the
most use of that stage in its history. It's the largest stage in
North America and we showed all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Any concern Rehme, a film producer, felt about the length of the
broadcast was overshadowed by the pleasure he took in counting the
academy's income from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year the show grossed the highest ever, international and
domestic,'' Rehme said. He declined to reveal that sum, which pays
the academy's operating costs for the year, but the figure for the
1999 awards was $26.5 million, according to the academy's annual
report.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which has the Oscar telecast contract through 2008, was
also celebrating. The show brought in the second-highest ratings in
the past five years, outdone only by the year ``Titanic'' swept the
awards.
</P>
<P>
   The network said some 46.3 million Americans were tuned in for
Sunday's entire show, and 79 million saw at least part of it, up
from 77.6 million the year before. Across the country it averaged a
29.2 rating and a 48 share, up from a 28.6 rating and a 46 share
last year. In Los Angeles, the No. 1 market for Oscar ratings, it
averaged a 42.7 rating and a 61 share. Chicago was the
second-largest market, despite the later broadcast in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Viewership peaked in the 10-10:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
block with 50.3million viewers nationwide, then plummeted to 39.2
million just after midnight when the last network commercial aired.
(Because no spots aired in the final 23 minutes, there is no rating
reported for when ``American Beauty'' finally was announced as Best
Picture).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get 79 million people to watch, we're not
complaining,'' ABC spokesman Dan Doran said. ``One of our research
executives said if we get a third of the country watching our
commercials at one time, we have nothing to complain about.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means we are unlikely to see any remedies soon.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly at the Oscar nominees' luncheon earlier this month,
producer Richard Zanuck said the show's theme was ``keep it
short.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, his wife and co-producer, Lili Fini Zanuck, said,
``When we took this on we had to open up our big mouths and say we
were going to make it shorter. And before we even aired we knew we
were going to run long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The run-throughs were really long. We tried to tighten it up
but only saved about a minute. It's just a long show,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehme agreed. ``The show's a long show. We're aware of it but
there's not a heck of a lot we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He defended the film montage sequences dealing with the history
of the world according to Hollywood and the salute to child actors,
saying if those had been cut altogether it would have spared only
seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, after all, about film, and we want to have film
packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehme also praised Burt Bacharach's star-studded medley of past
Oscar-winning songs, which went on long enough for everybody at a
typical home Oscar party to take a bathroom break.
</P>
<P>
   Lili Zanuck said she and her husband won't be repeating the
assignment next year. ``I wouldn't do it unless we could outdo what
we did, and right now I don't have those ideas in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   She reflected on the show at the Governors Ball less than an
hour after its conclusion. Asked about the length, she asked the
reporter, ``Did it feel long to you?''
</P>
<P>
   It felt plenty long to some. Best Director winner Sam Mendes
(``American Beauty'') told the Guardian in London that ``it felt
like a week'' before his category, the second to last of the
evening, came up.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Mitchell, film critic for The New York Times, suggested
that the back-loading of the most interesting categories later in
the show than usual actually made it seem longer than it was.
</P>
<P>
   If they had offered up Best Supporting Actor earlier, he said,
``it would have been a little bit of meat to help you sit through
the rest of the vegetables that are bad for you to get to the rest
of the meat. It was like getting a Snickers with just one peanut.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he believes the length of the telecast will drive
viewers away in droves, Mitchell said, ``No. That's the classic
thing about pain. You forget about it until you experience it
again.''

EX-NORTHRIDGE COACH GOES ON OFFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Ron Ponciano, the Cal State Northridge
football coach fired eight months ago for violating NCAA and
university policies, finally is being heard.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano, in his official response to the investigation that led
to his firing, accuses CSUN of distorting evidence and contends he
was a ``sacrificial lamb'' for the athletic department's lack of
control of the football program. He is seeking a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News has obtained a copy of the response to the
investigative report, which was written by internal auditor Peter
Dinauer and Tom Shannon, Northridge's faculty athletic
representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Football Audit misrepresents witness statements,
mischracterizes (sic) facts, reaches unsupportable conclusions,
slanders Coach Ponciano, and foists blame on Coach Ponciano for
which he bears no responsibility,'' writes Ponciano's lawyer, Scott
Campbell, in the 208-page document's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who works for the Santa Barbara firm of Rogers,
Sheffield and Herman, sent Ponciano's response to CSU legal counsel
Pat Carroll in January. Campbell accuses CSUN of ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems likely that no one with significant NCAA Division I
football experience reviewed the Football Audit and that no such
person was consulted prior to CSUN's decision to terminate Coach
Ponciano.''
</P>
<P>
   The report goes on to contest each of Dinauer's findings against
Ponciano that led to Ponciano's July 16, 1999 termination, and says
Dinauer's investigation was ``clearly ... prosecutorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell promises civil action if the CSU system doesn't settle
Ponciano's claim of wrongful termination, and said he and Ponciano,
now an assistant at Valley College, will attend the NCAA's April 14
hearing to determine sanctions against CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Football Audit and the NCAA investigation it spawned has
destroyed Coach Ponciano and his career,'' Campbell writes. ``He is
an `untouchable' in Division I ranks, and may well be tainted for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge is imposing its own penalties for the NCAA
infractions described in Dinauer's report, including a reduction of
two scholarships in each of the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The CSU system is also in the final stage of settling a $6
million claim filed by football assistants Keith Borges and Craig
Wall. Borges and Wall say they have been blackballed from coaching
by CSUN for their cooperation in Dinauer's investigation. &QL;

   SEATTLE _ Sonics guards Gary Payton and Vernon Maxwell were
involved in a fierce altercation Sunday that ended practice,
injured at least two teammates and threatened to fracture the
team's already fragile morale.
</P>
<P>
   Starting center Horace Grant did not play against the San
Antonio Spurs Monday night after bruising his left shoulder while
helping separate Maxwell and Payton. Swingman Chuck Person, already
on the injured list, aggravated his surgically repaired left knee
while trying to play peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that shouldn't have happened, but it
happened,'' said Grant, who will undergo an MRI exam Tuedsday if
his shoulder does not improve. ``Things happen in the heat of
battle. ... We just need a win. We get a win and everything will be
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident boiled over after a heated scrimmage during which
Maxwell and Payton continuously exchanged barbs. Sources said the
scene became so intense in the locker room afterward that Payton
picked up a chair, at which point Maxwell stormed into the training
room looking to grab a free weight. Both players were restrained
before making physical contact.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell eventually got dressed in an office and was escorted out
of the team's practice facility by forward Vin Baker. Later, Baker,
apparently acting as mediator, spoke with Payton in the parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell declined comment Monday night when asked about the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an argument,'' Payton said. ``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonics president Wally Walker said he talked to Maxwell on
Sunday night and to Payton early Monday. Walker refused to discuss
whether Payton and Maxwell would be fined, suspended or both.
Walker would say only that he encouraged both players to work out
their differences.
</P>
<P>
   However, club sources said Maxwell and Payton were fined
undisclosed amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell had a new locker location in KeyArena Monday night. He
had been situated directly to the left of Payton. Instead, Maxwell
used a locker that Lazaro Borrell occupied across the room.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute apparently did nothing to disrupt Maxwell and
Payton's chemistry on the court. The pair exchanged high fives and
patted each other's backside at times throughout the game Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both were wrong, and I told them that,'' Walker said. ``They
have to work it out between the two of them so it doesn't affect
the team and staff. If they put the onus on the team to settle
this, they won't like what could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both assured me that it was over,'' Walker said. ``They said
they want to put the problem behind them. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell and Payton went hard at each other throughout the team's
workout Sunday. When it became obvious both players were driven by
more than competitive spirit, coach Paul Westphal ended practice.
What was scheduled to be a lengthy workout ended after about 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Payton walked into the locker room while teammates
encouraged Maxwell to apologize. Maxwell is said to have entered
the locker room ready to resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Payton, still seething, reportedly threw a remote control at
Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   As the two again became enraged, sources said Person restrained
Payton. Grant hurt himself when he subdued Maxwell in the training
room.
</P>
<P>
   Grant received treatment before the game but was unable to play.
Greg Foster started in his place.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time a Maxwell-Payton exchange became
public. The two had to be separated earlier this season after
arguing during a timeout in a game in KeyArena.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ TV cameraman Aaron Fitzgerald didn't think twice
about running through a pool of jet fuel with flames nearby to
rescue another cameraman whose news helicopter had just crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking I need to get him out of there very quickly. I
didn't know if the whole thing was going to go up in flames,''
Fitzgerald said Monday, a day after plucking Phil Arno from the
burning Aerospatiale AS 350B helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Kelley, 28, the pilot of the crashed helicopter, managed to
lift herself out of the wreckage. But Arno, a 40-year-old cameraman
for KTTV-TV Channel 11), was trapped beneath debris and the
helicopter's camera systems and sitting on fuel that spilled out
after the helicopter rolled onto its side.
</P>
<P>
   After pilot Larry Welk landed his helicopter beside the downed
chopper, his partner _ KCBS-TV (Channel 2) cameraman Fitzgerald _
ran toward the wreckage, tore off the chopper's fiberglass roof and
lifted Arno from the pile of debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most heroic things I've ever seen,'' said
Welk, who used his chopper to light up the rescue scene for
Fitzgerald. ``I'm telling you it was divine intervention. The whole
helicopter should have been engulfed in flames.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kelley and Arno were recovering and in stable condition at
Northridge Hospital Medical Center late Monday, hospital officials
said. Kelley escaped with a broken pelvis, knee and wrist. Arno was
in the intensive care unit being observed for a concussion and a
shattered ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley and Arno, a cameraman for Channel 11, were filming the
Academy Awards scene at the Shrine Auditorium on Sunday. Kelley
works for Helinet, a helicopter operator at Van Nuys Airport that
contracts with five Los Angeles stations to provide aerial news and
traffic coverage.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 p.m., Kelley reported having problems with the copter's
hydraulic system, said George Petterson, an air safety investigator
for the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's similar to the power steering on your car, only there's
more resistance,'' Petterson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Welk and Fitzgerald, who were free-lancing for Entertainment
Tonight and still had about an hour left to film the Oscars, heard
Kelley's distress call and immediately put down their camera to
escort Kelley back to Van Nuys Airport northwest of downtown Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Welk, who said he is familiar with training for the copter
Kelley was flying, flew alongside her craft, calmly guiding her
through an emergency checklist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made all of her radio calls for her and cleared traffic for
her so she could pay attention to the steering,'' Welk said. ``She
was doing everything by the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Tur, a former news chopper pilot who now works as a safety
consultant for news stations across the country, questioned whether
Kelley should have been approved to fly this particular helicopter
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Tur, who said he has about 8,000 hours flying A-Stars, said the
helicopters require significant upper-body strength to handle if
the hydraulic system fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman who flew the helicopter is very small _ she's about
5-foot-2. She doesn't have the upper body strength to handle the
failure of the hydraulic system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that upon noticing the problem, Kelley should have
landed at the nearest airport, either Santa Monica or Los Angeles
International, rather than trying to make it back to Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a jam flying, you have to accept you're in a
jam and you have to know when to call for help,'' Tur said.
</P>
<P>
   Helinet Vice President Dave Corsello dismissed Tur's statement
as ``preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true at all,'' Corsello said. ``It's a technique
issue; it's a maneuver issue. It does (take strength) but it's also
technique and the ability to negotiate it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Kelley had plenty of training in hydraulic procedures
during her formal pilot schooling as well as additional in-house
training the company provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was pretty well-trained,'' Corsello said. ``She did a very
good job to get it where it was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both going to live. They're both going to come back to
work. She's great. She's doing fine. She's a little sore _
obviously a couple of broken bones. She's going to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Welk said he was most concerned about Kelley getting fatigued
during the 10- to 15-minute flight. And he said Kelley opted to go
the few miles farther to Van Nuys Airport because that's where her
own mechanic is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're a man or a woman, you get fatigued,'' he said.
``I don't think gender plays a part in it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kelley tried to land at Van Nuys Airport, Welk knew she was
going to have problems, he said. He asked her to try again, but it
was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a critical few moments. The helicopter went around
in four revolutions. It was turning like the teacups at Disneyland.
It was a horrifying sight for me. There was such a sense of
helplessness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the nose pointed downward and the chopper crash-landed,
with the fuel tank rupturing and igniting into flames, Welk said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge fireball came out from the bottom,'' he said. ``I
thought, There's no way they survived. I was heartbroken.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he saw Kelley escape from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought to tears,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fitzgerald sprang into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron only had seconds to get to Phil to see if he's alive,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Nuys Airport officials on Monday praised Fitzgerald and
others for their heroic efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They demonstrated a tremendous amount of bravery and courage
in assisting these victims without concern for their own lives,''
said Charlene Klink, an airport spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Van Nuys is the region's most popular location for news media
helicopters because it allows them to avoid the large commercial
airliners at LAX or Burbank Airport, said Stacy Geere, a
spokeswoman at Van Nuys Airport. There are 10 media helicopters
based at Van Nuys, including the one that crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety is and will continue to be our No. 1 concern in
operating Van Nuys Airport,'' Geere said. ``I think the pilots show
tremendous skill in landing the aircraft on airport property.''
</P>
<P>
   Petterson of the NTSB said a preliminary report on the crash
should be available within five days.
</P>
<P>
   The incident renewed calls from neighborhood activist Gerald
Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, to limit flights of news
helicopters out of Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are far too many helicopters flying out of Van Nuys
Airport over residential properties and homes,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Silver has been seeking a curfew on
helicopters flying out of Van Nuys, prohibiting flights between 10
p.m. and 7 a.m., a practice he said is followed at Santa Monica's
municipal airport.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said it is fortunate the incident did not happen over a
residential neighborhood, but said with the heavy volume of
flights, ``It's only a question of time till that happens. Then
people are going to ask the questions. It's too bad we have to wait
until there's serious fatalities before we do that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to National Transportation Safety Board records,
helicopters from Helinet's corporate predecessor, West Coast
Helicopters, were involved in two fatal crashes and two noninjury
incidents since 1993.

ANOTHER LATE MELTDOWN DOOMS SONICS AGAINST SPURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ While this would seem like the time most playoff-bound
NBA teams find ways to solidify their foundation, the Sonics
suddenly are discovering nothing but cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Their shooting? Broke. Defensive intensity? Inconsistent.
Health? Delicate. Fourth-quarter moxie? Deteriorating. Confidence?
Vanishing like the days in a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' 90-82 loss to the San Antonio Spurs in KeyArena
Monday night went like a bad television re-run. For three quarters,
the Sonics played well enough to win. But once again they
relinquished a lead in the fourth quarter, and what followed was
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics fell apart as if someone hit a detonator. Their
offense sputtered, the defense yielded and the fight slowly seeped
from of their sagging bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the Sonics' fourth consecutive home loss, and an
admission that it is becoming more difficult to keep the team
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're frustrated. I mean there's no keeping us from being
frustrated,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``But we have to
keep in mind the big picture. We're going to make the playoffs so
we're fighting for positioning in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our record is such that we have a good chance to move up,'' he
said. ``We're like everybody else, we'd rather not play the
(top-seeded Los Angeles) Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   The magic number for the Sonics to clinch a playoff spot is
essentially irrelevant. A Sonic victory combined with a Dallas loss
will ensure the postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   However, the team's direction has taken a swift turn from a
route that was impressive to this disappointing stretch. It was
less than two months ago that the Sonics were sitting pretty with
the fourth seed.
</P>
<P>
   They are now in the eighth spot, a half-game behind the
seventh-seeded Sacramento Kings. Still, the Sonics must face a
streaking New York Knicks team Wednesday, and the Kings visit on
Friday. Then, the Sonics travel to Portland on Sunday. They are 0-2
against Sacramento this season and haven't beaten a playoff team
since Charlotte on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   More pressing is the Sonics lost Monday for the fifth time in
their past six games in KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's not going to get any easier,'' backup center Greg
Foster said. ``But it's as simple as this: Either you're going to
be a man about it and stay and work hard, or you're going to run
and hide and quit. It's not too late. We can still get things
clicking and get things back together for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of finding ways to string together several wins, the
Sonics must get healthy. Foster started at center because Horace
Grant is suffering from a bruised left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics may not have Vin Baker in the lineup Wednesday after
he left the game Monday with a left ankle sprain. Baker crashed to
the floor with 2:21 left in the game when he turned his ankle while
attempting a move in the post against San Antonio's Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Baker didn't get his shot off and did not return. He fell, and
the ball rolled out of bounds. There was at least a reason for the
turnover. Otherwise, the Sonics simply froze down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   They led 69-55 with 2:15 to play in the third quarter. San
Antonio stormed in front behind a 22-12 run that bridged the third
and fourth periods. An Antonio Daniels' layup put the Spurs ahead
77-76.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Sonics had little ball movement, rushed shots or
were turned away by the Spurs front line of Duncan and David
Robinson. With 1:22 left in the game, Robinson's dunk capped an
11-2 run that buried the Sonics under a 88-78 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's demoralizing to look at the body language when we lose a
lead,'' Foster said. ``This is the NBA. That's going to happen. But
you've got to be abrasive enough to handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Grant, the team's best interior defender, the Sonics
struggled to contain Duncan (30 points, 18 rebounds) and Robinson
(23 points, 16 rebounds and four blocks).
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, who shot 36-for-89 (40 percent), encountered the
best defensive team in the league. San Antonio entered the game
allowing opponents a league-low 89.9 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio held the Sonics to 16 points and 6-for-20 shooting
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are playing hard, but for some reason or another, we're
not making baskets down the stretch,'' Baker said. ``We've got to
get to the bottom of it before the playoffs start.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant said the team must first cement its psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some confidence here, but it's slowly fading,'' Grant
said. ``We have to believe in each other and play like we trust
each other. ... Guys need to look at themselves and see what's more
important _ winning or individual goals. Where I come from, the
team comes first. Other things you have going on should be
secondary.''

RAY-ART ADDS SOUND STAGE NO. 6
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Sidestepping the effect of ``runaway
production'' by focusing on episodic television production, Ray-Art
Studios is adding a sixth sound stage to its Warner Center complex.
</P>
<P>
   Ray-Art converted a warehouse formerly owned by Boeing Aircraft
and Redken Laboratories to sound stages two years ago and will have
about 120,000 square feet of space by July.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Television has already signed a lease for the new
sound stage and will use it for two shows.
</P>
<P>
   Ray-Art co-owner Robert Papazian declined to name the specific
shows, and Paramount did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Previous shows that have used Ray-Art include ``Nothing
Sacred,'' ``The Love Boat: The Next Wave'' and the feature film
``Blade.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth in TV production has been fueled by the explosion in
the number of new networks, and it has created great local demand
for sound stage space in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Papazian said television series are more likely than feature
films and television movies to stay in Los Angeles because of the
quick turnaround time.
</P>
<P>
   Papazian said his location in suburban Woodland Hills was
especially attractive to television producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're close to the buyers ... We're close to the talent,''
said Papazian, a veteran television producer himself with partner
and Ray-Art co-owner James Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Los Angeles-area sound stages are still on the
lots of the major studios. But in recent years, the studios have
moved more toward leasing property and equipment rather than
investing in it. This has fueled a mini-building boom in sound
stage space, stretching from Toluca Lake to downtown Los Angeles to
Manhattan Beach to Santa Clarita.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are roughly 300 sound stages in Southern
California now.
</P>
<P>
   Papazian said location is an important factor to producers,
along with the physical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached the facility as producers, so when people come
in, we already know their problems,'' Papazian said.
</P>
<P>
   Papazian, who currently is a co-executive producer of the Don
Johnson series ``Nash Bridges,'' said such things as the layout of
the production offices, the communications systems, the arrangement
of parking and even the presence of an on-site commissary are
considered critical by time-strapped TV producers.
</P>
<P>
   Sound stages often sign contracts with production firms to use
the space for a set number of months or years. If they're not using
the space at a certain time, they're often free to sublet it to
other productions. In this fairly tight market, sound stages often
rent for several thousand dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
   Ray-Art's sixth stage will be the only one to have an
audience-rated stage, meaning a show can tape there in front of an
audience. Papazian said it will be the only such stage in the West
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ray-Art's stages are on the small side for feature
films. They are ideal, though, for both television and commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Papazian said he is looking to woo more commercials to Ray-Art
by converting one stage to be used strictly for commercials. TV
spots tend to be effects-heavy, so the studio will be equipped with
a ``green screen'' against which live action can be filmed and
effects put in later.
</P>
<P>
   This seems a smart move: Commercial production has been
especially resilient even during recent L.A. filming downturns.
According to Los Angeles' Entertainment Industry Development
Council, the number of commercial production days for the first two
months of 2000 was up more than 20 percent over the same months in
1999. During the same period, the number of TV production days was
up less than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More growth is likely: Papazian hinted at more stages being
planned, and said Ray-Art's staff of eight will surely grow along
with the studios.

VITESSE BUYS SILICON CHIP MAKER OROLOGIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  CAMARILLO, Calif. _ Moving to expand its chip product line,
Vitesse Semiconductor Inc. on Monday purchased chip maker Orologic
Inc. for $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   Orologic, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., makes
semiconductors that Vitesse wants to offer in conjunction with its
existing chips.
</P>
<P>
   Vitesse, which makes semiconductors for telecommunications
equipment using gallium arsenide rather than silicon, is responding
to customer demands, chief executive officer Lou Tomasetta said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasetta said Orologic's silicon chips add capabilities to the
complete package Vitesse plans to offer its customers.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, along with Vitesse's May 1999 purchase of
network chip maker XaQti (pronounced ``shockti''), creates a more
complete offering, Tomasetta said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vitesse has been focusing on trying to bring complete
solutions to the high-performance communications market. A number
of (our customers) have been asking for this capability in the next
generation,'' Tomasetta said. ``We think this is a potentially very
big area.''
</P>
<P>
   The company projects the combined products will generate $50
million in revenue during fiscal 2001. Market forecasts for 2003
approach $1 billion, Tomasetta said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big market for us to go after,'' he said. ``We're
pretty certain that this is going to make a significant difference
in our revenue stream in 2001. The market is really ready now for a
chip supplier to go in with a complete solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor analyst Arun Veerappan of Robertson Stephens
Securities said Vitesse's recent acquisitions move its chips beyond
the physical layer _ network switching, where the physical
connection to the user is made _ and closer to the infrastructure
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will provide them with a fuller product portfolio that
encompasses an end-to-end solution,'' Veerappan said.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the purchase, Vitesse will issue 5.5 million shares
of stock, adding to its present base of 170 million shares, chief
financial officer Eugene Hovanek said.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to close the transaction by the end of the
week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hovanek said the purchase will have a slight negative effect on
the company's earnings for 2000.

<P>
   Western leaders were quick Monday to praise what French
President Jacques Chirac called the ``brilliant'' election of
Vladimir Putin as Russian president.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's victory means that he is the unchallenged leader; at
least we can agree on that. But the prospects for the Putin era
remain murky.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Stalinism'' is sometimes invoked with reference to
Russia's new president and former spy chief. Unlike Stalin, Putin
has not created a culture of absolute fear; he has, however, done
nothing to discourage official thuggery.
</P>
<P>
   The 52 percent vote for Putin on Sunday gave him an absolute
victory over Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist candidate, who gained
barely half as many votes. So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Grigory Yavlinsky trailed in third place with a sad
but unsurprising 6 percent. Liberals are not very popular in Russia
these days; even the word demokrat is spat out with contempt. Many
see the demokraty as responsible for the country's chaos; there is
a widespread yearning for what Russians like to call the ``strong
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western enthusiasm for Putin is difficult to understand. As
befits a spy, his track record is almost invisible.
</P>
<P>
   He worked briefly for one of the country's best-known reformers,
Anatoly Sobchak. But his successful career in the FSB (as the KGB
is now known) suggests that liberalism is not always his prime
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Only on one issue can we see just where Putin stands. Very
depressing it is, too.
</P>
<P>
   His conduct of the war in Chechnya _ where civilians are as
flies to wanton boys, killed for the Kremlin leaders' sport _ has
been a cynical disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   There is mounting evidence, too, that the lethal bombings that
provided popular support for the assault on Chechnya may have been
the work of agents provocateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Politics in Russia is often surprising. Mikhail Gorbachev, who
was promoted to the Politburo by Leonid Brezhnev, introduced more
radical change than he ever expected to.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin, a Communist apparatchik, did much, despite his
drunkenness and his quixotic despotism, to move Russia towards (a
flawed version of) the market economy and the multiparty system.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on Putin, though the signs are not good.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair started praising Putin the
``modernizer'' on the basis of empty words about reform.
</P>
<P>
   Enormous changes are needed so that Russia can move away from
the robber capitalism that has become a distinguishing feature of
the country in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has said that he wants to make changes to the government
team. If he brings in reformers whose main aim is not
self-enrichment, that would be a welcome change. If, however _ just
as likely _ he brings in some old KGB cronies, the news will only
get worse.
</P>
<P>
   There is, admittedly, a potential chink of light in the
darkness. Putin has talked of the need for ``a dictatorship of
law'' _ in other words, the creation of a civil society, which
Russia so badly needs.
</P>
<P>
   Russians feel alienated from the laws that theoretically protect
them; that must change. If Putin sets Russia on the right road in
this regard, then he will deserve respect.
</P>
<P>
   To praise Putin for a few fine words makes no sense at all,
however. If Putin's Russia becomes a place of tolerance, he will
deserve respect; but killing civilians in order to win an election
is a poor start. &QL;

<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton and President Assad of Syria met in
Geneva Sunday in what may be a last attempt to avoid war in
southern Lebanon this summer.
</P>
<P>
   What was advertised as an attempt to restart Syrian-Israeli
peace talks _ with Clinton trying to accommodate Assad's demand
that a total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights
should be based on U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 _ has now
become a race to prevent a unilateral Israeli withdrawal under fire
from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   For three hours, the two men talked through interpreters at a
meeting in the Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva _ Assad has been
known to exhaust many foreign leaders with up to six hours of
discussions _ as the Syrian leader patiently explained that he was
not going to fall into the same ``peace'' trap as PLO leader Yassir
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   He will not make peace with Israel before guaranteeing the
return of all of the occupied Golan, captured by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat signed a peace settlement with Israel, then failed to
gain a majority of the occupied West Bank or a capital in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and Americans know that Syria will never allow the
Israelis to withdraw from their hopeless war in southern Lebanon
without the return of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   With a Syrian peace still unsigned, Hezbollah guerrillas in
Lebanon _ supported by Syria _ will continue to attack withdrawing
Israeli occupation troops and Palestinian guerrillas may then be
permitted to attack Israel across the international frontier _ just
as they did before 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Israel wants its soldiers out of their occupation zone by July.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has already indicated that it would accept an
international presence on the Golan after an Israeli retreat;
sources in Beirut suggest that U.S. and French troops may be
permitted to man an early warning station on the Heights.
</P>
<P>
   And the Syrians seem resigned to the opening of diplomatic
missions in each other's countries if the Israelis do withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is even said to be prepared to compromise on the exact
line of withdrawal, perhaps accepting continued Israeli control of
the entire shore of Galilee while negotiating on joint water
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But he wants the whole of the Golan back before a full peace.
For this reason, the American administration, playing the Israeli
card as usual, has been lambasting Assad as an ``obstacle to
peace'' _ as if the Syrian desire to implement the U.N. Security
Council Resolution upon which the whole ``peace process'' is based
is somehow designed to obstruct a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Assad believes that the Palestinians were conned into signing
the Oslo agreement in the belief that this would give them Gaza and
the West Bank and a Palestinian capital in Jerusalem and end all
Jewish settlements on their land. It did nothing of the kind.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad's south Lebanon card is a powerful one. If Israel
withdraws, only to find that its northern border is as vulnerable
as it was more than two decades ago _ and this after two Israeli
invasions of Lebanon which cost the lives of at least 19,000
Lebanese and Palestinian civilians _ then Israeli prime minister
Ehud Barak will be seen to have failed in his attempt to cut the
Israeli army's losses in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese, of course, would bear the cost of such a war.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian daily ``Ath-Thawra'' put it quite bluntly just before
Assad left for Geneva: ``President Assad will make no compromise...
on Syria's basic principles'' of exchanging land for peace, its
editor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Syrian radio _ as much a mouthpiece for Assad as the
Damascus press _ insisted that ``Syria wants to reach decisive and
clear results in Geneva to bring the peace process through to a
conclusion.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad claims to like U.S. President Bill
Clinton but it would be difficult to find two more different men.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is a stickler for detail, inexhaustible in his search for
the exact words which will ensure a cease-fire or a peace
agreement, ruthless in pursuit of his political aims _ be it the
return of the occupied Golan Heights or the suppression of an
Islamic insurrection in his own country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton doesn't like detail, he prefers emotion, ``trust'' _
always a sticky quality in high politics _ and will invariably give
way, like all American presidents, under Israeli pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Assad knows all about that pressure; he has fought it ever since
1967 when, as Syrian defense minister, he lost the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, in 1991, he demanded _ and got _ a confidential
letter from then-U.S. Secretary of State James Baker that an
Arab-Israeli peace would be constructed upon U.N. Security Council
Resolution 242.
</P>
<P>
   That historic resolution demands the return of all Arab land
occupied in the 1967 war in return for the security of all states _
including Israel _ in the area.
</P>
<P>
   It is upon that letter that Assad has based his entire
``strategic decision'' for peace. And in return, the Lion of
Damascus _ even the Israelis call him that _ as been called
inflexible, frightened, sick, desperate and brutal. It is a big
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people who believe that Assad is negotiating out of
weakness _ or because he is desperate to bequeath a peace to his
son Bashar _ do not know the president of Syria,'' one of his close
acquaintances remarked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told the Americans to be careful. The Israelis say all
these things but they are making a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assad is determined to get Golan back under the terms of the
U.N. Security Council resolution. He will stick to the letter of
the resolution. He is not going to be another Yassir Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
   True, Assad at 69 looks his age. His voice is gravelly, his
heart condition in 1982 proved his own mortality, his family feud
with his brother Rifaat remains unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is a police state and Assad's enemies rot in the darkest
of prisons. But his suspicions are almost always well-founded, his
fear of entrapment as real as his ability to lock up the Israelis
in their own adventures in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israelis want to leave Lebanon, they must give back
Golan. If they leave without handing back Syria's territory, then
there will be no peace on Israel's northern border with Lebanon.
Abide by the U.N. resolution, Assad says. Again and again and
again.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy, of course, to make the old man look uncompromising.
The U.S. State Department and the American media and all the usual
third-rate opinion-makers map out an easy story to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is dying. He must be forced to accept ``reality'' (i.e.,
American and Israeli power). He is uncompromising. He wants Golan
back before making peace with Israel; so why should he throw a
``spanner in the works'' by demanding land first and peace later?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Assad has seen what happened to Arafat _ who
accepted peace first and got precious little land, no capital in
Jerusalem, no end to Jewish settlements and no return of refugees _
is quietly erased from this scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Assad must be painted black. But his refusal to compromise on
the Baker letter and America's promise of a peace based on U.N.
resolutions is his sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was reminded of that again Sunday when he met
with Assad. So was Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Assad may be prepared to bargain over foreign troops in early
warning stations and the sources of water, but he wants the land
that was Syrian up to that fateful month of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Of all Middle East potentates, Assad is perhaps the only one who
believes that words mean what they say. Land for peace means just
that. All the land. And total peace. And in that order. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad claims to like U.S. President Bill
Clinton but it would be difficult to find two more different men.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is a stickler for detail, inexhaustible in his search for
the exact words which will ensure a cease-fire or a peace
agreement, ruthless in pursuit of his political aims _ be it the
return of the occupied Golan Heights or the suppression of an
Islamic insurrection in his own country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton doesn't like detail, he prefers emotion, ``trust'' _
always a sticky quality in high politics _ and will invariably give
way, like all American presidents, under Israeli pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Assad knows all about that pressure; he has fought it ever since
1967 when, as Syrian defense minister, he lost the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, in 1991, he demanded _ and got _ a confidential
letter from then-U.S. Secretary of State James Baker that an
Arab-Israeli peace would be constructed upon U.N. Security Council
Resolution 242.
</P>
<P>
   That historic resolution demands the return of all Arab land
occupied in the 1967 war in return for the security of all states _
including Israel _ in the area.
</P>
<P>
   It is upon that letter that Assad has based his entire
``strategic decision'' for peace. And in return, the Lion of
Damascus _ even the Israelis call him that _ as been called
inflexible, frightened, sick, desperate and brutal. It is a big
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people who believe that Assad is negotiating out of
weakness _ or because he is desperate to bequeath a peace to his
son Bashar _ do not know the president of Syria,'' one of his close
acquaintances remarked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told the Americans to be careful. The Israelis say all
these things but they are making a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assad is determined to get Golan back under the terms of the
U.N. Security Council resolution. He will stick to the letter of
the resolution. He is not going to be another Yassir Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
   True, Assad at 69 looks his age. His voice is gravelly, his
heart condition in 1982 proved his own mortality, his family feud
with his brother Rifaat remains unsettled.

   Syria is a police state and Assad's enemies rot in the darkest

   ISLAMABAD _ For an American president, it was just like the Good
Old Days. You could forget all the claptrap about Washington's
concern for democracy and human rights _ just as you could when
Johnson and Nixon and Carter hobnobbed with the Vietnamese
generals, Pinochet's acolytes and the Shah of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   For President Bill Clinton arrived in Pakistan this past weekend
to shake hands with another ``strongman'' and discuss America's
obsession: security, Islamic ``terror'' and the fear that someone
else _ a Muslim nation, for heaven's sake _ might be amassing a
nuclear stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that the leader of the Free World drove into Islamabad
Saturday morning past thousands of soldiers, riot police and
Punjabi Special Forces _ ``Elite,'' it says on their trucks, the
word accompanied by a picture of three bullets _ to ``engage'' the
country's military ruler, to talk about ``dialogue'' and to view
the legend already strung along the highway from the airport by the
general's loyal followers: ``Unity. Faith. Discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Vichy France had a similar logo: ``Family. Fatherland. Work.''
Plus ca change.
</P>
<P>
   True, General Pervez Musharraf is not your ordinary
run-of-the-mill dictator. His coup d'etat in Pakistan last October
embraced a minister or two _ including the prime minister himself,
Nawaz Sharif _ but there were no mass roundups, no secret
executions, no massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Pakistan, so riddled with corruption, so deeply sunk in
political lethargy, does not lend itself to such brutality,
although Sharif does face the hangman's noose if convicted of
treason, hijacking, kidnapping and a host of others sins.
</P>
<P>
   And already the U.S. administration is spinning the human
factor. Clinton has told the world he doesn't want Sharif hanged
``if convicted'' _ note the touching faith in Pakistani justice _
and doesn't believe the general's latest proposal, for
``democratic'' local government elections next year, goes far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   And he's a bit upset about that latest ban on political rallies
_ imposed, you've guessed it, because of the American president's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, did
not come here to chat about the issues which might save Pakistan
from ultimate collapse into anarchy _ only about those things which
cater to Washington's conviction that the world is threatened by
alien ``terrorists,'' most of whom who were trained by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants the general to close down Afghan Mujahedin bases
in Pakistan, to cut its ties with the Taliban regime in Kabul and
to secure the arrest _ and here we are back to America's latest
Menace _ of Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   If Pakistan is suffering a little local difficulty with
democracy, it can still be a ``loyal ally'' of the West. Just close
down the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that all these problems arose from Washington's
meddling in Afghanistan after the 1979 Soviet invasion is unlikely
to be raised, even by the Pakistan foreign ministry officials who
angrily inform visitors that ``we won the Cold War for you.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the real story has more to do with General Musharraf's
relations with the American military.
</P>
<P>
   In particular his cozy friendship _ trumpeted in the Pakistani
press and admitted in Washington _ with the U.S. commander
responsible for South Asia, General Anthony Zinni. An old chum of
the Pakistani general, General Zinni made no secrets of his views
about the country before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the U.S. isolates the professional Pakistani military, we
deny ourselves access to the most powerful institution in Pakistan
society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may hamper our nonproliferation and counterterrorism
efforts. Furthermore, in the larger strategic sense, Pakistan can
play a stabilizing role in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the army is only all-powerful because it staged a
military coup, the idea that counterterrorism should take
precedence over what the opposition regards as state terror, the
suggestion that a dictatorship can be ``stabilizing'' _ could there
be a more forthright explanation of America's determination to talk
to a general who has overthrown a democratically elected
government?
</P>
<P>
   True, the regime of Nawaz Sharif _ who was chatting to Clinton
himself only a few short months ago _ was corrupt. His hoodlums
broke up Supreme Court proceedings, while stories of his housing,
tractor and taxi schemes _ all allegedly creaming cash for the
party faithful _ have long gone the rounds in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   There are Pakistanis who believe that General Musharraf really
wants to ``return Pakistan to real democracy.'' But then again,
that's what they all say. And when you read the Pakistani press,
you can make up your own mind.
</P>
<P>
   General Musharraf, announced one fawning report in The Frontier
Post, is ``a leader in the making'' who ``blushes when his wife
discusses their courtship and becomes sentimental when he speaks of
his friends... there is no subterfuge, no game-playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Better still, ``the first thing you notice about (the general)
are his manicured hands,'' the journalist reported. ``They are the
fine hands of an aesthete.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Clinton grasped them firmly in his. &QL;

MAKEUP, MEDICATION MAY POLLUTE WATERWAYS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Exotic chemicals in drugs and cosmetics may
wind up polluting the nation's waterways and harming fish, experts
warned Monday.
<P>
   Not much is known about the potential dangers of pharmaceuticals
and other designer chemicals in the environment. Although the issue
has been under study for several years in Europe, research is still
in the very early stages and virtually no work has been done in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   An international panel of experts on the subject convened Monday
as part of the national meeting of the American Chemical Society,
under way this week in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said it was the first time scientists have gathered
to address the topic in North America _ itself a sign of just how
little attention has been paid to the emerging environmental
concerns posed by products such as antibiotics, psychiatric drugs,
hormones, animal-feed additives and synthetic fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something federal agencies are just now getting into,''
said Christian Daughton of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial pollutants with ominous-sounding chemical names tend
to garner far more regulatory and scientific attention. But
thousands of everyday products that most people take for granted
are being manufactured _ and, ultimately, flushed or thrown away
after use _ in huge quantities often comparable to agrochemical
production.
</P>
<P>
   Ecological monitoring in Germany and Switzerland confirm that
traces of commonly used painkillers and other prescription drugs
can be found in natural groundwaters and aquifers. Municipal
wastewater-treatment plants are unable to screen out some of the
more hardy compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Residues of cholesterol-lowering drugs and the analgesic
diclofenac have even been found in the city of Berlin's drinking
water, albeit in extremely low concentrations. German scientists
offered assurances that the city's tap water is in no danger of
becoming a prescription-only product anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a real problem for human health,'' said Thomas
Heberer of the Institute of Food Chemistry at the University of
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; `An Uncomfortable Feeling'
</P>
<P>
   But his findings have been the cause of some squeamishness. Even
if the Berlin water meets health standards, Heberer said, ``it can
give you an uncomfortable feeling knowing you are drinking
something that has made it through someone else's kidneys.''
</P>
<P>
   The more critical concern is the impact on aquatic species,
which can build up surprisingly high concentrations of chemical
pollutants from barely detectable levels.
</P>
<P>
   David Epel, a biologist at Stanford University, said he is
planning studies of whether calcium-channel blockers and
immunosuppressant drugs might be capable of overwhelming natural
toxin-filtering systems common in nearly all multicelled animals.
</P>
<P>
   For therapeutic reasons, certain new drugs are being developed
that are specifically designed to block ``efflux transporters,''
molecules on the surface of cells that shuttle out troublemaking
substances.
</P>
<P>
   These transporters have a limited capacity to deal with a
multitude of chemicals, Epel said, raising the possibility that
fish and other aquatic species in drug-polluted waters may become
vulnerable to toxic overload.
</P>
<P>
   Other emerging issues include the possibility of endocrine
disruption and reproductive problems following exposure to
hormone-like drugs, small amounts of which can have big effects in
some species. At the same time, scientists are debating whether
antibiotics in the environment, either from human-drug residues or
farm runoff, could breed drug-resistant microbes.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists noted that nobody has established any clear
evidence of environmental damage yet. But they said the evidence so
far clearly warrants some close scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't focused on this very much at all,'' Daughton
said.

GIVING SO OTHERS CAN LIVE

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA GUTIERREZ  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Scottish researchers this month (March) introduced the
world to five piglets they'd cloned, they hailed the achievement as
a solution to the worldwide shortage of human organs for
transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   More than 68,000 people in this country alone are on a waiting
list, waiting for new hearts, kidneys, livers, lungs, corneas and
bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   They wait and wait. Five thousand Americans died waiting last
year because there weren't enough organs and tissue available.
</P>
<P>
   Whether animal-to-human transplants are a viable, not to mention
ethical, solution remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   And the waiting continues.
</P>
<P>
   Next month the United Network for Organ Sharing, which maintains
the country's organ transplant waiting list, will run nationwide
public service announcements designed to dispel the myths and
address the fears that keep more Americans from donating organs or
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown that more than 80 percent of Americans support
the concept of organ donations. Yet every year, from the more than
15,000 potential donors who die in hospitals, only a third of their
families consent to donate their loved one's organs.
</P>
<P>
   The donation process starts with a signature on the back of a
driver's license or donor card, on which you can specify the organs
you want to donate. But because many people forget to take the
critical second step, their wishes are not always carried out after
they die.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is, they don't tell their family. Most
people don't realize that the family has the last word,'' says Bob
Spieldenner, spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing in
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when families are asked about donating their loved one's
organs, they say, `I don't know what they wanted. I'm not sure.'
And even though it might be indicated on their driver's license,
they never talked about it with their family. And the family is
afraid to make a mistake, so they go with what they feel
comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we tell people, `Make your decision now. But tell
your family about it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Organ procurement groups like Midwest Transplant Network in
Westwood, which covers all of Kansas and the western two-thirds of
Missouri, will not go against the wishes of the family, even if the
deceased had signed a donor card or driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your husband or brother and sisters say no, we would go
with their decision, because they are the survivors,'' says Midwest
spokeswoman Kim Francis. ``Flip it around. If your loved one died
and I said, `Too bad; he wanted to donate, and we're going to take
him off to surgery now,' how would you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Having family members witness you signing your donor card or
driver's license can show them how committed you are to your
decision, Francis says. ``It's a good idea to say to your family
that this would make me really happy to know that I've saved
someone else's life, and this is really, really important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Death, though, is a topic many would rather avoid. ``We've done
some focus group research that shows that people are afraid to talk
about it, or they are superstitious because they think if they talk
about it, it will somehow happen,'' Spieldenner says.
</P>
<P>
   Fear keeps most people from donating, say those trying to
encourage people to do just that. What will organ donation cost my
family? (Nothing.) Will my body be disfigured when they remove the
organs? (No.) Will doctors still work hard to save my life if they
see I carry a donor card? (Yes.) Does my religion allow this? (Most
do.)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, regardless of age or health, is a potential donor.
Ninety-year-olds have donated livers; 80-year-olds have donated
kidneys. Though the oldest heart donors have been in their late
'50s, ``more and more they're willing to use older donors, partly
because of the shortage,'' Spieldenner says. ``And medical
advancements show that they can be used.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell everyone not to rule themselves out. If you have AIDS,
that's probably going to rule you out, although there is some
experimenting going on using organs from AIDS patients in other
AIDS patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the procurement agency receives consent from the family to
proceed, each organ is evaluated. Though the donor has been
declared brain dead, doctors use a ventilator to keep oxygenated
blood pumping through the organs to keep them healthy during the
process, Francis says.
</P>
<P>
   The matchmaking ensues when the organs are deemed useful. The
local procurement agency contacts the United Network for Organ
Sharing in Virginia, which by computer matches the organ to
transplant centers awaiting similar organs. Ultimately a recipient
is found.
</P>
<P>
   The entire testing and procurement process typically takes eight
to 12 hours at the hospital. Procurement workers, trained to assist
grieving family members, work closely with the relatives on the
timing, Francis says. ``Donation is not going to help anyone if we
have complicated their funeral plans.''

AS BASEBALL SEASON BEGINS, KC AUTHOR LINES ONE RIGHT OUT OF PARK

<P>
   More Than Merkle, by David W. Anderson (271 pages; University of
Nebraska Press; $29.95)
</P>
<P>
   Books and baseball are a natural fit. Of all the major-league
sports, baseball is the most cerebral, the slowest-paced, the one
that lends itself as easily to a writer's flights of fancy as the
flight of a home-run ball.
</P>
<P>
   So it's OK that David W. Anderson of Leawood took five years to
write his baseball book, following an arc that led back to 1908. In
doing so, he crafted an excellent new entry in the baseball
literary canon _ and rediscovered the greatest season baseball ever
had.
</P>
<P>
   More Than Merkle, in fact, boasts this audacious subtitle: A
History of the Best and Most Exciting Baseball Season in Human
History.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson chuckles; it was his publisher's idea. ``That's
hyperbole from the University of Nebraska Press. I wanted 1908:
Baseball's Most Exciting Year. But book publishing is a series of
compromises, at least at my level. Hey, I'm not Stephen King.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson does believe there has never been a season like
1908, and while one might be inclined to argue with a first-time
author, Anderson has also umpired high school baseball _ and you
should never argue with umpires.
</P>
<P>
   1908 was the last year the Chicago Cubs won a World Series. It
was the year pennant races in the American and National leagues
were tighter than nuts on a new bridge. It was the year the diamond
was ruled by future Hall of Famers _ Walter Johnson, Christy
Mathewson, Cy Young, Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   And 1908 was the year New York Giants rookie Fred Merkle made a
mistake that cost his team a crucial game and gave the Cubs the NL
pennant. Largely forgotten now, the play was remembered for decades
by fans as ``Merkle's Boner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-two years later, the 2000 baseball season looms; it
starts Wednesday with another cycle of glory and shame. Will it be
great? Will Sammy Sosa slug the Cubs back to the Series after nine
decades? Well, all seasons are great for baseball fans, if not for
Cubs fans.
</P>
<P>
   But there'll never be another 1908.
</P>
<P>
   Merkle's defender
</P>
<P>
   Fred Merkle was not an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson believes this. The Sprint executive, who relocated
earlier this year to Leawood from Indiana, grew up in South Bend
and followed Chicago baseball. He was more a White Sox fan than a
Cubbie, but at any rate he has no love for New York teams.
</P>
<P>
   But he champions Merkle, the New York Giants' rookie first
baseman that fateful year.
</P>
<P>
   The story in a peanut shell: The Giants and Cubs were fighting
for a World Series berth as the season drew to a close. On Sept. 23
they faced each other at the Polo Grounds, New York's home field
(this was long before the Giants moved to San Francisco).
</P>
<P>
   It was a low-scoring game, a pitchers' duel between the Cubs'
Jack ``The Giant Killer'' Pfiester and New York's Christy
Mathewson.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs shortstop Joe Tinker hit a homer, but the Giants came back
and tied the game, 1-1. Then, in the ninth, with two out and Giants
left fielder Moose McCormick on base, Fred Merkle singled.
Infielder Al Bridwell came to the plate and smacked another single.
McCormick scored the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Except that it wasn't the winning run. According to an arcane
rule, Merkle was supposed to touch second base before he headed for
the clubhouse. He didn't. Nobody was in the habit of doing it. But
in 1908, umpires were just starting to enforce the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Merkle trotted off. Cubs' second baseman Johnny Evers ``screamed
for the ball,'' according to Anderson's book. Umpire Hank O'Day
ruled that Fred Merkle was the third out, that McCormick's run
didn't count, that the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   O'Day declared the game a tie. The National League ordered the
game to be replayed. It was _ and the Giants lost.
</P>
<P>
   They lost the game. They lost the pennant race, finishing behind
the Cubs by one game. And Fred Merkle lost the respect of fans and
journalists; the latter nicknamed him ``Bonehead.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson insists Merkle was made a goat for a mistake that
other players would have made that year, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tragic figure because in that age, the press would go
after the players and not the managers _ and really, John McGraw
was at fault there.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager McGraw was ``a control freak,'' Anderson says.
Earlier in the season, another player on another team had made a
similar mistake against the Cubs and had been called out by the
same umpire. McGraw should have given Merkle a heads-up to touch
second, Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   But as Anderson says: ``If ifs and buts were candy and nuts
...''
</P>
<P>
   On the Dead Ball
</P>
<P>
   The Merkle story is a classic, and Anderson's telling of it is
masterful. But the book is called More Than Merkle for good reason:
It's a wonderful portrait of a game that no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we have baseball. But More Than Merkle is about players as
opposed to millionaires, ballparks instead of stadiums, a game and
not a business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different time and a time that I think we need to
exalt,'' Anderson says. ``What I was trying to do with this book
was give people an idea of what baseball was like in the Dead Ball
Era.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dead Ball Era? It doesn't sound glamorous, and maybe it
wasn't by today's standards. We're used to Mark McGwire and Sosa
and Ken Griffey Jr. blasting the ball out of the park, but the
balls they hit are literally corked _ they have cork centers, which
make them livelier. In 1908 the balls didn't carry as well. Hence,
``Dead Ball.'' Other aspects of the game also favored defense.
Pitchers dominated. Games had scores like 1-0 and 2-1, not 15-6.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson thinks it was more exciting. But if the game was purer,
fans were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was gambling and hard liquor in the stands. The owners
voted down a ban on glass containers in 1908 because they would
lose profits on beverage sales. There were no paper cups back then,
so you had fans in the ballpark with bottles. If you look at some
of the old crowd shots you can see how close the fans are to the
players ... and sometimes there's a look of terror in the players'
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the situation after the replayed Giants-Cubs game got
ugly. The Cubs had won the decisive game of the season on Giant
turf. And Giants fans were on the edge of violence, as Anderson
recounts in the book through the eyes of Cubs pitcher Mordecai
``Three Finger'' Brown:
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it to the dressing room and barricaded the door.
Outside, wild men were yelling for our blood _ really. As the mob
got bigger, the police came up and formed a line across the door.
We read the next day that the cops had to pull their revolvers to
hold them back. I couldn't say as to that. We weren't sticking our
heads out to see.''
</P>
<P>
   As Anderson writes, ``The Cubs had to celebrate their
unprecedented third straight pennant on the train for Detroit. They
left town with a police escort.''
</P>
<P>
   Redemption and curses
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs won the battle that year. After that game with the
Giants, they went on to an anticlimactic World Series, defeating
the Detroit Tigers handily.
</P>
<P>
   But they lost the war: No Cubs team has won a World Series
since.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a Merkle curse?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merkle never uttered a curse. But there is kind of a cosmic
thing going there. Why wouldn't the Cubs ever win another World
Series? Of course, when you look at some of the teams they've
fielded, that answers that question.''
</P>
<P>
   And Merkle redeemed himself with 17 seasons of solid play and a
subsequent career as a minor-league manager. The jeers never
stopped, but Merkle never gave up, either.
</P>
<P>
   The big winners of 1908, though, were the owners. Total
attendance for both leagues was just over 7 million, a record
(compare that to today, when one team can draw 3 million in a
single season). It can be claimed that 1908 was the year baseball
became ``the national pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That season gave the owners the confidence to realize that
baseball was a viable business and that they needed to build
permanent stadiums, of which three still stand _ Wrigley (in
Chicago), Fenway (in Boston) and Tiger Stadium (in Detroit). The
stature of the game became very important.''
</P>
<P>
   And now 1908 has given us a new baseball book that falls just
short of a classic. I say that only because at times the narrative
drive isn't as strong as it should be; digressions or statistics
sometimes intrude.
</P>
<P>
   But those are quibbles. Anderson has scored three runs with More
Than Merkle: He has vindicated Fred Merkle, a player whose
respectable career has been overshadowed by one play. He has told a
tale worth telling: how the Chicago Cubs edged the Giants in a
thriller season. And best, he has brought the Dead Ball Era back to
life.

THE WRITES OF SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN MARK EBERHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They do it every spring: They swagger out into the soft
sunshine, cocky, prideful, ready to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   But we're talking about authors and publishers, not baseball
players. The baseball book has become as much a rite of spring as
Opening Day itself.
</P>
<P>
   And we keep buying them. And why not? Just as each new season
brings hope (even to Royals fans), it brings a crop of writers,
some veterans and some rookies, who try to leave their literary
imprint on the game. One of those rookies this year is Leawood's
own David W. Anderson; the review of Anderson's fabulous More Than
Merkle starts on today's Arts cover.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball isn't really ``the national pastime'' anymore; the
audience for football is bigger now. But a spring without baseball
or the books it inspires would still be unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Here's this year's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Retro Redbirds
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: I am a Royals fan and have been since my family
left St. Louis in 1970. But I grew up in St. Louis with the great
Cardinal teams of the 1960s; they played in three World Series and
won two, including a 1964 triumph over those damned Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Bob Gibson, base thief Lou Brock and outfielder Curt
Flood were my boyhood heroes, and they're all here, with plenty of
other company, in Peter Golenbock's The Spirit of St. Louis: A
History of the St. Louis Cardinals and Browns (651 pages;
Spike//Avon Books; $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   The Browns?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they were St. Louis' other team, a sometimes goofy,
sometimes good American League franchise that eventually became the
Baltimore Orioles. Owner Bill Veeck Jr. was an oddball who once
promoted the team by having a midget come to bat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, though, the Browns actually sampled glory for once,
winning the American League pennant and advancing to the World
Series. Their opponent?
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns lost, of course; the Cards were mighty in 1944. For
that one year, though, St. Louis owned baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Golenbock's book is as beefy as Mark McGwire's forearms, and he
does a fine job of balancing his story between the legendary
Cardinals and the usually woeful Browns. This is a great read.
</P>
<P>
   Goosed
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the massive home run Brett hit off me in the 1980
playoffs ... and the Pine Tar Incident in 1983, George and I became
linked in baseball history.''
</P>
<P>
   That's former Yankees pitcher Goose Gossage, who tormented
Royals fans in the late 1970s and early '80s with his hated,
mustachioed face and, worse yet, that ray-gun heater that other
people modestly referred to as a fastball. And Gossage blathers on
a lot more in The Goose Is Loose (342 pages; Ballantine Books;
$25).
</P>
<P>
   More on his competition with Royals hitter George Brett: ``(W)e
had many duels during the bitter years of the Yankees-Royals
rivalry, and I probably won the vast majority. Pitchers always do.
... (But) let's give the devil his due: I never saw Ted Williams
hit, but I can't imagine that he could have been any better than
George Brett.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, thanks, Goose. You know, all those years ago, KC fans
wished Gossage would just stop pitching. Now I wish he would just
stop ...
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I grudgingly concede that Gossage's
``autobiography'' is interesting. But then it should be; he had
Russ Pate help him write it.
</P>
<P>
   Guess Goose's pen isn't as mighty as his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Or his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Base hits
</P>
<P>
   - Red Smith on Baseball: The Game's Greatest Writer on the
Game's Greatest Years, by Red Smith (363 pages; Ivan R. Dee;
$24.95). Nobody, but nobody, wrote or writes about baseball like
the great Walter W. ``Red'' Smith. He has won some of journalism's
most prestigious awards, including the Polk and the Pulitzer. This
book collects writings from 1941 to 1981, from Jackie Robinson's
breaking the color barrier to Bobby Thomson's ``Shot Heard 'Round
the World'' and modern players like Carl Yastrzemski.
</P>
<P>
   - The Sporting News Selects 50 Greatest Sluggers, by Tony
DeMarco (175 pages; The Sporting News; $29.95). I'm sorry, but this
thing looks like a Time-Life book about fixing your sink. Still,
it's not bad. The author has the sense to put the mighty Babe Ruth
at No. 1, right above that upstart McGwire. There are no Royals on
the list, but then George was always more a triple threat than a
dinger man. Come to think of it, when did the Royals ever have a
home-run king? Steve Balboni? Puh-leeze.
</P>
<P>
   - Batter Up! The Ultimate Baseball Scorekeeper, by Benjamin Eli
Smith (128 pages; Chronicle Books; $14.95). Take this one to the
ballpark with you. It has information to help fans learn how to
score a game, as well as scorecards and even a pouch on the back
cover to hold your pencils.
</P>
<P>
   - Baseball's Most Wanted: The Top 10 Book of the National
Pastime's Outrageous Offenders, Lucky Bounces, and Other Oddities,
by Floyd Connor (388 pages; Brassey's; $12.95). A title that long
should be self-explanatory. It is. Weird book. Good book, though.
By the way, did you know that Ken Brett, George's brother, pitched
for 10 teams between 1971 and 1980? You do now.
</P>
<P>
   - The National Game: Baseball and American Culture, by John P.
Rossi (243 pages; Ivan R. Dee; $25). There are plenty of histories
of baseball; Rossi strives for something different: a look at how
the game has affected American culture and vice versa. Ambitious
and worth an afternoon's perusing if there's not a home game on the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Other voices, other leagues
</P>
<P>
   Josh Gibson: A Life in the Negro Leagues, by William Brashler
(200 pages; Ivan R. Dee; $14.95). In the first half of the 20th
century, Major League Baseball had the power to bar black players
from ``the big show,'' but MLB didn't have the power to keep black
players from being great. Gibson was known as ``the black Babe
Ruth.'' Unfortunately, he died at 35 in 1947, just as Jackie
Robinson broke that color barrier.
</P>
<P>
   - Joy in Mudville: A Little League Memoir, by Greg Mitchell (256
pages; Pocket Books; $19.95). Mitchell is one of those tireless (or
maybe crazy) dads who has spent time managing kids' ball teams. The
multiple roles as parent, coach and sports enthusiast sometimes
clash in gut-wrenching ways. His memoir covers two years in the
trenches _ er, dugouts.

 &HT;    The mocking of the Presidency, 2000
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Letterman calls George W. Bush ``a colossal boob.'' Jay
Leno makes fun of the number of executions under Bush's watch. And
Bill Maher insists he hates both Al ``Bore'' and George W.
``Gush.''
</P>
<P>
   Late-night political humor is rampant this campaign season. It
may have been funnier and more exciting during the primaries,
before Bush and Gore wrapped up their respective party nominations,
but it likely will get meaner and nastier as we head toward the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush needed a kidney transplant, he could call Quayle and
not even have to do a blood test.'' Bill Maher on ABC's
``Politically Incorrect''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's how stiff this guy Gore is: While campaigning in New
York City, he went up to Grant's Tom-- . They wouldn't let him
out.'' David Letterman on CBS's ``The Late Show''
</P>
<P>
   Political humor has been around as long as there have been
politicians, and late-night TV has been a major player since Steve
Allen hosted ``The Tonight Show.'' But over the years, the
monologists have multiplied. Besides Leno and Letterman, we now
have Conan O'Brien, Craig Kilborn, Bill Maher and cable's Jon
Stewart. Maher's entire show is devoted to ripping politicians in a
round-table forum.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are there more late-night political jokesters today,
but they are having more of an impact. According to a recent Pew
Research Center poll, nearly half of the under-30 crowd get most of
their campaign information from late-night talk shows, with 37
percent citing ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Politically
Incorrect'' as major sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new in contemporary political humor is how the media,
especially television, has made politicians into celebrities and
how many people get more of their political news from Letterman,
Leno and other humor shows than from the mainstream news
services,'' says David Schultz, professor of political science at
Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn., and author of the
just-published ``It's Show Time! Media, Politics and Popular
Culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, the impression people have of politicians is
framed by the jokes and less by a stance on the issues. Thus, Bush
is seen as an intellectual lightweight and a fratboy, and Gore is
seen as wooden. And because they are treated more like movie stars,
politics is now thought of as entertainment, campaigning is like
acting and politicians are like actors. This clearly leads to a
loss of substance in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign shifts into high gear in the fall, we can expect
the arrows to bear more poison. So far, Bush has taken the worst
drubbing, perhaps because he's fresh meat, while Gore has been vice
president for eight years. And perhaps it's just easier to poke fun
at someone portrayed as dumb than someone portrayed as boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore proposed that he and Bush drop all TV ads for the
remainder of the race and instead hold twice weekly debates on the
issues. Bush responded, `Any time, any place _ as long as you give
me directions.''' Colin Quinn on ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore e-mailed Bush and then Bush tried to e-mail him back, but
he couldn't get the stamps to stick to the screen.'' Bill Maher on
``Politically Incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Night-owl jokesters have found soft spots they like to hit Bush
on _ his alleged stupidity, his youthful drinking days and the high
number of executions since he became governor. Maher has even gone
after Bush's wildly popular mother, claiming Barbara Bush is ``not
a nice old lady ... she's after vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   The humor seems harsher than previous political seasons but
sedate compared to the field day comics had during Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is the gift that keeps on giving,'' says Mark Russell,
the Washington-based humorist who has been lampooning politicians
since the '50s and is celebrating his 25th anniversary of comedy
specials on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Russell concedes he's torn about the legacy of the Clinton mess.
On the one hand, the comedian considers himself patriotic and hated
to see his country go through such embarrassment. On the other
hand, the Clinton White House provided endless fodder for political
humorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of the Clinton scandals is we've really lost all
respect for the presidency and the city of Washington,'' Russell
says. ``You mention the Oval Office, and people go, 'Oh, yeah. We
know what goes on in there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when political jokes were subtle or even
slightly sophisticated _ at least on late-night TV. The high-water
mark of modern political scandals was Watergate, when the
government seemed to collapse and Richard Nixon, sweat pouring off
his face, insisted he wasn't a crook. The way Johnny Carson handled
it, with gentle zingers and an impish lift of the eyebrow, is a far
cry from Leno relishing the X-rated details of the Clinton-Lewinsky
affair.
</P>
<P>
   The mark of Clinton scandal humor was extreme vulgarity, and the
late-night hosts wallowed in every juicy tidbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those details coming out about what happened in the Oval
Office were vulgar,'' concedes Gerard Mulligan, who has written for
Letterman since 1977. ``But we didn't make any of that up. The
vulgarity didn't come from people putting a spin on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan says the digs on politicos this season aren't any
better or worse than they were 20 years ago, but he thinks the
humor is more personal and cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the assumption is every candidate has some kind of sexual
scandal in the closet,'' Mulligan says. ``Everybody assumes it's
just a matter of time before photos of George W., naked and dancing
on a bar, show up. Some cynicism is healthy, but it also can be
corrosive. If you assume everything is a lie, that is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   So, don't these popular shows feel some responsibility for
contributing to the cynicism and the general lack of respect for
our politicians?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we do contribute to the disrespect, but not to the
extent that the politicians do,'' Mulligan says. ``They shoot
themselves in the foot all the time. I guess if there's a constant
drumbeat that George W. is stupid, that gradually becomes accepted.
But as far as we're concerned, he's obviously not stupid. This is
our cartoon version of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the comics do consider some areas off limits.
For the most part, the families of the candidates are left alone,
especially children. ``Saturday Night Live'' overstepped its
boundaries a few years ago and did a skit about Chelsea Clinton.
The executive producer later apologized to the first family. As a
rule, network censors don't get involved in late-night monologues,
so the weeknight comics have a good deal of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to make jokes about the person who does the most
colorful stuff,'' Mulligan says. ``There's no ideological
balancing. If there were, we'd have to do two percent of our jokes
about Alan Keyes. It would be insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all political humorists are impressed with the late-night
comics. Much of the lampooning is seen as crude and superficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These flat-out statements, like `George Bush is a colossal
boob,' aren't terribly rewarding,'' says Russell, whose heroes are
Mort Sahl, Fred Allen and Mark Twain. ``Humor is supposed to be
subtle, the turning of a phrase. But late-night people are talking
to a bigger audience, so it has to be a little less subtle ... I
know Leno and Letterman are intelligent guys, and they're smart
enough to know they have to talk down to their audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The razor-sharp barbs reached their peak during primary season
but have fallen into a temporary lull as Gore and Bush gear up for
the general election. During the primaries, comedians had more
variety to work with, tackling independent-minded bulldog John
McCain and sleepy-looking intellectual Bill Bradley. Now that's
over. And the good ol' days with Ross Perot clucking, ``Now that's
just sad '' are but a memory. With two alleged dullards (one of
them a party-boy-turned-alleged-dullard) left now, how much fun can
be had?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, boring and stiff is good!'' Russell says. ``But Bob Jones
v-- . Buddha? They almost cancel each other out. By the time we
reach the general election, I'm usually sick of it. This was a very
lively primary season, especially with McCain in there. I hated to
see it end. We're going to have to contrive excitement for the next
eight months and endure the travesty of the conventions, where
there's never any suspense. Our only hope is Pat Robertson.
Whenever Robertson gets in there, it's good material.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and Gore go at it during the 2000 election season,
Leno, Letterman and Maher will, too. We may laugh at all of them
from time to time, a guilty pleasure at best. Cynicism on the tube
and in the nation is rampant, and late-night TV is feeding the
beast.

 &HT;    Race matters, even when asking a simple question
 &HT;    (With illustration and mugshot.)
 &HT;    By Marcus Franklin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question, by most accounts, is mundane. Unless, of course,
the person posing the query is a black man trying to get to a dance
club in Southeast Washington, D.C., at 1 o'clock in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I get a cab?'' I asked the man at the front desk of the
downtown hotel where I stayed Valentine's Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very difficult,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   I'll flag one myself, I told the man. He looked at me as if I
were a fool.
</P>
<P>
   What a fool I was.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know about the recent rash of robberies, assaults and a
murder of D.C. cab drivers. I didn't know the suspects were black
men. At the time, I had no reason to remind myself of one of the
nearly unbearable burdens of being a black man in the United
States: Each black man pays, in ways big and small, for any
misdeeds of the other 16,562,999 black men in this nation.
</P>
<P>
   No black man is exonerated from this socio-political liability.
Actor Danny Glover, who filed a complaint last year with New York
City because taxis whizzed by him, can attest to this fact. Amadou
Diallo could, too, had he survived the hail of bullets fired at him
by four recently acquitted New York police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to brave the winter elements in a black waist-length
leather jacket, a fleece skully of the same color, dark baggy jeans
and a pair of Timberlands, I stepped inside the hotel's revolving
glass door and out into the freezing air.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to me, D.C. Taxi Cab Commissioner Sandra Seegars,
three weeks earlier, had urged the district's mostly black 6,500
cabbies to pass up ``dangerous-looking'' individuals. Seegars, who
is black and lives in Southeast, later defined
``dangerous-looking'' in The Washington Post as a ``young black guy
with his hat on backwards, shirttail hanging down longer than his
coat, baggy pants down below his underwear and unlaced tennis
shoes. ... Late at night, if I saw young black men dressed in a
slovenly way, I wouldn't pick them up, either. Drivers are afraid
of gangs of young black males. In all my life, I have never seen a
gang of young white males in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, my pursuit of a cab began in front of the hotel. For
more than two hours, I walked along the four major streets
surrounding the hotel. I hailed until my arms ached. I yelled,
``Yo, taxi!'' until my mouth dried and my voice grew raspy. My
resolve to get a cab intensified as I watched a white couple and
then a black woman successfully hail taxis. It no longer mattered
if a cab took me to the club or for a spin around the block. I just
wanted a cab.
</P>
<P>
   Only two cabs stopped for me. A uniformed D.C. police officer,
who happened to be going to a nearby 24-hour drug store, hailed one
of them at my request. The other cabbie stopped after I got
desperate and put my hands together, prayerlike, and extended them
toward oncoming traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Both cabbies demanded to know where I was going before I got in
their cars. Both sped off after I gave them the club's address. I
don't think the cabbies heard any part of the address except
``Southeast,'' which is a largely black section of the District
disproportionately plagued by poverty and black-on-black crime.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't have been as indignant about the slights had they
been tied exclusively to the cabbies' fear of going to Southeast.
But the more than 100 taxi drivers who passed me up didn't even
know my destination. For all they knew, I was going to the upscale
Georgetown neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I took my last shot at getting a cab. A taxi carrying
three people _ all white, all men _ pulled in front of the drug
store. I jogged toward the cab, careful not to run too fast lest I
induce panic attacks among the emerging passengers and the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to go to ... Southeast,'' I told the driver as he shook
his head horizontally. He wouldn't even let down his window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I don't want to rob you,'' I snapped.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked back to the hotel, I began to wonder: This possibly
cannot be the real nature of God's universe. Would I be justified
if I presuppose I am going to be dragged to my death every time I
see three or more white men in a pickup truck? Would it be rational
of me to think I am going to be showered with bullets (possibly 41
of them) every time I see four white police officers because they
may believe I'm a rapist and that the keys or wallet I reach for is
a gun?
</P>
<P>
   At the hotel, another concierge, Kwaku, called me a cab. He
wasn't optimistic. The dispatcher wanted to know where I was going
and, upon learning the destination was in Southeast, wanted
assurance from hotel management that I was a guest. ``This is
crazy,'' I screamed at the men. ``These cab drivers are men of
color, and they're all afraid to pick up a black man. Their
mind-set is no different from a racist white person's.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions spewed from my anger. ``Why am I being discriminated
against because of the actions of some man I don't even know?'' I
asked. ``Why is the entire Southeast community being redlined? I
had nothing to do with any of those robberies or assaults or the
murder, nor did most of the people who live in Southeast.
Nothing!''
</P>
<P>
   The men shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   The cab never showed.
</P>
<P>
   As I headed to my room, I considered my first night in D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, my intense hunt for a cab nearly forced me to buckle
over at times; the experience compelled me to laugh aloud as
strangers gawked at me. The tragicomic ordeal angered me to the
point of wanting to do harm to the cabbies or their cabs because
they, black men, had bought into the stereotypes by associating
blackness with criminality.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, blacks accounted for more than half the robbery arrests in
America in 1998, as well as most of the murder arrests that year,
according to FBI statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But only one-half of 1 percent of all U.S. blacks were arrested
on charges of committing a violent crime in 1998. Moreover, nearly
seven out of every 10 people arrested for any crime in 1998 were
white, according to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   As the elevator climbed the shaft, I remembered Toni Morrison's
simple but profound take on the absurdity of race as defined by
so-called skin color:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I know that you're white, I only know stereotypical
information about you,'' Morrison told PBS's Charlie Rose in 1998.
``I only know assumptions about you. That's like knowing you have
two ears on your head. But as an individual, I don't know anything
about you.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it doesn't mean that race doesn't matter; it matters
a great deal. But that's because we've made it matter. We have made
it matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it can matter even when a black man asks a question as
simple as, Can I get a cab?

 &HT;    Story of one's life toldin automobiles

<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``A purple Cadillac is the last thing I've
ever dreamed of owning,'' Gail assures me in her recent e-mail,
``but lately I've been having these funny daydreams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about it,'' I answer, ``it's a mild delusion
brought on by Social Security anxiety.'' I punch SEND and get back
to work _ but not for long. Another message from Gail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame the whole thing on going out for chowder with Arthur.
He got to droning on about some client of his and pretty soon my
focus wandered. Suddenly, there I was in a purple Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself stepping out of the house one morning on my way
to pick up another load of manure for the vegetable garden only to
discover my green SUV (which remarkably resembles Toad of Toad
Hall) has turned into a lavishly-finned, iridescent land yacht.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, I've forgotten all about carrots and kale, and I'm
cruising off into the sunset in this purple atrocity, with a long
scarf like the one that strangled Isadora Duncan billowing behind
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please send help, or Tom Cruise _ whichever you can manage.
Love, G.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruise is too young for you. Love, E.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares,'' she answers. ``It's my daydream. Okay, how about
Robert Redford? Love, G.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost a week, I heard nothing more about movie stars or
Cadillacs. But this morning she writes that she's figured out her
recent pre-occupation with wheeled things. ``The entire story of
one's life can be told in automobiles. Did you ever think of
that?'' Admittedly, I hadn't, but as I read on, I could see what
she meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first car in my life was a used Rambler that my
father-in-law bought for us while my husband was still in college.
It was big enough to hold the portable crib in the back seat when
we drove up to Maine in a blizzard for a grad school interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the second baby came, he gave us a tan VW beetle. It was
brand new but it had no radio _ $1500 in the late '60s. That's the
car we were driving on our way to Penn State when I jokingly
suggested since we had a Bachelor's baby, and a Master's baby,
maybe we should have a Ph.D. baby. My husband flinched and there
was no more talking the rest of the drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the third baby came a yellow Subaru station wagon. It had
a radio. I wrecked it while my husband was at a turkey convention
in Houston. He got it in the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next came the blue Dodge station wagon that lasted long enough
to become my son's first car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Aunt Alice's inheritance kicked in and I went a little
nuts. Bought two cars _ a navy-blue Toyota sedan and a TR-7. They
lasted about as long as my second marriage. Tourists in a truck
totaled the Toyota so I got rid of the wreck and the husband at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traded the TR-7 for a white hatch-back Toyota that I kept
until 1990, when I swapped it for a wine-red station wagon that
hauled yard debris, recycling, kids, dogs, cats, and groceries for
nine years and 160,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point there were four Toyotas, all in varying stages of
decrepitude lining the driveway. Then one day they were gone _
first away to college and then just away. One to Florida, one to
California, and another to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toad and I are alone now. He takes me to the gym (not as often
as he should), and occasionally to a nearby high school where I sub
(not as often as I'd like). He takes me to the Post Office with
boxes of storybooks for the grandchildren, but he knows little of
the life I've lived _ carpooling, or rushing three kids with sore
throats to the doctor. He's never even had ice cream smeared on his
back seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understandably,'' my old friend philosophizes, ``my
transportation has shifted with my priorities, but WHAT does the
purple Cadillac mean? Love, G.''
</P>
<P>
   I send the only answer I can. ``Chowder bad. Don't eat there any
more. Love, E.''

 &HT;    Big-bucks candidates could foot their own security tabs
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ George W. Bush has spent a third of an elementary
school running for president. By November, he'll have consumed a
whole school, from bike racks to soap dispensers.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Public Safety reported that Texas spent
$1.3 million last year protecting presidential candidate Bush, four
times what it spent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   It's only money, unless we consider what it can purchase. The
going rate for an elementary school is about $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   A cost we must bear? Security is serious business. Candidate Al
Gore gets taxpayer-footed security, too. Do Bush and Gore really
need our help? No.
</P>
<P>
   Are they fully capable of rustling up protection for themselves?
Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Have they both used millions of dollars in soft-money
contributions to obliterate spending controls on presidential
campaigns? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   What do they intend to do with those funds? Enlighten voters?
Draw out the finer points of their plans for America? No. They'll
buy air time to show each other on television in unflattering
poses.
</P>
<P>
   There's got to be a better use for this money. The security we
now provide could be one.
</P>
<P>
   Until we as a nation come to a grips with the excesses of
campaign finance, here's what we do with some of the excess: No
more taxpayer-financed security for office-holders running for
president. Pay your own way, boys.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the campaign-finance nut is a tough one to crack.
Both major parties are as dependent as dialysis patients. They not
only have sold their souls, they've donated their kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Since it appears we're a long way from real campaign finance
reform, we as taxpayers should tell Bush and Gore to relieve us of
campaign security detail. They're so good at raising donations, let
them buy their own goons. They'd come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it privatizing away a government service, something
near to Bush's heart. The candidates could borrow from the Rolling
Stones, who in 1969 hired Hell's Angels for security at a concert
at California's Altamont Speedway. They were effective. A
concert-goer got fatally stomped, yes. But the Stones were safe
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities of privatized security for the candidates are
numerous. Bush, for instance, could tell the National Rifle
Association that its protection is needed against Gore and the
anti-gunners. True, unlicensed NRA bodyguards wouldn't be able to
pack pistols in every state like they can in Texas and Florida. But
you can fake a lot of liberals out with an NRA patch and a Tootsie
Roll Pop in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could rely on Big Oil or Big Tobacco to fulfill his every
security fantasy. The latter is always making dreams come true.
Last year tobacco political action committees gave $2.2 million to
Republicans _ for off-year elections.
</P>
<P>
   As for Big Oil, Bush has his personal reservoir. It's the $5
billion holdings of Fort Worth drilling giant Richard Rainwater,
whom the Houston Chronicle calls ``largely responsible for Bush's
wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest one worry that this approach would give an unnecessary
advantage to Republicans, consider the opportunities for the
Democrats. For his bodyguards, Gore could have his choice of
Teamsters with forearms like thunderheads, or animal-rights
activists armed with flasks of calves' blood.
</P>
<P>
   As taxpayers we should accept as our business the protection of
office-holders as they fulfill their official duties. But when they
go campaigning, they ought to be able to handle the load _ at least
until they face up to the legalized corruption of campaign
financing and accept real restraints.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, why should Texas spend elementary schools to get
George Bush elected?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The lines are blurring
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I do not live in a 20/20 world. I haven't for
quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
   My lifelong struggle with vision problems is my cross to carry,
I suppose. Certainly it could be much worse. Nothing seems worse,
though, when you're 7 and have to wear glasses.
</P>
<P>
   That was just the beginning of my eyewear nightmares. Fashion
glasses did not exist in those days. They basically took old-lady
glasses and scaled them down for little girls. I rebelled at one
point and chose stark black frames, a jarring contrast to my fair
color. My mother hated them. I was making a statement, although I
have no idea what.
</P>
<P>
   I am, then, quite used to not seeing things clearly. As I have
grown older, though, there are many more things that I don't see
clearly: newspapers and telephone directories as well as right and
wrong, truth and untruth. A lot of lines are blurring for me and
bifocals are addressing only a few of them.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-year-old girl is killed by her classmate with a
semiautomatic weapon. And there still are those who declare ``Guns
don't kill, people do.'' I can't see my way clear on that at all.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination,
hate crimes against people of color still are occuring. I can't see
my way clear on that, either.
</P>
<P>
   One young woman chooses to keep her baby and another chooses to
abort it. And while there are plenty of folks who claim 20/20
vision on that issue, I still can't see my way clear on it.
</P>
<P>
   One country is tired of dealing with a race of people and so it
decides to ``cleanse'' itself by murdering thousands upon thousands
of people. Did we really think that kind of atrocity ended with
Hitler? I definitely can't see my way clear on that.
</P>
<P>
   A mother wakes up one morning in her one-room apartment and
discovers that her husband has taken all their savings and left. As
she picks up her crying baby and tends to her hungry toddler, she
wonders ``What will we do? Where will we go when I can't pay this
month's rent?'' I can't see my way clear on that one.
</P>
<P>
   Aging has peculiar properties. I used to see everything so
clearly. Every issue had a definitive answer. When you're 7 years
old, these things are right: being kind, sharing, helping others,
obeying your elders, showing respect. These things are wrong:
lying, stealing, hurting others, cheating, calling names, hitting.
We lived by a simple code of conduct: Do nothing that harms
yourself or others.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of blurring, though, in that clear-cut world.
People aren't playing by the same rules I learned when I was young.
A lot of people aren't playing by any rules at all, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   A recent story in Newsweek addresses that point. It states that
in our legal system, children have ``the requisite moral sense _
the ability to tell right from wrong'' by age 7 to 15, depending on
the state. The Roman Catholic Church pins it to the ``age of
reason'' _ 7. A psychologist is quoted as saying it's closer to 12
and perhaps up to 15. And, as the story concludes, sometimes that
sense of morality fails to develop at all.
</P>
<P>
   So I find myself living in an increasingly blurry world. I no
longer can see the third line on the eye chart no matter how many
lens options the ophthalmologist gives me.
</P>
<P>
   On certain days, though, like when I read about a 6-year-old
shooting another 6-year-old, I am oddly grateful for my blurred
vision. There is much in this world I cannot, and no longer want
to, see clearly.

 &HT;    When it comes to investing, women do it better
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Women live longer and have less money than men, so
they need to be better investors.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that women are better investors.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys support both those propositions, and financial
counselors confirm it from their day-to-day experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women invest as though their lives depend on it, and they
do,'' said Deena B. Katz, a certified financial planner in Coral
Gables, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that the average age of widowhood is 56 and that
a high percentage of marriages, first and second, end in divorce.
``If you are not taking care of yourself now, you probably will
be,'' said Katz, who is writing a book on the subject. ``You really
can't afford to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see lots of young women investing now,'' added Elaine D.
Mobley, a Sautee resident who is 65, retired and divorced. ``They
are not marrying so early, and many of them are better educated
now. They see they have to look after their own welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley began managing her family finances more than 30 years
ago, following an early retirement. ``I had no pension, and I knew
we had to prepare for our future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll released last week reflects increasing levels of
financial apprehension among women. Asked to name the biggest
challenge in their daily lives, 26 percent said money mattters.
Less common worries included family, 22 percent; health, 15
percent; time and stress, 14 percent; or career issues, 8 percent.
Education and equality got the remaining votes.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for those worries. Women live longer,
receive lower salaries and get less money from pensions and Social
Security. They also suffer more financial damage following divorce,
and older women tend to know less about money management.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, women have certainly been successful is
managing their investments. That shows in the returns of single-sex
investment clubs surveyed by the National Association of Investors
Corp. Over the clubs' lifetimes, women-only clubs racked up average
annual returns of 23.8 percent. Men's clubs averaged noticeably
less, 19.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A massive study of trading among 35,000 households comes to a
similar conclusion. The authors, economists Terrance Odean and Brad
M. Barber of the University of California at Davis, found that men
buy and sell stocks much more frequently than women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men lower their returns more than women because they trade
more, not because their security selections are worse,'' the
economists reported.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have pointed out a number of reasons that women become
better investors than men. Each of them could be a lesson for the
rest of us _ males and beginners of both genders.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hot tips. Women are cool to them. ``I think maybe this
reflects the makeup of women, their thinking process,'' said Katz.
``Women are looking for something good and solid that they can
depend on. They are usually very goal-oriented: I'm making this
investment for my retirement or for raising my children. Men are
likely to buy a story.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Research. Mobley said she reads investment publications
weekly, to keep up with the companies she already owns as well as
to look for new investments.
</P>
<P>
   Women also are more willing to call on experts and to grill
them, said Katz. ``Society doesn't expect them to know anything, so
they can't be too embarrassed to ask questions. Men are expected to
know financial things, and they feel they can embarrass
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Patience. The California study disclosed that women sell and
replace 53 percent of their investments each year. That may sound
high, but men turned over 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   High turnover increases transaction costs, and it reflects an
unhealthy concern with short-term results. ``The people who have
done well are those who can buy and hold on for a number of
years,'' said Ellen O. Keller, a certified financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the long-term philosophy,'' said Mobley, who has
achieved annual total returns of better than 15 percent over her
decades of investing. She tends to maintain her confidence in
stocks she has selected, even when the companies have bad years.
``Companies are like human beings: Our lives are not always happy
and easy and great, and companies are the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Price consciousness. ``Women are careful shoppers,'' said Mark
Robertson, a spokesman for the National Association of Investors
Corp. ``They are the ones buying Cisco when it drops down to $18 a
share, rather than when it's $80.''
</P>
<P>
   A related factor is an awareness of the cost of investing.
Mobley canned her first stockbroker. ``I realized this guy was
churning my accounts, and I fired him real fast,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diversification. It's a basic principle for successful
investors: Distribute your money among different kinds of
investments, and you lower your risk. ``Women like the idea of
spreading it around,'' Katz observed. ``Men may like to take more
of a risk. They aren't afraid to slap it all into one pot.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rational decision making. Women are less likely to buy and
sell on whims or to let their judgment be clouded by comparing
their returns with those of other people, according to Katz. ``It
all revolves around the fact that women are more likely to be
goal-oriented,'' she said. ``They don't have pride in their
investments, other than that they have been able to succeed in
their goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good advice,'' she added. ``It keeps you from buying
and selling on impulse if you know where you're going and you know
you've got to make it work.''

 &HT;    Sport Trac creates its own niche
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just when it seemed automakers had filled every
available niche in the pickup and sport utility vehicle classes,
here comes Ford with exactly what you didn't know you needed: the
half-SUV, half-truck Explorer Sport Trac.
</P>
<P>
   It's got the cabin of a Ford Explorer and a truncated cargo
cage. Its direct ancestors include the Ranchero, trotted out by
Ford in the late '60s to compete with Chevrolet's equally sleek El
Camino.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Ford is early on challenging the hybrid
vehicles coming from other manufacturers, including Subaru. The
acronym, obviously, is SUT, for sport-utility truck.
</P>
<P>
   The base price is $23,050 in two-wheel mode, plus options, which
can include a dash-mounted six-disc CD changer, power driver's
seat, overhead console with compass and temperature display,
running boards, leather interior and a tonneau cover for the
4.2-foot cargo area. The only engine initially available is a
4.0-liter V-6 rated at 205 horsepower and 240 pounds-feet of
torque. The basic transmission is an automatic five-speed that, in
the $25,820 four-wheel-drive version, can be switched anytime from
two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive with high- or low-range
capability.
</P>
<P>
   The Sport Trac, about 16 feet long with seating for five, drives
and rides like the Explorer on which it's based, rather than, say,
the F-150 pickup. The interior, too, is Explorer-like,
distinguished by white-face gauges and _ this is a gee-whiz item _
a power rear window. So while the Sport Trac won't pass the pickup
cargo test of taking a standard size sheet of plywood, it will take
skis, if you don't mind running them into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Other wrinkles include a removable soft bag akin to a backpack
in lieu of a center console and the Sport Trac's all-plastic bed,
intended to resist the dings and dents that come with hauling loads
in a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, Ford has done a good job of integrating the
disparate elements of the Sport Trac. The sculpted body panels
cleanly link the cabin and cargo bed, and the optional plastic
running boards are more than decorative because there's a step-up
of nearly 2 feet to the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, it's easy enough to think you're tooling along in an
Explorer. It's only when you look over your shoulder that you
realize there's a pickup rear _ of sorts _ behind you.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's only natural to think the Sport Trac, perhaps
redundant in view of other Ford offerings, could represent a useful
and logical evolution toward multipurpose vehicles that fill
general needs as well as niches.
</P>
<P>
   FORD EXPLORER SPORT TRAC
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2001 Ford Explorer two-wheel drive Sport Trac
</P>
<P>
   Base price: $23,050 (four-wheel drive: $25,820)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 4.0-liter V-6 engine (205 horsepower), five-speed
automatic transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, height-adjustable shoulder
belts, power anti-lock brakes
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 15 mpg premium unleaded city, 19 mpg highway

 &HT;    Amid rising gas prices, quality fuel remains your best bargain
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the escalating price of fuel continues to chisel
its way deeper into our wallets, the natural reaction of many
motorists is to find the cheapest gasoline available.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, you may have patronized a ``name brand'' gas
station, but today you are filling your tank with whatever is a few
cents less per gallon. This penny-wise/pound-foolish solution could
end up costing you more in the long run. In spite of its price, I
still adhere to the rule that quality fuel is the best bargain in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, all gasoline, no matter where it comes from, must
go through the same process to get it from crude oil source to a
combustible fuel. Further refinement of this fuel produces either
regular or premium gasoline, which is only a rating of the fuel's
ability to resist knock.
</P>
<P>
   Either the refiner or the retailer determines the differences
between the qualities of fuel. Fuel quality depends on the special
chemicals that are added to the base fuel. Additives include
detergents for the control of deposits, corrosion inhibitors and
antioxidants.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say the fictitious Fish Oil Co. is a large refiner and
retailer of gasoline. The gasoline in its storage tanks is
basically the same as the equally fictitious Olive Oil Co. When the
tanker truck fills up with Fish Oil fuel, a special ``won't clog
fuel injectors _ keeps the inside of your engine sparkling clean''
additive package is mixed with the fuel in the truck before it is
delivered to Fish Oil retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Olive Oil distributors use a similar ``clean and healthy
engine'' additive package for their Olive Oil service stations.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom Co. has a large chain of quickie marts/gas stations. It
buys its fuel from the lowest bidder and adds it own ``we guarantee
our gas'' package to the gas it sells. Snake Oil Co., a small
independent specializing in cheap gas and greasy tacos, also buys
the least expensive fuel. However, to keep prices low to the
consumer, this company doesn't use an additive package.
</P>
<P>
   Snake Oil gas is 10 cents a gallon less than Fish or Olive Oil
gas and 5 cents less than Zoom, but that savings will be
short-lived. Without the benefit of the fuel additives, his car,
especially if it is fuel-injected, is more likely to develop the
driveability problems all of those chemicals were designed to
eliminate. Combustion chamber deposits, varnish buildup on fuel
injectors, fuel system component corrosion and PCV valve gook are
the most common.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when a person is experiencing poor engine performance,
the first question I ask is ``Where are you buying your gas?''
</P>
<P>
   The pat reply I hear is, ``With the money I save in gas, I can
buy those bottles of gas cleaner stuff they sell at auto parts
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. How much should you use, and how often? Excessive use of
these products can damage fuel systems. Not enough, and you're back
in the cheap gas syndrome. If you are a chemical engineer, you may
be able to arrive at the right formula, but I don't want to think
that hard.
</P>
<P>
   Quality gasoline contains an additive package. It is sold at
reputable, high-volume retailers. Their names are too numerous to
mention, but you hear their ads on the radio and TV all of the
time. Some will even supply you with printed information on the
additives and their benefits if you ask.
</P>
<P>
   I know it is tempting to feed your vehicle the lowest-priced gas
you can find, but the consequences could far outweigh the immediate
monetary benefit. Don't take chances with your car's fuel system.
Buy good gas. If you insist on buying cheap gas, invest that money
you save in a good interest-bearing account. The extra cash will be
needed come repair time.

IN ELOQUENT STASIS, HAVANA AWAITS A NEW ERA

<P>
   In Havana, everything waits. Forty-one years after Fidel Castro
came down from the hills to claim Cuba's then-vibrant capital, the
island has become, says photographer Stephen Crowley, ``a giant
waiting room.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, Cuba has lost its place in the
superpower confrontation and lost its life-sustaining subsidies
from the Soviet Union. Virtually no Latin American governments look
admiringly on Castro or his regime anymore. Instead, 11 million
people live out the tail end of a revolution, on an island cut off
and no longer of vital interest to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   So Cubans have made lives out of waiting. They wait for a house
to move into, for their turn at the bread line, to buy newspapers
that later in the day will be used as toilet paper. They wait for
dollars, for a visa to the United States, for a ride, for a package
with life-saving medicines, for the lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   There is neither joy nor community in their desuetude.
Contemplating the length of another day, people sit on the curb or
listlessly stand next to each other, isolated, wrapped up in their
own worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the harsh tropical light, only the architecture seems
alive. The sensuous curves of Art Deco and the concrete and steel
of a later era are unexpectedly fluid. Whole buildings seem to
change by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   But the people of Cuba, together, yet alone, wait as if
suspended in time, in the calm before the storm. &QR;

 &HT;    Erma Bombeck's papers given to her alma mater
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ From all appearances, the late humor columnist
Erma Bombeck kept just about everything, and the University of
Dayton is ready to give it all a new, permanent, climate-controlled
home.
</P>
<P>
   Erma Bombeck, who died in 1996 of a kidney disease, left her
papers _ original manuscripts, correspondence, photographs, awards
and the like _ to the University of Dayton, where she was a member
of the 1949 graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   A sneak preview of boxes to come arrived about 2 1/2 weeks ago
from Bombeck's Arizona home, where Bill Bombeck has been faced with
the daunting task of organizing his late wife's papers into a state
suitable for their donation to her alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrie Moore, UD's archivist, is thrilled with what Mr. Bombeck
sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen so far, I can't wait to see the rest,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore asked for a select sampling of Bombeck memorabilia to
display during the university's Erma Bombeck Conference on Popular
American Humor this week. Mr. Bombeck responded with cartons of
documents representing the life and times of one of America's
favorite humorists, whose career began in her Centerville garage.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has separated everything into three categories:
professional, personal and philanthropic. There are photos from
Erma's tap-dancing days; snapshots of family vacations; a
hand-written note from George Bush; and copies of the New York
Times list of best sellers, upon which Erma's name appeared with
each book she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There's a letter from Bennet Cerf, publisher at Random House,
dated Oct. 28, 1952. ``A smart girl like you should sit down and
write a book,'' he advised, telling Bombeck to go ahead and send
him her manuscript when she did.
</P>
<P>
   There's a letter from an editor at a syndicate, dated Jan. 29,
1965, informing Erma that Glenn Thompson, then-editor at the Dayton
Journal Herald, had sent along some of her columns. The syndicate
was impressed. They wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   There's a July 2, 1984, Time cover featuring Erma's
by-then-famous face; copies of books in various translations,
including Japanese; and, weighing in at about 8 pounds, the
original, typed copy of The Grass is Always Greener Over the Septic
Tank.
</P>
<P>
   That original manuscript, typed on carbon paper and tied with
twine, will symbolically represent the entire collection of Erma
Bombeck papers at Friday's lunchtime ceremony, during which Bill
Bombeck will make the presentation to the university.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said Bombeck's papers are a great and welcome addition to
the university archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone of her fame, and as well-loved in our popular culture,
it really brings a lot of notoriety to the university,'' said
Moore. ``She was a great friend to UD.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the safekeeping of the documents, the UD archives
can be studied by anyone needing information for biographical
purposes or research projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the fun things about archives,'' said Moore,
whose job it will be to organize and cross-reference Bombeck's
papers. ``The research projects people come up with are
fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked when she thinks she'll have the documents in manageable
shape, Moore laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot possibly answer that question,'' she said. ``It's
going to take a while.''

 &HT;    When it comes to investing, women do it better
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Women live longer and have less money than men, so
they need to be better investors.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that women are better investors.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys support both those propositions, and financial
counselors confirm it from their day-to-day experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women invest as though their lives depend on it, and they
do,'' said Deena B. Katz, a certified financial planner in Coral
Gables, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that the average age of widowhood is 56 and that
a high percentage of marriages, first and second, end in divorce.
``If you are not taking care of yourself now, you probably will
be,'' said Katz, who is writing a book on the subject. ``You really
can't afford to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see lots of young women investing now,'' added Elaine D.
Mobley, a Sautee resident who is 65, retired and divorced. ``They
are not marrying so early, and many of them are better educated
now. They see they have to look after their own welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley began managing her family finances more than 30 years
ago, following an early retirement. ``I had no pension, and I knew
we had to prepare for our future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll released last week reflects increasing levels of
financial apprehension among women. Asked to name the biggest
challenge in their daily lives, 26 percent said money mattters.
Less common worries included family, 22 percent; health, 15
percent; time and stress, 14 percent; or career issues, 8 percent.
Education and equality got the remaining votes.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for those worries. Women live longer,
receive lower salaries and get less money from pensions and Social
Security. They also suffer more financial damage following divorce,
and older women tend to know less about money management.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, women have certainly been successful is
managing their investments. That shows in the returns of single-sex
investment clubs surveyed by the National Association of Investors
Corp. Over the clubs' lifetimes, women-only clubs racked up average
annual returns of 23.8 percent. Men's clubs averaged noticeably
less, 19.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A massive study of trading among 35,000 households comes to a
similar conclusion. The authors, economists Terrance Odean and Brad
M. Barber of the University of California at Davis, found that men
buy and sell stocks much more frequently than women.

they can't be too embarrassed to ask questions. Men are expected to

themselves.''
</P>

``Companies are like human beings: Our lives are not always happy
and easy and great, and companies are the same way.''

their goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good advice,'' she added. ``It keeps you from buying
and selling on impulse if you know where you're going and you know
you've got to make it work.''

 &HT;    Sport Trac creates its own niche
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just when it seemed automakers had filled every
available niche in the pickup and sport utility vehicle classes,
here comes Ford with exactly what you didn't know you needed: the
half-SUV, half-truck Explorer Sport Trac.
</P>
<P>
   It's got the cabin of a Ford Explorer and a truncated cargo
cage. Its direct ancestors include the Ranchero, trotted out by
Ford in the late '60s to compete with Chevrolet's equally sleek El
Camino.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Ford is early on challenging the hybrid
vehicles coming from other manufacturers, including Subaru. The
acronym, obviously, is SUT, for sport-utility truck.
</P>
<P>
   The base price is $23,050 in two-wheel mode, plus options, which
can include a dash-mounted six-disc CD changer, power driver's
seat, overhead console with compass and temperature display,
running boards, leather interior and a tonneau cover for the
4.2-foot cargo area. The only engine initially available is a
4.0-liter V-6 rated at 205 horsepower and 240 pounds-feet of
torque. The basic transmission is an automatic five-speed that, in
the $25,820 four-wheel-drive version, can be switched anytime from
two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive with high- or low-range
capability.
</P>
<P>
   The Sport Trac, about 16 feet long with seating for five, drives
and rides like the Explorer on which it's based, rather than, say,
the F-150 pickup. The interior, too, is Explorer-like,
distinguished by white-face gauges and _ this is a gee-whiz item _
a power rear window. So while the Sport Trac won't pass the pickup
cargo test of taking a standard size sheet of plywood, it will take
skis, if you don't mind running them into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Other wrinkles include a removable soft bag akin to a backpack
in lieu of a center console and the Sport Trac's all-plastic bed,
intended to resist the dings and dents that come with hauling loads
in a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, Ford has done a good job of integrating the
disparate elements of the Sport Trac. The sculpted body panels
cleanly link the cabin and cargo bed, and the optional plastic
running boards are more than decorative because there's a step-up
of nearly 2 feet to the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, it's easy enough to think you're tooling along in an
Explorer. It's only when you look over your shoulder that you
realize there's a pickup rear _ of sorts _ behind you.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's only natural to think the Sport Trac, perhaps
redundant in view of other Ford offerings, could represent a useful
and logical evolution toward multipurpose vehicles that fill
general needs as well as niches.
</P>
<P>
   FORD EXPLORER SPORT TRAC
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2001 Ford Explorer two-wheel drive Sport Trac
</P>
<P>
   Base price: $23,050 (four-wheel drive: $25,820)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 4.0-liter V-6 engine (205 horsepower), five-speed
automatic transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, height-adjustable shoulder
belts, power anti-lock brakes
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 15 mpg premium unleaded city, 19 mpg highway

 &HT;    Amid rising gas prices, quality fuel remains your best bargain
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the escalating price of fuel continues to chisel
its way deeper into our wallets, the natural reaction of many
motorists is to find the cheapest gasoline available.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, you may have patronized a ``name brand'' gas
station, but today you are filling your tank with whatever is a few
cents less per gallon. This penny-wise/pound-foolish solution could
end up costing you more in the long run. In spite of its price, I
still adhere to the rule that quality fuel is the best bargain in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, all gasoline, no matter where it comes from, must
go through the same process to get it from crude oil source to a
combustible fuel. Further refinement of this fuel produces either
regular or premium gasoline, which is only a rating of the fuel's
ability to resist knock.
</P>
<P>
   Either the refiner or the retailer determines the differences
between the qualities of fuel. Fuel quality depends on the special
chemicals that are added to the base fuel. Additives include
detergents for the control of deposits, corrosion inhibitors and
antioxidants.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say the fictitious Fish Oil Co. is a large refiner and
retailer of gasoline. The gasoline in its storage tanks is
basically the same as the equally fictitious Olive Oil Co. When the
tanker truck fills up with Fish Oil fuel, a special ``won't clog
fuel injectors _ keeps the inside of your engine sparkling clean''
additive package is mixed with the fuel in the truck before it is
delivered to Fish Oil retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Olive Oil distributors use a similar ``clean and healthy
engine'' additive package for their Olive Oil service stations.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom Co. has a large chain of quickie marts/gas stations. It
buys its fuel from the lowest bidder and adds it own ``we guarantee
our gas'' package to the gas it sells. Snake Oil Co., a small
independent specializing in cheap gas and greasy tacos, also buys
the least expensive fuel. However, to keep prices low to the
consumer, this company doesn't use an additive package.
</P>
<P>
   Snake Oil gas is 10 cents a gallon less than Fish or Olive Oil
gas and 5 cents less than Zoom, but that savings will be
short-lived. Without the benefit of the fuel additives, his car,
especially if it is fuel-injected, is more likely to develop the
driveability problems all of those chemicals were designed to
eliminate. Combustion chamber deposits, varnish buildup on fuel
injectors, fuel system component corrosion and PCV valve gook are
the most common.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when a person is experiencing poor engine performance,
the first question I ask is ``Where are you buying your gas?''
</P>
<P>
   The pat reply I hear is, ``With the money I save in gas, I can
buy those bottles of gas cleaner stuff they sell at auto parts
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. How much should you use, and how often? Excessive use of
these products can damage fuel systems. Not enough, and you're back
in the cheap gas syndrome. If you are a chemical engineer, you may
be able to arrive at the right formula, but I don't want to think
that hard.
</P>
<P>
   Quality gasoline contains an additive package. It is sold at
reputable, high-volume retailers. Their names are too numerous to
mention, but you hear their ads on the radio and TV all of the
time. Some will even supply you with printed information on the
additives and their benefits if you ask.
</P>
<P>
   I know it is tempting to feed your vehicle the lowest-priced gas
you can find, but the consequences could far outweigh the immediate
monetary benefit. Don't take chances with your car's fuel system.
Buy good gas. If you insist on buying cheap gas, invest that money
you save in a good interest-bearing account. The extra cash will be
needed come repair time.

E-MAIL IS TREACHEROUS. SO WHY DO WE KEEP TRUSTING IT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By AMY HARMON   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Microsoft Corp.'s e-mail storage system had been as flawed as
the one at the White House, the software company might have been
spared many of the more painful moments in its continuing antitrust
battle with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of electronic messages that were supposed to
have been saved on White House computers may not prove any less
embarrassing for the Clinton administration than the vast e-mail
archive behind the government's antitrust case was to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Court filings disclosed last week that the Justice Department
has opened a criminal investigation into whether White House
officials suppressed e-mail messages subpoenaed in investigations
of the administration. Because of a glitch in the White House
electronic mail system, thousands of messages were not saved in a
way in which they could be conveniently searched to comply with
subpoenas dealing with campaign fund raising, Monica Lewinsky and
other matters.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether White House officials who knew of the glitch
understood its implications and tried to cover it up. But whether
or not they did, and whether or not any of the missing mail is
relevant to the subpoenas, the investigation underscores the value
placed on e-mail as a particularly revealing window on the truth.
</P>
<P>
   And as it unravels, the case may once again highlight the
persistent assumption among e-mail users _ despite overwhelming
evidence to the contrary _ that their electronic correspondence is
private. (It may also highlight the misconception that historians
no longer have paper trails to follow.)
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Lt. Col. Oliver North unwittingly proved that
e-mail, so apparently ephemeral, is harder to expunge than paper
documents comfortingly run through a shredder. North thought he had
deleted electronic messages regarding his assistance in providing
arms to Nicaraguan rebels, but it turned out that he had neglected
to eliminate the back-up copies.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, a wave of court cases based on e-mail has mounted.
In the Microsoft trial, the credibility of company's chairman, Bill
Gates, was undermined when he flatly denied in his deposition what
he had previously written in electronic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Microsoft trial, many companies issued strict
policies governing employees' use of e-mail. Yet people continue to
send such messages that they would never commit to a written
document _ and save them. Henry H. Perritt Jr., dean of the Chicago
Kent College of Law, said, ``What the Microsoft case showed is that
people need to think about e-mail as a form of writing, as opposed
to a telephone call or a face-to-face conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   So why don't they?
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be the seductive quality of computer
communication, which encourages the belief that words are
disappearing into the ether. ``In a public situation, you are
clearly aware of people listening,'' said Sara Kiesler, a professor
of human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. ``But
on a computer you have to monitor yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the apparently intractable human tendency to blab
electronically, several companies are proposing to fight technology
with technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sendmail, whose software handles most of the world's electronic
mail traffic, is working with others on a standard that would
enable senders to control whether their e-mail can be forwarded by
the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, appropriately named Disappearing Inc., is
developing an encryption system that would enable senders to set a
date when their such mail would no longer be readable.
</P>
<P>
   But there is concern that such features could also dampen
enthusiasm for a medium whose speed and simplicity has made it a
hugely popular form of communication. ``A hard problem is how to do
this in a way that doesn't take away from the trillion messages
that are being sent each day,'' said Greg Olson, president of
Sendmail. ``This is a very delicate evolution.''

 &HT;    Adding insulation saves on energy bills
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Look at adding more insulation to a home as
an investment, not as a cost, three contractors agree.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Weaver of W.C. Weaver Insulation summed it up best when he
said, ``We've saved thousands of people thousands of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   With the rising cost of energy, it makes sense to save money
whenever possible. The problem is, most people don't think about
cutting corners until its too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like most people don't think about fixing their roof
until it leaks,'' said David Burris, manager of Tri-City
Insulation. ``Most people don't think about fixing their insulation
until they see their utility bill either in the dead of winter or
the middle of summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to 1974, there was no insulation code for homes built in
North Carolina. Most homes built between 1974 and 1980 were
insulated, but not all of them were insulated properly, Burris
said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 5 percent of Burris' business stems from insulating
older homes. It's just too hard to get behind the walls, underneath
the floorboards and in the ceiling. And, as the difficultly level
increases, so does the price, Burris said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon for homeowners to insulate their attics,
though. The attic is where most homes experience the greatest
amount of energy loss, up to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The three most common insulating materials are Fiberglas,
cellulose and rock wool. Fiberglas is made out of sand. Cellulose
is made out of recycled papers. And rock wool, the oldest known
insulation, is made out of melted rock.
</P>
<P>
   Clete Kiper, owner of Spray Tech Insulation in Nashville, Tenn.,
only insulates homes with rock or mineral wool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all-natural. It doesn't burn. And it has no chemical
additives,'' he said. ``We're really trying to push the health
aspect here.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver insulates with Fiberglas because of its low cost, high
availability and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of ways to insulate. Kiper uses the spray
method, in which insulation is funneled from a work truck to inside
the home through a long hose. Air pressure forces the insulation
through the hose, where it's directed to the desired site.
</P>
<P>
   The spray method isn't cheap. Aboard one of Kiper's work trucks
is $80,000 worth of insulating equipment. He prefers the spray
method, he said, because it takes less time and effort than laying
batt.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Burris don't have a preference. They spray insulation
and lay batt, depending on the application. Batt comes in preformed
pieces. Insulating contractors cut it down to size to fit into the
appropriate cavities.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the monetary gains, properly insulated homes offer
health benefits and enhance comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Insulation helps keep molds, spores, mildews and carpet mites
from making their way into homes, Kiper said.
</P>
<P>
   It also creates a more uniform temperature throughout the house,
thus increasing comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Burris reminds homeowners that an insulated home is also a
quieter home.
</P>
<P>
   Insulation is something people can add to a house that
eventually will pay them back. In two years, because of the money
they will have saved on utility bills, most homeowners will get
back every dollar they invested in insulation.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of adding insulation depends on the size of the house,
the material used and the method of insulation. Weaver, Burris and
Kiper offer estimates.

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A great deal of research is being conducted to
establish the variables that enhance and preserve mental sharpness
and acuity. Some have been demonstrated to be more effective than
others, and further research will eventually help establish the
things that are effective as opposed to those that are valueless or
even harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a list of things that at the present time are being
considered for their effectiveness in helping individuals achieve
and maintain mental sharpness:
</P>
<P>
   _ The interaction of certain medications that can produce
confusion and cause memory problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Estrogen replacement therapy in women, which boosts the
production of certain chemicals essential in effective brain
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Regular exercise, giving rise to both physical and
psychological benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Healthy sleep patterns, both getting enough sleep and the
avoidance of problems such as obstructive sleep apnea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Effective methods of dealing with stress. Some studies are
pointing to the possibility that prolonged stress can actually
cause changes in brain chemistry and therefore brain structure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoidance of chronic depression and anxiety. Both of these
emotional problems can definitely impair healthy mental
functioning. Short-term memory is especially sensitive to the
effects of prolonged impaired mood states.
</P>
<P>
   _ Staying mentally stimulated. Although the net effect of
``brain exercises'' is still being studied, working crossword
puzzles, playing games that involve memory exercises, etc., are
considered by some experts to be helpful in retaining mental
sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eliminating poor indoor ventilation. Some authorities believe
that regular breathing in poorly ventilated work or living areas
can be harmful to brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   _ Herbal derivatives such as Gingko Biloba are promoted as being
effective in opening blood vessels in the brain and aiding in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Multivitamins are being studied as possible ways to decrease
the rate of aging at the cellular level and thus impacting memory
functions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decrease the ingestion of food or beverages prepared in
aluminum cookware.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide better protection for children and adults
participating in athletic events where head trauma is frequent. For
example, some experts caution about the potential damage from
frequent ``headers'' in soccer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Educate parents about the potential damage done to infants
when shaking or rapidly changing head position.
</P>
<P>
   Further research will assist in determining the relative
importance of each of these variables in attaining and maintaining
mental sharpness and acuity.

THE HARD BUSINESS OF SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JILL ABRAMSON   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``They call us the fathers of soft money,'' Bob
Farmer says, and he's not preening. Neither is Bob Mosbacher, the
other hangdog dad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Farmer, the top money man for Michael Dukakis and the
Democratic Party, and Mosbacher, finance chairman for George Bush
and the Republicans, were the kings of campaign fund-raising. More
than that, they earned a place in political history by starting the
first national programs to raise soft money, the large,
unrestricted gifts to the two parties by wealthy individuals,
corporations and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them have lived to feel some regret over their fiscal
ingenuity (though not, it must be said, the victories it
contributed to). Today, Farmer says it's high time Washington
passed campaign finance reform legislation. ``Obviously, money in
politics is totally out of control,'' he says. Mosbacher agrees
that ``it's gotten totally out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's about to get worse, predicts Jeffrey Birnbaum, author
of ``The Money Men'' (Crown Books), a forthcoming book about
political fund raising. ``There will be far more soft money than
ever before,'' he says. Experts on campaign finance agree, some
estimating that during the 2000 elections the two parties could
collect as much as $500 million in soft money contributions. That's
up from $262 million four years ago, when there were widespread
fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum says that the Clinton-Gore money team has taken soft
money to a new level. ``At one time in the Democratic Party, it was
time to celebrate if they got a $50,000 check,'' he says. ``Now a
host of wealthy Democrats are expected to fork over $100,000 or
more every year.'' The Republicans, Birnbaum adds, ``are hungry for
victory, having been out of the White House for eight long years.''
More than 50 wealthy Republicans have joined the Regents, which
costs them $250,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from the sidelines, Farmer and Mosbacher sound a little
like those physicists who came to regret having invented nuclear
weapons, which set off the arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1988, Farmer says, he feared that the Republicans, who
held the White House, would raise so much money they would swamp
the Democrats. So he came up with the idea of asking wealthy
supporters to write $100,000 checks to the Democratic Party. They
got a fancy name, the Democratic Trustees, and although the money
they gave went into party coffers, most of it was spent to help the
Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned about the Democrats' program, Mosbacher says, he
worried about being outpaced, so he promptly copied their idea,
calling the Republican version Team 100. Mosbacher says Vice
President George Bush didn't like the idea. ``He moaned and
groaned,'' Mosbacher recalls. ``He foresaw it as something that
would be perceived as someone getting clout for making a big
contribution.'' But he went along with Mosbacher's argument that
the Republicans would be ``left in the lurch'' if they left the
soft money field to Farmer. That year, Farmer recruited 130
Democratic Trustees, while Mosbacher drew 267 members to Team 100.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1988, soft money played an insignificant role, though it
was permitted by a loophole in the post-Watergate federal election
laws passed in 1974, which allowed unrestricted donations to
political parties for party-building activities, like voter
registration drives. Legal challenges to close the loophole have
failed, much to the benefit of presidential candidates, to whom
direct contributions from individuals are limited by law to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The soft money reaped by the two parties in 1988 was a pittance
compared with today, when almost every political leader, from
President Clinton on down, reserves large blocks of time for wooing
big contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' Farmer says. ``They are all spending all
their time on the phone asking for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore has challenged Gov. George W. Bush not to
accept soft money, but even as he issued his proposal, his party's
largest benefactors were invited to a series of lunches. In
Manhattan last Wednesday, for example, Gore raised more than
$700,000 for his party from about 75 donors at two lunches. The
Republican Party will also raise huge amounts of soft money to
support Bush, who has already raised more than $70 million in hard
money for his presidential campaign, an unprecedented sum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, $100,000 donations have become commonplace. And some
of the high rollers from 1988 are rolling higher today. Richard T.
Farmer, an Ohio executive who was one of the original Team 100
members, gave $445,000 to the Republican Party last year. Carl
Lindner, another Ohio executive who was one of Farmer's big
supporters, gave the Democratic Party $270,000 last year, according
to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bob Farmer and Mosbacher, now that they no longer spend
their days raising money, favor campaign finance reform. But they
doubt that Sen. John McCain's bill to ban soft money or the other
proposals now debated in Congress would work. Farmer, who served as
President Clinton's consul general to Bermuda and now runs a
high-tech company in Miami, would like legislation mandating free
or discounted television time for presidential candidates.
Mosbacher, chairman of a Texas energy company, thinks that if
corporate soft money is banned, independent spending by labor
unions must be constrained.
</P>
<P>
   But neither option, Farmer says, will shut the door on soft
money. ``The problem with campaign finance reform,'' he says, ``is
that every time you close one loophole, you open others.''

 &HT;    Eron Field a `world attraction'
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Tal Smith was hooked on baseball long before he walked
wide-eyed into a major-league ballpark for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   It took a lot of badgering to persuade his parents to allow him
the biggest treat of his young life. And so it was that his mother
dropped off the biggest 7-year-old fan of the Boston Red Sox at
Fenway Park that summer afternoon in 1940 while she shopped for
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   As much as he was taken by the grace of the game's consummate
hitter, Ted Williams, Smith was just as overwhelmed by the giant
outfield fence known as the Green Monster and the meandering quirks
and cozy charm of the stadium where he could almost reach out and
touch Dom DiMaggio or Bobby Doerr.
</P>
<P>
   In the 60 years since, Smith has watched thousands of ballgames
in dozens of ballparks as a scout for the Cincinnati Reds, farm
director of the Colt .45s in Houston and vice president for the New
York Yankees and Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I maintain that part of the appeal of baseball is the
distinctive features of each ballpark,'' Smith said. ``Every
basketball court and football field measures the same, but baseball
can provide something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Now as president of the Astros, Smith brought his love of
ballpark nuances and idiosyncrasies to the design of the new Enron
Field, a $250 million palace in downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ballpark is so unique and such a world attraction that
it's great from the fans' standpoint,'' said Smith, who also had a
hand in the construction of Houston's Colt Stadium and the
Astrodome.''This is baseball at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   Or soon will be. Somewhere amid the dust and the wheelbarrows
lies a gem of a baseball diamond just waiting to be discovered.
That time will come Thursday night when the world-champion New York
Yankees play the Astros in the first of two exhibitions in the
plush, 42,000-seat ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be one of the most exciting and memorable events
in Houston's sports history,'' said Astros owner Drayton McLane.
``It looks like an old-timey ballpark and looks a lot like the
storefronts that we all grew up knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Definitely not the Astrodome
</P>
<P>
   The brick-and-limestone stadium bathed in an aqua color blends
the distinctive feel of old-fashioned ballparks and the latest in
modern technology. It offers the brick facade of Wrigley Field and
the rounded arches and a pronounced railroad motif as well. Even
the retractable roof resembles an old train shed. Fourteen
railroads once owned major terminals in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Union Station, with its majestic marble columns and a
47-foot-high lobby ceiling, abuts Enron Field. The building served
as the main railroad terminal for passengers and World War II
soldiers from 1911 until the early 1970s and was designed by the
same architect who drew up the master plans for Grand Central
Station.
</P>
<P>
   Once restored, the ornate building with the neoclassical revival
style will serve as the main entrance to the ballpark off Crawford
Street for an expected 3 million fans this season. It also will
house a retail store, a cafe and the Astros' corporate offices.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. Enron Field will be everything the Astrodome
was not: open air, when that air isn't too hot or humid; natural
grass, not AstroTurf, although the team already has had to resod
the infield with a hardy Tifway 419 bermuda; and a much smaller
facility than the 55,000-seat Dome. Enron Field offers further
confirmation that baseball is distancing itself from the
cookie-cutter, bowl-shaped dome stadiums and embracing more
intimate, open-air, downtown stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't anything architecturally replicated from the
Astrodome,'' said Earl Santee, Enron Field's lead architect from
the HOK Sport architecture firm in Kansas City, Mo. ``There's not
one thing they wanted us to carry over.''
</P>
<P>
   All the serious work has been completed in time for the home
opener against Philadelphia on April 7 as major-league baseball,
for the first time, will unveil three new stadiums in the same
season. The other two are in Detroit (Comerica Park) and San
Francisco (Pacific Bell Park).
</P>
<P>
   Enron Field is, by far, the least expensive and, in fact, came
in $1.8 million under budget. Arizona's Bank One Ballpark, for
instance, cost $465 million, and Seattle's Safeco Field topped $500
million and doesn't even require air conditioning. For 30 years,
the Astros will pay $7.2 million in annual rent, counting $2.5
million as a maintenance fund. The team also chipped in 36 percent
of the stadium's total cost. Bonds will be retired through user
fees, a hotel-motel tax and a tax on rental cars.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting the sport's trend toward downsizing, which heightens
ticket demand and brings fans closer to the action, Enron Field
will be among baseball's smallest ballparks with its 42,000-seating
capacity although Detroit's will accommodate only 40,000 fans and
San Francisco's only 40,800. Like the others, Houston's new home is
an urban ballpark, cut out of a tiny sliver of land northeast of
downtown and tucked inside Highway 59.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, HOK Sport had to tailormake Enron according to the
constraints of the 25 acres available. That explains one of the
shortest left-field porches in baseball at a Jeff Bagwell-friendly
315 feet, although it comes with a Fenway-like, 21-foot-high wall.
Conversely, no center fielders will stretch their legs more than
new Astro Roger Cedeno, who can retreat 435 feet to straightaway
center and still make a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to do so, Cedeno also will have to be wary of a
flagpole that's in the field of play some three feet away from the
wall. And to add to the degree of difficulty, he will have to
battle a 20-degree incline on the last patch of grass between the
warning track and the center-field wall. Astros employees lovingly
call it ``Tal's Hill'' because it's the brainchild of Smith, a
student of the game who loves ``wrinkles'' and was well aware that
Detroit's old Tiger Stadium had a flagpole in the field and that
Yankee Stadium, before it was renovated, had its monuments honoring
players such as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in the field of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, old Forbes Field was so deep that they stored the batting
cage right there in center field,'' Smith said. ``There was no
other place to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the deepest center field in baseball, coupled with the
flagpole and the incline, fans should expect more triples and even
inside-the-park home runs. Pitchers can only hope for more deep
outs.
</P>
<P>
   All of those features are firsts for HOK, which has built or
renovated more than 500 sports facilities, including Jacobs Field,
Coors Field and Oriole Park at Camden Yards and has had a hand in
most of the 12 new ballparks built since 1990. Enron offers
countless other innovations, like the closed captioning for the
hearing impaired on the 131-foot-wide scoreboard as well as the
day's stock-market quotes. But it scratched the dirt trail leading
from the mound to home plate, maybe because the Arizona
Diamondbacks noticed it on Enron's artist renderings and
incorporated the idea in its park.
</P>
<P>
   McLane's pride and joy, though, is the 24-ton replica of a 1927
Wild West steam locomotive that will huff and puff with every
Astros home run and zip down an 800-foot track from center field to
left. The 57-foot-long engine was built in Minnesota and has
arrived in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? McLane might don a conductor's cap and take the first
ride on Thursday night. ``There's definitely a place for somebody
to drive it,'' Santee quipped.
</P>
<P>
   `You'd better bring gloves'
</P>
<P>
   Promoted as one of the most intimate stadiums in baseball, the
first-row seats are three feet closer to the diamond than at
Wrigley Field, the benchmark for cozy ballparks. ``You'd better
bring gloves,'' McLane advised fans.
</P>
<P>
   Those farther away in the upper deck will be treated to a
dazzling view of the downtown Houston skyline. Even when the roof
is closed, those down the right-field line will not have their
sight line obstructed because the architects saw fit to build a
sliding-glass wall running from left field to center field, making
it the world's largest sliding-glass patio door.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,500 season tickets have been sold, a club record
shattering last year's high of 15,500. Ninety-five percent of those
renewed, said John Sorrentino, vice president for ticket sales. The
Astros will cap sales at about 23,000 to allow for single-game
ticket-buyers, but the first seven games of the season, including
three exhibitions with the Yankees and Texas Rangers, have been
sold out. The average ticket price is $18 with a high of $29 for
dugout box seats and a low of $5 for outfield upper-deck seats, but
kids under 14 can sit in the upper deck for a buck. To assure
yourself of the option to keep your seat for up to 30 years, you
had to shell out up to $20,000 for a Permanent Seat License.
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime fans will miss the vast parking lot of the
Astrodome, not to mention its cushioned seats and
climate-controlled air conditioning. Only the club seats and seats
in the 63 luxury suites are padded. McLane notes there are 14,000
parking spots in the same radius of Enron Field as that which
included 24,000 slots surrounding the Astrodome. Enron includes 96
on-site parking spots, 2,040 reserved spots nearby and room for
more than 25,000 cars within a half-mile radius.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to think many in the crowd will be among the 160,000
people who work downtown and will already have parked their cars.
For those who don't, 35 city-run trolleys cover the immediate area
_ the city plans to buy six more _ and will run 45 minutes after
games end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the Astrodome,'' said Ward Adkins, a 53-year-old
oil-and-gas attorney who saw the first and last games played in
that stadium and has held season tickets since 1986. ``I think
we'll be closer to the action at Enron, and the concourses around
the concession stands are wider, but I'll miss the cushioned seats.
Plus, if you go outside in Houston in the middle of August, it's
like a fever. I don't want to spend $100 to go to an event and
sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a $50 million retractable roof, Adkins and his friends
shouldn't have to. Enron's three-paneled roof weighing 5,000 tons
can close in approximately 12 minutes, and the 17 custom air
handling units can cool down Enron Field in four hours. The roof on
Arizona's Bank One Ballpark can close in 4 1/2 minutes, ``if she's
in a good mood,'' said the facility's senior inspector, David
Brown. ``It's four minutes, 35 seconds if she's cranky.''
</P>
<P>
   Santee, who has worked on 50 of HOK's stadiums and currently is
at work for ballparks for the Pirates, Yankees and Red Sox, claims
Bank One Ballpark's roof casts shadows on the playing field unlike
Enron's movable roof, which disappears behind the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   According to research over the last five years, McLane argues
that the roof will be open for almost all of April and May games
and between 65 and 70 percent of all the innings for the Astros' 81
home games. It needs to stay open to provide up to six hours of
daylight for groundskeeper Luke Jenkins' precious grass. Everyone
remembers that the natural grass in the Dome died because of a lack
of sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have received approval from major-league baseball to
open the roof one time during the game if the weather conditions
allows, but only with umpires' approval. ``We can't open and close
it to suit the Astros,'' McLane said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's as much about the fans as the players. Enron has more
women's restrooms than men's and is above the city code
requirements by 44 percent for women and 165 percent for men. Fans
can frequent up to 35 concession stands to eat and will have every
imaginable food item from grilled (not boiled) Star Dogs to sushi.
Enron will even offer food found in the visiting team's city,
starting with Philly cheesesteaks for the opening series with the
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of making the customer feel wanted. Why, there's
even a small balcony jutting out over left-center field for
bystanders who don't want to sit.
</P>
<P>
   Like Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to stand during games,'' Smith said. ``Judge Roy
Hofheinz (Astrodome founder) did, too. He even had a stand-up desk.
We'll see how it works. It's just another wrinkle.''

 &HT;    Foundation cracks don't mean house is ready to fall down
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You'd think that if your house foundation starts
to crack you've got big problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, to quote from ``Porgy and Bess,'' it ain't necessarily so.
</P>
<P>
   Small cracks in foundations are perfectly normal, and ignoring
superficial cracks won't lead to your kitchen sliding off into the
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   When the cracks are large enough to stick a finger through, or
when your basement walls bow inward or lean, then you've got cause
for concern. But it's not time to panic.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Glacken, owner of Hydra-Lift System of Dayton, said he's
been in the foundation-repair business about 16 years, and ``over
the years I've only seen five or six houses that were in danger of
falling down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley is in the midst of a period of low rainfall
that has lasted at least five years, and Glacken and other
foundation specialists say the drought has contributed to
foundation problems in houses that have never had them before.
</P>
<P>
   As soils under houses contract, the support under foundations
shifts, and that puts stresses on the concrete. Concrete is
incredibly resistant to crushing, but it can crack if stretched or
twisted. The same goes for bricks and the mortar between bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks develop at natural stress points: between bricks and
concrete blocks, at corners around windows and doors, where
concrete steps meet the foundation and so on.
</P>
<P>
   If you notice a hairline crack that wasn't there before, you
should keep an eye on it to be sure it isn't expanding or moving.
</P>
<P>
   One way to check a crack is to put a piece of tape across it.
Check back in a couple of days; if the tape is twisted, that
indicates the wall is continuing to shift.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, though, cracks expand and contract slowly as
temperatures change. In the heat of summer, the walls swell,
squeezing cracks closed. When the walls cool off in the winter they
contract, and the cracks may get a bit wider.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time of year to apply a little silicone and latex
caulk to visible cracks in concrete. Because the weather is fairly
mild, the cracks are at about the midpoint of their expansion and
contraction cycle. Caulk applied now should be able to stretch to
keep covering the cracks when they are at their widest.
</P>
<P>
   At hardware and home-improvement stores, you can find caulk
colored to match concrete approximately, but don't expect an
invisible repair.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sowder, vice president of W.T. Sowder Construction of
Centerville, said if cracks develop between bricks and the crack
hasn't changed in years, the problem can be fixed by tuckpointing
the bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Tuckpointing involves removing some of the deteriorating mortar
between the bricks and replacing it with fresh mortar. You can get
tips on tuckpointing from places where bricks and mortar are sold.
It's a process that will keep you hunched over in front of a brick
wall for hours at a time, but it's a job the average
do-it-yourselfer can handle with a little instruction.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a basement, apply caulk on both inside and outside
cracks above ground level. The cracks can be a path for air to
escape from the house, and patching them may improve energy
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   If you have cracks or holes below ground level, you can deal
with them from inside the basement in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   To fix a hole of less than about two inches, you can use a
cement-hole plugging compound from a hardware store. Plugging
compounds usually come in two parts that are kneaded together to
make a claylike plug.
</P>
<P>
   You have to use a chisel to remove crumbly material from the
edges of the hole. Also use the chisel to slope the sides of the
hole so the hole is wider on the inside than at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   After cleaning the hole, force the plugging compound into the
hole. The rim formed by angling the sides of the hole will help
hold the plug in place.
</P>
<P>
   Narrow cracks are fixed in much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   You may need to add a latex bonding agent and cement to fix
larger holes and cracks. Cement comes in powder form and is mixed
with water to form a heavy paste. Spreading a latex bonding agent
in the hole or crack will help hold the cement plug in place.
Bonding agents are sold where cement is sold.
</P>
<P>
   While cracks and holes are common, serious foundation problems
are rare. And serious foundation problems require professional
intervention and can be quite expensive to repair.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of serious foundation problems is a basement wall
that bows inward. That indicates tremendous pressure in the soil
behind the wall trying to burst through. The same goes for a
leaning wall or a door that won't close.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no hundred-dollar fix for a bad foundation,'' Glacken
said. ``You're usually talking about several thousand instead of
several hundred'' dollars.

addressing only a few of them. (Kabat, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED

some of the excess: No more taxpayer-financed security for

   BLACK-TAXIS-COMMENT _ The question, by most accounts, is
mundane. Unless, of course, the person posing the query is a black
man trying to get to a dance club in Southeast Washington, D.C., at
1 o'clock in the morning. ``Can I get a cab?'' I asked the man at
the front desk of the downtown hotel where I stayed Valentine's Day
weekend. ``It's going to be very difficult,'' he replied.

<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ William Jefferson Clinton is embracing an
almost quixotic quest for a legacy that would put Monica Lewinsky
out of our minds. It won't happen. This not only is a lame-duck
president but one with baggage so heavy that other world leaders
see no reason to genuflect before him. (Kleinberg, Cox News
Service.) MOVED MONDAY.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``A purple Cadillac is the
last thing I've ever dreamed of owning,'' Gail assures me in her
recent e-mail, ``but lately I've been having these funny
daydreams.'' ``Don't worry about it,'' I answer, ``it's a mild
delusion brought on by Social Security anxiety.'' I punch SEND and
get back to work _ but not for long. Another message from Gail. ``I
blame the whole thing on going out for chowder with Arthur. He got
to droning on about some client of his and pretty soon my focus
wandered. Suddenly, there I was in a purple Cadillac. (Schuett, Cox

foundations are perfectly normal, and ignoring superficial cracks
won't lead to your kitchen sliding off into the back yard.

   HOUSES-INSULATION _ Older homes have their faults as well as

of difficulty based on where in the house it has to be installed.

   BLOOMSIDE _ A lot of gardening involves timing. By knowing what
blooms when you can combine plants according to when they flower
and in a sequence that will extend your garden's show throughout
the seasons. To help sort through the options, we provide 50 trees,
shrubs, perennials and bulbs and chart them on a seven-month
calendar according to when they bloom (Annuals weren't included
because their summer show is easy for most to plan). This pull-out
chart also should help you plan your beds so that they have
continuous color, or at least when you want it. Keep in mind,
however, that like the weather, gardening holds no absolutes.

REMEMBERING JEAN SHEPHERD: PECULIAR RIFFS ON AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (editors: text that should be italicized is marked with (BEGIN 
ITALICS HERE) and (END ITALICS HERE) 
 (bl) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's start with a supportable thesis, and duly credit a master:
For pure listening satisfaction it's hard to improve on the
seductive intimacy of radio.
</P>
<P>
   From 1956 to 1977, Jean Shepherd held weeknight seminars on
WOR-AM in New York that were part Kabuki, part commedia dell'arte,
part Uncle Remus. In his flat, nasal Indiana twang, playing all the
parts, and the occasional kazoo, he oozed into the darkened
bedrooms of East Coast America on the battery power of cheap
Japanese transistor radios. The meandering stories he told _ they
always came back to the point,  &UR; always &LR;  _ were usually about him.
But they also seemed to be about us _ about the old man, family car
trips, the Catch-22 Army and a cast of playmates from childhood and
adolescence, through whom all the complexities of life on earth
would be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   What was he? Social commentator? Cult leader? Or just a manic
kid from a blue-collar background discovering his subversive id in
the age of Eisenhower? It was Shepherd, after all, who alerted
America to the scourge of ``creeping meatballism,'' the postwar
rush to a conformist society where happiness meant cars with tail
fins and a refreshing, ice-cold bottle of Pepsi-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing department at WOR never deciphered his demographic
silhouette. The station fired him in 1977, over frustration with
his format. Shepherd continued to write books (``In God We Trust,
All Others Pay Cash,'' ``Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories
and Other Disasters'') and went on to make films for public
television and delve into other broadcasting venues from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
   His death last October at age 78 proved a catalyst for a
memorial by his admirers, among them the humorist Harry Shearer and
Art Silverman, associate producer of ``All Things Considered'' on
National Public Radio. With others they put together a two-hour
show of reminiscences as well as generous chunks from Shepherd's
programs. The result, ``A Voice in the Night,'' was broadcast last
Christmas Eve on KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in April, the program will be distributed to public
radio stations around the country to schedule as they wish. In New
York, WNYC-AM will broadcast the show May 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an insatiable appetite for one-way conversation,'' said
Silverman, recalling some off-the-air encounters in which he felt
more like audience than companion.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common refrain among those who knew Shepherd, one that
may help explain why he worked alone, with rarely anything more
than a newspaper clipping in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from the radio tribute follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ By CHARLES STRUM
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Shepherd essays cannot easily be excerpted;

PINOCHET'S REVENGE: OLIVER NORTH, YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JAYSON BLAIR   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine that the year is 2005 and that Oliver North, the retired
Marine lieutenant colonel and former National Security Council
staff member in the Reagan White House, is on trial in Lebanon. He
has been arrested while vacationing in Switzerland on an
international murder warrant issued by Lebanon. The charge is that
he helped direct the 1986 bombings of Libya that killed 31 people.
</P>
<P>
   Libya had long sought his arrest, but in the end it was a
Lebanese judge who obtained it, by joining the case and requesting
that the Swiss authorities detain North and then extradite him to
stand trial in Beirut on charges of crimes against humanity and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine further that North is then convicted and the headline in
one American newspaper roars: ``Military Aide to Reagan Convicted
of Murder for Official Act.''
</P>
<P>
   The events have not happened, of course, but international legal
experts say that in the wake of the near-extradition of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet of Chile to Spain, it is no longer so hard to
imagine a situation in which a former high U.S. official could be
arrested while traveling and then tried in any foreign country, for
crimes alleged to have been committed anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the notion, the likelihood that any nation would
be so brazen is another matter. Issuing an indictment as a
propaganda ploy is one thing; indeed, Libya already has one out on
North. But these days, following through on it could subject the
Libyans to far more than a writ of habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
   That is because a law of force still operates in the world, and
it is not hard to imagine another set of headlines: ``U.S. Demands
Release of North; Economic Sanctions Threatened; Warships
Maneuver.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is worth considering what might happen to someone like
North when thinking about the recent rulings _ and precedents set _
in the Pinochet case by the British House of Lords. In 1998
Pinochet, in London for medical treatment, was arrested after a
judge in Spain issued an international warrant based on charges
related to his actions while he was the leader of Chile. The Lords
ruled that he was not immune from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   If the British home secretary, Jack Straw, had not freed
Pinochet earlier this year because of his deteriorating health, he
would have had to face trial in Spain on charges of torture and
political killings during his 17-year rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Widely praised by human rights organizations, the rulings have
more quietly raised some eyebrows among former U.S. officials who
now wonder whether they too could some day be extradited _ let us
say, if the United States lost its position as the world's sole
superpower _ and tried any time any judge in the world accuses them
of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, North said, ``It limits my travel to certain
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   It has some legal experts asking: Could Henry A. Kissinger be
put on trial overseas as an architect of policy during the Vietnam
War, which included bombings of Cambodian villages and intensive
bombings of Hanoi?
</P>
<P>
   What about President George Bush or his secretary of state,
James A. Baker III? Could they be held responsible for deaths tied
to economic sanctions related to the Persian Gulf war in Iraq? Or
what about President Clinton? After he leaves office, could he face
trial for the bombings of a factory in Sudan that was mistakenly
believed to be a chemical weapons plant?
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional Republicans have argued against the expansion
of international criminal courts, which they say could hamstring
U.S. leaders who fear being prosecuted after they leave office for
official acts they committed. The legal rulings in the Pinochet
case rejected an argument that the general was immune from
prosecution by virtue of his official status, and legal experts say
the case also expands the power to criminally prosecute certain
human rights violations _ that occur anywhere _ to the courts of
every nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done is restricted the travel opportunities for
people like Henry Kissinger, Wesley Clark and Bill Clinton,'' said
Michael Byers, a professor of international law at Duke University.
``We have reduced their options in traveling to rogue states and
their allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Vieteretti, the managing director of Kroll Associates,
the New York-based international security firm that provides
personal protection, said his company is now much more concerned
``with a country's laws, its alliances and anything our clients may
have done to anger those nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some former U.S. officials said the FBI has warned
them not to travel to some countries, including some in Europe,
where there is a risk of extradition to other nations interested in
prosecuting them.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Byers says that former U.S. officials do not need to
worry ``unless they are foolish enough to travel to some place like
Iraq.'' Experts say that the reason is simple. If, as the saying
goes, to the victor go the spoils, so too with history: the
triumphant get to tell the story of what happened and to name the
heroes, the pardonably mistaken and the villains when the conflict
has ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political reality is that it is very remote,'' said
Jonathan Charney, a law professor at Vanderbilt University and the
editor of the American Journal of International Law. ``Why? Because
we are the superpower. It would be dangerous for another country to
do that economically, politically and otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Kissinger said he believed that the
``very complicated'' issues surrounding the Pinochet rulings needed
further study. But he added that he was not concerned. ``I don't
think the well-known people are as much in danger,'' he said. ``I
certainly don't worry.''
</P>
<P>
   But North said that all it would take would be the slightest
change in the political winds.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was supported by the British when he was their ally in
the war against Argentina over the Falkland Islands. ``Here is this
person who aided and abetted their cause, helped bring about
democracy,'' North said. ``And now because of this political sea
change in Great Britain, now the country is going to turn him over
to a third-party country to have him prosecuted. That's
disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Derian, the first assistant secretary of state for
human rights, said she could foresee the day when U.S. officials
would be prosecuted for acts similar to those that might be
attributed to Baker, North or Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a stretch right now with the current rules of war and
diplomacy, but I think it is going to come,'' said Derian. ``It
would be interesting to see what would happen if Kissinger went to
Cambodia, or they just put out an international warrant for his
arrest.''

A WEAPON FOR CONSUMERS: THE BOYCOTT RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since the 1970s, when grape workers and the anti-apartheid
movement were holy causes for millions of Americans, have so many
groups embraced the boycott as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In the most prominent boycott in years, the NAACP has called on
tourists and conventions to shun South Carolina to pressure that
state to remove the Confederate flag atop its Capitol. Also facing
an NAACP boycott, the Adam's Mark luxury hotel chain agreed last
week to pay $8 million, seek minority customers and give its
employees diversity training to get the boycott dropped and to
settle race discrimination lawsuits brought by some offended black
guests and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Gay groups have proposed a boycott of Paramount over a planned
television show starring Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who has called
homosexuals ``biological errors'' and ``sexual deviants.'' Groups
seeking to restore democracy to Burma are sponsoring boycotts
against Best Western, Unocal, Suzuki and other companies that do
business there. Among the companies that labor unions are
boycotting is Kaiser Aluminum, which locked out 2,900 unionized
workers 14 months ago. And the Southern Baptist Convention is
pressing a boycott against Walt Disney Co., charging that it is too
sympathetic to gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times may be ripe for more consumer boycotts,'' said Jeff
Faux, executive director of the Economic Policy Institute, a
research group in Washington. ``We have more of a consumer culture,
and people see themselves more as consumers today. While people are
participating less in the political process, as consumers they see
that one way they can exercise power is by where they spend their
money and where they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The boycott takes its name from an economic war waged by Irish
farmers in the 1880s against an English land agent, Charles
Cunningham Boycott, who refused demands to cut rents during a time
of poor crops. Their subsequent refusal to work his land or sell
him goods forced him to return to England.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1880s American farmers were already shunning
railroads charging exorbitant rates. In 1885 alone, American labor
unions carried out 196 official boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   One boycott that made a profound impression on 20th-century
America was the Montgomery bus boycott, which came after Rosa Parks
famously refused to sit in the back of the bus in 1955 because she
was black. Since then, civil rights activists have repeatedly
embraced boycotts. Two months ago, the television networks agreed
to increase minority hiring after the NAACP threatened a boycott,
charging that few shows featured minority actors.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes boycotts, which require organization and consumer
awareness, fail. Most Americans do not realize that the United Farm
Workers' 1984 grape boycott remains in force. Begun when growers
refused to sign new union contracts, it has largely failed because
the union stopped promoting it when it failed to catch on. Union
officials say it remains in effect because lifting the boycott
would give a victory to the grape growers. In sharp contrast, the
original boycott called by Cesar Chavez in 1967 persuaded millions
of Americans to give up grapes and pressured California growers to
recognize unionized workers and raise wages.
</P>
<P>
   Boycotts can hurt the very people they intend to help. When
anti-sweatshop groups threatened a boycott against apparel from
Bangladesh in the mid-1990s because many factories employed child
labor, the factories simply fired the children, pushing some into
begging and prostitution. Anti-sweatshop groups now generally
oppose boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP's president, Kweisi Mfume, said his group never rushes
into boycotts. ``This is a trigger you don't want to pull until all
else has failed,'' he said. ``In the case of South Carolina, after
38 years of negotiating even the NAACP has a limit to its
patience.'' As a result, the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce
says, more than 100 conventions and other events have been canceled
in the state, which has lost at least $18 million in tourist
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard Hunter Jr., the chamber's president, said, the
boycott might backfire because it has caused some lawmakers to dig
in. ``One group of legislators,'' he said, ``has used the boycott
very effectively for not taking action, saying, `We're being
blackmailed. If we succumb this time, what are they going to ask
for next?''' The business community, Hunter said, has been working
to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for less controversial tools than a boycott to pressure
Paramount to drop its ``Dr. Laura'' plans, gay groups have deluged
the corporation with calls and e-mail. ``Paramount would never host
a talk show where someone said such nasty things about blacks or
Jews,'' said John Aravosis, who has organized the stopdrlaura.com
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Companies react to boycotts with either compliance or defiance.
After several groups boycotted Pepsi over its Burma ties, the
company stopped doing business there. ``When customers and
consumers contact us, we definitely listen,'' said David De Cecco,
a Pepsi spokesman, who added that the company's action was
consistent with American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Unocal has reacted differently to a boycott over its
investment in a natural gas consortium in Burma. ``We sympathize
with the boycott's goals,'' said Michael Thatcher, a Unocal
spokesman. ``We want to see democracy and economic improvement in
Myanmar. We feel that the way we're doing it is much more likely to
bear positive results than their way, which is to pull out and
isolate the country.''
</P>
<P>
   During the South Africa boycott, the apartheid regime made
similar arguments, saying sanctions were hurting the nation's
blacks in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Desmond Tutu rejected those arguments, saying,
``You get all sorts of people saying all sorts of things about
sanctions: That they will hurt the people you are trying to help.
Twiddle! It's baloney of the first order! Because you are speaking
about people already suffering, and you are saying you are trying
to find some way that is a nonviolent strategy for bringing about
the change that everybody says they want.''

BRINGING LAWSUITS TO DO WHAT CONGRESS WON'T 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than three decades, gun-control advocates have pressed
lawmakers for stiffer measures, but the gun lobby ensured that they
got nowhere in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Then about two years ago, two dozen cities and counties
nationwide began suing gun producers to recover the costs of
treating gun shot victims.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Faced with the lawsuits and the costs of litigating
them, Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest firearms maker, recently
agreed to make changes in the way it makes and markets handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, cigarette makers had long frustrated public health
activists who sought national legislation aimed at restricting how
tobacco is sold, especially to children. Congress proved unwilling
to buck the tremendous lobbying power of the industry, and nothing
happened. But four years after state attorneys general nationwide
and wealthy plaintiffs' lawyers joined forces to sue the tobacco
companies, the companies reversed field and sued for peace.
</P>
<P>
   These two cases are emblematic of a shift taking place in how
Americans attempt to govern their own society. Over the last few
years, the legal system has begun to overtake the legislative
process as the vehicle to resolve contentious debates, particularly
over unpopular products, when Congress is unwilling to act. Both
the tobacco and firearms litigation, for example, were highly
organized assaults on specific industries.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, lawsuits had been brought by individuals against
both industries with little financial success or effect on company
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always cases out there, and they were going
nowhere,'' said Susan Koniak, a law professor at Boston University.
``But the law is moving the way it is because of the huge
consolidation of cases that are taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of concentrated legal firepower to set social policy has
stirred sharp debate. Some legal experts have decried such lawsuits
as abusive. Others view them as a problematic but necessary
counterbalance to the powerful control that companies and interest
groups can exert over Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schuck, a law professor at Yale University, said that in
assessing whether to go to court or settle, ``a lot of time a
company has to make a judgment regardless of whether it thinks it
is right on the law.'' But in the case of Smith &AMP; Wesson, which
Schuck doubts would have lost a court case, legal right or wrong
was not the relevant calculation. The problem for the company was
simply that it didn't have the money to roll the dice. And that was
a reality its lobbyists were powerless to change.
</P>
<P>
   Some see this as fundamentally unfair. Walter Olson, a senior
fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group,
described the type of lawsuits brought against cigarette companies
and gun makers as ``end runs'' around the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not what litigation is supposed to be,'' said Olson.
``It gathers too much power in the legal system to litigate
everything we used to vote over.''
</P>
<P>
   But others disagree, calling the new legal activism an important
counterweight to the power and resources of corporations. ``We have
a political system that is shaped in a significant fashion by
powerful interest groups that spend their resources,'' said Deborah
Hensler, a law professor at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   She added that private litigation, because of the resources
wielded by wealthy plaintiffs' lawyers, now represents another
arena where political power resides.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the courts have long been used to shape social
policy. In the 1960s and 1970s, so-called impact litigation was
brought by civil rights groups and other activists to bring about
changes in public policies that legislatures were unwilling to
effect, like reforms in prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   And major litigation against products like asbestos, breast
implants and defective birth-control devices like the Dalkon Shield
also traces back decades. In many of those cases, too,
manufacturers withdrew products from the marketplace even though
regulators had not ordered such actions.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest wave of litigation is fundamentally different,
legal experts said. First, its purpose was to change how cigarettes
and guns are sold, and thus consumed, rather than to eliminate
their use. Legal action, initiated largely by private individuals,
was being used as a tool of social engineering. But these suits
also mark a growing alliance between state and city officials on
one hand and private plaintiffs on the other.
</P>
<P>
   That merger confers on the lawyers political credibility and
quasi-public authority, while endowing the states and cities
frustrated by logjams at the federal level with the entrepreneurial
energies of the legal marketplace. The result is a two-track system
where issues stuck in Congress can now jump off that track into the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Hensler, the Stanford University professor, said she believed
that the development was a mixed blessing. While it does provide
for an increased form of legal activism, the private lawyers who
may end up steering such actions are not answerable to the public
they supposedly represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to ask the question, `Are these the right people to be
leading the charge on the private side,''' she said. ``In the end,
I do get to vote on my congressman, but I don't have any direct
power on the deals.''
</P>

   Few expect the recent wave of large-scale litigation to end.
Recently, for instance, some of the lawyers involved in state cases
against the tobacco industry filed lawsuits against health
maintenance organizations for failing to disclose that they gave
financial incentives to doctors who restricted medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jack Weinstein of the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn has
overseen much of the recent wave of product litigation, including
major cases involving firearms and tobacco. Known as a judicial
activist, Weinstein said that he believed the courts would always
probably play a pivotal role in resolving social problems. ``We are
going to have government that takes responsibility or have the
private bar back them up where they are not doing a good job,''
Weinstein said.

   A New Culture War on Campus
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times at Eastern Connecticut State University.
One misstep, one infraction, one drunken dorm party, and a student
can find himself on a bus to Hartford for an evening of Aida or
Carmen or who-knows-what kind of caterwauling.
</P>
<P>
   Opera as punishment was the idea of Kirk Peters, the associate
dean of student affairs, who, himself an opera fan, tried to give
away 15 opera tickets last fall. He plastered posters all over the
campus in Willamantic, but got no takers. ``I couldn't get people
to go, and it was a freebie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during a disciplinary session with 10 freshmen men, he
came up with his diabolically brilliant plan. The 10 had hopped a
fence around a football field during a rainstorm and tore up the
field playing baseball. The standard punishment would have been 10
hours of community service, but he offered to cut off five hours if
they would go to the opera with him.
</P>
<P>
   Eight agreed, and off they went, not only to the opera but to
the pre-opera workshop. The reviews, predictably, were mixed. ``Two
of them absolutely loved it,'' Peters said. ``Four thought it was
just OK, and two said they'd rather pick up trash. They fell asleep
and said it was really tough to sit through it.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 60 students have taken the opera option, Peters
said. About 30 have turned it down. Most of the offenders are men
charged with alcohol-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not apologizing at all,'' Peters said. ``I feel a college
has a responsibility for raising standards.''

   Pope Speaks of Holocaust During Visit to Israel
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish to remember,'' Pope John Paul II said at Jerusalem's
Holocaust memorial, ``to ensure that never again will evil
prevail'' as it did for the Nazis' victims.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is on his first visit to Israel, which the Vatican did
not even officially recognize until 1994, and his plea of ``never
again'' _ coming on top of his recent broad apology for past church
sins _ struck a distinct chord.
</P>
<P>
   While some Holocaust survivors faulted the pope for not going
even further in condemning the church's wartime silence, his visit,
one survivor said, ``marks a turning point for Jews and
Christians.''

   Ruling on Cuban Boy
</P>
<P>
   The international custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
seems to be nearing a conclusion. After a federal judge in Miami
concluded that only Attorney General Janet Reno can grant the boy
asylum, Reno said Elian should be reunited with his father in Cuba
in a prompt, orderly fashion. Lawyers for both sides wrangled over
just how, and if, that would be accomplished. The government wants
lawyers for Elian's relatives in Miami to agree to a speedy
timetable for any appeal of the ruling, but the lawyers have
balked.

   '60s Militant Arrested
</P>
<P>
   H. Rap Brown spent the last 25 years effacing his reputation as
one of the most militant black radicals of the 1960s. He changed
his name to Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, became the imam of his mosque
in Atlanta and helped clean up his impoverished neighborhood. But
his peaceful obscurity was shattered when he was accused of the
shooting of two Atlanta sheriff's deputies, one of whom died.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was captured after a shootout in Lowndes County, Ala.,
and he claimed to be the victim of a ``governmental conspiracy.''
His trial is likely to be a death penalty case.

   Decoding the Fruit Fly
</P>
<P>
   At their annual meeting, biologists who study the Drosophila
fruit fly got a gift: a CD-ROM, courtesy of Celera Corp.,
containing the DNA code for the fly's 13,601 genes. The decoding of
the fly's genome validates a bold strategy that Celera is confident
will work on the human genome. The understanding of the fly's
genome will be of major help in interpreting the human genome.
Wings aside, the organisms have a surprising amount of genetic
equipment in common.

   Court Rules on Student Fees
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment protects the right to speak _ and sometimes
the right not to speak. No one can be forced to salute the flag,
for example. Conservative college students have argued that they
should not have to support causes they disagree with through
mandatory student activity fees.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting that argument, the Supreme Court said the overall
quantity of speech at universities mattered more. Unbounded debate
is central to a university's mission, the court said, and mandatory
fees are constitutional as long as the money collected is
distributed without regard to viewpoint.

   Record Sex-Bias Award
</P>
<P>
   The Voice of America, the government-run radio service that
broadcasts news about the United States abroad, and its parent
agency agreed to pay a record $508 million to 1,100 women to settle
a sex discrimination case. If the settlement is approved by the
judge overseeing the case, each woman will get at least $450,000.
The suit, which was filed 23 years ago, charges that the women were
denied jobs and promotions with the service.

   Grisly Discoveries in Uganda
</P>
<P>
   The corpses of more than 150 people were found by the Ugandan
police buried under a building used by a doomsday cult involved in
a fire on March 17 in which 500 of its members died.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found about 40 miles from the church at Kanungu
where the 500 members of the cult perished when their church was
set ablaze, the police said. The police said the discovery shed new
light on the Kanungu blaze, which they said they were treating as a
mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   Conviction in Subway Murder
</P>
<P>
   A New York jury convicted Andrew Goldstein, a schizophrenic man
who threw a woman to her death in front of a subway train last
year, of intentional murder and rejected his insanity defense. The
case has prompted scrutiny of how the mentally ill are cared for in
New York. A law named for the victim, Kendra Webdale, allows courts
to compel the mentally ill to submit to treatment.

   Diabetes Drug Withdrawn
</P>
<P>
   Two widely used drugs, blamed for deaths among patients, are
being taken off the market. The diabetes drug Rezulin, linked to 63
deaths from liver failure since 1997, was withdrawn by Parke-Davis.
The 500,000 Americans taking the drug were urged not to stop until
they get other treatment. Janssen Pharmaceutica, the maker of the
heartburn drug Propulsid, which has caused 80 deaths from heart
problems, said the drug would also be withdrawn.

   Anti-Gay Bias in Military
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon report found that anti-homosexual harassment in the
U.S. military remains widespread, especially in the form of
offensive remarks and gestures. The survey, ordered after a gay
soldier was beaten to death last July at Fort Campbell, Ky., also
found that an overwhelming majority of service members believe
their superiors and colleagues tolerate harassment ``to some
extent.'' The survey suggested that despite repeated efforts to
prohibit such behavior, negative attitudes toward gays remain a
pervasive part of military culture.

   Good News for the Elderly
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted unanimously to repeal a Depression-era
provision that forced Social Security recipients to give up all or
part of their retirement benefit if they earned more than $17,000 a
year. The House passed the same measure this month, and President
Clinton said he would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was intended to discourage older people from
remaining in the work force. But with employers complaining about a
shortage of workers, the political case for abolishing the earnings
limit became overwhelming.

   Move on Internet Drug Sales
</P>
<P>
   In its first action against foreign Internet sites selling
prescription drugs to American consumers, the U.S. Customs Service
joined Thai authorities in raiding online pharmacies in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane E. Henney, the commissioner of food and drugs, has sent
warnings to 13 Web sites in other countries, saying they could be
violating federal law by selling prescription drugs to U.S.
citizens without valid prescriptions. Such drugs may be dangerous,
she said, because there is no assurance they were properly
manufactured or stored.

   YOSEMITE-CROWDS (San Francisco) _ The Clinton administration has
unveiled a radical relief plan for crowded Yosemite National Park,
designed to unpave paradise and wipe out some parking lots. By
VICKI HADDOCK.
</P>
<P>
   CASINO-BRIBE (Baton Rouge, La.) _ After four hours of punishing
cross-examination by the attorney for former Louisiana Gov. Edwin
W. Edwards, Eddie DeBartolo lost his cool. After first denying,
then conceding that his office made 11 phone calls trying to locate
Edwards in Vail, Colo., and Baton Rouge one day before he was to
deliver a $400,000 payoff, DeBartolo said he was only trying to
find out where Edwards was. By ERIC BRAZIL.
</P>
<P>
   COMETS-LIFE (San Francisco) _ Experiments with high-speed guns
show that comets could have delivered the building blocks of life
to Earth billions of years ago, scientists say. Like microscopic
Evel Knievels, an unexpectedly large percentage of organic
molecules survived being shot from a large gun and slammed into a
wall of felt at several miles per second, one researcher reported
to the American Chemical Society. By KEAY DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKING-VERDICT (San Francisco) _ The jury verdict awarding $20
million in punitive damages to an ex-smoker who is now dying of
lung cancer is the latest in a handful of significant courtroom
defeats for the tobacco industry in recent years. By EMILY GURNON.
</P>
<P>
   GENE-DATBASE (Troy, N.Y.) _ This is what Michael Fortun saw on
his recent trip: A country in which nearly every resident's genetic
information is filed with a giant corporation. Residents don't
volunteer to give their genetic data away; it happens
automatically. It may sound like science fiction, but the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute bioethicist was actually in
Iceland, where the future already is happening. By ANDREW
BROWNSTEIN.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE-WATER (San Francisco) _ Decades after they approved the use
of MTBE in gasoline to clean the air, U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency scientists still don't know what it does to people who drink
it or how to effectively remove it from soil and ground water. By
JANE KAY.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   REGIS-PHILBIN (San Francisco) _ The reason for the immense
popularity of Regis Philbin, the host of the game-show hit ``Who
Wants to be a Millionaire,'' are tough to nail down. The appeal
seems to lie purely in his Regisness, if you ask his fans _ his
common touch, sense of humor, graciousness and ability to think on
the fly. But the appeal may also be that he is just a nice guy. By
CRAIG MARINE.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-REVIEW-MYSTERIES (Undated) _ Chris Larsgaard's thriller,
``The Heir Hunter'' (Delacorte Press, $23.95, 356 pages), is a
fast-paced debut that points to a bright future for this local
writer. Like the author, Larsgaard's protagonist specializes in a
very lucrative field of private investigations. Nick Merchant and
his partner, Alex Moreno, hunt for the heirs of people who die
leaving no will and no known relatives. If they find the heirs,
they get a percentage of the estate. By BOBBIE HESS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-PROFILE-SMITS (San Francisco) _ Diners at the other tables
in Le Charm on Fifth Street were trying to be cool, glancing
smoothly from the corner of their eyes, dipping a spoon into the
soup and laughing, ho. But that was, after all, Jimmy Smits sitting
over there. He was in San Francisco to talk about ``Price of
Glory,'' a new film about a Latino father from an Arizona border
town fighting to get his three sons shots at a boxing title. By
EDVINS BEITIKS.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   COLON-CANCER (Undated) _ Studies have shown that fewer than 41
percent of Americans over 50 have ever been tested for colon
cancer. Even more disturbing is a recent government report that
only 9 percent of Medicare beneficiaries get the annual recommended
fecal occult blood test, one of the most basic screening tools.
``Women know about mammography, men know about prostate
screening,'' says Dr. Moshe Shaike of Memorial Sloan-Kettering in
New York. ``People are a little bit squeamish about intestines,
stool and having an examination in this area.'' By SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   FREDERICK'S (Hollwood) _Today's Frederick's of Hollywood is
about flirtation, not sleaze. By CYNTHIA ROBINS.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   EXAMINER-SALE (San Francisco) _ The fight over the future of San
Francisco's daily newspapers intensified as former mayoral
candidate Clint Reilly asked a federal judge to issue an emergency
order barring Hearst Corp.'s imminent purchase of the San Francisco
Chronicle. By SETH ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NINERS-SEASON (Palm Beach, Fla.) _ If only the San Francisco
49ers had had Steve Young and Garrison Hearst healthy for the
entire season, they might have been a playoff team once again.
That's the opinion of the man who lost a bid to become club
president and fled to Cleveland, Dwight Clark, now vice president
and general manager of the Cleveland Browns. By JOHN CRUMPACKER.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ I'm sorry. If the pope can do it,
I can do it. I'm saying I'm sorry. One thing, though. I'm not
making the mistake of saying what I'm sorry for. If I've wronged
you, you know who you are. Yes, I'm sorry for what I wrote about
you, but on the advice of counsel I can't get more specific than
that. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ I celebrated my 30th and 40th
birthdays there, and chose it as the site for a post-Mass reception
when I converted to Catholicism. To us, the women and men for whom
the Washington Square Bar and Grill was more second home than
saloon, it was _ and always will be _ ``the Square.'' After 27
years in business under three separate owners, the Square closed
its doors forever this week. The times and people's eating and
drinking habits have changed, said the final owner, Peter Osborne.
By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   NRA-POLITICS (San Francisco) _ Charlton Heston and his
gunslinging pals in the National Rifle Association have done
something no body else could do, not even pit bull Democratic
strategist James Carville. They've made President Clinton smell
like a rose. By SCOTT WINOKUR.

ISRAELI POLICE PROPOSE CHARGING NETANYAHU WITH CORRUPTION

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After a seven-month investigation, Israeli police on
Tuesday recommended that former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and his wife, Sara, face criminal prosecution on charges of
bribery, fraud and the theft of $100,000 worth of gifts meant for
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, who quit politics when he was defeated by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak in May, said the charges were ``baselesq'' and
tendentiously inspired by political enemies. His lawyer, Yaakov
Weinrnth, said he was ``itching for a trial'' to demonstrate a
police vendetta against the former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   If justice officials decide to put Netanyahu on trial, it could
thwart his ability to make a political comeback. While he has not
publicly expressed interest in doing so, the right-wing opposition
to Barak has been lackluster, and many here assumed that Netanyahu
would eventually be tempted back into politics.
</P>
<P>
   A police recommendation does not always lead to prosecution, as
Netanyahu well knows. In 1997, while he was prime minister, the
police suggested that he stand trial on corruption charges. But the
attorney general declined, saying there was insufficient evidence.
That attorney general, Elyakim Rubenstein, remains in office.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the police said the Netanyahus ``illegally
removed'' 700 gifts to the state of Israel when they left the prime
minister's residence. Netanyahu said last fall, when the police
investigation included well-publicized searches, that he was in the
midst of moving back into private life and had been planning to
``settle up'' with the state after unpacking.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the police said some of the objects, which included
silver candelabras and paintings, had been altered to remove
inscriptions that clearly marked them as gifts to Israel. Some were
found in the Netanyahus' Jerusalem apartment and some in a
warehouse. Other gifts simply disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The police also said that the Netanyahus had accepted some
$50,000 worth of free services from a contractor, Avner Amedi, over
nine years. They described it as an illegal ``give-and-take
relationship'' _ a relationship of bribery. It began when Netanyahu
was a legislator and continued through his three-year tenure as a
charismatic right-wing prime minister who eventually lost the
confidence of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not specify Tuesday what the contractor
received in return. The police discovered ``a number of cases'' in
which, they said, ``Netanyahu did, in fact, act on Amedi's
behalf.'' But the police report indicated that the relationship
broke down when Amedi did not get everything he requested and
submitted a bill to Netanyahu, which went unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   After Netanyahu lost the election, the contractor, with the
knowledge of the Netanyahus, submitted a bill for $110,000 of
moving expenses to the prime minister's office, the police said.
They said that the bill was ``very high,'' and that it ``raised
suspicions about criminal acts,'' prompting government officials to
suspect that the Netanyahus were trying to have the government pay
for their private expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The police investigation began after a newspaper, Yedioth
Ahronoth, reported on the suspicions of government officials.
According to the newspaper, the private work included ``four floor
polishings in a single month,'' a crane used to install bars on the
windows of the Netanyahus' private apartment and the repair of an
exercise machine.
</P>
<P>
   Amedi, the contractor, is the state's chief witness, and most of
the case outlined by the police is believed to be based on
information he provided. But about 100 other people were also
questioned by the police.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Netanyahu's political allies suggested foul play by the police.
``The police have been behaving as if they were on a chase mission
to find Netanyahu guilty of something,'' said Uzi Landau, a
legislator from Netanyahu's Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israeli police have numerous investigations before them,
targeting figures across the political spectrum. President Ezer
Weizman is under investigation for accepting a large cash gift from
a French businessman. The campaign fundraising practices of Barak
are under investigation. And on Monday, the police began an inquiry
into whether a leading rabbi, Ovadia Yosef, should be prosecuted
for incitement after a blistering sermon against the education
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dark day for Israeli politics,'' said Ophir
Pines-Paz, who is the chairman of Barak's governing coalition.
``The whole spate of investigations looks bad and is bad. We all
have to be very careful. We have to understand that we are not
above the law.''

&HT;     DOCTORS, OLDER AMERICANS URGED NOT TO OVERLOOK THE COLON 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Richard Farrell had always been good about going to the doctor
for regular checkups. And four years ago, at the age of 62, he had
no reason to believe anything was wrong, until he started getting
stomach spasms and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   By then, his colon was riddled with cancer and Farrell was
flirting with death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major symptom of colon cancer is no symptom at all,'' said
Farrell, who lives in Amsterdam, N.Y. ``It's one of those diseases
that creep up on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell has since learned, after four major surgeries to remove
tumors and a third of his colon, that he never should have become
so sick.
</P>
<P>
   Simple screening tests could have tipped off doctors to his
condition a lot earlier, when colon cancer is much easier to treat.
The problem was that nobody ever mentioned them during all those
routine checkups.
</P>
<P>
   ``With early screening, you can reduce the death rate by 90
percent,'' Farrell said. ``But the average person doesn't know
about screening. Most primary care physicians don't talk about it.
None of my doctors said anything to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that fewer than 41 percent of Americans over
age 50 have ever been tested for the disease. Even more disturbing
is a recent report from the Department of Health and Human Services
indicating that only 9 percent of Medicare beneficiaries get the
annual recommended fecal occult blood test, one of the most basic
screening tools.
</P>
<P>
   Even fewer, 2 percent, get the flexible sigmoidoscopy, another
screening test recommended every five years. A more thorough
colonoscopy is recommended at least every 10 years, and more
frequently if problems are found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women know about mammography, men know about prostate
screening,'' said Dr. Moshe Shaike, director of the Cancer
Prevention and Wellness Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New
York City. ``People are a little bit squeamish about intestines,
stool and having an examination in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell, now 66, is part of a national campaign to change those
attitudes and a founding member of the Colon Cancer Alliance,
established last year in New York City to offer support services
and educational materials to people touched by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 56,600 people are expected to die in the
United States from colorectal cancer, making it the second leading
cause of cancer death among men and women in North America after
lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really frustrating,'' Dr. Edward Lee, assistant professor
of surgery at the Albany Medical Center in Albany, N.Y., said about
the lack of screening. ``With the 60- to 70-year-old patients I
see, the saddest thing is they've been going to their physician
every six months or year. They feel they've been cheated because
they've been doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past month, a coalition of agencies, including the
Colon Cancer Alliance, has been trying to raise awareness of the
disease and get people talking about it. Katie Couric, the
co-anchor of NBC's ``Today,'' spearheaded a five-part series on the
disease after losing her husband, Jay Monahan, to colon cancer in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The message seems to be getting out, especially to primary care
doctors who are in the best position to recommend screening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say I'm better this month at remembering to ask my
50-year-olds about it,'' said Dr. Laura Pica of Delmar, N.Y. But
like many physicians and colon cancer advocates, Pica believes the
medical community needs to be more aggressive about talking with
patients, despite the time constraints under managed care.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, patients need to be more willing to talk with
their doctors about any problems or symptoms they might be
experiencing with their intestines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've been toilet trained, most people don't like to
talk about their bowel movements,'' Pica said.

</P>
<P>
   Farrell, a father of four, retired in 1996 from his job with the
New York state Division of Food Safety and Inspection. These days,
in between talking to other colon cancer victims and survivors, he
spends his time talking with policy-makers and journalists to
advocate early screening.
</P>
<P>
   His last surgery was in October 1999 and he's optimistic his
cancer has been cured. Yet Farrell's life is far from normal.
Because he lost so much of his colon, he tends to have 10 to 15
bowel movements a day. And he lives with the uncertainty that his
cancer could return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't go through the hell I've been through,'' Farrell said.
``Get yourself screened. It's been a terrible journey.''

   TROY, N.Y. _ This is what Michael Fortun saw on his recent trip:
</P>
<P>
   A country in which nearly every resident's genetic information
is filed with a giant corporation. Residents don't volunteer to
give their genetic data away; it happens automatically, unless
objectors opt out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become a nation of guinea pigs,'' the natives are known

<P>
   It may sound like Fortun stumbled into the nightmarish future of
a science fiction novel, but the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
bioethicist was actually in Iceland, a five-hour plane trip away.
As U.S. and British scientists battle over whether genes can be
patented, the future already is happening at deCode, in its labs at
a restored Kodak plant in the capital city of Reykjavik, lined with
rows of robotic genetic sequencers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can learn a lot by paying attention to Iceland,'' said
Fortun, 41, an assistant professor and historian of science. ``Even
though people's genetic information is being databased now, no one
knows, given the pace of scientific change, what it's going to be
used for 10 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation that was populated by Vikings 1,100 years ago and
which claims to be Europe's oldest democracy also is a treasury of
genetic material. The alleged homogeneity of Iceland's population,
which some researchers dispute, may give scientists a prized
opportunity to study genetic anomalies that lead to disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some families on the island can trace their family trees back a
millennium, and Iceland's state-run health care system has been
keeping detailed patient records since 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the genealogies and medical records the DNA samples of
some 10,000 volunteers, and deCode could have one of the most
valuable, and controversial, genetic databases in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has several U.S. board members and is
incorporated in Delaware, filed for an initial stock offering with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month. In
exchange for $200 million, it won a monopoly on access to the
medical records of almost all of the Iceland's 270,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   But at what cost? In an upcoming book that traces recent
advances in genetics, Fortun argues the company bought politicians
through political contributions, trampled on individual rights and
brazenly stifled dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was presumed to be in the database unless they opted
out,'' said Fortun, whose book is currently titled ``Promising
Genomics.'' ``It's a complete reversal of what's usually considered
to be informed consent.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the book's more disturbing episodes, Iceland's
National Bioethics Committee, which regulates genetic research in
the country, was disbanded after one of its members publicly
criticized deCode.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very clear conflicts of interest,'' he said. ``It's
a very cozy arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Iceland's population supports the project.
After all, the company has brought cutting-edge scientists back to
Iceland and could make the country a leader in fighting genetically
based ailments. The company claims it already has made progress
toward finding the genes associated with multiple sclerosis,
schizophrenia, arthritis and manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is trying to maintain residents' privacy.
DeCode said it will remove people's names from the database and
encrypt the data three times.
</P>
<P>
   But some Icelanders worry what will happen when deCode markets
its results to pharmaceutical and insurance companies around the
world. For example, could a person be rejected for a job or be
forced to pay higher insurance premiums if he was known to have the
gene that causes multiple sclerosis?
</P>
<P>
   Fortun, who was initially hopeful about the Icelandic venture,
insists he is not a critic of genetic testing per se. Rather, he
views it as critical in these early days of genetic experimentation
that ethics not be lost in the euphoria of science and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think DNA is the secret of life, you should treat it
pretty damn seriously,'' he said. ``Everyone should be in on that
secret.''

&HT;     GOVERNMENT OFFERS PLAN TO LIMIT YOSEMITE TRAFFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VICKI HADDOCK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Clinton administration has unveiled a
radical relief plan for crowded Yosemite National Park, designed to
unpave paradise and wipe out some parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   The long-anticipated Yosemite Valley Plan presented Monday calls
for letting nature reclaim some 180 acres of the Yosemite Valley,
eliminating two-thirds of the valley's 1,600 day-use parking spaces
and funneling visitors in on shuttle buses during the high season.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt touted the plan as a way to cut
traffic by up to 60 percent on peak days, when about 7,000 cars
clog the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you can argue about is that we ought to be
going further,'' Babbitt said, an oblique reference to some
environmentalists who want to limit the number of people admitted
to Yosemite and ban cars altogether. ``You don't manage the
national parks by taking the easy step of saying, `Stay home.'''
</P>
<P>
   The public will have 90 days to comment on Babbitt's preferred
proposal and four alternatives before the National Park Service
makes its decision. Federal officials hope to adopt a proposal
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the San Francisco Commonwealth Club on Monday,
Babbitt admitted suffering vexation during seven years of trying to
forge an agreement from competing interests with different visions
of what Yosemite should be.
</P>
<P>
   He noted the dueling passions of Californians: An infatuation
with both Yosemite and the automobile. But he predicted the latest
proposal would flourish, because ``everyone's exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Many prominent environmental groups flanked Babbitt to
enthusiastically endorse his proposal. Jay Watson, California
regional director of the Wilderness Society, hailed it as historic,
``an elegant balance between park protection and visitor use and
enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   A few, notably the Sierra Club, withheld their support and vowed
to fight for still more stringent environmental protection in what
they consider the crown jewel of the national parks.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also faces opposition from some vacationers who
would resent the restrictions using a shuttle bus would impose on
their ability to freely wander the Yosemite Valley from the privacy
of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of unrestricted Yosemite access contend
environmentalists overstate the dangers to the valley's ecosystem,
and that there are other methods of accommodating more park
visitors _ an underground garage, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Park attendance has dropped a bit in recent years, following a
quadrupling of the entrance fee to $20.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Babbitt maintained that with 3.8 million people
visiting Yosemite last year, overcrowding still was so bad that
something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't go so far as to compare it with Coney Island, but
yeah, why not?'' Babbitt said. ``You're not going to see majestic
Yosemite through a cloud of diesel fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Babbitt proposal would cost an estimated $343 million over
10 years.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposal includes the following elements:
</P>
<P>
   _ Constructing parking lots near park entrances at El Portal on
Highway 140, Badger Pass on Highway 41 and Crane Flat on Highway
120 as feeder lots for shuttle buses into top valley attractions.
The shuttles would not run on slow winter days, when visitors could
find space among the 550 valley parking slots.
</P>
<P>
   _ Removing three bridges and the Cascades Dam on the Merced
River, requiring development be set back 150 feet from the
riverbank upstream and 100 feet downstream, and restoring riparian,
meadow and black oak landscape along the banks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Restoring about 180 acres, including the Ahwahnee and Stoneman
meadows to their natural, development-free state by removing roads
and parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   _ Abolishing a 3.2-mile section of Northside Drive so that the
river no longer would be bracketed by asphalt along Yosemite
Valley. Instead, it would become a bike and foot path.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reducing the number of valley rooms from 1,260 to 981 by
removing cabins at Curry Village and Housekeeping Camp, but
allowing Yosemite Lodge to replace more than 100 units destroyed in
the floods of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving the park superintendent's home, concessionaires,
stables and staff headquarters out of Yosemite Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been loving Yosemite to death; from my perspective
we've been disrespecting our national parks . . . paving over them
and polluting them,'' said Tom Kiernan, president of the National
Park and Conservation Association, an organization that supports
the national parks. ``This plan is our best hope for turning things
around.''

&HT;     REGIS PHILBIN, THE MAN WITH A MIDAS TOUCH, IS JUST A `REGULAR
GUY' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CRAIG MARINE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALY CITY, Calif. _ For Regis Philbin, one good thing about his
``overnight success'' after more than three decades in show
business is that he's not about to lose his grip on reality.
</P>
<P>
   With his ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' soaring as the most
popular television show perhaps of all time, considering how
frequently ABC airs it, Philbin, while enjoying the ride, can also
take a step back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep it in perspective,'' said the dapper and
meticulously dressed game show host, who also has a rabid following
from his morning show with the soon-to-be-departing Kathie Lee
Gifford. ``This is all transitory, I know that. For now, we're
riding high. In time, people will get tired of the show, or I'll
get tired of the show, or something else will come along. I'll
still be the same person. That much I know.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for Philbin's immense popularity are tough to nail
down. The appeal seems to lie purely in his Regisness, if you ask
his fans _ his common touch, sense of humor, graciousness and
ability to think on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin recently was in Northern California handing out a $1
million check at the Wards store in Daly City to a contest winner.
Deanne Miletich, a 30-year-old farm land appraiser from Salinas,
snagged the check after buying some curtains. As strait-laced as
they come, the thrilled Miletich was the perfect winner for the
department store, which will give out four more million-dollars
checks around the country. With her fresh face and ``aw-shucks''
manner, the Wards honchos were no doubt grateful that Miletich
seemed far from the type of person who might spend her winnings on
a Vegas vacation package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take my family on a cruise,'' she said. ``Maybe take
my mom shopping in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's why Philbin is the man: His contract with Wards (they
lost the ``Montgomery'' after restructuring) says that he shows up,
hands out the big check, waves to the great unwashed and hits the
road. Instead, Philbin personally requested that he be allowed to
spend almost two hours sitting at a table signing autographs for
anyone who cared to wait in line. Nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big deal,'' he shrugged when it was brought up. ``I just said
I'd love to sign some things for awhile. These are the people who
have put food on my family's table for all this time. I'm not doing
them a favor, they're doing me a favor.''
</P>
<P>
   And he means it. He's really like that. A kind word here, a joke
there, a snapshot, a joke _ lots of show biz types can pull this
off in public and reveal a darker side when the lights are off, but
everyone _ the publicity people, the security guards, his driver,
everybody _ says that he is like this all the time. It's enough for
hundreds of fans to line up to meet the man they all call by his
first name, as though he's a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   The Reinosos _ 24-year-old Marvin, his 23-year-old wife Janet
and their 10-month old son Anthony _ waited and explained why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regis crosses generations,'' said Janet. ``It's not just old
ladies who watch him. We love him, he's real, he can relate and
he's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a regular guy,'' her husband agreed. ``And Anthony just
loves him. He'll sit there and stare when Regis is on, whether it's
the morning or at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Regis signed until he realized time wouldn't allow him to
accommodate everyone in line. Instead of hitting the back door,
Philbin signed a bunch of photographs that he had brought and spent
his remaining time walking the line of fans. He shook hands and
distributed pictures, making sure he didn't miss anyone, seeming
too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thinks about now that he's on top, Philbin
replied, ``I think about how lucky I am. I'm always aware of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And that would have been his final answer, except someone asked
him whether the morning show would go on post-Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''

&HT;     SMITS TAKES ON A FATHERLY ROLE IN `PRICE OF GLORY' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Diners at the other tables in Le Charm on Fifth
Street were trying to be cool, glancing smoothly from the corner of
their eyes, dipping a spoon into the soup and laughing, ho. But
that was, after all, Jimmy Smits sitting over there.
</P>
<P>
   Smits, tree-top tall and gaspingly handsome, made a name for
himself with a supporting-actor Emmy on ``L.A. Law,'' added a
best-actor Emmy and Golden Globe in ``NYPD Blue,'' and has never
looked back. He was in San Francisco to talk about ``Price of
Glory,'' a new film about an Hispanic father from an Arizona border
town fighting to get his three sons shots at a boxing title.
</P>
<P>
   Smits was unfailingly gracious to the waitress and busboy (``I
appreciate it. Thank you so much.'') and nodded once or twice in
the direction of the other tables. By now Smits, 44, is used to
having people snatch glances at him in cafes, but there was a time
when the look on peoples' faces was altogether different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in New York, wearing a fatigue jacket, with this same
goatee, and they'd cross the street if they saw me,'' said Smits,
who grew up in Brooklyn and now lives in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Smits remembered the hardscrabble days of trying to find acting
jobs in the early 1980s, ``especially one day when my daughter was
little and I was going out for a big audition, and I didn't have
any money. We kept a big change jar just for her, and I had to
break into her piggy bank. A guilt-laden day, I'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Smits' daughter, Taina, is a teacher in Virginia, and his
17-year-old son, Joauquin, is getting a taste for the silver
screen. ``We were at a movie not long ago, and he puts his hands
up, frames the screen, and says, `Cool shot, Dad.' I thought, `Oh,
man, I'm in trouble now.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's the way his father and mother must have felt, said Smits,
when their son opted to major in theater at Brooklyn College and
went on to get a master's degree in fine arts at Cornell University
in 1982. Smits says his father, Cornelis, a former merchant seaman
from the South American nation of Suriname, ``used to tell me, `If
this acting doesn't work, you can teach, right? You can make a
living if acting doesn't work out for you?' Now, both my mom and
dad have these big Kool-Aid smiles about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Smits' acting class routinely would go to
Broadway performances by Raul Julia, a Puerto Rican actor who took
on dozens of roles.
</P>
<P>
   ```Mac the Knife,' Shakespeare, Pinter, Brecht, Shaw _ he did
them all,'' Smits said. ``He was not going to be defined by his
outward looks, by doing only Latino roles. Looking at it, watching
him work, it was like he gave me . . . permission, you know, like
he was saying to me, `You go ahead and dream your dreams.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smits hopes he's giving Hispanics the same sense of ``dreaming
your dreams.'' In between ``L.A. Law'' and ``NYPD Blue,'' he has
kept close to his roots, narrating a PBS documentary on illegal
immigration, hosting a television show on Hispanics in the United
States with Ricardo Montalban, starring with Edward James Olmos and
Esai Morales in Gregory Nava's ``My Family, Mi Familia.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimating that half his fan mail comes from Hispanics, Smits
said, ``I got one letter from a Latino kid who wrote to say he'd
seen me on `L.A. Law' and it boosted him a little, made him think
he could be a lawyer, too, and he got his degree. I'm not saying it
always happens that way, but it's nice to know it happens
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell the kids in acting classes, `If you stay with
it you're going to wind up being Tom Cruise.' But you can point to
your own experience and say, `It can be done.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smits would like to see Hispanics take heart from ``Price of
Glory,'' in which he plays a father reliving his boxing life
through his sons. The movie has largely an Hispanic cast, with Jon
Seda of ``Homicide,'' Maria Del Mar, former fighter Carlos
Palomino, and newcomers Clifton Collins Jr. and Ernesto Hernandez.
Shooting was done in Nogales, Ariz., and Huntington Park in
southeast Los Angeles, with Hispanics coming to the set on a daily
basis to see Smits and the others at work.
</P>
<P>
   It felt odd to star as the father of three grown sons, said
Smits. ``I have a beautiful wife in the movie, but I told my
agents, `Huh-uh. No more daddy roles for now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a definite break from what he's been doing, said Smits _
``the idealistic lawyer and sensitive-cop kind of roles. This was
such a juicy part, a father who is American in so many ways,
aspiring to have his kids be better than he was.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Carlos Avila, is essentially an American
saga, said Smits, the kind of boxing movie American audiences have
turned out for, time and again. ``We don't want a family that
resides in Iowa saying, `We're going to see a Latino movie. Are we
going to need subtitles?' I like to think of this as an American
movie that has a Latino heart to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smits, whose mother, Emelina, is from Puerto Rico, has stayed
close to his roots since he started in 1982-83 with Off-Broadway
roles in ``Hamlet'' and ``Little Victories.'' He moved to TV with
his debut on ``Miami Vice'' in 1984, and then found the spotlight
with ``L.A. Law.'' The family in ``Price of Glory'' reminds Smits
of his growing-up years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ortega family has higher ideals, it wants the kids to be
better, to do only what is best for them,'' he explained. ``My
father was a major disciplinarian. `You will go to school. You will
stay in your room three hours to do your homework. You will make
yourself better.' Hey, that's as American as apple pie.''

&HT;     LIVING BY THE POPE'S EXAMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I'm sorry. If the pope can do it, I can do it.
I'm saying I'm sorry.
</P>
<P>
   One thing, though. I'm not making the mistake of saying what I'm
sorry for. If I've wronged you, you know who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I'm sorry for what I wrote about you, but on the advice of
counsel I can't get more specific than that.
</P>
<P>
   I'm even sorry about some of the things I haven't written
recently. But I'm sorry, some things are just too close to the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Getting specific about your apologies can get you in trouble, as
the pope has learned. It can even get columnists in trouble, and
we're draped in the mantle of pundit infallibility.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at what the remarkable John Paul II has been doing.
First he apologized for past actions of the Catholic Church, but
that wasn't enough. Sure, he's sorry about the Inquisition, said
some people, but what about Pope Pius XII's unwillingness to
intervene in the Holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   Then John Paul went to the Western Wall and left a note to God
expressing sadness about the oppression of Jews through the ages,
with a commitment to genuine brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   His powerful gesture was appreciated by many, but there were
Orthodox Jews who objected to his presence at the wall and Muslims
who objected to his presence in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   And orthodox American liberals objected to the Church's attitude
toward women, abortion and gays. Being pope means having to say
you're sorry about everything.
</P>
<P>
   I say look at the example the pope has set. It took physical and
intellectual courage for this infirm man to go to the Middle East
and ask forgiveness for sins committed by other Christians on other
popes' watches.
</P>
<P>
   God can grant forgiveness. People tend not to.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that people don't know how to apologize
anymore. Or their lawyers advise them to hedge their words.
</P>
<P>
   You hear a lot of passive sentences like ``I regret if anyone
was offended.'' You read sentences like ``Due to a production
error, the word `idiot' was inserted before Congressman Zeppelin's
name. The Daily Afterblat regrets the error.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine once asked a boyfriend if he was having sex
with another woman. He told her, ``It occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   That's almost as ripe as President Clinton's redefinition of
``is.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Clinton months to get around to a full-fledged apology
for messing around with a young intern in the Oval Office. Before
that we heard Clinton saying he did not have ``inappropriate
relations'' with the young woman.
</P>
<P>
   We live in the age of lies and lawyers, and no wonder people are
cynical about apologies. And no wonder Clinton was much more
interested in apologizing for slavery than the sins he committed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he got a lot of guff for that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Apologies, even genuine ones, are taken as signs of weakness.
When you do something regrettable, you should express some regret.
It makes you stronger.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be too specific, and don't apologize too much or
you'll never stop.
</P>
<P>
   Even the pope can't apologize without someone carping about it.
But we have to thank him for setting an example.
</P>

   A SEASON ON THE LAND: More flue-cured tobacco is grown in Pitt
County, N.C., than anywhere else in the nation. The culture and the
economy are rooted in tending the leaf, and in the self-reliant way
of life such labor demands. Yet as court rulings, public opinion
and pressure from Washington alter the fortunes of tobacco, change
has made its way into the fields.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TOBACCO PRIMER: In their infancy, tobacco plants look like
tiny shamrocks. As many as a million plants have taken root in the
warmth of W.C. Moore's greenhouse. The green fuzz sprouting in the
seed crates doesn't look like much, but with an average price, the
half-million pounds of leaf it will grow into could net $850,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Charlton Heston and his gunslinging pals in the
National Rifle Association have done something nobody else could
do, not even pit bull Democratic strategist James Carville. They've
made President Clinton smell like a rose.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, the NRA president remembered for his movie role as
Moses, called Clinton a liar; his partner in vilification, NRA
Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, all but accused Clinton of
rejoicing in the deaths of children in schools and on playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   I felt sorry for Bubba. No more White House sexual
misadventures. Soon, no more White House power. Now Moishe the
Magnificent and his sidekick are calling the prez names with more
than the usual venom.
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures rising in the never-ending firearms debate, I
find myself wanting to cut out all the baloney and get back to the
question of law.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many Americans believe it's not an open question.
In fact, among the biggest things the NRA has going for it is the
public's assumption that the Second Amendment is gospel, for good
or ill.
</P>
<P>
   These same people want gun control, polls show. They want
licensing, registration, child safety devices and bans on automatic
firearms that amount to weapons of mass destruction in the hands of
a lone gunman.
</P>
<P>
   They want it so badly, the mothers of America are planning a
march in Washington on May 14, Mother's Day, to tell the NRA where
to get off and Congress that now's the time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   But many Americans, moms and dads alike, don't think the nation
can make much progress in holstering its weapons as long as the
Second Amendment stands as written _ and they don't want to rewrite
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA has created a sense of futility, or inertia, among
people who support gun laws but also love the Constitution,'' said
Barrie Becker, executive director of San Francisco's Legal
Community Against Violence.
</P>
<P>
   According to advocates of gun control, strict regulation of
firearms _ like the regulation of automobiles, drugs and other
consumer products _ is not barred by the Constitution, and no
reasonable court has ever disagreed with that proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Becker added: ``What we want to say to the NRA is, `Stop hiding
your extremist rhetoric behind the Constitution. Everything on the
table today is completely consistent with the Constitution.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA knows their policy agenda is unpopular, so they cloak
it in a very popular document. When people feel that what they want
is not constitutional, they throw their hands up. The average
person bows out of the debate. That's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   To address it, the advocates of gun control held a
teleconference Monday, inviting reporters to pepper them with
questions about the Second Amendment's actual reach. Becker
participated, as did Harvard's Laurence Tribe, Yale's Akhil Amar
and other legal luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   The teleconference coincided with the delivery of an open letter
signed by 45 scholars and historians to Heston.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, complemented by an advertisement in the New York
Times, called the organization's stand on the Second Amendment ``a
distortion of legal precedent and a disservice to all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over the discussion, and any discussion about gun
control, is a federal case that arose in Texas, Emerson vs. the
United States, that could go to the Supreme Court. In the case, a
trial court dismissed a criminal indictment on Second Amendment
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The first ruling of its kind in 60 years, the Emerson decision
disregarded more than 100 other related decisions. If it stands,
look out: Even the government's currently limited ability to
regulate firearms will be subject to challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever else it does,'' said Tribe, who has acknowledged a
limited right to bear arms under the 14th Amendment that would
still be subject to strict regulation, ``the Second Amendment does
not guarantee a supply of cheap handguns available to all . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing about the language of the Second Amendment remotely
suggests the licentious, absolutist interpretation that everybody
is entitled to have guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The teleconference over, I had an insight: Moishe is confusing
the Second Amendment with the Second Commandment. There's a big
difference. The first was written on parchment, the second in
stone. And the authorial provenance of each is somewhat different.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with Moishe is the fact that he thinks he's
still up on the mountain. He needs to come off it. The nation is
desperate for disarmament.

 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I celebrated my 30th and 40th birthdays there,
and chose it as the site for a post-Mass reception when I converted
to Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Over long lunches, I fell in love there with baseball legend
Hank Greenberg, discussed the timeless appeal of big band swing
with Woody Herman and learned how baritone Sherrill Milnes went
from singing radio jingles in Chicago to starring on the stage of
the Metropolitan Opera in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Over a dinner there, a Dutch television journalist and I once
took turns picking the fertile, facile, funny brain of Studs
Terkel, who _ then in his mid-70s _ drank us both under the table.
</P>
<P>
   And on one perfect, sunny Sunday afternoon, I levitated along
with about 150 other jazz lovers as Stan Getz filled the air with
the most beautiful and sensuous tenor sax music I have ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called it ``the Washbag, but they were not among us
regulars. To us, the women and men for whom the Washington Square
Bar and Grill was more second home than saloon, it was _ and always
will be _ ``the Square.''
</P>
<P>
   After 27 years in business under three separate owners, the
Square closed its doors forever this week. The times and people's
eating and drinking habits have changed, said the final owner,
Peter Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nobody (including me) takes long, cocktail-laden lunches
anymore. And the folks who have the energy and livers to drink late
into the night belong to a younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is hard on a lot of people and some of them see me
as `the villain,''' Osborne said during an all-day wake that marked
the Square's last day.
</P>
<P>
   I don't see Osborne, who also owns the wildly successful MoMo,
as a villain. Although I spent hundreds _ no, thousands _ of hours
in the Square during the 1970s, '80s and early '90s, my visits had
dwindled to a few a year.
</P>
<P>
   Meals out these days tend to be someplace near my office or home
where it's easy to find parking. A night of ``drinking'' is a
couple of glasses of wine at a bar near my newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Washington Square Bar and Grill managed to serve
very good food for nearly three decades, alcohol was unmistakably
at the core of the Square experience.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially a public club for journalists, novelists, movie
moguls, lawyers, real estate agents, investment types, visiting
celebrities and jocks and their fans, the joint attracted and
catered to people who tended to check ``three or more drinks per
day'' on those medical profile sheets you fill out at the doctor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying it was an admirable (let alone healthy)
lifestyle; I'm just saying it was what it was. And part of what it
was was the sort of booze-fueled fun and camaraderie that made the
Roaring '20s a decade that still fascinates as much as it appalls.
</P>
<P>
   Once, for example, in the mid-1980s, my friend Sally Jenkins and
I sat eating, drinking and entertaining visitors at the same table
in the Square for 11 1/2 straight hours.
</P>
<P>
   We'd just planned to have lunch but somehow never left. Over
cognacs (or maybe stingers), I calculated our time spent in the
same chairs and announced, ``We could have flown to Greece by
now.''
</P>
<P>
   That memory and scores of others wafted into my consciousness
when I read that the Square was closing and knew I wanted to pay my
last respects. Foremost in the nostalgia bin are the nascent days
of the globe-trotting softball team, Les Lapins Sauvages.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of Sports Illustrated writer Ron Fimrite and the
Square's original co-owner, Ed Moose, the team played games in
Paris, London, Ireland, New York and L.A., before I gave up the
mantle of official scorekeeper. Later squads traveled to Hawaii and
Moscow and finagled permission to play in such hallowed baseball
shrines as Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was Fimrite, the Square's official biographer, who literally
opened the doors of the place for me. On the night I arrived in San
Francisco to begin life as a Californian _ Sept. 23, 1975 _ he had
made dinner reservations for us at ``this terrific bar.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next 15 or 16 years, the dual-room restaurant at 1707
Powell St. was my venue of choice for lunch, dinner, brunch,
birthdays, New Year's Eve, out-of-town guests, St. Anthony's
penny-pitching contests, celebrations of good fortune and escapes
from the pain of a broken heart.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an always high-quality, protective staff of
bartenders, servers and hosts, a woman could walk into the Square
solo and enjoy the same freedom that men traditionally took for
granted: to be left alone in peace if she wanted, even while
sitting at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheers'' turned the concept into a TV cliche, but, if you were
a Square regular, everybody really did know your name and much of
what was going on in your life. For decades, we were all part of a
wacky, sometimes dysfunctional, but affectionate extended family.
</P>
<P>
   And now the family home has been sold.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's to the Washington Square Bar and Grill. I consider
myself fabulously fortunate to have known the best times there _
and to have survived to tell the story.

<P>
   TENN-EXECUTE (Nashville) _ Philip Workman, who was convicted of
killing a police officer during a fast-food restaurant robbery in
1981 in Memphis, could become the first person executed in
Tennessee in 40 years. Lawyers for Workman, whose execution is
scheduled for April 6, have made a fairly compelling case about the
fairness of his trial, including some ballistics evidence that
suggests the officer may have been killed by friendly fire from
other cops. The only eyewitness at the trial has recanted, saying
he fabricated his story after being coached and threatened by
police. And just a few weeks ago, the medical examiner turned over
a potentially exculpatory x-ray of the victim that had never been
seen by the defense. The issue may ultimately be whether Workman is
guilty of felony murder even if he didn't fire the fatal shot
because he clearly committed the crime that led to the officer's
death. The question is now before the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of
Appeals. By Kevin Sack. (1200 words)

   OPEC-IMPACT (Dallas) _ Surging fuel prices and rising costs for
chemicals, plastics, resins and other products have driven up
expenses for many manufacturers. And even though oil prices have
retreated somewhat recently in expectation of increased production
by the oil-producing nations, there is little relief in sight. So
far, however, the higher petroleum costs have not for the most part
been passed on to consumers _ outside of direct expenses for fuel,
which have led airlines and shippers to raise prices _ as global

she stood in a row with 10 co-workers, tucked an orange under her
chin and transferred it to the space beneath a colleague's chin.
The goal was to move the orange down the entire line in less than
five minutes. But there was a deeper purpose: to build teamwork,
enhance communication and promote problem solving. And, oh yes: to
have a hoot in the process. But after the fun ended, employees
returned to their desks, submerged themselves in their daily chores
and forgot all about the great fruit exchange. More and more
corporations _ at least 70 percent, according to some estimates _
are relying on external training programs to foster leadership
skills and companywide bonding. Trouble is, many of these programs
have no practical value whatsoever. By Abby Ellin.

   ISRAEL-NETANYAHU _ JERUSALEM _ Israeli police Tuesday
recommended that former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be
charged with accepting a bribe and illegal gifts while in office.
The charges, if filed and if they lead to a conviction, could bring
a jail sentence. Police also recommended that Netanyahu's wife,
Sarah Netanyahu, be charged. The bribery recommendation stems from
work a contractor did on the Netanyahus' private house, apparently,
police say, in expectation that the prime minister would give him
contracts. The gifts included those from foreign dignitaries,
including a gold letter opener from Vice President Al Gore.
Netanyahu will hold a televised news conference at 1 p.m. EST to
dispute the allegations. (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

   CLINTON-SCFLAG _ COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Few, if any, local NAACP
officials will be in the audience Wednesday when President Clinton
speaks at a fund-raising dinner in Columbia, where he's expected to
denounce the Confederate flag flying atop the Statehouse. What
would seem a natural rally for flag opponents, such as the NAACP,
is complicated by the organization's national economic boycott of
South Carolina. ``We would have preferred that the president come
in and leave,'' said Dwight James, executive director of the
NAACP's South Carolina conference. ``We are hopeful that any
visitors coming in for the dinner will not stay in hotels or
frequent other tourist venues in Columbia.'' A look at how the
boycott is inconveniencing black organizations and colleges, pegged
to Clinton's speech at a $500-per-person state Democratic Party
fund-raiser to honor U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, chairman of the
Congressional Black Caucus. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   SCHOOLBUS-TRAIN _ CHATSWORTH, Ga. _ A Murray County, Ga., school

   RAYLEWIS _ ATLANTA _ Ray Lewis was a willing participant in the

Nino, has told police that he saw Lewis take off his chain to
prepare to fight and then engage in a fight with the victims. Gwen
is a key witness for the prosecution; he also will face tough going
under cross-examination. His rap lyrics speak of gang violence and
he's now in a halfway house for violating probation in an Ohio drug
conviction. (Rankin/Torpy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   POL-LATENIGHT-JOKES _ David Letterman calls George W. Bush ``a

rampant this campaign season. It may have been funnier and more

   IOWA-PORK (State Center, Iowa) _ Agriculture, they tell you the
moment you get to Des Moines, no longer rules the local economy.
Corn and pigs are no longer kings. Well, maybe not, but farm
traditions die hard. Although almost half of Iowa's pork producers
went out of business between 1992 and 1997, the surviving family
farmers cling to their debt-ridden, often economically marginal
farms the way grand old English families hang on to their country
houses, even when the roof leaks and the servants are long gone. By
R.W. Apple Jr.

   HOLLYWOOD _ The sound of giggling erupted from behind the
louvered dressing-room door. I could hear it through the walls. A
very slender, dark and beautiful young woman was changing into a
red lace-up-corset, matching thong bikini and sheer, see-through
red nylon and ostrich-feather confection to parade (quickly, mind
you) past a waiting TV crew. Telemundo was at Frederick's of
Hollywood for a shoot and the on-air reporter was living the part,
not just observing it.
</P>
<P>
   She stepped quickly out of the dressing room and coyly pranced
by the camera and its two-man crew. Speaking quickly in Spanish,
she displayed a slim leg and flipped a boa at the camera, showing
just enough skin to make the point: Today's Frederick's of
Hollywood is about flirtation, not sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of giggling that goes on at Frederick's, mainly
because of the filmy little nothings that gave it such a racy
reputation in days gone by. Crotchless panties; backless-sideless
and nearly frontless bras; maribou-kissed mules and fluffy feather
boas. The stuff of Vargas pin-ups and naughty Playboy shoots. But
if you look elsewhere at the Rio thongs (4 for $14), the ``Kiss''
bras (click the little gizmo between the cups and watch your
cleavage increase) and the H2O Water Bra, which weighs a ton but
looks great under a jacket, you realize that what Frederick's
really sells is simply . . . lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   You can find Frederick's of Hollywood in shopping malls and on
the Net (www.fredericks.com). You can send away for the catalog and
buy bridal trousseaux, bathing suits, garter belts, Superman robes
and boxer shorts for the boyfriend, wigs, body glitter and perfume,
lace-trimmed camisoles with matching briefs, cotton undies and yes,
selections from the section named ``Show-off,'' which includes
stretch lace body stockings and what they coyly call ``birdcage''
bra styles.
</P>
<P>
   Just from looking at him, you wouldn't have thought that the
Frederick of Frederick's, a dapper gent named Frederick Mellinger,
had it in him to invent such lascivious lingerie. Mr. Mellinger
(which is what the staff still calls him 10 years after his death)
spoke about women with a hushed reverence. Suave and debonair, he
was always the perfect gentleman. One only wonders about his
fantasy life.
</P>
<P>
   When Mellinger mustered out of the Army after World War II, he
opened a lingerie store on lower Fifth Avenue in New York and the
factory to supply it in New York's Chinatown. Frederick's of New
York specialized in French-style undies _ black, lacy, frilly
``unmentionables'' that no one talked about in polite society, but
behind bedroom doors _ ooo la la. Women who had worked in the
factories while their men were away fighting in Europe and the
South Pacific found themselves relegated to the kitchen and bedroom
again. Mellinger thought that it was the perfect time for a little
sex and sizzle. His undies were (and in some way still are)
scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Mellinger was clever. He understood the American
mentality.'' So says Amanda Diaz, Frederick's spokeswoman, an
ebullient blonde with a generous figure and striking bangs. ``He
advertised in the back of women's magazines like Harper's Bazaar,
Good Housekeeping and Vogue _ usually about fixing a specific
figure problem. From there, he built a mailing list and a
catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mellinger wasn't sure his business belonged in New York.
Glamour and sensuality meant one thing to him: Hollywood. And so
Frederick's of New York became Frederick's of Hollywood in 1947
when Mellinger moved his business to the West Coast and onto
Hollywood Boulevard across the street from Mann's Chinese Theater.
By then the formula was perfected. It was time to grow the
mystique: Frederick's of Hollywood was about one thing and one
thing only _ the secrets of the Hollywood stars.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem, and that came along with the sexual
revolution of the 1960s. Frederick's of Hollywood became synonymous
with naughty lingerie. If you wanted to dress like a dominatrix for
Halloween, you went to Frederick's. If you were having a bridal
shower and you wanted to give the bride something that would make
her blush for a week, you'd go to Frederick's. If it had feathers
on it but bared the nipples or the rear end, you bought it at
Frederick's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got that stripper-porn magazine reputation in the early
'70s,'' Diaz said, ``when everything was so loosey-goosey.
Frederick's, which was already in touch with female sexuality, went
more so with the crotchless panties. . . . They sell them at
Nordstrom's,'' she huffed. (FYI: I called Nordstrom to ask if they
had crotchless panties and the saleswoman who answered the phone
said, ``No we don't. You're going to have to go to Frederick's for
those.'')
</P>
<P>
   Seated at the desk in her office, upstairs from the retail
store, Diaz is surrounded by original catalog art from the '50s and
'60s. Then, the catalog was mostly drawings and sketches of pin-up
girls with the faces of movie stars, particularly Brigitte Bardot
and her charming Gallic pout (not to mention her daring derriere,
dressed-up satins and laces).
</P>
<P>
   If there was once a bit of back-room sexual mystery attached to
Frederick's, Diaz dismisses the idea that the company got a new
lease on life with the success of the Victoria's Secret franchise.
``We've always looked like ourselves,'' she said. ``We hear all the
time from our vendor base that they're going more sexy because of
us. There is plenty of market share for both of us. We have
200-plus stores and an Internet site which was up three or four
years before theirs. Victoria's Secret has a lot of wonderful
things, but they're never going to be 54 years old.''

 &HT;    PHYS ED TEACHERS FIGHT AGAINST OBSOLESCENCE
 &HT;    630&AMP;adds. With PHYS-ED-POLL and PHYS-ED-WEB.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, April 2.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Embattled physical education teachers are
leading an uphill struggle to reverse the gradual disappearance of
their classes from American schools.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than 30 percent of high school students now taking
daily phys ed classes, many worry that the lack of activity could
be making the next generation of American adults less healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the U.S. Marine Corps boot camp at Parris Island,
S.C., reported that while its new recruits are ``smarter and more
mentally agile,'' they ``do not have the physical fitness
foundation of their predecessors.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Education reported in January that
nearly 80 percent of the 1 million students tested in grades 5, 7
and 9 failed to meet minimum standards on the ``Fitnessgram,'' a
simple, widely used test. For example, many could not reach back
with one hand over their shoulder and the other under their elbow
and touch fingertips behind their back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're paying a tremendous price for the rollback in
physical education,'' Surgeon General David Satcher told the
convention of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education,
Recreation and Dance here last month. ``One of the greatest
contributions you can make to an adult's health is to get them
started as a child on a lifetime of physical activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that at least 300,000 people die each year in this
country because of physical inactivity and poor nutrition, which go
together,'' he said. ``Others become unnecessarily dependent on
others in their old age.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 physical educators who convened here with
scholars and business leaders agreed that as a first step to
reverse the trend, they will try to convince Congress to adopt the
Physical Education for Progress bill.
</P>
<P>
   The PEP bill would authorize grants of $400 million over five
years to local school systems for equipment, support, curriculum
development and training of staffs and teachers for physical
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just to keep the next generation from becoming
obese,'' the bill's sponsor, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said in
his Washington office. ``The kids who are causing all this violence
and bullying, they're not getting the organized physical activity
where you let off steam and learn about things like waiting your
turn and not winning all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, the powerful chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, wll offer the bill as an amendment to the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act when it reaches the Senate floor by
early May. While Stevens has 18 Senate co-sponsors for the bill,
opposition by fiscal conservatives makes its prospects uncertain,
supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Republican, but there's a group of Republicans _ they're
very bull-headed _ they say they don't want to have any new
legislation on anything,'' lamented Jim Baugh, president of Wilson
Sporting Goods Co. He said he had personally visited 20 senators on
behalf of the PEP bill.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill does become law and then obtains funding, it would
be the first new federal law on physical education since 1989. But
while such a victory would be a morale-booster for physical
educators, financially it would be only a drop in the bucket _ an
average of about $1,125 a year for each of the nation's 88,000
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   So over the long haul, the physical educators and their allies
hope to revise state and local priorities. They want the United
States to continue producing world-class athletes. But they are
more concerned about the vast bulk of our children who grow up
indifferent to physical activity, passive sports fans more
comfortable on the couch than on the field.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   At their Orlando convention, physical educators were bombarded
with warnings that physical education could follow driver's
education out of the public schools and into the world of
pay-your-own-way luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all baby boomers were required to take physical education
throughout their school years, when policy-makers still recalled
the appalling levels of physical fitness that hampered recruiting
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Those who enjoyed physical education then are among its
strongest supporters now. But it is not unusual for a school board
or legislature to be dominated by boomers who hated those
military-style gym classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in that age group, so I know what too many decision-makers
are remembering _ the single row, the roll calls, competition,
calisthenics, getting picked last,'' said Jennifer Reeves of
Tucson, who taught physical education to children for 20 years
before moving to the University of Arizona to teach physical
educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of them don't know that now we're exposing children
to a variety of skills and activities that they can use and enjoy
all of their life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the suspension of the military draft in the Nixon
administration, state enforcement of mandatory physical education
laws began to slack off.
</P>
<P>
   Classes became shorter and rarer. Waivers allow many students to
substitute varsity sports, cheerleading, or music, or work on the
school newspaper or Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Market research by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association
indicates that participation fell below 70 percent in the 1980s and
below 60 percent in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is especially steep after children leave sixth
grade, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control:
</P>
<P>
   _ Though 42 percent of high school students were taking daily
physical education in 1991, that had dropped to 27 percent by 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 17 percent of middle schools and 2 percent of high
schools required all students to take daily physical education in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois, cited in 1997 as the only state still vigorously
enforcing a strict physical education mandate for all students in
all grades, now has joined the 49 who slacked off. Chicago school
officials estimate that they will save $16 million a year as the
result of a recent court decision approving their plan to change
physical education to an elective in 11th and 12th grades.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Those who are unswayed by the concerns of Satcher about health,
Stevens about violence or the Marines about finding fit recruits
might be impressed by the potential economic losses, suggested
Gudrun Doll-Tepper, president of the International Council on Sport
Science and Physical Education.
</P>
<P>
   Her nonprofit council's worldwide study, financed by the
International Olympic Committee and released last November,
established that ``every dollar invested in physical education
saves $3.20 in medical costs.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, firms ranging from ski resorts to wholesalers of
athletic footwear lose potential sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Britain, for example, the leisure industry employes far
more people than the car industry,'' said Margaret Talbot,
president of International Girls and Women in Sports and Physical
Education. When her group mentioned that to British parents and
education officials, ``that woke them up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. decline reflects a global trend, according to the
international report. The experts concluded that in almost all
countries:
</P>
<P>
   _ Physical education requirements that exist on paper are feebly
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Much time is wasted in talking instead of activity in physical
education classes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most teachers in the primary grades have very little training.
</P>
<P>
   _ Morale among professional physical educators is low.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said the good news is that new approaches are probably
more important than higher spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a lot to learn from less developed countries,
because of the way they deliver with almost nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best physical education classes I ever saw was in
Buenos Aires, Argentina, with 45 children and one balloon,'' she
said. ``The children were active and involved and learning and
enjoying themselves, and that is teaching at its very best.''

<P>
   Schools aren't providing as much physical education as most
adults and teenagers want, judging from a national poll by the
National Association for Sport and Physical Education:
</P>
<P>
   _ 81 percent of adults and 71 percent of teens agreed that
``daily physical education should be mandatory in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 47 percent of teens said they don't have a daily phys ed
class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teens split among 47 percent who said they have ``the right
amount'' of physical education, 42 percent who said they would take
``more'' if available, and 9 percent who said they would take
``less'' if possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teens said what they like most about phys ed class are the
opportunity to have exercise (20 percent), getting fit (18
percent), having fun (16 percent) and the activities offered (16
percent). Only 6 percent said they don't like anything.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teens said what they dislike most about phys ed class are
running (13 percent), boring activities (9 percent) and undressing
and dressing for class (7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Adults who believe they are not getting enough physical
activity blamed their job (33 percent), lack of interest or
motivation (27 percent), lack of time (19 percent) or health
problems (13 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Teens who believe they are not getting enough physical
activity blamed lack of time (24 percent), doing homework (19
percent) and lack of interest or motivation (13 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Adults who think their own children aren't getting enough
physical activity blamed lack of interest or motivation (24
percent), lack of time (13 percent) and watching television (13
percent).
</P>
<P>
   The phone poll of 1,017 adults and 500 teens aged 12 to 17 was
conducted Feb. 3-7 by Opinion Research Corp. International of
Princeton, N.J. The margin of sampling error was 3 percent for all
adults, and 4 percent for the teens and for the parents (those
within the adult group who had children 6 to 17).

OPEC AGREEMENT ON INCREASING OIL PRODUCTION IS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Despite a deep split between Saudi Arabia and
Iran, the president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said the group had agreed on a plan to increase oil
production that should at least halt the recent surge in prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have an agreement,'' said Ali Rodriguez,
Venezuela's oil minister and the newly named president of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   Although the oil ministers said they were still discussing
last-minute details, officials said the increase in quotas would be
very close to the Saudi demands for an additional 1.7 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the increase would be much more modest, because
OPEC countries already cheat on their quotas by about 1 million
barrels a day. Much if not most of that cheating is expected to
cease once the official quotas are increased.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say the increase will bring only a modest relief
in gasoline prices, which have soared since OPEC and allied nations
like Mexico and Norway slashed production by 2.1 million barrels
one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The expected increase would also fall well short of pleas from
the United States, where the White House and the Department of
Energy have waged a loud campaign for a real increase of as much as
2.5 million barrels daily.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the increases would entirely reverse the cuts
imposed last year by the 11 OPEC members, and they are likely to be
followed by proportionate increases by Mexico and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has also said it will raise its daily production by about
700,000 barrels, although analysts are skeptical. Iraq exports oil
under special U.N. restrictions that stem from the Persian Gulf War
and permit it to spend the revenue only on food, medicine and other
humanitarian needs. Though Iraq is a member of OPEC, it is allowed
to export as much oil as it wants.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's apparent agreement comes after a bitter test of wills
in which Saudi officials threatened to shatter OPEC's unity by
pushing through an increase with or without Iran's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The battle turned on politics as much as economics, and much of
that battle within OPEC was about whether countries could or would
be seen as capitulating to heavy-handed U.S. demands.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials adamantly wanted to raise prices, in part
because the United States is its biggest market and in part because
of concern about political wrath from Congress, where some
lawmakers have pushed for legislation to block aid and sales of
military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian leaders denounced U.S. demands and insisted that OPEC
should not makes its decision in response to political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and Saudi leaders argued here that Iran is already
producing near its maximum capacity of about 3 million barrels a
day and has nothing to gain from an increase in total production.
As a result, any increase in production would come from other
countries _ Saudi Arabia in particular _ and merely lead to lower
prices for what Iran was already selling.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia and Iran are OPEC's two largest producers, but
Saudi Arabia is by far the biggest, with a daily output of 7.6
million barrels. It has enough spare capacity to flood world
markets in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials, alarmed when prices suddenly surged to about
$30 a barrel in recent months, demanded an increase in output that
would prevent worldwide shortages and stabilize prices.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House officials said they were satisfied
with the apparent agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, they have argued privately that their lobbying
campaign helped move the consensus within OPEC away from a broad
resistance to any increases just two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But within OPEC, many leaders are still fuming about what they
view as heavy-handed pressure that only made their political
situation more awkward. Venezuelan leaders have been particularly
sensitive about being portrayed as puppets of the U.S. government,
and went out of their way last week to criticize lobbying efforts
by the U.S. secretary of energy, Bill Richardson.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Monday, Iranian officials almost gleefully pounced on the
issue of U.S. pressure when Richardson reportedly called the oil
minister of Qatar just as he was meeting with his counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Though modest, the proposed increases are still significant. Oil
prices have already skidded about 18 percent since March 8, falling
from $34 to about $28. Most of that decline reflects expectations
that OPEC would agree on an increase of roughly this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials have made clear that they would like to see the
price of oil settle at around $25 a barrel. They believe that price
could remain stable and would allow the world's big consuming
nations to rebuild their badly depleted reserves.

daily newspapers intensified as former mayoral candidate Clint
Reilly asked a federal judge to issue an emergency order barring
Hearst Corp.'s imminent purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed late Monday, Reilly asked U.S. District Judge
Vaughn Walker to issue a temporary restraining order blocking
Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle for 10 days, or until Walker can
hold a full hearing on Reilly's contention that Hearst's
acquisition of the newspaper would create a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important case of great moment and interest in this
community,'' said the motion by Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's lawyer.
``Hearst should not be able to end competition in the daily
newspaper business in San Francisco by rushing to complete its
purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle before this court has had a
full and deliberate hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   A full hearing already was set for April 13, but Hearst
announced March 17 it would complete its purchase of the Chronicle
by March 30 for a reported $660 million. Hearst also said it would
sell its San Francisco Examiner to the publisher of the free,
thrice-weekly San Francisco Independent, by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has denied Reilly's antitrust claims.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly presented declarations from newspaper industry veterans,
including three formerly involved in the business operations of the
Examiner and Chronicle, asserting that Hearst's plan to give the
buyer of the Examiner an annual subsidy of up to $25 million for
three years was insufficient to publish a competitive newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Halling, a lawyer for Hearst, replied, ``The thrust of Mr.
Reilly's case is that Hearst is not providing a large enough
subsidy for the continued publication of the Examiner. To suggest
that the antitrust laws require any level of subsidy is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's motion is the latest shot in his suit seeking to
prevent Hearst, the New York-based company that publishes the
smaller afternoon Examiner, from buying the larger Chronicle, which
is published in the mornings. Alioto said the motion was delivered
to the federal court clerk's office after regular hours Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The court papers amplify Reilly's contentions that Hearst's
purchase of the Chronicle would lead to Hearst owning San
Francisco's only metropolitan daily newspaper, resulting in higher
advertising and subscription rates and fewer editorial voices.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has said the sales of the Examiner and the Chronicle
would create economic competition between daily papers in San
Francisco for the first time in 35 years and promote a diversity of
editorial voices.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fang, publisher of The Independent, has said the Examiner
would publish as a daily paper sold through home subscriptions and
newsracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fang family has agreed to purchase the Examiner name,
archives, subscriber list, Web site, computers, office furniture,
delivery trucks and newsracks. The staff, buildings and printing
presses were not included. Hearst has said the Examiner employees
would be offered jobs at the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   In the court papers filed Monday, Alioto argued that Hearst's
sale of the Examiner to the Fangs was ``a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The transaction . . . does not provide sufficient assets,
resources, or subsidy from Hearst to permit the continuation of the
Examiner . . . in competition with the San Francisco Chronicle,''
Alioto said. ``The result will be a monopoly by Hearst, just as if
Hearst had shut down the Examiner itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto filed declarations from six industry veterans, who said
putting out a competitive paper would present the Fangs with
obstacles and costs far beyond the subsidy to be provided by the
Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Five of them said a competitive paper would require an annual
subsidy of $50 million for five years, or a one-time payment of
$250 million. The sixth estimated a $50 million subsidy would be
needed for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the veterans are former executives with the San
Francisco Newspaper Agency, which manages the business operations
of the Examiner and the Chronicle under a joint operating
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor last year, argued that
Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle would violate federal antitrust
laws that outlaw monopolies, and the Newspaper Preservation Act,
which allows joint operating agreements to preserve newspapers with
competing editorial voices.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Examiner and Chronicle have been in a joint
operating agreement, an exception to the federal antitrust laws
that allows them to share business operations while maintaining
independent editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, set to expire in 2005, the Chronicle and
Examiner split profits.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto alleged that Hearst, on one hand, had misused its
position in the agreement to discourage other potential Chronicle
buyers by insisting that they honor the duration of the
profit-splitting agreement with Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Hearst an unfair advantage, the lawyer claimed,
because only Hearst could buy the Chronicle, simply stop publishing
the Examiner and avoid its costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Hearst insisted on continuing the joint operating
agreement, competition was foreclosed in the sale of the San
Francisco Chronicle, other bidders were excluded, and Hearst forced
the sale of the paper to itself at a below-market price,'' Alioto
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto further contends that Hearst on the other hand has
refused to offer potential Examiner buyers its cut of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The court should permanently bar Hearst from buying the
Chronicle for ``abusing'' the agreement, Alioto said.

ORPHANS SEEK REDRESS FOR INJUSTICES 
</HEADLINE>

 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ They were Quebec's ``children of sin,'' most of them
given up by teenage girls when unwed parenthood carried deep social
stigma. Others were progeny of rape or incest. Others still were
from families too poor to feed another mouth.
</P>
<P>
   They were castoffs, in any event, children wanted by nobody but
dutifully taken in by the Roman Catholic Church, which ran nearly
all of the province's charitable institutions as well as public
schools and hospitals during the 1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Today they are called the ``orphans of Duplessis,'' named after
Maurice Duplessis, the iron-willed provincial premier who, in close
alliance with bishops and priests, dominated Quebec for nearly a
quarter-century until his death in 1959. Because of his ferocious
opposition to social change, Quebecers still refer to that era as
the ``long darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   In that darkness, the sad tale of the Duplessis orphans begins.
It is a story that can be summarized with one chilling statistic:
Starting in the mid-1940s, roughly 3,000 abandoned Quebec
youngsters of normal intelligence were arbitrarily pronounced
``severely retarded'' or ``psychotic'' so that church-run
orphanages could qualify for heftier government payments.
Institutions treating disturbed youngsters received three times as
much funding as orphanages that merely provided shelter and
education.
</P>
<P>
   Now hundreds of middle-aged Duplessis orphans are demanding
apologies from the church and financial redress from the province
for what they describe as childhoods of systematic abuse. They
contend, and the province quietly concedes, that their young lives
were horribly transformed in facilities where straitjackets,
solitary cells, and heavy doses of tranquilizing medicines were
used regularly to control unruly children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is North America's largest case of institutional abuse,''
said Carlo Tarini, a spokesman for the orphans.
</P>
<P>
   One former patient is Alice Quinton, a child of incest but
otherwise just a normally feisty 7-year-old, who was abruptly
transferred from a church home for abandoned youngsters to a locked
facility, run by the Sisters of Charity of Quebec, that housed 900
severely disturbed adult mental patients _ and, from that day,
scores of terrified little girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``October 23, 1945 _ that's the date the gates of hell opened
for me,'' Quinton recalled in an interview. ``I lived behind the
grated windows at St.-Julien Hospital until I was 23 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy has drawn international attention, and, last year,
an apology from Quebec's current premier, Lucien Bouchard.
</P>
<P>
   But it was qualified remorse. Bouchard acknowledged that serious
injustices occurred and that the province deserved some blame, but
said that it would be difficult to pursue civil or criminal action
after so many decades because of incomplete records and other lost
evidence. He offered the equivalent of $2.1 million to provide
counseling and advocacy services for surviving orphans, many of
whom live in poverty and unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is genuine compassion for the orphans, and the desire to
restore their dignity, for example, by revising their medical
records to show the truth,'' said Dominique Ollivier, spokeswoman
for the Ministry of Citizen Relations. ``But it is simply not
within our power to undo history.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer of a fund was rejected by a committee of orphans. They
demand a total of $56 million in individual reparations as well as
an unambiguous apology from the church.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's archbishop, Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte, is adamant
that the church did not intentionally mistreat the children. He has
insisted that to render apologies for mistakes made inadvertently
would sully the name of nuns who dedicated their lives to bringing
up youngsters abandoned by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   In a public statement that stunned many, Turcotte recently
declared that the orphans ``don't deserve an apology . . . (They
are) victims of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Church officials did not respond to requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Turcotte's hard-line view is not universal in Quebec's Catholic
hierarchy. Last week, 64 nuns and other followers of religious
callings issued a letter condemning Turcotte's ``cold'' stance.
</P>
<P>
   The fate that befell Alice Quinton at St.-Julien Hospital was
repeated at roughly a dozen other institutions throughout Quebec as
abandoned children were either herded into mental asylums or found
their orphanages reclassified as ``mental hospitals'' to secure
increased funding from the government
</P>
<P>
   Life in these settings was occasionally marked by appalling
cruelties, with children tied to bedsprings, bound in
straitjackets, or placed in reeking isolation cells. The harshest
abuses appear to have been aberrant acts by a few cruel nuns, not
standard procedure. Beatings also occurred, but this was a time
when a hard slap in the face or strap across the bottom were
considered routine forms of discipline in Quebec schools.
</P>
<P>
   There were also instances of sexual assaults by custodians and
other male staff. Cases of rape appear to have been rare.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most searing injustice seems to have been the
collusion of doctors, church officials, and government leaders in
falsely diagnosing the most defenseless wards of the province as
severely retarded or hopelessly insane simply to boost the flow of
funding to needy institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Quebec's ombudsman, Daniel Jacoby: ``Normal
children from foundling homes and orphanages ended up in
psychiatric institutions along with the mentally handicapped and
the mentally ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a recent government report estimated that during the
Duplessis era, nearly 30 percent of the residents at provincial
asylums were not mentally ill at all, just unwanted children.
</P>
<P>
   ``As `children of sin,' we were unpleasant reminders of the
weakness of human flesh,'' said Bruno Roy, 57, born out of wedlock
and surrendered to an orphange called Mount Providence, on the
eastern outskirts of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, `normal' children have families to defend them and
love them,'' he said. ``So by the most basic definition, we were
`abnormal.' It wasn't such a big leap to treat us as subhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy was 11 when Mount Providence was abruptly transformed from
orphan home to mental asylum in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened almost overnight,'' said Roy, a retired professor
of French literature and one of the few Duplessis orphans to have
achieved a normal life. ``Bars were put on the windows, a fence was
raised around the orphanage, and four busloads of crazies _ adults,
some drooling, some catatonic, some dangerous _ were brought to
live among us. Our education was suspended; no more classes.
Instead, we were set to work washing the backs and bed linen of
insane old men.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Roy counts himself lucky. One of the nuns
recognized the gleam of his intelligence, despite the diagnosis of
``severely retarded'' in his records, and had him released to a
vocational school at age 15.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Quinton keeps her medical records in a loose-leaf notebook
together with her ``art'' _ sad drawings of herself as a young girl
trussed up in a straitjacket, lashed into a sort of potty chair
with thick straps. It was the punishent you received for talking
back or giggling at St.-Julien's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I was crazy, and that I must be in an institution
all my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During 23 years of incarceration, Quinton said, she made just
one foray to the outside world, a day trip to the nearby town of
Granby: ``I saw ordinary children who walked about freely and did
not appear frightened (to) laugh out loud or talk with their
friends,'' she said. ``I'd never imagined such a life was
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1961, two years after the death of Duplessis, outside
medical examiners entered Quebec's asylums and were stunned by what
they found. Quick orders came down from Quebec City to release the
orphans.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, they told me I was not crazy, after all,'' said
Quinton. ``So you have to leave, they said. I couldn't even cook
for myself. I didn't know that to make a potato you put it in
boiling water. I had never seen or touched a can opener.''

COURT RULING ON TOBACCO WAS THE RIGHT ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here is a proposition that makes sense for those
who believe that the powers of the government need to be
circumscribed and defined, even where doing the right thing is
involved:
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how important, conspicuous, and controversial the
issue, and regardless of how likely the public is to hold the
executive branch politically accountable . . . an administrative
agency's power to regulate in the public interest must always be
grounded in a valid grant of authority from Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   From the left, you can think of police and speech-limiting
powers that are inherently subject to abuse. From the right, you
can think of economic and environmental powers that are just as
flexible in the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the above quotation is from Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor's majority (5-4) opinion denying the Food and Drug
Administration's authority to regulate tobacco should not detract
from the appropriateness of her point. The fact that the cigarette
racket is as low as ``free enterprise'' goes cannot be a
justification for stretching the law.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that she spoke for the Supreme Court's conservative
majority (and its minority of smokers) should not mean to those of
different ideologies that her key points don't merit respect. They
do.
</P>
<P>
   The hurdle faced by advocates of FDA regulation, as the agency
intended in rules set four years ago and tied up in the courts ever
since, is simply too high. Acknowledging that is too much to hope
for, but tobacco opponents should recognize the court's decision
for the delicious political opportunity that it is.
</P>
<P>
   In tossing this, in effect, back to Congress, the slender court
majority has offered a golden opportunity to get the policy
direction correct; or, if Congress cannot shake off the corrupting
impact of millions in tobacco money and does nothing, the court
will have handed Democrats in general and Al Gore in particular a
major issue against Republicans and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer was acerbic but confused
logic with law. How, he wondered, can a statute aimed at unsafe
drugs and devices not permit regulation of a drug (nicotine) and a
device (the cigarette) that the majority itself has deemed unsafe?
If ever likely harm and even death justified regulation, here is
the case, making Justice O'Connor's reasoning
``counter-intuitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so. The unfortunate fact is that for decades, the FDA itself
has consistently decided that it lacked legal jurisdiction to
regulate the tobacco racket. On the surface, changing its official
mind in 1996 is not wrong, but it becomes so if Congress's specific
actions over the years (however corrupt) are considered. Justice
O'Connor even found a provision of the US Code that states with
discomfiting clarity that ``the marketing of tobacco constitutes
one of the greatest basic industries of the United States with
ramifying activities which directly affect interstate and foreign
commerce at every point, and stable conditions therein are
necessary to the general welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, several statutes regulate the racket (for example, its
advertising) in ways that clearly contemplate its continued
existence. And yet, she reasons, regulation by the FDA would by the
agency's statutory obligation to remove unsafe products and devices
from the market require the banning of tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The decision puts the onus for inaction on Congress and the
president, where it belongs, and puts tobacco squarely in the
politics of 2000. Two years ago, in fact, a proposed law shepherded
by John McCain provided for FDA regulation the right way as part of
a comprehensive approach. As always, only a filibuster kept the
proposal from a vote and certain passage.
</P>
<P>
   But it's back now with a vengeance. The FDA provisions were
drafted by Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, a Republican and a
physician, and he is likely to support reintroduction. Leading
Democrats like Representative Henry Waxman of California and Gore
have already begun vigorous advocacy, as has President Clinton even
before his return from abroad. Even the industry is aboard in
principle.
</P>
<P>
   And leading Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
and Bush are already positioned as favoring phony substitutes
allegedly discouraging smoking by teenagers and opposing a grant of
regulatory power to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching the law to fit a worthy goal is always tempting but
almost always ill-advised. Putting the heat on via politics makes
more sense _ constitutionally as well as strategically.

DNA TESTING CASTS SHADOW ON ADOPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gurgling infant girl awaiting adoption seems healthy now.
</P>
<P>
   But what surprises may be encoded in her DNA? Are there flawed
genes that predispose her to serious mental or physical health
problems _ perhaps soon, perhaps years from now _ that would not
only cloud her life, but put a severe burden on her adoptive
parents?
</P>
<P>
   DNA testing is growing in power to predict future health or
disease, and with the Human Genome Project rushing toward its end,
all sorts of genetic forecasting will increase.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the speed with which science is gaining the ability to
predict who will fall victim to debilitating diseases is outpacing
our power to cure or even treat those same ailments.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemmas posed by such issues as who should be tested, who
should be told, and who should be protected from involuntarily
submitting or releasing information about their genetic makeup are
among the thorny ethical issues being discussed among the thousands
of biotechnology leaders convening this week in Boston for the
Bio2000 convention.
</P>
<P>
   Although genetic testing for predisposed medical conditions
could invade every facet of human life, adoption specialists say it
is already a rising concern among prospective adoptees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a number of calls asking for just this kind of
thing,'' said Karen Eanet, a genetic counselor at Greater Baltimore
Medical Center. ``They ask for some things we can't do and things
we can do but wouldn't recommend.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of predictive genetic testing of adoptees raises
difficult moral questions. In whose interest would it be to know
about medical problems ahead of time? What if the test detects
conditions that aren't treatable? Does testing invade the child's
right to privacy?
</P>
<P>
   Courts have ruled that adoption agencies have to provide all
reasonable medical history information. That hasn't been legally
interpreted to mean that agencies have to search for more
information, such as a genetic test might provide.
</P>
<P>
   But with hundreds of tests that can diagnose rare conditions and
others on the horizon that could identify predispositions to more
common diseases far in advance of symptoms, there could be
incentives for couples to ask for genetic testing of a child before
they adopt.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma pits the interests of some parents, those who are
worried about hidden health problems, against the interests of
children for whom agencies are seeking families. And, said
specialists at an unusual meeting on adoption and genetic testing
earlier this month, it raises the question of whether genetic
technology has created a demand for ``the perfect baby'' or ``the
perfect family,'' so that children with some abnormalities would be
less likely to find homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do these tests, it sounds like we'll have a huge pool of
unadopted children rotting in the foster care system,'' said Susan
Harris, a regional manager at Children's Services of Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genetic testing has the possibility of putting some children
in the back of the line, and that really frightens me,'' said Susan
Soon-Keum Cox, an authority on international adoption who was
adopted from Korea in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Cox participated in a meeting earlier this month at
the University of Massachusetts in Boston that brought together
specialists from many fields to discuss genetic testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that right now there aren't a lot of
requests for this type of testing, but as the tests multiply and
become more accurate, this problem will get more acute,'' said
Aytan Y. Bellin, counsel for a New York State task force weighing
this and other bioethical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Farrell Smith, the conference's organizer and a professor
of philosophy at UMass, said one incentive for genetic testing is a
lack of medical records in many cases, particularly in foreign
adoption. In such cases, both the child and the adoptive parents
could have an interest in genetic testing that would reveal a
proneness to health problems that runs in the birth family.
</P>
<P>
   A major question about preadoption gene testing, said Smith, is:
``Will you violate the child's privacy rights and risk genetic
discrimination in the future?''
</P>
<P>
   The conference brought together specialists from such disparate
fields as medical ethics, adoption services, law, and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Some argued that the main purpose of adoption is to find homes
for children and that genetic testing could harm their chances.
</P>
<P>
   Bellin referred to two cases in which couples considering
adoption sought genetic testing to reveal whether an adoptee would
develop Huntington's disease, a fatal, inherited disorder. In both
cases, specialists refused to perform the test.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic tests already can detect rare but serious disorders in
infants and can find single malfunctioning genes that cause
diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   More problematically, DNA tests also can reveal the presence of
genes that increase a person's chance of developing heart disease,
Alzheimer's disease, and inherited cancers. But these tests can't
predict with certainty, because environmental factors also help
determine whether the disease develops.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Glantz, a lawyer and bioethicist at the Boston
University School of Public Health, argued that testing for
adult-onset diseases would violate the child's right to privacy.
And, even though it might benefit anxious parents who are worried
about an adopted child's future health risks, ``My position is you
don't treat parent anxiety by testing their children for
adult-onset diseases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laurie Demmer, a medical geneticist at UMass Memorial Health
Care in Worcester, said she often consults with parents considering
adoption and wanting to know whether the child might develop a
life-threatening disease such as cystic fibrosis or might have a
chromosome defect that could cause mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the child may have some abnormalities, such as a
cleft lip, that could be part of a genetic syndrome. That's where a
genetic test might add information that will help immediately in
treating the child.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, she also has requests for tests she won't do. ``I
spend a lot of time explaining why we don't test children for
late-onset disorders'' such as Huntington's disease or to detect
genes they may carry that are harmless to them but could be passed
on to a child. ``We like to wait until they're old enough to make
the decision themselves,'' Demmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most vexing dilemma the participants discussed was
whether prospective adoptees should be tested for a disease such as
Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This fatal genetic disorder often
isn't diagnosed until the child is several years old and begins to
show muscle weakness. Patients become progressively disabled and
die in their teens or early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, genetic testing of an infant wouldn't lead to any
medical benefit for the child, since there is no treatment. But
parents may well feel that they're not equipped to deal,
financially or emotionally, with such a devastating condition.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bartholet, a professor at Harvard Law School and an
author on adoption and reproductive issues, said she feels that
prospective adoptive parents ``have some right to know about
extreme problems they don't feel ready to take on.'' Others,
however, argued against any attempt to match children's needs with
parents' desires or ability to take care of them. Nobody, they
argued, is prepared for a child with severe medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was not aimed at creating a position on testing.
But speakers noted that the American Society of Human Genetics and
the American College of Human Genetics have taken positions against
testing except to detect conditions for which treatment would have
immediate benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how the issue will play out. Anita Allen,
a professor of law and philosophy at the University of
Pennsylvania, said, ``I think the public adoption sector is
extremely reluctant to move in the direction of genetic testing.''
</P>
<P>
   But in private adoptions, said Allen, ``agencies have to depend
more on the values of consumers.''
</P>

   ``I think there may be more pressures'' to perform testing and

HIP AFRO-ASIAN FILMS REINVENT A GENRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, ``Erin Brockovich,'' starring Julia
Roberts and her gravity-defying breasts, spent its second week at
the top of the box office, earning about $19 million. But to the
shock and amazement of most observers, ``Romeo Must Die'' came in a
close second with $18.6 million for its opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Despite middling-to-negative reviews, little of the attention
and publicity afforded big-name releases, and no ``stars'' in the
Hollywood sense of the word, the action film, which opened
Wednesday, has earned $25 million in less than a week. Compare
that, say, to Madonna and Rupert Everett's excessively hyped flop
``The Next Best Thing,'' which only earned $5.8 million during its
opening weekend earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, Hollywood types are still shaking off their
Oscar-party hangovers and scratching their heads in wonderment at
how a film starring an R&AMP;B singer and a Hong Kong action icon most
Americans have never heard of could register one of the biggest
openings this year.
</P>
<P>
   So loosely based on William Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet''
that it might as well have been inspired by a ``Flintstones''
episode, ``Romeo Must Die'' has Jet Li (perhaps best known for his
turn as a villain in ``Lethal Weapon 4'') as an ex-cop and son of
an Asian kingpin who comes to Oakland (that's Verona for you
English-lit fans) to avenge the death of his brother. Along the
way, he falls for the daughter of an African-American ganglord
(played by Delroy Lindo, who yet again is so much better than the
roles he is offered), who is his father's rival. Making her film
debut as the daughter is singerAaliyah, who, as an actress, is a
hell of a singer, and there's also rapper DMX in a small role. But
the film's best moments come when Li, who became a superstar in
hundreds of martial-arts films, flashes his fists and feet of fury
at anyone who vexes him.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a great movie? Not at all. For an action film, there's far
too little action, and the acting often is clunky and creaky. But
in months to come, ``Romeo Must Die'' may be remembered as the film
which ushered in the new era of ``blaxploitation'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you remember this film genre of the early '70s, which
made stars of Pam Grier, Ron O'Neal, Richard Roundtree, and Melvin
Van Peebles in such films as ``Coffy,'' ``Superfly,'' ``Shaft,''
and ``Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,'' respectively. These were
those cheaply made films that boasted a distinctly urban
sensibility sharpened by crime, violence, sex, and music. All of
the films _ whether the hero was a cop or a hustler _ featured an
iconoclastic character with a headstrong me-against-the-world
attitude. Think Clint Eastwood's spaghetti-western Man With No Name
crossed with Ruy Ray Moore's Dolemite, and you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Tarantino did his part in reviving the genre back in
1997, when he refashioned Elmore Leonard's crime novel ``Rum
Punch'' into an underrated blaxploitation homage, ``Jackie Brown,''
with Grier as the title character. While Tarantino made a typically
stylish film, it pretty much followed the blueprint of those 1970s
films he grew up watching.
</P>
<P>
   But films like ``Romeo Must Die,'' are as much informed by
hip-hop as by ``Cleopatra Jones'' and ``Shaft's Big Score'' _ which
seems appropriate given that since so many rap artists from Ol'
Dirty Bastard to Snoop Dogg to Foxy Brown _ have been clearly
influenced by blaxploitation flicks. Instead of blaxploitation call
it the ``new-blax-swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Also falling into this category is Jim Jarmusch's
recentlyreleased ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,'' starring
Forest Whitaker as a hit man bound by codes of honor and loyalty,
as dictated by the wisdom of the ``Hagakure.'' At turns funny and
elegiac, it's a smarter and far superior film to ``Romeo Must
Die.'' But the two share the tenets of the modern blaxploitation
film _ a combination of hip-hop cool and Asian marital-arts
culture, which has been an underground staple of urban hipness
since Bruce Lee wandered through that hall of mirrors in ``Enter
the Dragon.'' (In 1973, there wasn't a self-respecting inner-city
kid who didn't have a Bruce Lee poster on the wall and a pair of
homemade nunchucks under the bed.)
</P>
<P>
   While it's unlikely such films will proliferate as they did in
the 1970s, the stunning success of ``Romeo Must Die'' and the
critical acceptance of ``Ghost Dog'' (already on its way to
worshipful cult status) cannot be ignored. ``Rush Hour II,''
starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in the sequel to the 1998
hit, is already on the way. And as sure as Hollywood can run a new
idea in the ground, there will be more films capitalizing on this
new Afro-Asian combination platter which is proving that, after
nearly a quarter-century, blaxploitation is back.

   FALL RIVER, Mass. _ It's lunchtime at Diman Regional Vocational
Technical High School here, but there are no scowling lunch ladies,
no mystery meats, no Formica tables reeking of bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, paying patrons at the cozy Diman Tea Room restaurant
are served pan-seared salmon with spinach, baby shrimp, and New
Zealand mussels by teens in toques who dream of becoming star
chefs.
</P>
<P>
   And their passion is no flash in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Culinary arts programs at vocational technical schools are
booming and a big part of the reason _ particularly at Diman, where
a whopping 140 students are wielding whisks _ can be summarized in
one word: ``Bam!''
</P>
<P>
   That is the culinary call of the wild television chef Emeril
Lagasse, a Fall River native and a Diman graduate, who sizzles on
the five-year-old Food Network, a national cable TV station
showcasing celebrity chefs from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Voc-tech students and administrators say that the influence of
television chefs who entertain as much as teach has filled their
cooking classes to the brim and has encouraged students who
otherwise might have passed over the program _ or dropped out of
school entirely _ to find a niche in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here for 24 years and this is the largest class
we've ever had, and it's all kinds of kids. I know it's Food
Network and Emeril,'' said Ed Kerr, who heads the culinary program
at Diman and taught Lagasse for three years. ``The kids know all
the shows. They come in here and ask if we can make what they see
on TV, and it's really made them see how exciting cooking can be.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 51 culinary arts programs at vocational schools across
Massachusetts, although the programs have always been popular,
administrators say there has been a renewed interest over the past
five years, with some schools reporting 25 percent to 40 percent
increases in enrollment, and others, such as Assabet Regional in
Marlborough, renovating their aging kitchens to meet demands.
</P>
<P>
   Once dominated by boys, the programs are now evenly split, the
schools say, due, in part, to the soaring economy and thriving job
market in the restaurant field, and because the
cooking-as-entertainment phenomenon cultivates students' creative
and artistic sides.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what Julia Child did for Baby Boomers by showing them on
television how to concoct coq au vin and other French fare, Food
Network chefs like grilling king Bobby Flay and Asian guru Ming
Tsai are turning the next generation on to catfish, quail eggs, and
key lime pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love watching those chefs because it inspires me to do
something different,'' said April Smeaton, 17, a senior in the
Diman program who has won awards for her creative wedding cakes.
``I will see a recipe that interests me and then run out to get the
ingredients to try it at home. I just did a banana loaf with banana
leaves that I saw on `Yan Can Cook,' and it came out awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   At Blue Hills Regional Vocational Technical School in Canton,
Mass., culinary arts department head Jim Hanrahan said the quality
of his students has improved over the years and attributes that to
youths getting excited by what they see on television and entering
the program with a positive attitude and a burning desire to get
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, because the students are so diverse, they are
preparing more ethnic foods than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that the kids who came to this program had
trouble with geometry or thought this would be an easy ride through
high school,'' Hanrahan said. ``But these kids are now
sophisticated about food, they are serious about cooking, and they
want to be challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanrahan said he lets students choose a recipe they like from
any Food Network show and make it for their final project.
</P>
<P>
   ``These chefs they see on TV have great personalities. They
aren't stiffs like you used to see, and that really gets the kids
going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Tri-County Regional Vocational Technical High School in
Franklin, Mass., students are cooking at such a high level that
they can enter the culinary program at Johnson and Wales College in
Providence as sophomores, bypassing freshman year, said Tri-County
pastry instructor Bernard Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think students coming out of voc-tech programs are at the
greatest sophistication levels,'' said Thomas L. Wright, vice
president of culinary education at Johnson and Wales. ``Whether
it's Emeril or Martin Yan or Paul Prudhomme . . . kids see chefs,
they see the ice sculptures and they want to be that. The media
plays a huge role in inspiring young culinarians in many ways, and
kids come here ready to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, celebrity chefs like Tsai, who owns the
critically acclaimed Blue Ginger restaurant in Wellesley, say that
while they are thrilled to be sources of inspiration for future
chefs, they warn that the road to TV chef stardom is paved with
dirty dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai said students have to be realistic about their goals and
about the restaurant industry, which requires hard work, long
hours, dedication, talent, and the right breaks to make it big.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their goal is to be artistic and to create food, then they
will get instant gratification,'' said Tsai. ``If the plate comes
back full or empty, that's how you know you are doing the job every
night. But being a star chef is about timing and luck and they
should put their hearts into cooking because they love it, not
because they want to be on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Lantagne, 17, of Norfolk, Mass., will happily take that
advice. The Tri-County junior is a fan of Tsai's and Lagasse's (he
is often heard yelling ``Bam!'' in the Tri-County kichen or ``Let's
kick it up a notch!'' another Lagasse-ism), but his dreams are set
on the high seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a chef for a cruise line, so I can see the world
and do what I love,'' said Lantagne. ``I mean, it would be cool to
have my own TV show, but it would have to be different than
everyone else's. I can think about it as I cruise the world.''

A CHILD-FRIENDLY GETAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STAN GROSSFELD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas _ Last year my 1-year-old son threw up on me on
an American Airlines flight from San Juan. I didn't have a change
of clothes so my wife followed me to the lavatory and gave me her
frilly shirt. None of the passengers saw me sprint to the toilet
but they all saw me leave and I know what they were whispering:
``Who is that blushing transvestite?''
</P>
<P>
   I learned an important lesson that day. Although an infant is
entitled to fly for free, forget trying to save the money. Pay the
piper and buy the extra seat.
</P>
<P>
   This year would be different. Besides paying for Samuel we
decided to pick a destination that had more activities than any
2-year-old could dream about but would also offer fun things for
adults. With a skim of the Internet we chose Nassau, just a quick
50-minute flight from Miami. Here we could see dancing flamingos,
swim with dolphins, and ride on an inner tube that plunged straight
through shark-infested waters.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about big resorts like the Day-Glo-colored
Nassau Marriott Resort &AMP; Crystal Palace Casino is that they are
kid-friendly. Children under 12 eat free and there is a Kids Club
and a playground right on the beach. From our balcony overlooking
the massive pool and powder blue ocean, we saw 12 stingrays
floating like butterflies in the sea. Inside, there is a parrot
named Pistachio who likes to be fed grapes, and a video game room
that parents can see from tables in the Goombay Mama restaurant.
This allows parents to actually be able to chew their food while
the kids play nearby. Samuel loves the video driving games but
doesn't like the ones with guns. ``Too many boo-boos,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Our first outing was to the Ardastra Gardens Zoo and
Conservation Centre to see what are billed as the world's only
dancing flamingos. Dancing flamingos?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a secret how we get them to do it but they've been
dancing here since the 1950s and they do it for the applause,''
said trainer Dario Higgs. Kids are free but adults pay $10 each for
a mostly Third World zoo. But it is not without charm. A Bahamian
boa constrictor emerges from a white pillowcase and poses for
pictures around your neck, an anteater just wants to be hugged, and
peacocks stroll the pathways always looking over their feathers for
2-year-olds seeking to add another feather to their cap.
</P>
<P>
   The dancing takes place in a small open-air ampitheater where
the flamingos run in and parade left, right, and run on command.
This time of year is breeding season so some of the flamingos are
thinking about other things besides being pink Rockettes. The
birds, the announcer explained, are pink because of
keto-carotenoids, found naturally in microorganisms in their food.
None of the flamingos have names but all are banded with numbers.
Samuel immediately bonded with number nine. That was the flamingo
that refused to take orders.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we took a boat ride to Dolphin Encounters on Blue Lagoon
Island to swim with the dolphins. Samuel was able to feed a dolphin
and proclaimed himself ``Dolphin Boy.'' The only problem was that
Dolphin Boy didn't want his mother to get in the water with a
well-trained, well-bribed dolphin named Dot. The ``Swim with the
Dolphins'' encounter, which includes an educational lecture, then a
half-hour swim with the majestic mammals was the highlight of some
people's lives, let alone vacations. For $129 you get kissed by a
dolphin, dance with a dolphin, get splashed by a dolphin, and have
a dolphin leap 10 feet over your head. For the grand finale, Dot
the dolphin pushes you across the lagoon at motorboat speed. Samuel
cried the whole time, worried what Dot would do to his mom.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphin Encounters is a photo opportunity paradise. But if you
are too busy with your 2-year-old to shoot much film, don't worry.
Somebody at Dolphin Encounters is videotaping the experience ($49)
or shooting the dolphin kiss ($30 for 8x10 framed or on a key chain
for $5. For those on a tighter budget, a shorter dolphin encounter
is offered for $49. Here, conservation is preached but capitalism
is practiced. The boat for the 20-minute return to Nassau doesn't
come until everybody has a good half hour in the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop on the Anti-Terrible-Two Tour was the Atlantis Hotel,
across a bridge from Nassau at Paradise Island. This mammoth
sand-castle-shaped hotel boasts the world's largest marine habitat,
second only to Mother Nature's.
</P>
<P>
   It also is the solution to dining with the 2-year-old. At the
cafe, which has huge picture windows lining the giant lagoons, we
ordered our waiter's recommendations _ Bahamian lobster lightly
battered and then fried to lock in the juices, and tender lamb
chops. We then went to The Dig.
</P>
<P>
   The Dig is an underwater replica of what life could have been
like 11,000 years ago on the lost continent of Atlantis. The Dig is
the antithesis of Boston's Big Dig; it is soothing and relaxing.
You walk through dark stone tunnels with nautical noises piped in
and marvel at some of the 40,000 live fish. The only traffic is a
group of lobsters crawling on a grating over your head.
</P>
<P>
   We returned to find dinner being kept warm. Bahamians may be the
politest, warmest people on earth. The waiter played with Samuel
and entertained us with stories about waiting on Michael Jackson,
Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neil, and John Starks. The biggest
tipper, he said, was the Shaq, Jordan autographed a Bahamian
dollar, and only Starks ordered desert. The food was excellent, and
there were 38 restaurants and lounges to try.
</P>
<P>
   We loved this hotel and came back the next day.
</P>
<P>
   For the big kids, there is a 100-step-high water slide that
takes you from the cliff of a replica Mayan Temple virtually
straight down at more than 30 miles per hour. Just when you feel
your stomach in your throat, you splash into a clear tunnel that
whisks you in a tube insulated by plexiglass through a lagoon of
sharks and then spits you out into a swimming pool. All this in a
couple of heart-throbbing seconds. You must be 48 inches tall or
have the IQ of a starfish to attempt this. ``I got water in places
I never had water before,'' said a laughing Jessica Stone, a
teenager from Buzzards Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Less spectacular but more popular is a similar waterslide ride
on an inner tube through the shark tank. After one or two Bahama
Mamas (the local rum drink specialty), some people thought the
sharks started looking strangely similar to people they worked
with.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 2-year-old is smart enough not to want to go on
these death-defying rides, there are plenty of other options.
Atlantis has 40 waterfalls and five fresh-water swimming areas,
including wading pools with tiny waterslides, to satisfy every
toddler. There also is a slow inner tube river ride, perfect for
mother and child to relax.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the walk-through predator lagoon where you are the
lowest part of the food chain. In the all-glass tunnel, the fish
are either next to you or above you. There is a saw tooth ray that
looks as if he went to the chainsaw section of Home Depot for
Christmas, and tons of sharks, sting rays, and 200 other species of
sea creatures.

750,000 WORDS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Oxford English Dictionary went on line earlier this month,
putting its contents _ 750,000 or so words, with etymologies,
pronunciations, timelines, and illustrative quotations from a
millennium's worth of sources _ at the fingertips of Netizens
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   This should be big news: The OED is more widely known than ever
before, thanks to two recent books about its creation. Simon
Winchester's ``The Professor and the Madman'' and K.M. Elisabeth
Murray's ``Caught in the Web of Words,'' a biography of her
grandfather, founding editor James A.H. Murray, brought the romance
and excitement of the enterprise's early years to an enormous
audience. So why has the hoopla been so restrained?
</P>
<P>
   Money is the likely answer. For all the OED's attractions,
there's not yet any cheap way to access it from your home computer.
The OED simply lacked the resources, spokeswoman Royalynn O'Connor
said, to fine-tune a consumer-friendly pricing structure _
pay-per-download, say _ so for now, the cost of an individual
subscription is a flat $550 per year. (Network subscribers
negotiate their own contracts, which start at $795 a year.)
</P>
<P>
   It's not a truly prohibitive price, given where so much of our
money goes; it's a movie ticket and a latte per week, say, or a
Tiffany trifle for Valentine's Day (and some of us would rather
have the dictionary than the Tiffany trifle). As the Wall Street
Journal calculated, you're paying only .0008593 cents per word _
hard to begrudge when the dictionary, for all its fame, has never
made a profit for Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
   Still, so many reference works are free online _ and so many
more allow subscribers to pay only for what they download _ that
$10.58 a week may sound steep to the recreational user. The OED
people seem confident, though, that most people will eventually be
able to get access, either free, through local library networks, or
through a refined subscription plan, as the online version evolves.
And one of the nicest proposals bouncing around the organization is
to offer free access on Sundays: If this world-circling
organization can decide on the boundaries of ``Sunday,'' crossword
addicts may find their lives much simplified.
</P>
<P>
   You can take a free tour of the site at www.oed.com, and see
what it might be worth to you. The experience is not likely to make
you nostalgic for the print version, unless book-lifting is part of
your training regimen. Here, if you turn to set (the plastering
term) and you're referred to rendering, you don't have to haul down
another six-pound volume _ you just click on the link, and there
you are. For bed, bath, and bus commuting, there is nothing like a
book, but for reference works, this is obviously the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   And the Internet version will be far easier to keep current _
for better or worse. Already it has Quentin Tarantino's ``I'm gonna
git Medieval on your ass,'' from ``Pulp Fiction'' _ though it seems
that the colloquial use of medieval to mean ``cruel, barbarous,''
was already a century old.
</P>
<P>
   Revisions will be posted quarterly, as the editors (who began
with M to Mah) work their way through the text, and around 2010 the
``finished'' product will be declared the third edition. But of
course, it won't stop there; when they finish with lyyn (an
obsolete form of the verb lie), it will be time to start all over
again with M, ``1. The letter, and the sound it represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Down for the count
</P>
<P>
   When the 2000 Census form arrived, I promptly filled it out _
excluding my college-age daughter, because the instructions on
answering Question 1 say ``DO NOT INCLUDE in this number: College
students living away while attending college.''
</P>
<P>
   But when I phoned to ask if she and her housemates had filled
out their form, she said no, they'd thrown it away. ``It came, but
it said not to list `college students living away while attending
college' '' _ which is what they are, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The census instructions on the Web site (if you can get there)
are far more detailed: They say clearly that you do list ``a
college student living at this residence during the school year.''
But someone condensed the thought one step too far _ and now, who
knows how many census forms are clogging the landfills of college
towns across the nation?

PUBLIC JOCKEYING INTENSIFIES ON GENE MAPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, biologists have traded accusations,
inflammatory documents have been leaked to the media, and the
seemingly abstruse question, ``Who owns the human genome?'' became
front page news across the country and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair were swept into the peculiar controversy over whether private
companies should be allowed to ``own'' pieces of the genetic
blueprint for an entire human being.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate is less futuristic than it sounds. By the end of
this year, competing public and private researchers predict they
will have read the full endowment of coded DNA instructions inside
every human cell _ in effect, the operating manual for a human
being.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just as science stands on the brink of what a U.S.-British
scientific declaration calls ``one of the most significant
intellectual achievements of all time,'' the researchers,
government officials and financial backers alike have begun
publicly jockeying for position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the California Gold Rush, where (companies) are
offensively patenting genes as quickly as possible,'' even if they
don't know exactly what the genes do, in an effort to preempt other
companies, said C. Frank Bennett, a vice president at Isis
Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Carlsbad, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The complete set of human DNA will reveal what goes wrong in
thousands of rare diseases _ and will show how genes contribute to
common killers like cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's. The
potential profits, as this newly found information gets translated
into safer and more effective drugs and treatments, are vast.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, both fortune and fame are at stake as the race for
the human genome enters the home stretch, pitting the decade-old,
public Human Genome Project against a two-year-old private upstart,
Celera Genomics. Negotiations aimed at combining their efforts
collapsed this month amid bitter disagreements over how their
genetic data would be released. The public program is releasing the
information daily, while Celera is providing it initially only to
subscribers, who pay millions of dollars for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, companies that aren't gathering the DNA
sequences but want to use it ``are cheering on the Human Genome
Project'' in its race against Celera, said Roy Whitfield, chief
executive officer of Incyte Genomics Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Many people suddenly seem baffled and outraged at how the
essence of humanity _ the DNA blueprint _ has become the genetic
equivalent of the Yukon Territory, with private biotech prospectors
staking patent claims right and left. One voice in opposition, the
Cambridge-based advocacy group, the Council for Responsible
Genetics, has been circulating a ``No Patents On Life!'' petition
denouncing the conversion of cells, genes and organisms ``into
corporate property.''
</P>
<P>
   The biotech companies lost $30 billion in value two weeks ago
when a call for free sharing of the basic DNA data by Clinton and
Blair was widely misunderstood. Many investors panicked because
they thought the statement meant that genes couldn't be patented _
and companies, as a result, would be unable to make money from
them. In fact, nothing had changed: Genes remain patentable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For patients awaiting therapies and cures for deadly disease,
there is hardly a more important issue than patents, because
without patents, private-sector research'' leading to gene-based
medicines ``will be very, very limited,'' said Chuck Ludlam, vice
president for government relations for the Biotechnology Industrial
Organization, or BIO.
</P>
<P>
   Patents allow their holders a 20-year monopoly on developing
commercial applications from their ``invention,'' but patents do
not confer ownership on it. That distinction is little comfort to
those who oppose gene patents in principle.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA in the genes, argued BobFranza, a biologist at
Washington University in St. Louis, is a product of evolution, not
of man. To patent it, he said, ``is an act of arrogance beyond
anything I can imagine.'' Lanza agreed that the tools and computer
software used in analysis should be patentable _ but not the DNA
itself.
</P>
<P>
   While this feeling may be widespread, US patent policy has been
that even living things can be patented, ever since the US Supreme
Court upheld a company's patent application for a genetically
modified bacterium in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A major cause of the present controversy and confusion is that
the genetic information being decoded in the genome project can
exist in two different forms, only one of which can be protected by
patents.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``raw sequence'' is the genome's entire string of
3.2 million chemical units, or base pairs, that encode genetic
instructions. Ninety percent of this sequence is nonsense code: The
genes, each of which carries the code to make a single protein, are
interspersed among the nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Patent policy says this genomic raw sequence is not an invention
but a purely natural substance, and can't be patented.
</P>
<P>
   So the answer to ``Whose genome is it?'' is ``The genome belongs
to everbody,'' said John Doll, head of biotechnology patenting at
the US Patent and Trademark Office.
</P>
<P>
   The genes, however, once isolated and purified and removed from
their natural context, can be patented. In the public debate, this
distinction often has been lost, leading to confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people now believe that human genes are not
patentable,'' Doll said. ``That's simply not true.'' And, he said,
the Patent and Trademark Office has issued hundreds of patents for
human genes, and there are thousands of applications pending.
</P>
<P>
   But the gene-patent controversy is not so easily quenched. If
genes can be patented, biotech prospectors want to know, what about
pieces of genes?
</P>
<P>
   A patented invention has to show ``utility' _ that is, its
purpose. And companies and universities have filed for patents on
fragments of genes whose function they don't know, or they have
made an educated guess of the function based on computer algorithms
that search for similarity to known gene functions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, leaders of US and British scientific organizations
warned that allowing patents at such an early stage of knowledge
``does not serve society well.'' Bruce Alberts, president of the
National Academy of Sciences, and Aaron Klug, president of the
Royal Society of London, said in a statement that such patent
applications shouldn't be allowed because they are, ``in effect,
laying claim to a function of use that does not yet exist,'' and
benefits only the companies' shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The US Patent Office already has taken steps to ``raise the
bar'' on gene patents. It has proposed a set of guidelines
requiring that patent-seekers show ``real-world utility'' of the
gene sequences on which they seek protection. The public comment
period on the guidelines ended last week: The biotech industry
filed comments generally supporting the rules but is having some
differences, said Ludlam.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the war of words between Celera and the government
genome project continued _ with a polite interlude when Celera and
a consortium of university scientists announced they had jointly
read out the entire DNA sequence of the fruit fly, Drosophila
melanogaster. That collaboration was successful, and showed that
Celera's aggressive system of DNA sequencing _ called ``whole
genome shotgun'' _ was powerful and accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Celera, armed with hundreds of supercomputers, is using that
same method as it speed-reads the human genome: By the end of last
week, the company claimed to have read about 95 percent of the
genome. The entire genome has to be sequenced several times,
though, for best accuracy. Some of Celera's data was taken from the
public database after it was sequenced by the public Human Genome
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Celera president J. Craig Venter, in an opinion essay in the
Wall Street Journal, reiterated his position that the company won't
release genomic raw sequence data publicly until it has completed
the project. The company's business plan, he said, was to recoup
some of its ``hundreds of millions of dollars'' of investment by
charging for access to the sequence information.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike some other companies, Celera is not going to try to
patent large numbers of genes, said J. Paul Gilman, director of
policy planning. It will concentrate on only 200 to 300 genes it
believes will be medically valuable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ludlam, of the BIO trade organization, said that it will take
decades or even hundreds of years to turn all the insights from the
human genome project into health benefits. Given this viewpoint, he
said, the current acrimony seems trivial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people standing at the starting line and squabbling
about a two-step lead in a 90-mile race,'' he said. ``It's
ridiculous.''

OPTIONS ABOUND IN BELIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINT PLACENCIA, Belize _ From eagles in Alaska to emus in
Australia, my wife and I have crossed the globe to see animals in
their natural habitats. Which is why we were deep in the Monkey
River rain forest, listening to the harsh barks of howler monkeys
in the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide, a burly Belizian named Terry, slapped the sides of
those trees with the flat side of a Guatemalan machete, all the
while shouting, ``HOO! HOO! HOO!'' The noise did it: He had
``charmed'' the monkeys out of the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Howling and scattering, the large, long-tailed, bearded
creatures moved from branch to branch, sometimes in groups of a
half-dozen or more, sometimes with babies among them.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the monkeys (and hearing their seal-like voices) was a
highlight of our animal-viewing, but hardly the only one. During
our four-day stay on the Placencia peninsula, located on the
Caribbean coast of southern Belize, we also saw: brightly colored
fish, pelicans, sea eagles, parrots, heron, toucans, iguanas, a
snoozing crocodile, and even a glimpse of a manatee.
</P>
<P>
   And along with the creatures came creature comforts, at a deluxe
20-room beachfront resort called the Inn at Robert's Grove, built
in 1997 by a couple of New Yorkers who thought it was time for a
change in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Belize, the only English-speaking country in Central America,
has long been known for its excellent snorkeling and scuba-diving.
But, as we discovered, it is also a haven for ecotourism and other
``soft'' adventures, with its rain forests, preserves, trails, and
acres of unspoiled land. And Placencia is probably the most
unspoiled section of this nation of 216,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But adventures aren't for everyone. If you're averse to the
possibility of getting wet, dirty, or muddy, if you dislike wearing
sunscreen and bug spray (sometimes lots of it), and if you're not
up for sometimes strenuous excursions and bumpy rides on land and
sea, you may be happier with a different kind of vacation. My wife,
for instance, concluded that although she enjoyed the animals and
the inn, all the excursions were not for her. I, on the other hand,
participated in every adventure, feeling hardy _ or is that
foolhardy?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I had something to prove. We were in Belize celebrating
both our 33d anniversary and my rapidly approaching birthday, which
would take me into the last year of my 50s. Damned if I was going
to let the passing of time slow me down!
</P>
<P>
   This was a resort-centered vacation, in that all of our
excursions began from the resort and most were conducted by Roberts
Grove boat captain Herman Pollard. In our four days there, we had
three adventures. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Adventure one: snorkeling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our destination was Laughing Bird Caye National Park, one of the
best snorkeling areas in Belize. Getting there involved a
rip-roaring, 12-mile motorboat ride, with Herman at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Despite clouds overhead, the snorkeling was fine, with
blue-and-yellow fish predominating and bright coral formations
waving beneath us. In addition, pelicans and sea eagles flew about
as we walked through the small park, stopping to admire an
accumulation of sea shells on a picnic table. (A sign asks you to
take only memories.)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of picnics, we had a tasty one, packed by Herman and
accompanied by the local brew, Belikin Beer. Afterward, he took his
group to inspect a haven for dozens of hermit crabs of all sizes,
some walking around naked while searching for a new shell. One wag
labeled the creatures Herman's Hermits.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the inn's snorkeling trips include two other stops,
and one of them can be the largest barrier reef in the Western
Hemisphere. But the weather was iffy this November afternoon. So
after an extended stay at the national park, we headed back,
stopping at a waterfront village that is typical of what you'll
find in Placencia: a laid-back town with dirt roads and a few shops
and restaurants. You'll also find, here and elsewhere in the
nation, some of the friendliest residents anywhere, whose lilt and
attitude are decidedly Caribbean-flavored. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Adventure two: the rain forest &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day's trip began with a boat ride up the winding Monkey
River, surrounded by forest. Once we were on land, Herman turned us
over to local guides Terry and Brian, who led us along a precut
trail in the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   It was raining in the rain forest, which to me seemed more like
a jungle, what with the thick vegetation and monkey howls. If
Tarzan had swung by on a vine, I wouldn't have been overly
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   We walked along the trail, made muddy by the rain, past bright
orange mushrooms, strangler figs, bamboo, gumbo limbo, and
tearcoats _ prickly plants that are so named because if you walk
too close to them they'll tear your coat or anything else you're
wearing. Toucans hopped in the trees, and the spiny-backed iguanas
(known locally as bamboo chicken) looked positively prehistoric. On
the ground was a jaguar print, but its owner wasn't present.
</P>
<P>
   Following the walk, we stopped in the tiny town of Monkey River
for a local lunch, which means that in addition to such dishes as
fresh fish or stewed chicken, it included Belize's national staple,
beans and rice, and Marie Sharp's Habanero Pepper Sauce was always
within reach.
</P>
<P>
   The boat ride back brought more animal sightings, including a
crocodile who appeared to be sleeping blissfully by the river bank.
In open water, Herman stopped the boat until we caught a glimpse of
a manatee surfacing. It was about this time that those who had
shunned bug spray began to regret their decision. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Adventure three: the jaguar preserve &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our final trip was conducted by David Vernon, who runs an outfit
called Toadal Adventure. And for me, this was the trip's most
exciting episode.
</P>
<P>
   The destination was the Cockscomb Jaguar Preserve, a ride of
more than an hour in a four-wheel-drive vehicle over unpaved,
rose-colored dirt roads, with a drive by a banana plantation. And
while we hadn't expected to see jaguars strolling about, we did
enjoy the story of how they were caught. Originally, a pig was
placed in a wooden cage. But after dining on the pig, the jaguars
would munch on the cage to free themselves. So metal cages were
substituted, with a barrier inside that also preserved the pig.
</P>
<P>
   The Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary (the official name of the
jaguar preserve) is also home to more than 250 species of birds and
other creatures, so a walk in the forest is part of the trip. Our
guide showed us plants that, when touched, close up and sway away
from you.
</P>
<P>
   But the real attractions were yet to come. After a picnic lunch
(and another good one at that), most of the group headed to the
river for a tube float. This consists of sitting semi-upright in a
small, inflated tube and paddling your way down the river. For me,
the float began smoothly _ I felt as if I were on a theme-park
ride. But on a theme-park ride, when you head for an obstacle it
miraculously moves away at the last second. Not so here. Despite my
paddling, the current introduced me to a number of branches hanging
over into the river.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was fun, and so was the next part of our adventure . .
. when it was over, that is. This portion consisted of a 1 1/2-mile
walk to a glorious natural waterfall. For an initiation, our guide
instructed us to swim beneath the 20-foot-high waterfall and let
the water beat on our backs.
</P>
<P>
   And so we did. But the next part involved sliding down smooth
boulders, with water rushing over them, into different sections of
the river. For me, this was a strenuous, sometimes heart-thumping
exercise, with some deep drops into the next water level. At least
three times, I thought we were done, only to find another drop
looming. One of them required a leap that sent me far underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I was wet and bug-bitten, apparently from not using
enough spray. But I was also exhilarated and proud. Take that, time
in thy flight! &QL; 
 &QL; 
Back at the inn &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After such adventures, there was nothing nicer than changing
into dry clothes and relaxing at the inn. Relaxation, after all, is
what inspired the inn in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   For Robert and Risa Frackman of New York City, opening the
resort was a major lifestyle change. He was a land developer and
she was a public relations executive. But, says Risa Frackman, ``It
was time for something new.'' In 1994, they visited Belize for the
first time and decided they (and their two springer spaniels)
preferred peaceful Placencia over other areas. Originally, they had
planned to build just a beach house for themselves, but in 1997
decided to construct a two-room inn. From there, plans mushroomed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Inn at Roberts Grove sits on eight acres of land and
contains three white-stucco, red-roofed hacienda-style buildings
housing 20 beachfront or beachview rooms, which have a mix of
colonial and Central American decor, terraces, full baths,
king-sized beds, and both air conditioning and ceiling fans. Among
amenities are a 50-foot beachfront pool, the beach itself, a tennis
court, bicycles, boats, and _ ahh! _ rooftop Jacuzzis from which
you can watch the sun set. A new addition is an on-site dive
center. The price, starting from $100 a night for two in summer and
$150 in winter, is perhaps half of what comparable luxury lodging
would cost at more ``mainstream'' Caribbean destinations. And in
addition to snorkeling, trekking, and diving adventures, there are
fishing excursions and visits to Mayan ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Night life doesn't glitter in Placencia, although the bar scene
is reportedly lively on Friday nights. So I was content to unwind
at the inn's lounge, where bartender Franz Ramirez mixed perfect
pina coladas and rousing rum punches while letting us in on the
local goings-on. I thought the strips of flour tortillas used as
bar snacks were so delicious that they should be sold in bags.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, meanwhile, consists of a 50-seat dining room and
a variety of international and Caribbean dishes, including fresh
seafood, steak, and conch fritters. The Caribbean lobster was
tasty, but for me it will never top the New England variety.
</P>
<P>
   The Placencia area is dotted with inns and resorts _ some
simple, some stylish _ for people seeking this kind of unspoiled
vacation. (The irony, of course, is that the more buildings that go
up, the less unspoiled the destination becomes.) Near the Inn at
Roberts Grove, we dined one night at another nice resort, Luba
Hati, whose restaurant specializes in Mediterranean cuisine with a
Caribbean touch. My favorite: the calaloo soup, a kind of
black-bean concoction.
</P>
<P>
   When we returned home, I found that because of those insidious
insects, I was still itching. But I was also itching for more
Belize-style adventures.

   Relax _ we're talking about marine glowworms. When the wee
creatures mate, they light up the waters of the Turks and Caicos
Islands. Theirs is an elaborate ritual, lasting 15 minutes and
involving a zig-zag dance by the male as he searches for the eggs,
which pulsate with a great green luminescence.
</P>
<P>
   This natural light show takes place every month, around three to
six nights after the full moon and 50 minutes after sunset. The
romantic rendezvous, which involves hundreds of the glowing
critters, occurs off the shores of Providenciales, or Provo for
short, the main visitors' island of the Turks and Caicos.
</P>
<P>
   A Glow Worm Cruise, which includes a beverage and conch
fritters, costs $49 a person. For information or reservations, call
Sail Provo at 649-946-4783. For more information about the Turks
and Caicos, call 800-241-0824 or visit

making a tea of tichimai and salt to ease headaches; boiling glory
cedar with epson salts to help you relax; boiling dried sour soup
leaves with water to combat insomnia; and combining braden and

SWIMMING WITH THE HIPPOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe _ Are that big-mouthed, loud-larynxed
hippo's tonsils pink? Or is it just the setting sun reflecting off
the water into its face?
</P>
<P>
   We are not going to get close enough to find out. Sure, this is
one of those creatures that seemed so lovable as portrayed in Walt
Disney's ``Fantasia,'' decked out in tutus and gavotting sweetly to
the ``Waltz of the Flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   However, you do not want to cruise up to massive chinside to
check tonsils by applying a tongue suppressor and coaxing, ``Say
aaahhh, please.'' No. When a hippo snorts, ``Aaahhh!'' as this one
is doing without any prompting, it shivers the timbers of any
foolishly really-up-close boat, and threatens passengers' eardrums,
at the least.
</P>
<P>
   These are bad-tempered water dudes, says the skipper of our
25-foot craft that seems so frail in the presence of a plenty-ton
Zambezi River hippopotamus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is close enough,'' says Larry Munkombwe at the wheel of
the flat-bottomed power boat that is idling about 100 feet from the
protruding gray head and shoulders of a resident monster. ``They
are very dangerous. Hippos are responsible for several thousand
human deaths a year in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't swim, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they run on the bottom, and they run very fast. This one
has popped up for air. But they can stay under for quite a time,
and they like to tip over boats. They account for a lot of
drownings. He could overturn us, so we'll keep our distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hippos are vegetarians with no taste for human beings, Mukombwe
says. ``But they can mangle and stomp you to death, knock you
around badly if they catch somebody on land. They look ponderous,
but are deceptively fast for a short distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Beside us four hooded eyes appear like floating Ping-Pong balls,
behind two snouts. A pair of crocodiles are watching us watching
the hippo. They would love the hippo to play bump-the-boat and
force a turnover. Crocs aren't squeamish or fussy about people
flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Mukombwe says sadly, ``Just this  &UR; morning  &LR; a guy fishing on the
bank, not far from here, was eaten by a crocodile. I knew him.
People saw it. The croc came out of the river so fast, got behind
the guy, and forced him into the water. It was over quick. Never go
swimming or wading in the Zambezi. This river has more crocs per
100 meters than any place else in the world. They're bigger _ maybe
15 feet, almost 600 pounds _ and more aggressive than your American
alligators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody told us,'' says Marie Jowett, an Englishwoman, ``this
boat ride is one of the most peaceful things you can do. But we're
being shadowed by crocodiles, maybe undermined by hippos . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just stay in the boat and relax. Have a beer,'' says the
skipper, laughing. ``You'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right, and Zambezi brand beer is very good.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; evening &LR;  Jet Boat Cruise is a relatively recent addition to
the Zambezi scene, a different look at this goliath of a river.
Most visitors see the Zambezi from another direction and in its
most agitated state _ toppling over a 300-foot cliff as steaming,
storming, stupendous Victoria Falls, a mile-plus-wide stretch of
wild, wilfully, wondrous water.
</P>
<P>
   But up here, above the freefall frenzy, the mighty 1,700-
mile-long Zambezi is easy, olive drab-hued, loafing along on its
way to cataclysm amid cataracts. As a World Heritage area, this
sector still leads a sheltered life much as it was when the
Scottish missionary-explorer David Livingstone followed the river
and the tall tales he'd heard from natives to the tall Falls in
1855, christening it for his queen, Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy bush lines the banks. Wandering elephants are crazy about
the the fruit of the lala, palm trees that impersonate starbursts.
Small grassy islands, lily pads, hyacinths of white and purple
punctuate the flow. Away from the mainstream, the river cuts
through forested tracts, creating mysterious corridors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are tour boats, large and not very
maneuverable, offering excursions-with-meals. But the shallow draft
Jet Boats, which can travel through rapids and in depths of mere
inches, skittering like water bugs, are the fun. And it's soon
clear to his five passengers that Larry Munkombwe knows his river
and his vehicle intimately. He's not going to let the monitoring
crocs or hippos get us.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating controlled brinksmanship, he steers among
crosscurrents, eddies, rocks, swerving through white water toward
Devil's Cataract, the west end of the falls, to within 100 yards of
the rim of no return: Victoria's downfall. The edge, a football
field away, has an innocent enough look that is contradicted by the
ominous rumble and clouds of mist. Long before Queen Victoria and
Livingstone, the local folks called it ``the smoke that thunders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No closer,'' Larry says with a smile. Nobody wants to go over
this falls in a barrel or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Now the return voyage from the precipice turns serene, placid,
blood-pressure-lowering as the sun lowers, too, signaling quitting
time. Time to go home. More hippos appear in water turned
tangerine. They look friendlier, belching and waving goodbye by
wiggling their ears.
</P>
<P>
   But they are upstaged by a blizzard of egrets. It is avian rush
hour. Open-boot storks seek their trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they deliver babies here, too?'' wonders Marie Jowett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course _ but black babies,'' quips ebony-faced Larry.
</P>
<P>
   A dense flock of black ibises, crying like babies, speeds toward
a waterberry tree on an island that they share with snowy egrets,
creating a harlequin pattern of black and white. Flurries of
black-masked-yellow-feathered weaver birds return to the fuzzy
nests they've loomed, which hang from trees like Christmas
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Larry takes us into a sidestream, a gloomy hallway of another
birdy rooming house, that evokes Joseph Conrad's ``Heart of
Darkness.'' Then he pulls up against the shore, saying, ``I want to
show you something special. Just a short walk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's all been special,'' say Marie's husband, Bill Jowett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very proud of this,'' he says, nodding upward. Suddenly
we realize that the branches above belong to an endless tree: an
ancient, wrinkled, twisted baobab. ``It's also a walk to go around
the trunk _ 65 feet. It's 100 feet tall and 1,700 years old. We
would like to see it up against one of your American redwoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but I didn't bring one.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the boat we are overcome by the light show of dusk. The
river is aflame, the sky tinted champagne, smoky blue, rose, lilac.
</P>
<P>
   It's that way until he docks and helps us off. Thanks, Larry.
The hippos and crocs didn't get us _ but the Zambezi did.

A LOW-KEY HOLIDAY AT ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS CAMPGROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD PENNINGTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOHN, Virgin Islands _ When I learned that E27 was my cabin
assignment, I laughed. Carrying my bags up 200 stairs should not be
considered a hardship, I thought, in light of the fact that I was
on one of the most indisputably beautiful islands in the world.
From experience _ this was my fourth visit to the camp _ I knew
that I'd be refreshed and in the water by noon the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentally conscious Maho Bay Campground, established
in 1976, is built on the side of a tall hill within the confines of
the Virgin Islands National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The 114 tent-cabins are made of heavy canvas and mosquito
netting, and sit on stilts _ some people call them ``tree houses.''
Each 16-foot-square unit has a small deck that usually affords a
good view of the blue-green bays below the camp. Jungle separates
one cabin from another. Stairs and wooden walkways connect the
cabins _ there are no roads to your front door.
</P>
<P>
   To get to E27, I followed a route that says something about the
fauna found on the island: I walked along the Crab Ramble,
proceeded to Lizard Lane, then Pea Hen Parkway and Morning Dove
Pass, finishing at the Lost Donkey Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I fell asleep as I listened to two women in the next tent
sing a lovely pop song _ I had been up all the night before
worrying that a nor'easter would cause cancellation of my flight
from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Mary, joined me later. We like to call the camp
``Cambridge in the Jungle'' because it tends to attract a somewhat
bookish crowd. Almost every night a lecture is offered at the
pavilion, but that doesn't stop college-educated people from
playing ``Go Fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests are instructed to listen to their music with headphones,
and the only live music permitted is an occasional night concert.
As a result, quiet prevails much of the day. Privacy is respected
but camaraderie among guests is common.
</P>
<P>
   Children are as plentiful as the bananaquit birds, and no age
group seems to be missing. The camp is host to yoga and
environmentalist groups.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 species of tropical birds breed on the island. The
camp pea-hens are all named Gertrude. Determined pelicans cruise
along the beaches, diving for fish. More than 800 species of trees,
shrubs, flowers, and other plants cover the island.
</P>
<P>
   Maho days have their routines. There's coffee at 7 in the
pavilion. We clean our swimming goggles so that they are as clear
as the Caribbean air. We place buckets of water in the sun for a
warm afternoon shower.
</P>
<P>
   St. John has 39 beaches: some sandy, some pebbled, some rocky.
We visit a beach a day, transported on corkscrew-like roads by one
of the many island trucks fitted with bench seats and canopies. We
travel as light as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon we read and rest, and in the starlight we
walk to a deserted beach. In the distance the giant island of St.
Thomas lights up the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Some of St. John's best beaches are those closest to the camp.
Big Maho Bay, whose shore is shaded by coconut palms and seagrape
trees, is just a short walk down the Donkey Trail. Francis Bay,
with its long sandy beach and hiking trail, is in the other
direction. Many visitors to the camp spend their first day walking
to the nearby Annaberg sugar plantation ruins and Waterlemon Bay,
passing a large mangrove swamp. (Beyond that lies the Johnny Horn
Trail, which leads to Coral Bay on the other side of the island _
an interesting hike.)
</P>
<P>
   Trunk Bay, several bays down the coast from Maho, is considered
one of the finest beaches in the world, but for years we stayed
clear of it. Hundreds of thousands of people go there every year,
mostly shipped in from cruises. A much-hyped underwater trail is
one attraction. When I swam there, I found it difficult maneuvering
through the clusters of swimmers. While Trunk Bay does have
wonderful sand, Jumbie Beach, next door, is as secluded as Trunk is
overpopulated.
</P>
<P>
   Mary worries as I swim away to islands or around rocky
headlands. Most people prefer to hover over a small section of
coral, but I prefer to see much quickly. I search for green and
hawksbill turtles. I'm likely to encounter silver tarpon, orange
spotlight parrotfish, schools of blue tang, and odd-looking
trunkfish. When snorkeling, I do everything I can to stay clear of
the island's fragile coral.
</P>
<P>
   The camp activities desk offers excursions to every part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 I circled the island on the Cinammon Bay, a 42-foot
wooden motor yacht that was once owned by Laurence Rockefeller.
When we dived into Brown Bay we encountered a large green (and
harmless) nurse shark who lurked between two large coral
formations, slowly moving its tail.
</P>
<P>
   This time Mary and I sailed on the High Country, a 42-foot
gaff-rigged ketch with dark orange sails. We crossed the Francis
Drake Channel, passing Great Thatch island, on our way to Jost Van
Dyke, one of the British Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   We visited Foxy's Bar, ordering chicken roti (a boneless curried
chicken/potato mixture rolled in a chapati shell), and a painkiller
(rum, pineapple and orange juice, creme of coconut, topped with
freshly grated nutmeg). At noon the party had already started. Foxy
sang impromptu songs, told incorrect jokes and imaginative stories.
One song rhymed Ulysses Grant and hair transplant. A book about
Foxy and Jost Van Dyke says that once there was a clock on the
island, but it broke.
</P>
<P>
   The bar has a pleasantly rowdy crowd of yachtspeople from
morning to night. Jost Van Dyke has just a couple hundred
inhabitants _ a legendary four cars and four bars. Its Great
Harbour is filled with fine yachts.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week we grabbed a ride with Hamilton Eugene to the
head of the Reef Bay Trail on Centerline Road. The walk down the
cool, dark jungle path eventually led to the sea. We were sheltered
from the sun by tall mango, bay rum, silk cotton, genip, and thorny
lime trees. Some trees support massive termite nests.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way we stopped near a small waterfall to view ancient
petroglyphs, mostly primitive faces carved by Arawak, Carib
Indians, or African slaves. A nearby plaque read, ``Around a pool
are strangler figs and the greenish fruit of the black calabash
tree . . . grey green bromelaids resembling pineapple cling among
tree branches. Razor grass fringes pool and small Christmas orchids
sometime bloom on the rocky cliffs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the trail was Lameshur Bay _ a welcome sight
because as we walked we became progressively exposed to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the week I rented a kayak at the camp's dive shop
and paddled to Whistling Cay. When I snorkel I prefer deep water:
the canyons below the surface. I circled the island and after an
hour was relieved to see the kayak again, especially so after
spying a large barracuda hovering in the water nearby.
</P>
<P>
   We find that traveling around the islands is free of stress
because everything seems so well organized. And we prefer to
vacation in a place that respects nature. The Maho management
actually discourages guests from renting cars.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we will return to St. John, and someday may surpass author
John Steinbeck, who visited the island nine times.

ADS GALORE NOW PLAYING AT A SCREEN RIGHT NEAR YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take an elevator ride in downtown Boston these days and you're
likely to see a video screen flashing news and a five-day weather
forecast _ along with commercials for restaurants and temporary
employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in line at the convenience store, you might see a stock
market update and get a flashy color advertisement for discount
brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   At the gas pump, get sports scores and an ad for a new Buick.
</P>
<P>
   Now that consumers have mastered the mute button on their TV
remote controls, marketers have begun to exploit the minutes in a
day when they have consumers' undivided attention. Video screens,
each playing a two- to three-minute loop of news and commercials,
are going up across the country at the rate of nearly 100 a day.
And with a handful of companies dreaming up novel places to put
them, even restroom stalls are not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for all those moments when people have nothing
better to do than stare at the tops of their shoes,'' said Tom
Pugliese, chief executive of Minneapolis-based Next Generation
Network, which has installed about 6,000 ``Ebillboards'' across the
country, including 350 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has created a fast-growing category in advertising
known as ``digital out-of-home.'' As the economy roars and
companies compete for ever-more-expensive advertising spots on TV,
radio, and billboards, many have begun looking for alternatives.
Promoters of the new medium say the sudden proliferation of
commercial video screens has been further fueled, ironically, by
the clutter of traditional ads people are subjected to every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have become really good at filtering,'' Pugliese said.
``The trick is to get to them when they're ready to tune in, not
when they're tuning out. If you're standing in line at the
convenience store, it's either watch the back of the head of the
guy in front of you or look at one of our screens. People actually
appreciate it. It's useful and it's entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   While advertisers have flocked to the new medium, companies are
not yet sold on the effectiveness of the ads, which are typically a
fleeting 10 seconds of video or come in the form of banner ads
displayed across the bottom of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is ready to bet the farm,'' said Tobe Berkovitz, a
communications professor at Boston University. ``Just because
people are looking at the screen in an elevator doesn't mean
they're processing the information emotionally or cognitively. Only
time will tell whether these ads are sticking in people's minds or
whether the video screen is just a way to avoid eye contact with
other people in the elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   But advertisers are hungry for more effective ways to reach
elusive markets _ especially 20- to 30-year-olds, who watch less TV
and don't read newspapers as often as older consumers. Since the
commercials that run on the screens are fed over the Internet to
each individual location, they can target audiences and tastes with
specificity. Elevators in office towers, for example, are prime
spots for restaurant ads aimed at corporate lunchers. And Internet
sites have found almost instant response in elevators.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people get to their desks, they log on to their computer
and check out the site they just saw advertised a minute before on
the elevator,'' Berkovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if advertisers' theories about consumers' willingness to
respond to these ``untapped time'' ads proves to be wrong, there is
little doubt people watch them.
</P>
<P>
   At 150 Federal St. in Boston where screens _ flashing news,
trivia, weather reports, traffic conditions and, of course,
commercials _ were installed in elevators late last year, office
workers say they home in on the 12-inch panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I forget to get off at my stop,'' one worker said
earlier this week, nearly missing her floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to do,'' said Bill Mahr of Hartford Insurance
Group, who says he watches but doesn't pay much attention. ``I
mean, you are stuck in an elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups conducted by Next Generation Network and other
companies found viewer attention riveted on the screens for the 2
1/2 minutes of the average elevator ride and checkout line wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, there's nothing else to do but watch,'' Pugliese
said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a reason the screens have not only become popular with
advertisers, but also with convenience store companies, who say the
screens at their counters distract customers from the fact that
they are waiting in long lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come to convenience stores want to get in and out
quickly,'' said Margaret Chabris, a spokeswoman for Dallas-based
7-Eleven Inc., which has video screens near the checkout counter in
stores across the country, including 102 in the Boston area. ``But
if they happen to find themselves in a line, they get some
entertainment, and time passes more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising time in elevators or any other place where people
are trapped for short periods is seen as so potentially lucrative
that companies, including the Canadian firm Thinc Ideas and North
Carolina-based ATM/Rio Net, have sprung up to capitalize on it,
trying out places like ATM kiosks and movie theater lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Next Generation Network, which is about to go public with a $115
million stock offering, said it is already reaching 40 million
consumers annually. And it has signed agreements to install video
displays in some of the 1.2 million elevators maintained by Otis
Elevator Co., train platforms at the New Jersey Transit Authority,
and at checkout counters of Cumberland Farms and 7-Eleven
convenience stores. It also has struck deals with Shell Oil Co. to
put screens at gasoline station pumps. The company plans more than
10,000 installations during the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the craze, companies say they must take care in their
zeal to worm advertising into every corner of consumers' lives lest
they rebel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a line out there somewhere, and we have to be careful
not to cross it,'' Pugliese said.

MONEY-SAVING DEALS IN THE CARIBBEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a strange time to be thinking of the Caribbean. After all,
the time for the islands is winter, when it's cold and snowy. It's
then that those sunny isles beckon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, is also the time to think about a Caribbean
vacation. The reason is simple: money-saving deals. Mid-April to
mid-December is off-season for the Caribbean, which means savings
of 15 to 50 percent on resort packages, and, in some cases, added
amenities to lure you to these sunny isles.
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe the Caribbean will be just too hot in
summer. It isn't. Temperatures range from 81 to 85, and it's the
dry season right into July. There's no fear of having a week's
vacation wiped out by rain as may happen along the US East Coast in
summer. The hurricane season does officially begin in July, but
most hurricanes don't appear until at least late August.
</P>
<P>
   At Bolongo Bay Beach Club &AMP; Villas on St. Thomas the resort has
a continental plan, which includes accommodations, daily breakfast
buffet, complimentary use of nonmotorized watersports, snorkle
gear, tennis, and nightly entertainment. In winter, the price is
$112.50 per person per night, and from April 24 through May 31, the
price is $87.50 a person and drops to $72.50 a person from June 1
through Sept. 30. Children under 12 receive all the features free.
Those who book seven nights also receive a complimentary sail and
beach outing to St. John, including lunch and open bar; a
$95-a-person value.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to save money on a Caribbean vacation is to stay at
an all-inclusive resort. For example, SuperClubs, with 13
properties on four islands and in Brazil, includes accommodations,
all meals, drinks, sports including equipment rental and
instruction, entertainment, recreational activities, taxes, and
airport transfers in one price. And no tipping is allowed. The
SuperClubs Breezes Golf &AMP; Beach Resort in Jamaica offers the only
golf school on the island. It has a 187-acre golf course. The
resort was awarded the Professional Association of Diving
Instructors Gold Palm Resort Certification and has added new dive
sites where several planes were sunk. ``We're reaching a lot of new
divers who've never had the chance to try it before. It's all
included, so why not try something new?'' said Cheddy Parchment,
resort general manager. For information on SuperClubs, call
800-467-8737 or visit www.superclubs.com.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the off-season things are happening. Many islands have
festivals throughout the year. In June, Grenada holds a Spice Jazz
Festival; St. Martin, an African Festival; St. Vincent, Carnival;
and in July, Barbados holds it Crop Over Festival; the Caymans, the
13th annual Taste of Cayman; the US Virgin Islands, the 34th Annual
Youth Games 2000 National Championships; and in August, Curacao
holds a Salsa Festival, and Antigua offers Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   One note of caution. Since the summer is a slower season in the
Caribbean, check to be sure that all the amenities you wish are
available and that the resort is not using the time to renovate.
Those changes could affect your vacation.
</P>
<P>
   For information on the islands, call 800-356-9999, ext. 799, and
request a free Caribbean Vacation Planner, a 168-page guide
covering 27 destinations with island maps, facts, figures, Web site
addresses and general information to help select a vacation
destination.

   Howard Johnson Hotels &AMP; Inns is giving away an all-expense-paid
four-night vacation in Puerto Rico for two to the winner of an
essay contest on favorite memories of a stay at a Howard Johnson
property. The contest celebrates the 75th anniversary of the brand.
``Late last year, the brand unveiled an exhibit in honor of its
namesake, Howard Dearing Johnson, at the Hospitality Industry Hall
of Honor in Houston. The exhibit contains physical reminders of the
brand's early years,'' said Mary Mahoney, president of Howard
Johnson International. Entrants should describe their fondest
Howard Johnson memory in 750 words of less. In addition to content,
creativity, and style, entries will be judged on how well they fit
with the brand's longstanding commitment to serving customers well,
offering solid value, and making guests feel at home. Entries may
be sent by mail to Howard Johnson Favorite Memory Sweepstakes, Box
5244, Parsippany, NJ 07054-6244 and be postmarked by May 1. Entries
may also be submitted to www.hojo.com. The Howard Johnson Co. was
founded in Quincy, Mass., and its restaurants soon were throughout
the country. Today few restaurants remain, but hotels bearing the
Howard Johnson name are found in more than 500 locations worldwide.

The Swissotel Boston's Cafe Suisse says it is the only restaurant

said David Gibbons, general manager of the hotel. ``But fondue is
the ultimate Swiss dining experience and a wonderfully creative way
to eat.'' The hotel's Fondue Festival is available through April.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street is out. Venture capital is in.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Marshall is living the transition. In August, she quit
her longtime gig as a high-profile stockbroker for Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. She pushed her Christian Dior suits to the
back of her closet and cut off her mane of curly hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the venture capital haircut,'' she says. No time for bad
hair while she's jetting around the country, raising $50 million
from investors. Marshall's Axxon Capital Inc. aims to invest in hot
young companies, especially those run by women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never lived in a time like this,'' says Marshall, who
started Axxon with a partner, Paula Groves. ``We think we are going
to make a ton of dough.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is part of a stream of talent leaving traditional
financial firms across the nation to ride the latest wave to
riches: venture capital. The money hotshots of the 1990s _
investment bankers, analysts, and stockbrokers to the wealthy _ say
financing upstarts in the high-flying technology industry is more
interesting and fulfilling than doing quick deals, and it allows
for closer relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But not one of them would have traded in their pinstripes for
khakis if the money potential weren't big. Really big.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're good at this, the upside is greater'' than
investment banking, says Ken Mabbs, the former chief of corporate
finance for First Albany Corp. in Boston. After 19 years of taking
high-tech companies public, he's launching a venture arm for the
investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists put money into young, private firms,
especially in the hot Internet, e-commerce, or telecommunications
sectors, in hopes of ultimately taking them public or selling them.
By contrast, investment bankers sell companies' shares to the
public and arrange mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All investment bankers want to be venture capitalists when
they grow up,'' Mabbs says. He told his boss, First Albany chairman
George C. McNamee, as much about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``George said, `Why don't you do it here?' '' Mabbs recalls. Now
the 46-year-old veteran of such IPOs as Plug Power Inc.,
Informatica Corp., and U.S. Web Corp. is raising a $125 million
fund for First Albany's fledgling FA Technology Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration of investment banking, Mabbs says, is that
dealmaking involves a string of transactions. They're short and
intense, and they end abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers live and breathe a client for several months, working
long hours and getting to know every detail of the business. They
spend a lot of time in airports, eat too much hotel food, and get
little sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they call you in the middle of the night and say they want
you to do 15 jumping jacks, you've got to do 15 jumping jacks,''
Mabbs says of banking clients. Then comes the IPO, or the merger,
and it's over. All that intimate knowledge goes out the window.
</P>
<P>
   That's a common complaint, says Alex Thomson, a recruiter with
Pendleton James Associates in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're deal junkies. They move from deal to deal, and in the
end, they don't own anything,'' he says. ``I can't tell you how
many of these guys tell me they want to own something.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall says the stock-peddling business lost its panache as
investors started buying stocks online. She hated the day-trading
mentality and wanted to get back to longer-term investing.
</P>
<P>
   One of her claims to fame was convincing clients in the early
1990s, before the Internet was ubiquitous, that American Online
Inc. would take off. Piles of profits later, she boasts a Rolodex
of loyal clients, many of whom are investing in Axxon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a history of making money in this town. I'm a careful
investor,'' Marshall says. ``I have the same instinctual feel for
companies that I did for stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the job requires more than instinct. While it's been
relatively easy, and quick, making money in venture capital over
the past couple of years, much of that has had to do with the hot
IPO market and the explosion of new businesses starting up around
the Internet and telecommunications. A failure to make smart
investments could be costly.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rao, the former chief executive of Chadwicks of Boston Ltd.,
is one of Marshall's longtime clients. He's investing in the first
Axxon fund, he says, because she helped him make money before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key ingredient, to me, is the people,'' Rao says.
``Sheryl's track record was a big plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall says she's got a large amount of her own money at stake
in the fund. And she's attracted big investors such as Citizens
Bank, John Hancock Financial Services, and State Street Bank _ no
easy task with a first-time fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising the fund is one of the hardest things I've ever done
in my life,'' says Marshall. At 50, she's got the energy of three
twenty-somethings, a prerequisite in the venture game. She's
constantly on the phone, in a cab, or on a plane. She's trying to
find the perfect cappuccino machine for her office, for those
all-important afternoon caffeine fixes. In January, she was home
only five nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate airplane food. I hate flying coach,'' she says. ``I
told my husband before I started this, `I'm going to be a very bad
wife for about nine months.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone in the business can relate. The hectic lifestyle isn't
terribly different from investment banking. Says FA's Mabbs:
``Choose your poison. They're both insane.'' Most venture
capitalists frequently miss dinner at home. And they've got what
many lightly refer to as an attention-deficit issue. They have an
uncanny ability to juggle dozens of plans, meetings, and
conversations in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   Those pressures don't seem to faze those who've tasted Wall
Street's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Kanter, managing director of DLJ in Boston _ and, as it
happens, Marshall's former boss _ is leaving his post after 17
years with the respected firm. He's starting a private-equity
partnership, Marathon Capital Group, which will include venture
capital investing as well as legal and financial advisory services.
</P>
<P>
   Some DLJ principles, but not the firm itself, are investing with
Kanter, he says. ``I don't want to be owned,'' he says. ``I want to
be fully independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Tobin, a 30-year-old principal at Battery Ventures in
Wellesley, epitomizes the new generation of venture capitalists. He
had started and sold a software company by 1995 and was looking for
a financial job. There were few openings in VC back then, he says,
so he became an investment banker for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated it,'' he says. ``It's a glorified sales business.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months later, he was at Battery. And it wasn't just about
money, he says. For Tobin, the draw was building longer-term
relationships with entrepreneurs, and helping to build companies.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bono of Weston Presidio Capital came to a similar
conclusion a year ago. He was the former co-head of mergers and
acquisitions at Tucker Anthony Inc., a Boston investment banking
firm. After 13 years as a banker, he wanted to be a principal, or
an owner, instead of an agent doing deals.
</P>
<P>
   He says the challenge was more intriguing for him than the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my former life, you could meet a company and it would be
clear very quickly if you could help them,'' Bono says. ``It's very
different to say whether you want to be an owner of that
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The brain drain from investment banking into venture is becoming
a huge problem for Wall Street firms. Thomson, the recruiter, says
the flow of IPOs and buyout deals has bankers busier than ever.
They're having to delve into the ranks of consultants and managers
of operating companies to find new blood. An MBA with just two or
three years' experience can command an $800,000 pay package,
Thomson says.
</P>
<P>
   At the business schools, MBAs are more interested in joining
dot-com companies or venture firms than Wall Street firms, a big
shift from the 1980s and mid-1990s. At Harvard Business School, 12
percent of the class went into venture capital last year, up 50
percent from 1997. Meanwhile, 10 percent went into investment
banking last year, down from 16 percent in 1997 and much higher
levels in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   In venture capital, Thomson says, ``the wealth finally rivals,
and in some ways surpasses, investment banking numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists are quick to point out that while
investments with sizzling IPOs can sometimes lead to returns in the
billions of dollars, those aren't the norm. What Wall Streeters
give up when they move into venture are those beefy paychecks and
bonuses. The big returns take longer to come to fruition, and they
depend heavily on a healthy stock market.
</P>
<P>
   These folks seem to thrive on that risk, even as they admit they
had it good in their former jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Says DLJ's Kanter: ``I`m going into the big abyss.''

COACH'S JOURNEY LEADS HIM BACK TO FINAL FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ When he was summoned to cut the last nylon
strands during Florida's net-cutting ceremony Sunday at the Carrier
Dome, where the fifth-seeded Gators had just defeated No. 3 seed
Oklahoma State, 77-65, to win the NCAA East Regional and a trip to
the Final Four in Indianapolis, it was with a sense of deja vu that
coach Billy Donovan triumphantly ascended to the top rung of the
stepladder.
</P>
<P>
   The prideful and purposeful steps he took were no different from
those he took 13 years ago in Louisville, Ky., where as a gutsy
point guard for coach Rick Pitino, Donovan helped lead Providence
College to an improbable 70-57 victory over Big East rival
Georgetown in the finals of the Southeast Regional and a berth in
the 1987 Final Four. Coincidentally, it was the same year the NCAA
vacated the tournament records of Marshall and Florida _ the two
schools Donovan would go on to coach.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Rockville Centre, N.Y., Donovan was a gym rat's gym
rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really dedicated my whole entire life to the game of
basketball,'' said Donovan, who came to Florida four years ago from
Marshall University, where he became the youngest head coach in the
nation and turned around the foundering Thundering Herd by going
35-20 in two seasons at Huntington, W.Va. ``As I've gotten older,
I've realized there's probably more things to life than basketball.
There's my wife and my kids, but when I was growing up and I was
younger, that's all I did. I just played ball all day long, and I
loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was first exposed to the game by his father, William, a
standout point guard at Boston College who graduated in 1962 as the
school's third-leading scorer. Donovan starred at St. Agnes High
School, where he led the Long Island powerhouse to a 51-5 record in
his final two seasons. On more than one occasion, he worried his
mother, Joan, by sneaking out of his bedroom late at night to steal
away a few hours of court time at St. Agnes, where the school
custodian eventually relented and finally gave Donovan his own key.
</P>
<P>
   ``True story,'' said Donovan's 59-year-old father, as he stood
on the Carrier Dome court and recounted the now famous story about
his son's school days. ``His mother and I went over to the gym and
found him there, and we were like, `Billy, do you have any idea
what time it is?' and he says, `I just lost track of time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was a story Donovan told over and over again in Louisville
with the nylon net draped around his neck, his heart bursting from
his Providence jersey and his hair a sweaty mop. Donovan was only
too happy to oblige hungry reporters because he had just fulfilled
every basketball junkie's hoop dreams by making it to the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   But that was 13 years ago, when he was a player. It seemed like
another lifetime. Another era. Another epoch. Another chapter in
Donovan's basketball diaries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Elite 8 to elite company
</P>
<P>
   Sunday he authored yet another chapter for the memoirs. In just
his fourth year as Florida's coach and sixth as a head coach,
Donovan stood at the top rung of his profession at the tender age
of 34, making him the third youngest coach ever to reach the Final
Four. He also became the sixth person in NCAA history to play and
coach in a Final Four, joining the illustrious company of Vic
Bubas, Dick Harp, Bob Knight, Bones McKinney, and Dean Smith.
</P>
<P>
   As Donovan stood atop the ladder, it was as though his amazing
transformation from a Long Island gym rat into a slick-haired, New
York-accented, Pitino protege had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt, as a player, in order for me to play at the
level I played at, obviously I had to be a student of the game,''
Donovan said. ``I love watching games as a basketball junkie, and I
still am. I mean, I love watching games. The one thing about the
NCAA tournament is that I don't get a chance to watch any of the
games, because I'm always watching film on upcoming opponents. I
love watching film. I love being at practice. I love being on the
floor with these guys, and I love trying to find innovative ways to
try to motivate them and try to bring out the best in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's really, really important to me,'' he
added. ``In life, very few people are fortunate to be able to do
something that they love, and I feel very privileged to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Donovan genuflected to the coaches who helped mold him _
from the recently deceased Joe Mullaney of Providence to high
school coach Frank Morris _ he said Pitino made the most indelible
impression on his career. It was, after all, Pitino who gave
Donovan his first coaching break by offering him a chance to leave
his job with an investment firm on Wall Street for a low-paying
graduate assistant's job at Kentucky in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Jim O'Brien, who replaced Donovan at Kentucky and also was an
assistant to Pitino on the Knicks when Donovan played for New York,
is well-acquainted with the young coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the coaching profession and you watched Billy
play for Rick at Providence, and saw what he was able to
accomplish, and how he turned his game around from a chubby kid to
a really great player in one year, you saw his work ethic and you
saw how he improved,'' said O'Brien. ``And he spent so much time
with Rick at Kentucky. You almost have to be brain dead not to
become a good coach with Rick because he gives so much
responsibility to his people. Billy has such a passion and a love
for the game of basketball and for teaching it. He also has proven
himself to be a tremendous recruiter. That's an unbeatable
combination. I don't think many people in the country are surprised
that Billy took the Florida program to the Final Four. They might
be a little surprised that it happened this soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to join Pitino at Kentucky, for all intents and
purposes, was like having Bill Gates ask you if you were interested
in getting in on the ground floor of an upstart software company
called Microsoft. For Donovan, it was a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a tremendous amount of respect for Coach Pitino and
certainly the opportunities he's afforded me as a player and
coach,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan had no sooner developed a reputation on Pitino's staff
at Kentucky for being a young go-getter with a tireless work ethic
and a voracious appetite for watching film when people all around
the Bluegrass State began drawing obvious comparisons with Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Some have even suggested Donovan has become a Mini-Me version of
Pitino by adopting many of his former mentor's coaching
philosophies and tactics. But what Donovan has done is to adapt
what he learned from Pitino. He took the same up-tempo, all-out
style of basketball that was played at Kentucky and branded it
``BillyBall'' at Florida, where it has become the perfect
complement to the ``Fun `N' Gun'' offense of football coach Steve
Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I got schooled by one of the best basketball
coaches around,'' Donovan said. ``But I am not him. I am my own
man. But it doesn't bother me one bit when I'm compared with him.
What he's done for me as a player and as a coach and as a person, I
wouldn't be here right now. So I'm not bothered in the least when
his name is brought up in the same breath as mine. It's a
tremendous honor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The highest recommendation
</P>
<P>
   And so when Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley sought a
successor to Lon Kruger, who left the Gators to take the job at
Illinois in 1996, the first person he contacted about Donovan was
Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know about the style of play, and he said nobody
knew it better,'' Foley said. ``Nobody knew Rick Pitino's style
better than Billy Donovan because he played in it and he coached in
it. He told me that he was a ferocious worker and a tireless
recruiter. I asked him about his character and integrity, and he
told me that Billy Donovan was going to go straight to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``His only concern was that we had patience with Billy, meaning
there was a lot to do with the program. That's why we gave him a
six-year contract right off the bat, because I wanted him to know
that we were committed to him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Foley returned to Gainesville, Fla., from an interview at
Donovan's home in Huntington, W.Va., sufficiently impressed by his
high level of energy and enthusiasm, he knew the Gators had found
their coach.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, had Mike Miller, one of four McDonald's All-Americans
Donovan lured to Florida. The Gators lured Miller away from such
established programs as Kansas and Kentucky. Initially, the
decision Miller wrestled with in leaving his home in Mitchell,
S.D., was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have Kansas and Kentucky, and then you have Florida,
who's going to pick Florida over those two schools?'' said Miller,
a 6-foot-8-inch sophomore forward who led the Gators in scoring as
a freshman (12.3 points per game) and again this season (14.3 ppg).
``But I believed so much in what Coach said that it made the
decision easy. People say, `How was it easy?' Well it just was. It
was easy for me.''

RUSSIAN PAIR LEFT OUT IN THE COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France _ She had been coughing and was worried about
getting bronchitis before the European Championships. So Elena
Berezhnaya got some pills from a New Jersey doctor, went to Vienna
last month, and won the pairs gold medal for Russia with partner
Anton Sikharulidze.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the phone rang with bad news from Moscow.
Berezhnaya's doping sample had come back positive for ephedrine,
and the Russian Federation was yanking her and Sikharulidze out of
the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened my eyes and made them like saucepans, and the same
did Elena,'' said legendary coach Tamara Moskvina, whose pupils
were shooting for a third straight title here. ``We thought cough
is not an important sickness. For 30 years, nobody paid attention.
But they said it was like doping and she is not eligible.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in skating history that a woman had tested
positive for a banned substance, and it will likely cost Berezhnaya
both her European title and a three-month suspension when the
International Skating Union council takes up her case here next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they will be sent to Siberia _ together with me,'' mused
Moskvina, who took the blame for Berezhnaya's mistake. ``Elena and
I always considered doping a great disgrace. We believe we are well
prepared and we can win without any help. The only special pills I
give them were artistry and psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many over-the-counter cold medications contain ephedrine,
Moskvina said she had never read the banned list and that
Berezhnaya hadn't thought to question the doctor or read the label.
``When you eat bread, do you know the ingredients of bread?''
shrugged Moskvina. ``You eat bread. She took a pill.''
</P>
<P>
   So the finality of the word `doping' hit her and Berezhnaya like
an uppercut. ``We think, ahh, we are criminals, everybody will
point fingers and say, `How can you do that?' '', Moskvina said.
``The whole day yesterday I was with her, looking for places where
we can jump out of the mountains and into the Mediterranean Sea.
Then we decide we did nothing wrong, nothing prohibited. So we
finish not in the sea, we finish in the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze were up the road in Monte
Carlo, but they are planning to return to watch the medals be
awarded without them Tuesday night. ``We are not going to hide; we
are not going to run away,'' said Moskvina. ``They don't feel
guilty about what she did. They will stay here until the end of the
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition now figures to be a walkover for China's Shen
Xue and Zhao Hongbo, who won the silver last year and dominated
Monday night's short program ahead of Russia's Maria Petrova and
Alexei Tikhonov. ``We are satisfied,'' said Zhao. ``We performed
all the elements good. But this is only the short program.''
</P>
<P>
   If he and Shen can hang on, they'll make history. The Chinese
have never won the pairs title, and only Chen Lu has ever won a
global gold. The Americans had no illusions about making the podium
here. After injuries put two of last year's three entries down for
the season, the US was content with two spots in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Just attack,' '' said Kyoko Ina, who was sitting in
sixth with John Zimmerman. ``We just wanted to skate clean.'' So
did Tiffany Scott of Hanson, Mass., and partner Philip Dulebohn,
who were ninth in their world debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've skated against everybody here, but not all together,''
said the 22-year-old Scott, who was skating juniors only three
years ago. ``We told ourselves it was just another competition.
People in the crowd, frozen water. It's all the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Though their skating was crisp and clean, Scott and Dulebohn
were hung with rookie marks, including a brutal pair of 4.7s from
Czech judge Jarmila Portova. ``We're still kind of new,'' shrugged
Scott. ``It's a game. But I'm willing to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the men twiddled their thumbs for nearly
eight hours while their field was being whittled from 47 to 30 for
Tuesday's short program. ``That stupid qualifying round is over,''
exulted two-time champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia, who landed a
quadruple toe loop to win his group ahead of US champion Michael
Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get off the ground,'' said Weiss, the defending
bronze medalist. ``It would have been nice to have hit the quad,
obviously, but I have to save something for later.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Goebel did hit a quad salchow-triple toe combination but
missed most everything else in a nightmarish program that included
a fall on another quad, a single axel, and a step-out on a triple
flip. ``It stunk,'' admitted Goebel, who ended up eighth in his
group, which Canada's Elvis Stojko won ahead of Russia's Evgeny
Plushenko. ``That was not a world-level program. I have no idea
what happened. I've been training extremely well here. I really
don't know what went wrong. There is no excuse for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Goebel, who figured to contend for a medal here after finishing
third in the Grand Prix final, needs at least to climb back into
the top 10 if the US is to earn back a third men's spot for next
year's world championships in Vancouver. ``Next year is so far
away,'' said Weiss. ``I'm just trying to get through this year.''

OPTIMISM ON ANIMAL-TO-HUMAN ORGAN TRANSPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite daunting scientific and ethical issues, biotech
companies are closing in on a new generation of animal-to-human
organ transplants, with one top executive predicting that her
company could be ready to implant pig hearts or kidneys in patients
within two to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, none of the few dozen patients who have received a
solid animal organ _ called xenotransplantation _ survived for long
and most died almost immediately, largely because their immune
systems treated the organs like an invader. In recent years, a few
patients have survived the wait for a human organ by being hooked
up to a pig organ kept outside the body.
</P>
<P>
   Though the stubborn problem of the patient's immune system
rejecting foreign organs hasn't been overcome, new techniques for
overcoming rejection are showing promise in experimental animals,
said Corinne Savill, chief operating officer of Imutran, based in
Cambridge, England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xenotranplantation has a lot of hurdles to overcome,'' she
said, ``but we are getting monkeys to live two to three months on a
pig heart or kidney,'' Savill said.
</P>
<P>
   Tried without much success for decades, xenotransplantation
continues in research because of the drastic and worsening shortage
of human organs for patients who could be saved from death if
substitute organs were available. One analyst has estimated that
the market for pig kidneys, lungs and hearts could exceed $6
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Savill was among several scientists, regulators and company
sponsors of xenotransplant research who spoke at the Bio2000
conference in Boston on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of animal transplants has been clouded by fears
that dangerous viruses could be transferred to patients along with
the organ, and scientists previously discovered that pigs _ the
most likely organ donors _ harbor a specific type of retrovirus in
their own cells.
</P>
<P>
   Savill presented reassuring data from a 1999 study in which she
and officials from British biotech company Imutran probed the blood
of dozens of monkeys given pig organs, as well as a number of
patients who had received animal transplants, in search of viruses
that might have made their way from the organs into the hosts. They
found none.
</P>
<P>
   None of the patients, however, had received solid organs, but
instead had undergone less intrusive procedures such as skin grafts
from pigs, or had had pancreatic islet cells (which produce
insulin) from pigs. Still others had had their circulation hooked
up to pig livers outside their bodies to cleanse their blood
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Savill's experiment does not end worries over
animal-to-human infections, a subject that still preoccupies
scientists and regulators, such as the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the survival rate for patients who have received solid
animal organs remains grim: In 1992, a human patient in Poland
survived just 24 hours with a pig heart, while, in 1996, a patient
in India died during a similar operation.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, some of the only xenograft experiments are being
carried out by a Boston biotech company, Diacrine Inc., in
collaboration with Genzyme. Surgeons have transplanted fetal pig
brain cells into patients with Parkinson's disease and Huntington's
disease, and the researchers have reported improvement in some
patients. Moreover, examination of a patient who died confirmed
that the fetal cells had survived for eight months in the
recipient's brain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the tough medical issues, xenotransplantation
raises ethical and social questions.
</P>
<P>
   John Logan, a vice president at Nextran Inc., a Princeton, N.J.,
company, said that recruiting patients will be difficult because of
stringent safety precautions. Volunteers need to give large amounts
of blood recurringly to test for any viruses that may have infected
them from the transplant. They will have to promise to use birth
control for the rest of their lives, and to get family and close
friends to agree to be tested as well, to track any infections.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, volunteers will probably have to take
immunosuppressive drugs forever because the rejection battle is
still not won. Even getting ethics boards to approve the
experiments will be difficult because most board members have only
a ``primitive'' knowledge of xenotransplantation, Logan said.

HOLE IN THE SOX? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNEDIN, Fla. _ Worriers make me nervous. I don't like to get
into cars with worried drivers; don't like to accept food from
worried chefs; and don't like to play pickup ball with worried
point guards, quarterbacks, and goalies.
</P>
<P>
   This is all covered extensively in the Holley Lama's manifesto,
soon to be available online for free. We don't have time to explore
that entire document, but let me say this: When sports worriers
come my way _ you can always see the angst in their eyes _ I search
for exits. With that said, it's time for a confession.
</P>
<P>
   I am officially worried about the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Their 8-17 Grapefruit League record has nothing to do with it.
They were a 10-minute drive from Jimy Williams's offseason home
when they lost to the Blue Jays on Monday at Dunedin Stadium, 8-6.
They lost. Who cares? The Martinez Brothers, Nomar Garciaparra,
Troy O'Leary, Derek Lowe, and Mike Stanley didn't even make the
two-hour bus ride here from Fort Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they had come, they wouldn't have been on the mound
starting for Boston. That job belonged to Jeff Fassero. Fassero is
a pleasant man. But if you've got any restless habits you are
trying to shake, you don't want to watch him pitch. You want to vow
to stop biting your fingernails after he starts. I'd like to tell
you that it's only spring and not to worry, but Fassero is no
spring pitcher; he's slated as Boston's third starter.
</P>
<P>
   Worried yet?
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Fassero threw a backdoor slider to Raul
Mondesi. Such pitches are supposed to be discreet, hence the name.
But the pitch Fassero threw was so wide and visible that I swear I
saw a ``How's My Driving?'' sticker on the seams. Mondesi saw it,
too, and easily yanked the pitch over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Disclaimer: Fassero said he wouldn't throw that pitch during the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, third baseman Tony Batista faced Fassero.
There was a pitch and, suddenly, there was a baseball heading over
the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Disclaimer: The wind was blowing out all day, thus making home
runs easier to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Following his five-inning, four-run performance, Fassero said he
had his best overall outing of the spring. Mostly, he kept the ball
down and forced the Blue Jays to hit a lot of ground balls.
Williams said Fassero pitched well and emphasized that he is a
starter, not a reliever. By giving up only four runs, Fassero
lowered his spring ERA to 7.71 (it had been 7.94). He gave up 35
home runs last season. In 16 innings, he's allowed seven homers.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be noted that very few pitchers in Major League
history have been winners past age 35. Fassero is 37.
</P>
<P>
   (I've got a copy of a CD entitled ``The Big Calm'' with me, so
there is no panic over here. But I can't say there hasn't been a
little seat squirming.)
</P>
<P>
   I can easily argue against myself in several areas. Fassero has
had one bad year _ last year _ in his career. It is still spring
training, where the sad Minnesota Twins are the fourth-best team in
the 20-team Grapefruit League. And, don't forget, this time last
year I went on record and said the Sox would win 80 games.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Fassero. As the exhibition games come to a close,
I'm starting to ask myself questions that don't have the best
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Whose rotation would you rather have, Boston's, New
York's, or Cleveland's?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Let me think about that for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have Pedro and Ramon Martinez, Fassero, Tim Wakefield,
and either Brian Rose or Juan Pena. In other words, one dominant
pitcher, three questions, and a .500 reliable (Wakefield). The
Yankees have Orlando Hernandez, Roger Clemens, David Cone, Andy
Pettitte, and, probably, Ramiro Mendoza. No dominant pitcher, but
fewer questions. The Indians have Bartolo Colon, Chuck Finley, Dave
Burba, Charles Nagy, and Jaret Wright. Four solids and one question
(Wright).
</P>
<P>
   Is this enough for the Sox to win the World Series?
</P>
<P>
   All spring, Sox players have been giggling at fans and media
predicting greatness. Their response is always something like this:
We basically have the same team we had last year and didn't win the
World Series, so why pick us now? I giggled with them until Monday.
And then I found myself saying, ``Good question.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess it's progress that I am not worried about a few of the
team's roster moves, although they make me nervous. It looks as if
the Sox are prepared to send the versatile and speedy Donnie Sadler
to the minors. On some jaunts from first to third, Sadler breaks
the sound barrier. Imagine Carl Everett, Jose Offerman, and Sadler
in the same lineup. The Sox have never had such swift runners.
</P>
<P>
   If Sadler is sent down, it will mean the Sox released Marty
Cordova and optioned Sadler in the same week. Replacing them will
be Jeff Frye and Gary Gaetti, both of whom I like very much. I
would still take the Cordova-Sadler ticket over Frye-Gaetti, even
though I love the stories Gaetti has to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is all premature. The season begins in a week and
nothing is clear until July's All-Star break. But I've still got
this urge to bite my nails.

MODEM MAKER WON'T PART WITH TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When the leading maker of dial-up telephone modems, 3Com Inc.,
announces that it's getting out of the business, you might think
it's a sign that old-fashioned modems are doomed.
</P>
<P>
   But then, you're not Frank Manning, president of Boston-based
Zoom Telephonics Inc., a major modem producer. Manning says his
company, like 3Com, sees booming demand for high-speed cable and
DSL connections to the Internet. But Zoom has no intention of
bailing out of the market for traditional modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to support our Zoom and Hayes brand modem
customers and will continue to develop new modem products,''
Manning said last week. He added that having a strong presence in
the modem business should boost demand for more advanced Zoom
products.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, Zoom reinforced its commitment to the modem
business through its purchase of the US assets of Hayes Corp.
Before falling on hard times in the 1990s, Hayes had been the
dominant maker of telephone modems and had actually created the
software used throughout the industry to control the way modems
work.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom says it is investing most of its research and development
budget into various broadband technologies that are likely to
supersede traditional modems. Zoom already makes a line of cable
modems, and is working on DSL products.
</P>
<P>
   But there will still be improvements in traditional modems. A
new standard called V.92 is expected this year. The V.92 modems
will allow for ``call waiting,'' so that a user can interrupt an
Internet session, take a voice phone call, then hop right back onto
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The skinny on servers
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, an appliance is something that keeps the beer
cold. For many companies on the Internet, however, an appliance is
a simple but powerful plug-and-play server computer. When an online
firm needs to boost its computing capacity, many rely on server
appliances from Network Engines Inc., based in Randolph, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up an Internet server can be a daunting task, even for
someone with technical skill. Network Engines offers servers
preloaded with the Linux operating system or with Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows 2000 operating system. Each server is about as thick as a
pizza box, designed to snap easily into the mounting racks favored
at heavy-duty server installations.
</P>
<P>
   Network Engines' skinny boxes are making a surprisingly large
splash. The hot Linux computer maker VA Linux Systems is sticking
its label on a box made by Network Engines, and IBM Corp.'s
Netfinity 4000R server is a Network Engine in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   Linux power quest
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of IBM, that company is throwing a bunch of its server
computers to the wolves in an effort to hasten commercial
applications of the Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In cooperation with the University of New Mexico, IBM is
hitching together 256 of its Netfinity server computers into a
giant Linux supercomputer called LosLobos, Spanish for
``wolfpack.'' They're using Netfinity. Each of the Netfinity
computers will contain a pair of Intel Corp. microprocessors, for a
total of 512 processors. The result, say IBM researchers, will be a
supercomputer cluster capable of performing up to 357 billion
calculations per second.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists first began building computing superclusters in
1994, in a project called Beowulf. Since then, universities around
the world have constructed ever more powerful clusters, based on
standard PC hardware and the Linux operating system. But few of
these Beowulf-type systems are used for commercial applications.
They're used for ultra-sophisticated scientific research, such as
analyzing the planet's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM says it hopes to use LosLobos to develop Linux-based
business software that fully exploits the power of the system. That
could mean a boost for IBM's e-business efforts and for the
company's aggressive new move into Linux software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about 2 to 3 percent into what the Internet is going to
do for the world,'' said John Patrick, IBM's vice president of
Internet technology. As merchants seek to add more and better
services, they'll need all the computing power they can muster.
``Down the road,'' said Patrick, ``we believe that Linux clusters
are going to be as important for e-business as they are for
modeling the weather.''

&HT;     GUNSHOT HELPS IN UNDERSTANDING CELESTIAL LINKS TO LIFE ON
EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Experiments with high-speed guns indicate that
comets could have delivered the building blocks of life to Earth
billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpectedly large percentage of organic molecules survived
being shot from a large gun and slammed into a wall of felt at
several miles per second, one researcher reported Monday during a
meeting of the American Chemical Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited because it's a really new result. . . .
Scientifically, it's extremely interesting,'' said Randall E.
Winans, an organic chemist at Argonne National Laboratory, a U.S.
Energy Department-funded facility in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The findings strengthen the suspicion of some scientists that
terrestrial life descended from nonliving organic chemicals that
literally fell from the sky, back when the solar system was young.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1950s to the 1970s, most scientists held a contrary
view: They argued that life had first emerged on Earth itself, a
few billion years ago. Many agreed with the 19th-century naturalist
Charles Darwin that the first organic molecules formed by chance
agglomerations of chemicals in a ``warm little pond.'' Over time,
those molecules supposedly evolved into more and more complex
structures, and eventually into living plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, laboratory experiments first showed that
amino acids _ building blocks of proteins, essential to life _
formed readily in flasks of laboratory chemicals that supposedly
simulated Earth's early atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ``Earth first'' theory of the origin of life fell
on hard times in the 1970s. A big problem was that geological
research revealed Earth's primeval atmosphere possibly didn't
contain enough hydrogen-rich gases to spur the formation of organic
molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists began to wonder if our ancestral organic
molecules might have formed more easily in outer space, perhaps
within the icy, mountainous chemical snowballs known as comets.
Robotic space probes passed near comets and discovered that they
were indeed packed with organic molecules.
</P>
<P>
   There was one catch, though: As the comets fell to Earth, they
would have heated up from friction with the atmosphere. They would
have become so hot, in fact, that their precious organics might
have totally burned up.
</P>
<P>
   The new research suggests otherwise. Winans and his colleagues
packed five types of amino acids into a tiny projectile, then
inserted it into an 80mm, gunpowder-fueled howitzer with a 40-foot
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   They then fired the organic payload into a wall of
water-drenched felt. After the smoke cleared, they scooped up the
mess and analyzed its chemical constituents with a device called a
mass spectrometer.
</P>
<P>
   To their astonishment, 12 percent of the amino acids had
survived the simulated crash landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping for at least 1 percent, so we were happy,''
Winans said with a big grin.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues were J.G. Blank of the geology and geophysics
department at the University of California at Berkeley, Mike J.
Ahrens of Argonne, G.T. Grey III of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, and Sutatcha Hongsresawat and G.H. Miller
of the geophysical sciences department at the University of
Chicago. Miller has since moved to the University of California at
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Their research is scheduled for publication in the scientific
journal Origin of Life.

PATRIOTS' OWNER SAYS `BAD APPLES' DON'T BELONG IN LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ With two NFL players under indictment on
murder charges, the most violent sport in America is ready to take
a stand against what it's been selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under certain conditions, certain guys won't be eligible to
play (in the NFL),'' Patriots owner Robert Kraft said Monday during
a break at the annual league meetings. ``There may be certain
antitrust problems or other (legal) problems with that, but I know
as a fan it's how I feel. I'd go for the limit. We're really not
going to have bad apples on our team to the best of our ability.
Coach (Bill) Belichick agrees.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, so too does NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who
said that a group of team owners and head coaches will meet Tuesday
evening to discuss how the league's antiviolence policy might be
altered to address the reality behind the screaming headlines that
have rocked the league over the past three months _ when first
Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth and later Baltimore Ravens
linebacker Ray Lewis were charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that most of our players are good citizens, but
the ones who get in trouble generate an enormous amount of negative
publicity for our league,'' Tagliabue said in a statement outlining
his opening remarks to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tagliabue wisely amended that when asked if the issue of
concern for the league was violent criminal acts by a handful of
its players or merely the bad publicity that came with their
arrests. ``It's not an image issue, it's a substantive issue of
player conduct,'' he said. ``We're trying to help players maintain
themselves professionally and stay out of trouble. Societal
standards are changing and there are raised expectations for
professional athletes, but it's also an issue of general concerns
about the level of violence in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The league has begun a review of its antiviolence policy and
also has begun to study individual team policies, although Tampa
Bay head coach Tony Dungy said he was not sure this would lead to a
league-wide policy any time soon. ``I know my policy can't go for
the whole league,'' said Dungy, one of several head coaches on the
committee studying the growing problem of criminal behavior among
players. ``What we can do is try to reeducate guys about what is
acceptable and what is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Ravens coach Brian Billick, who also is on the
committee, said Tuesday's open forum will be ``a sharing of ideas
about what individual clubs are doing to enhance the education of
our players. It's a starting process of brainstorming. If we see
some viable programs that could be expanded league-wide, all the
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't throw the baby out with the bath water. Just
because these things happened, we can't say our entire structure is
not working. You can't junk our whole system because someone
inevitably makes a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft acknowledged that he feels much the same way despite his
strong public stance that certain players with a criminal
background be banned from the NFL. The problem, as he sees it, is
finding a balance between a desire to keep the league's image clean
and a sometimes counterbalancing desire to win football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to think we have a high standard, but we're also a
microcosm of society,'' Kraft said. ``We're not trying to be Boy
Scouts about it. We want to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no perfect solution. We want to develop as strong a
support system as we can. And we want to screen as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue also spoke of teams begining to use an employment
screening process similar to what other businesses have designed to
eliminate potential employees whose history might make them likely
to make headlines off the job rather than on it. ``Some clubs are
doing in-depth screening of draft-eligible players,'' said the
commissioner. ``They're using tests employers generally use. Some
have suggested we do it league-wide to identify people who might
need support and counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no major change is expected in league policy on players
involved in violent off-field altercations or criminal behavior,
Kraft said it is clear to him that the issue must be addressed. ``I
feel strongly the American public is fed up,'' Kraft said.
``They're sick of it. We in the NFL need to be mindful of that.''

LAWSUIT PUTS `REVERSE' ENGINEERING TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer experts who recently found a way to defeat the
popular Net filtering program Cyber Patrol think they're striking a
blow for freedom of thought.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsystems Software, the Massachusetts company that made
the software, thinks the hackers are just a couple of thieves,
swiping computer software that doesn't belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   Who's right? It depends on how the federal courts interpret the
laws governing ``reverse engineering,'' the common but sometimes
controversial business of analyzing somebody else's software.
</P>
<P>
   Reverse engineering can be a legitimate business tool. But
Microsystems executives say that it's being used in this case to
violate their intellectual property rights and ruin their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pointless and malicious acts damage the company,'' said
Microsystems attorney Irwin Schwartz. ``But worse still, they
undermine parents' ability to protect their children from
inappropriate or sexually explicit material on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of material Cyber Patrol is
</P>
<P>
   supposed to filter out. But Eddy Jansson of Sweden and Matthew
Skala of Canada used reverse engineering to decipher the list of
Web sites that Cyber Patrol blocks.
</P>
<P>
   They then produced a program, called CPHack, that will let any
Cyber Patrol user decipher the list and that also deciphers the
main password for Cyber Patrol. Anybody with this password can turn
off Cyber Patrol, thus defeating the purpose of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they are more capable of judging the wisdom of kids
looking at these materials than the parents of the kids
themselves,'' said Schwartz, who filed suit against Jansson, Skala,
and their ISPs in a Boston federal court.
</P>
<P>
   That court has issued a temporary restraining order against the
two men, requiring that they stop distributing CPHack. The court
will hold another hearing on the matter today and may issue a
preliminary injunction against Jansson and Skala.
</P>
<P>
   To show support for the two men, Net users around the world have
put copies of CPHack on their own sites. Schwartz said that
Microsystems Software is contacting these users' Internet service
providers, demanding they delete the software from their customers'
sites. That move has roused the anger of the American Civil
Liberties Union, which will appeared in court Monday to support the
right of Net users to post the software.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the case could turn on whether the court decides
Jansson and Skala had a right to reverse engineer Cyber Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Reverse engineering is hardly new. Companies routinely take
apart competing products to see how they work. But it's a little
more complicated when the product is a piece of software.
</P>
<P>
   This software is created as ``source code,'' written by humans
in a particular computer language, such as Java or C++. This source
code is then run through a program called a compiler, which
converts it into an ``executable'' digital file that the computer
can understand.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of extremely smart people could understand this
digital language. But there are programs that can ``decompile'' the
code. In this way, someone can recreate the original source code
and discover how the program works. But the recreated code is
protected by copyright law, and a software maker who re-used
somebody's source code could be taken to court.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the reverse engineers don't want to copy a program,
but simply figure out how it works? In a number of such cases,
courts have declared that reverse engineering is perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Sega Enterprises Ltd., the maker of home computer game
consoles, sued a firm called Accolade Inc., which was making
unauthorized games for use on Sega equipment. Accolade had used
reverse engineering to learn how to make their games
Sega-compatible. Sega claimed Accolade had no right to do this, but
a federal appeals court held that Accolade had a right to study
Sega's source code to produce a compatible product.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Zittrain, lecturer on technology law at Harvard Law
School, says the case established a key principle for reverse
engineering. ``It's not legal if what you're doing is literally
ripping off the product,'' Zittrain said. ``It is legal if you are
reverse engineering to learn about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same rule came into play earlier this year, when a federal
court held that Connectix Corp. could legally produce a program
that would allow owners of Apple Macintosh computers to play games
written for Sony's PlayStation game console.
</P>
<P>
   But does the principle apply in the Cyber Patrol case? Both
Accolade and Connectix made products that were intended to enhance
the products of Sega and Sony. But Microsystems argues that Jansson
and Skala are seeking to ruin the market for their product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of the use in the affected market is essentially to
destroy the product's functionality,'' agrees Steve Bauer, partner
at the Boston law firm Testa, Hurwitz &AMP; Thibeault, and a specialist
in intellectual property law. For that reason, Bauer is skeptical
the court will side with Jansson and Skala.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Pamela Samuelson, a law professor at the
University of California at Berkeley, believes that CPHack was
mainly created to learn about how Cyber Patrol functions, and to
share that information with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these people did here was to go inside to try to learn
something, which is the same thing they did in the Sega v. Accolade
case,'' said Samuelson.
</P>
<P>
   Even if CPHack causes harm to Microsystems Software, Samuelson
said, it can still be a legal product if it serves a legitimate
purpose, such as public education.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the Cyber Patrol case is likely to provide
the software industry with an education on how far reverse
engineering can go.

   `TWO' BY TWO: THE RETURN OF STEELY DAN
</P>
<P>
   STEELY-DAN-STARBEAT-NYTSF _ It's been almost two decades since
Walter Becker and Donald Fagen of Steely Dan released their last
album, 1981's best-selling ``Gaucho.'' But now, just as their fans
had pretty much given up hope, comes ``Two Against Time,'' a
vintage revival of the Steely Dan sound for a new century. By Gary
Graff. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   JEN AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   FAIRCHILD-JENNIFER-CONNELLY-INTERVIEW-NYTSF _ If you grew up in
the '80s, chances are you saw actress Jennifer Connelly play the
pubescent baby sitter in Jim Henson's ``Labyrinth'' and the
rebellious rich girl in John Hughes' ``Career Opportunities.''
There was even a cameo in a Duran Duran video. With three
high-profile films scheduled for release this year _ ``Waking the
Dead,'' ``Requiem for a Dream'' and ``Pollock'' _ Connelly is about
to show that she's come a long way. An interview. By Robert
Haskell. WITH PHOTO.

   THE FLICK FIX
</P>
<P>
   FUN-FILM-FESTIVALS-NYTSF _ In this media-meets-mainstream era,
film festivals _ from the Toronto International Film Festival to
the New York Film Festival _ have become increasingly open to
regular Joes, who fill empty seats and help create buzz for
upcoming releases. The festivals are the perfect destinations for
those who want to mix movies with their vacations. A list of five
of the best festivals and what you need to do to make the most of
them. By David Kaufman. North American rights only.

<P>
   KRAKOW MAINTAINS ITS REGAL MIEN
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-FARE-NYTSF _ Krakow, Poland, is one of nine cities chosen
as European cultural capitals for the year 2000, with a recorded
history dating back to 965. It is also home to central Europe's
second oldest university (after Prague). No wonder Polish people
are a proud lot. A look at the history of this regal city and what
visitors to Krakow should see. By Eve Schaenen.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING AROUND: SPRING SKIING
</P>
<P>
   BC-TRAVEL-SHOPPING-NYTSF _ Spring on the ski slopes means balmy
weather and bargains. That is especially true this spring, when
many ski areas are trying to make up for a rocky start that left
them high and dry. Now they have the snow, but they also have too
many empty hotel rooms and condos. By Everett Potter. WITH PHOTO.

   WHAT'S AN `OSCAR' REALLY WORTH?
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR-PRICETAG-WORTH _ QUESTION: What's an Oscar really worth?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: It depends on how you look at it _ anywhere from $0 to
$64 million. By Thomas O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET MELTDOWN: RELAX, HISTORY DOESN'T ALWAYS REPEAT ITSELF
</P>
<P>
   BOOM-TO-GLOOM?-INVESTOR-WORTH _ There's nothing like good news
for making investors nervous. As the economy continued to grow
strongly into the month of February, it set a record for the
longest economic expansion _ peacetime or wartime _ in U.S.
history. So, where does that leave investors? Well, history
shouldn't scare us. Just because the previous long-lasting economic
boom ended in economic and financial meltdown doesn't mean that the
current boom will do the same. By Jim Jubak.
</P>
<P>
   PROMISING GREECE GIVES INVESTORS HOPE FOR `EMERGING EUROPE'
</P>
<P>
   `OPA!'-GREEK-ECONOMY-WORTH _ A couple thousand years after
Greece supplied a name for the continent, Europe is about to return
the favor. Next year, when the euro likely replaces the Greek
drachma, the European Central Bank will effectively rule the Greek
economy, ending a history of inflation and financial chaos. Having
tamed its Trojan-Horse economy, Greece is ready to gallop towards
an ``emerging Europe.'' By Todd G. Buchholz.
</P>
<P>
   A HARE-AND-TORTOISE RACE TO RETIREMENT WEALTH
</P>
<P>
   BONUS-401(K)-WORTH _ Retirement savers have enjoyed a pretty
good run lately _ probably even better than they think. Or so I
concluded after studying the performance of 24 leading mutual funds
used in 401(k) plans. Most investors collected a nice ``installment
bonus'' on their 401(k)-plan investments. Not because they invested
brilliantly but because they invested methodically, making regular
tax-deductible contributions. By Scott Burns.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOLEHILL-TO-MOUNTAIN MYTH OF RETIREMENT SAVINGS
</P>
<P>
   BADNEWS-BOOMER-MATH-WORTH _ Allow me to introduce the
Installment Effect. That's my name for what happens to investments
when they're made or changed in installments. Understanding the
effect can mean the difference between a well-financed old age and
one that has you filling out a job application at Wal-Mart at 84.
By Scott Burns.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME WARNER'S MAIDS OF HONOR CAUGHT THE BOUQUET
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIMEWARNER-`BOUNCE'-WORTH _ On Jan. 10, Time Warner
shareholders from Ted Turner on down were high-fiving one another
as they watched their stock soar 39 percent, to $90 a share, after
America Online announced it planned to acquire the media giant. But
they weren't the only investors celebrating. That same day,
frenetic trading drove the stock prices of Time Warner rivals up an
average of 14 percent. By Nick Pachetti.

   COMMENTARY (moved in ``k'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HOLBROOKE'S CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   HOLBROOKE-CENTERPIECE _ Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, wants to improve U.S.-U.N. relations and
re-engage America in the world. He also wouldn't mind being Al
Gore's secretary of state. By James Traub.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITAL OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   JUSTICE-CENTERPIECE _ On Feb. 24, a new Gallup poll revealed
that American support for capital punishment has fallen to 66
percent, its lowest level in 19 years. And only 52 percent favor
the death penalty if the law were to allow a life sentence without
parole. Just as remarkable, 91 percent (an 11 percent rise from
last year) recognized that innocent people have been sentenced to
death. By Bruce Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   WATER: A SOLUBLE _ AND SOLVABLE _ PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATIZE-WATER-ECONOMIST _ What could be more basic to life
than a drink of water? Yet more than a billion people have no
access to safe water. Three times as many lack adequate sanitation.
World demand for fresh water is expected to grow sharply, by 70
percent (for household use) by 2025. Shortages seem inevitable,
which could lead to war. This dismal reckoning lies behind the big
world water summit held in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN'S DARE, CHINA'S SCARE
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-`ONE-CHINA'-ECONOMIST _ Taiwan's election, which ended 50
years of Nationalist rule and chose as the island's next president
Chen Shui-bian, the candidate of a hitherto pro-independence party,
is a clear rebuff to China's Communists, who claim Taiwan as their
own. What will China do now? The only solution remains for the two
sides to decide together, through negotiation, whether they are to
be one China or two.
</P>
<P>
   GREENSPAN'S DRIP-TORTURE STRATEGY IS DANGEROUS
</P>
<P>
   RISKY-FED-RATES-ECONOMIST _ Pour boiling water on a frog and it
will jump away; heat it up slowly in a pot of cold water, and it
will die. America's Federal Reserve, which raised short-term
interest rates by another quarter-point to 6 percent on March 21,
may need reminding of this tale. The Fed's strategy of slowing an
overheating economy by raising rates gradually might prove just as
risky for America _ and for the world economy, as well.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA ISN'T PAKISTAN'S SIAMESE TWIN
</P>
<P>
   RESPECT-INDIA-OPED-IHT (New Delhi, India) _ India resents being
treated by U.S. policy as a Siamese twin of Pakistan. It also frets
at the respect accorded to China, to the extent that Washington has
let Beijing off the hook on its nuclear and missile transfers to
Pakistan. India would like Washington to be on the side of the
world's largest democracy, not on the side of the world's largest
autocracy. By Brahma Chellaney.
</P>
<P>
   WHY RISING GAS PRICES KEEP AL GORE AWAKE AT NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   GORE-GAS-PAINS-INDEPENDENT (Washington) _ With the stock market
up since President Clinton took office, unemployment and crime both
down, and the world _ however uneasily _ at peace, the status quo
should work in Al Gore's favor. But eight months is a very long
time in electoral politics, and recent days have foreshadowed just
how much could go wrong between now and Nov. 7, and how much is
actually out of Gore's control. By Mary Dejevsky.
</P>
<P>
   `E-WASTE': TOXIC COMPUTER PARTS POSE POLLUTION NIGHTMARE
</P>
<P>
   TOXIC-COMPUTERS-INDEPENDENT _ Millions of redundant computers
and their highly toxic components are storing up a huge hidden
environmental problem in Britain and America. If action is not
taken soon, campaigners say, the countries will have billions of
pounds of hazardous contaminants in their soils. The full scale of
the potential pollution nightmare can be judged by the U.S.
experience. By Paul Lashmar.
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS IN HOT WATER OVER BOYCOTT. TEA, ANYONE?
</P>
<P>
   MASS.-VS.-MYANMAR-ECONOMIST _ Call it a case of states' rights
vs. nations' wrongs. Little Massachusetts is once again standing up
for the democratic values it so boldly asserted before the American
Revolution. Then it boycotted English imports by tossing crates of
tea into Boston Harbor. Today the state is boycotting companies
that do business with Myanmar, home of one of the world's harshest
military regimes. Alas, two lower federal courts have ruled that
Massachusetts' well-intentioned foray into foreign affairs is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY COLOR: QUIRKY MOMENTS ON THIS WEEK'S CAMPAIGN TRAIL
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARYCOLOR-COLUMN-ECONOMIST _ The regular ``Primary Color''
column.
</P>
<P>
   FICKLE FANS, JOCKS FLOCK TO EVER-NEW ARENAS
</P>
<P>
   DOOMED-JOCK-PARKS-SE-ECONOMIST _ During the past decade about
half the stadiums in the nation that house football, baseball,
basketball or hockey games have been replaced _ usually to lure new
teams to a city, or, in the case of Seattle, to prevent the
departure of existing teams. What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   THE TAXING DILEMMA OF E-COMMERCE
</P>
<P>
   TAXMAN-INTERNET-ECONOMIST _ With the Internet currently
displacing motherhood and apple pie at the top of the list of
American virtues, proposals to tax the Net are not popular. But if
e-commerce grows as quickly as predicted, failing to tax it could
do serious damage to the finances of America's state and local
governments, which depend on sales taxes for much of their
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   `CHOLO' ALEJANDRO TOLEDO: PERU'S FAIRY-TALE CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   FUJIMORI-RIVAL-ECONOMIST _ Political fairy tales are not unknown
in Peru. In 1990, a university rector named Alberto Fujimori rose
from nowhere in the final weeks of a presidential election campaign
to trounce Mario Vargas Llosa, a world-famous novelist. Now
Fujimori is seeking a third term in an election on April 9. He has
seemed assured of easy victory. Yet suddenly he has a serious
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   TERABEAM: THE NEXT TELECOMS GIANT?
</P>
<P>
   TERABEAM-ME-UP-ECONOMIST _ When it comes to ground-breaking
technology and ingenious new Internet businesses, the `digerati'
who show up for Esther Dyson's annual PC Forum are blase to the
point of weariness. That makes the buzz caused last week by
Seattle-based TeraBeam Networks all the more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW-AGE DOG
</P>
<P>
   CANINE-CENTERPIECE _ Having had the civilizing influences of
organic dog chow, calming balms and organic medicine foisted upon
them, is it any wonder that our pampered pooches just want to get
back to their doggie-dog roots? By Charles Siebert.
</P>
<P>
   BORIS BEREZOVSKY: KREMLIN PUPPETEER OR FUTURE PUTIN VICTIM?
</P>
<P>
   BORIS-BEREZOVSKY-ECONOMIST _ Will Boris Berezovsky, Russia's
oligarch-extraordinaire, see out the year in jail, exile or the
comfortable nook between business and government that he currently
occupies? The answer will give a clear sign of where the country is
headed under Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   VLADIMIR PUTIN: RUSSIA'S POST-COLD WARRIOR
</P>
<P>
   THREE-FACES-PUTIN-ECONOMIST _ Spies are good at concealing their
motives. Presumably Vladimir Putin, most of whose working life has
been spent with the KGB, is no exception. Does he come to power
with the bottled-up energies of a hitherto frustrated reformer,
determined to take Russia into Europe? Or does his heart lie in the
paranoid, ruthless old world of the Cold War Soviet security
services? Or is he in reality a Kremlin insider, a crafty
new-Russian power-broker who revels in sleaze and arm-twisting? Any
one of these three faces could be the real Putin, the other two
just political disguises.

SNUBBING THE FED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why isn't the stock market bothered by the Federal Reserve's
campaign to raise interest rates?
</P>
<P>
   That's the obvious question to ask in light of last week's big
rally. The Fed raised rates last Tuesday, its fifth rate hike in
recent months, and investors reacted as they have to each of the
past hikes: They bid up the price of stocks. The Nasdaq is back
within striking distance of 5000 and the Dow Jones industrial
average is in the neighborhood of 11,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market seems impervious to rate increases,'' said Ned
Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Call us old-fashioned, but we were brought up to believe that
higher interest rates are bad for stocks. Did someone change the
rules without telling us? More significantly, is there some logic
to the market's behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Money managers and economists are divided on the question. But
when pushed, they came up with some plausible explanations for the
current state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
   They say stocks are ignoring the Fed because:
</P>
<P>
   --The market is awash in liquidity. Investors pumped $65 billion
into equity funds in the first two months of the year, according to
Riley. That money has buoyed stock prices, in effect, offsetting
the Fed's handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   --Long-term rates are falling. The rate on the 30-year Treasury
bond has dropped to 6 percent, down from nearly 6.75 percent in
January. The reason? The government is using money from the budget
surplus to buy back debt. Barry Evans, chief fixed-income officer
at John Hancock Funds, says that those lower long-term rates are
also offsetting the Fed's attempt to rein in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   --Investors in tech stocks are looking to the distant future.
The logic here goes like this: The hottest tech firms are
relatively young companies whose earnings payoff may be three to
five years out. With such a long time horizon, who cares if
interest rates are a little higher or a little lower? If you have
your money in the next Cisco _ doesn't everyone? _ you won't even
notice the difference.
</P>
<P>
   --Investors are counting on the Fed to engineer a soft landing.
``The market is envisioning a rosy scenario,'' said Wayne Ayers,
chief economist at FleetBoston Financial Corp. Under that scenario,
the Fed raises rates a little more _ say 50 basis points _ the
economy slows down modestly, productivity keeps rising, and
inflation remains under control. As Dr. Pangloss put it in
``Candide,'' ``All is for the best in this best of all possible
worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't buy it. From where we sit, it looks as if investors are
in a deep state of denial.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the economy shows few signs of slowing down. Gross
domestic product climbed at a 7 percent rate in the fourth quarter
of 1999 and most forecasters are looking for about 5 percent growth
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed would be more comfortable with a number like 3 percent.
What's more, it is clear from everything the Fed has said and
published that the central bank means business. ``It is inevitable
that the Fed will slow the economy,'' said Mark Zandi, chief
economist at RFA Dismal Sciences, a Pennsylvania forecasting firm.
``It is a just a question of how much higher rates will have to go
to accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the just-released minutes from the February meeting of the
Federal Open Market Committee, Fed officials worried aloud about
the ``imbalances'' in the economy and the budding inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Several committee members also thought it might be time to raise
rates by 50 basis points, instead of the 25-basis-point doses
Greenspan seems to favor.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication the chairman is ready to take such
drastic action, but you have to wonder if the thought hasn't
crossed his mind. If you hit the economy with a stick and nothing
happens, maybe you need to use a two-by-four?
</P>
<P>
   Zandi thinks the federal funds rates, currently at 6 percent,
could easily go to 7 percent and possibly higher by the end of the
year. If he's right, you have to think the news can't be good for
stocks. Those higher rates will produce a slower economy, weaker
profits, more hesitant consumers, and quite possibly a crack in the
belief that tomorrow will always be better than yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   So far investors have chosen to ignore the Fed. We're betting
that they won't be able to do that forever.

PASSING THE BATON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Kenneth Galbraith is an old man now, no longer spry at 91
but active. For fifty years he has been the single most visible
symbol of the American Left: not socialist but rather
associationist, in contrast to the creed of individualism that has
made such headway in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Private affluence, public squalor is the essence of the
Galbraithian diagnosis. Always there has been a prescription as
well: from price controls to progressive taxation to micro-lending.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of benchmarks help put this associationist impulse in
American historical perspective. Next Monday evening at 10, PBS
will air ``Brother Can You Spare a Billion? The Story of Jesse H.
Jones.'' The Texas developer and banker was chairman of the
Reconstruction Finance Corp. under Franklin Roosevelt and later
secretary of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The RFC was a government business partnership conceived under
Herbert Hoover that pumped plenty of public money into American
businesses, the railroads in particular, without much effect.
Arlington filmmaker Eric Stange's documentary is a vivid reminder
that government-directed industrial policy is the great Road Not
Taken in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Similar is David Hart's book ``Forged Consensus: Science,
Technology and Economic Policy in the United States, 1921-1953,''
which chronicles the ins and outs of an all but forgotten debate
about the governance of technological change in the years before
and immediately after World War II _ including the attempt by
Senator Harley Kilgore of West Virginia to create an Office of
Technology Mobilization with the power to oversee all federal
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Among the partisans of these New Deal battles, only Galbraith is
still standing, and differences of opinion that once seemed great
have lost their power to divide. Since 1958, when he published
``The Affluent Society,'' but especially since 1967 when ``The New
Industrial State'' appeared, Galbraith has been the foremost
exponent of the view that oversight by government and business
technocrats working together was the best way to bind communities
and ameliorate the lot of their least fortunate members.
</P>
<P>
   He has, in other words, been on the losing end of a lot of
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   So who is there to carry on? Well, a potent clue may be obtained
from the Global Development and Environment Institute, an
associationist think tank administered by the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomancy and the faculty of arts and sciences at Tufts
University.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is in some part a vehicle for the enthusiasms of
Neva Rockefeller Goodwin, its codirector with Tufts professor
William Moomjaw. On Monday, she awarded its first Leontief Prize
for Advancing the Fronters of Economic Thought jointly to Galbraith
and Amartya Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Leontief? He was a longtime Harvard professor whose career as an
economist ranged from Czarist jails during the Russian Revolution
to the forefront of quantitative methods and, eventually, a Nobel
Prize. In later years he became a pungent critic of mathematical
economics for its divorce from pressing policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Sen, who is master of Trinity College at Cambridge University
and professor emeritus at Harvard University, is no stranger to
mathematical economics. But since his boyhood in India he has been
among the profession's foremost students of the relationship
between human well-being and economic growth. His Nobel citation
credited him for having ``restored an ethical dimension to the
discussion of economic problems.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 66, Sen doesn't have the same demotic touch nor the
stylistic flair of the older man (Galbraith wrote for a time for
Fortune magazine.) He is, instead, a formidable institutional
politician and policy entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   But no one who has read ``Development as Freedom'' can doubt
that Sen is Galbraith's most prominent heir, as an intellectual and
humanitarian. And anyone who considers the history of the last 250
years will be heartened by a line of implacable optimism from the
journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson: ``I am defeated all the time, yet
to victory I am born.''

<P>
   As cell phones explode in popularity _ 30,000 new users are
being added daily to the total of 86 million existing users in the
United States _ federal regulators are questioning whether the
microwaves emitted by cell phones pose a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   A cell phone emits microwave radiation through its antenna, with
the radiation field concentrated near the user's head. The
assumption for years had been that the low-level radiation emitted
by a cell phone antenna was safe.
</P>
<P>
   However, that assumption is now being re-examined by federal
safety regulators as the result of two industry-sponsored studies.
</P>
<P>
   While federal safety regulators say there is no evidence that
cell phones are safe _ or that they are unsafe _ the two studies
raise questions that have led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
to sponsor more research on cell phone safety.
</P>
<P>
   In a package of stories, photos and graphics for release Sunday,
April 2, the Hearst Newspapers and The San Antonio Express-News
explain how the safety issue originated and what is being done to
resolve it.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer number of cell phone users ``translates into a
potentially significant public health problem,'' if the devices
even slightly increase the risk of health problems, the FDA says.

Newspapers &LR;  &QC; WASHINGTON _ Federal safety regulators are
investigating whether microwave radiation from cell phones causes
cancer or other diseases.
<P>
   The probe was triggered by two industry-sponsored studies that
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said require additional
research.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA hastens to add that there is no scientific basis for
concluding that cell phones are unsafe _ or that they are safe. The
only way to conclusively answer the safety question is through ``a
significant research effort,'' the FDA says.
</P>
<P>
   One study by researchers at the American Health Foundation in
New York found an association between cell phone use and a rare
type of brain tumor. The other study, conducted by Integrated
Laboratory Systems in Research Triangle Park, N.C., found that DNA
in human blood cells breaks down when exposed to large doses of
cell phone radiation, possibly laying the genetic groundwork for
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not sure what this means,'' said Dr. George Carlo, who
headed the industry's $27 million safety research project from 1993
until last year. ``This could be a colossal coincidence or the tip
of the iceberg,'' said Carlo, an epidemiologist and lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   With 86 million cellular phone users in the United States alone
and 30,000 new users signing up daily, ``this translates into a
potentially significant public health problem, should the use of
these devices even slightly increase the risk of adverse health
effects,'' the FDA says.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the number of cell phone users in the United
States jumped by 10 million. U.S. cell phone sales soared over $37
billion in 1999, up $8 billion over the previous year and $12
billion over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Carlo studies showing a possible link between the phones and
illness have caught the attention of Peter Angelos, a prominent
Baltimore attorney who has successfully litigated against the
tobacco industry and asbestos manufacturers. Angelos is
investigating possible legal action against the cellular phone
industry but cautions that more scientific research is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The question of cell phone safety recently led Metrocall of
Alexandria, Va., the nation's third largest pager company and a
major seller of AT&AMP;T cellular phones, to warn its sales staff that
parents buying for a child or young adult should consider a pager
instead of a cell phone ``due to potential health risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said company officials, is concern that younger
people, whose bodies are still developing, may be more susceptible
to damage from microwave radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an adult comes in with a teenager and says, `I want to buy
my kid a cell phone,' we say this is something that we want to make
you aware of,'' said Michael Scanlon, a senior vice president at
Metrocall.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo's cell phone research project _ which involved dozens of
scientists at universities, hospitals and private laboratories
across the nation over a five-year period _ produced more than 40
studies.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the research showed cell phone use had no effect
on the human body, Dr. Russell Owen, chief of the radiation-biology
branch of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health,
said the two studies ``raise some interesting scientific questions
but are no cause for alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new safety research will be coordinated by the FDA
and the cell phone industry represented by the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA). The first study
will follow-up the North Carolina research on DNA breakdown linked
to cell phone radiation.
</P>
<P>
   That is ``a priority goal,'' said Owen, because _ if the
findings are accurate _ such genetic damage could lead to cancer or
other disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the new research program won't be released until
later this year. It is unclear how long it will take to complete.
Meanwhile, the National Cancer Institute and the World Health
Organization are conducting separate studies on cell phone safety.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about cell phone safety were first raised in 1993 when
a Florida man, David Reynard, filed suit against NEC Corp., a cell
phone manufacturer, claiming his wife Suzy's fatal brain cancer was
caused by her cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   His suit and 12 other suits against cell phone manufacturers
have been dismissed for lack of scientific proof, according to
Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   Public anxieties were further heightened by the brain cancer
deaths of two prominent business executives in 1994 and 1993,
Michael Walsh, the chief executive officer of Tenneco, and Reginald
Lewis the CEO of TLC Beatrice. Both were cell phone users. At the
time, their illnesses sparked a sell off on Wall Street of wireless
industry stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of public concern, the CTIA decided to fund the $27
million research project aimed at assuring consumers that cell
phones are safe.
</P>
<P>
   The industry association argues that cell phones are indeed
safe, despite the two studies that Carlo calls ``red flags.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are just pieces of a much larger picture, and the larger
picture continues to reaffirm the fact that there are no adverse
health effects from using cellular phones,'' said Jo-Anne Basile,
CTIA's vice president for external and industry relations.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones use microwave signals to transmit human voice or
data. Microwaves _ a specific category of radio waves _ also have
other applications, the most common of which is to cook food. The
major difference between cell phones and microwave ovens is the
amount of power that propels the signal. Cell phones use low power,
while ovens use high power.
</P>
<P>
   High levels of microwave radiation are known to be dangerous. A
microwave oven, for example, shoots a powerful microwave signal,
propelled by 100 watts of power, at a piece of food and cooks it by
heating its water molecules.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is whether the low level of microwave radiation
used by a cell phone _ a cell phone's microwave signal is propelled
by about 0.6 watts of power _ also can cause harm.
</P>
<P>
   Past research has shown no firm link between microwaves and
cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some epidemiological studies suggest associations with
cancer, others do not, and experimental studies have not yet
yielded reproducible evidence of carcinogenic mechanisms,'' ACS
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone's radiation field is concentrated at about three
to four inches around the antenna, near the user's head.
</P>
<P>
   And this is where the potential problems lie.
</P>
<P>
   Current FDA rules on cell phone safety rely on a radiation
measurement called the ``specific absorption rate'' or SAR.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones are allowed to emit a maximum SAR of 1.6 watts per
kilogram as measured over one gram of body tissue.
</P>
<P>
   However, the FDA now questions whether that safety limit fully
protects consumers. The limit is focused entirely on protecting a
user from phones that actually destroy cells by heating them, the
``thermal'' effect.
</P>
<P>
   This limit may not protect against ``any non-thermal effects of
chronic exposure,'' the agency said. DNA disintegration is an
example of a non-thermal effect.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.6 watt SAR was set in 1996 from the previous limit of 8
watts, following a recommendation from the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers _ a professional association.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-watt ceiling had been considered safe. But the group
proposed reducing the ceiling, which was first established in 1982
to govern two-way radios,
</P>
<P>
   by a factor of five to ensure that there would be no health
effects caused by cell phone use.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, the North Carolina researchers at
Integrated Laboratory Systems were surprised to find cell damage
when tissue was exposed to radiation of 5 and 10-watts per kilogram
over a period of 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found no problems when blood cells were exposed to
radiation of 1 watt per kilogram over a period of 24 hours. They
also found no damage when blood cells were exposed for three hours
at 1, 2.5, 5 and 10-watts per kilogram of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, problems appeared when blood was exposed to
higher levels of radiation over longer periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   What had previously been considered safe now appeared to pose
some risk. This led to the conclusion that no one knew exactly what
is a safe level of radiation for human exposure.
</P>
<P>
   One of the authors of the study, Dr. Graham Hook, said the
results don't necessarily mean the phones are harmful if they
operate below 5- and 10-watts per kilogram for short periods.
</P>
<P>
   The American Health Foundation used a different kind of
scientific tool known as case control studies. In still-unpublished
preliminary findings, the researchers compared the cell phone
exposure of a group of people with a particular health problem with
another group of people who did not have the condition.
</P>
<P>
   One study compared the cell phone habits of 465 patients newly
diagnosed with brain cancer against a group of 422 non-cell phone
users who did not have the disease. They found no association
between overall brain cancer risk and cell phone usage.
</P>
<P>
   But when the researchers looked at a specific type of brain
cancer _ known as neuronal tumors, which grow from the periphery of
the brain inward _ they found that 14 out of 34 patients with that
kind of cancer were cell phone users. Compared with the control
group, cell phone users had more than double the risk of developing
the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a somewhat paradoxical finding, the researchers
found that the risk did not increase with the duration of cell
phone use, which they would expect to occur with a carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Muscat, the lead researcher on the study, called the
findings ``not a red flag, but a pale red flag.'' He said that the
link between phones and the rare brain tumor requires a larger
study of larger populations of people.
</P>
<P>
   Muscat also cautioned that the long-term health effects of cell
phone radiation are unknown, adding that there is often a
decades-long latency period among certain types of cancers. ``To be
prudent, surveillance is needed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from both research projects later briefed the FDA
about their findings. The agency then ordered the new round of
safety investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the telecommunications industry asked
scientist George Carlo to oversee $27 million in research on cell
phone safety, he spent the next six years managing 40 studies at
universities and private labs around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In findings that neither he nor the industry expected, Carlo
reported back last year that two of the studies raised safety
questions about radiation emitted from the devices. He urged more
industry leadership in researching cell phone safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry downplayed Carlo's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wheeler, president and chief executive officer of the
Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), said ``the
weight of scientific evidence continues to reaffirm that there are
no adverse health effects from the use of wireless phones.''
</P>
<P>
   CTIA would no longer work with Carlo, Wheeler said, but would
cooperate with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to design
further studies.
</P>
<P>
   This falling out between Carlo and his former employers in the
cell phone industry marked the start of a new career for Carlo. He
became a cell phone industry gadfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said we should tell people that we don't know whether cell
phones are safe and that until we do know, users should take
precautions,'' Carlo said, recounting a February 1999 meeting with
cellular phone executives.
</P>
<P>
   No one agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a receptive audience, Carlo went public with the
scientific findings, which are awaiting publication in a scientific
journal. He's had a cool relationship with the industry ever since.
</P>
<P>
   When he first started the cell phone research project in 1993,
Carlo expected the studies would show that cell phones were
perfectly safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think we'd find anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because it had been widely assumed cell phones couldn't
cause health problems in humans because the phones operated at such
low power.
</P>
<P>
   After he and CTIA went their separate ways, Carlo began working
almost full-time without pay to alert consumers about possible
health effects from cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   His organization published a half-inch thick consumer manual
called ``Wireless Phones and Your Health,'' in which he concludes:
``The science is in a gray area. Phones may or may not cause brain
cancer. Most studies have found no connection, but enough have
found a connection that a potential cannot be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the two studies that raised questions found an increased
risk of a rare brain tumor in people who used cell phones; the
other study reported genetic damage in blood cells exposed to cell
phone radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo cautions that the two studies don't necessarily mean cell
phones are dangerous and that much more follow-up needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, he says consumers should take steps to protect
themselves by using a headset or ear phones to keep the device's
antenna away from the user's head. With such an arrangement, the
antenna and the cell phone are stashed in the user's pocket or on
the user's belt.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, Carlo, 46, has run his own company _ currently known
as Health Risk Management Group, of Washington, D.C. _ which
researches public health issues. He received a doctorate in
experimental pathology and epidemiology in 1979 from the State
University of New York at Buffalo and a law degree from George
Washington University in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo blasts the cell phone industry for maintaining that phones
are safe when ``they should say the science is uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The right approach is, `We don't know,''' he said. ``Consumers
should protect themselves until we find out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be on the threshold of a public health disaster,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Or his research could be proven incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens I'd be the happiest guy in the world,'' Carlo
said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If you're concerned about the microwave radiation
emitted from your cell phone, the Food and Drug Administration
suggests these precautions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid using cell phones for long durations. ``Time is a key
factor in how much exposure a person receives,'' the agency is
advising consumers. People should use convention telephones for
longer conversations, the agency says.
</P>
<P>
   _ If cell phones must be used for lengthy calls, the FDA advises
switching to a model that places greater distance between the
user's head and the phone ``since the (radiation) exposure level
drops off dramatically with distance.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, headsets or earphones let users make calls while
keeping the antenna several feet from the head. Another example is
a car phone with the antenna on the outside of the car.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also is asking manufacturers to design cell phones
``in a way that minimizes any (radio frequency) exposure to the
user that is not necessary for device function.''
</P>
<P>
   One such model is Motorola's Star-Tac phone series, which have
an antenna that angles the radiation away from a user's head. The
company maintains that the antenna position is driven by the sleek
design and compact size _ not because of any concern about
radiation safety.
</P>
<P>
   While the makers of cell phones maintain that their phones are
safe, some smaller companies sense an emerging ``safety'' market
and are devising accessories to deflect a phone's radiation away
from the user's head.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Surrey in Britain have
developed what they call a ``smart antenna'' that they say blocks
radiation from the user's head.
</P>
<P>
   The device _ comprised of four mini-antennas twisted to form a
helix _ could be in use by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are developing special shields to deflect
radiation from the user.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis-based Aegis Corp. sells a shield that the company says
protects the user from up to 99 percent of a cell phone's radiation
emissions. MicroShield of Enfield, England, is selling a cell phone
with a nickel-lined shield.
</P>
<P>
   Integrated Wave Technologies, Inc., of Fremont, Calif., is
marketing a special ``hands-free'' voice activated accessory kit.
The technology allows users to place cell phones several feet away
and use their voices to dial numbers or answer calls, even in
high-noise environments found in vehicles and most other places
phones are used.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone manufacturers say the safety devices are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Jo-Anne Basile, vice president for external and industry
relations for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association,
says existing designs are safe. She dismissed shield products as
``people preying on the fears of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Federal Communications Commission is prodding the
industry to develop a standardized test to ensure that
</P>
<P>
   cell phones don't exceed radiation standards. If there's no
agreement in the next few months among the corporations, the FCC
says it will impose one by this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also is setting up its own testing equipment to
independently assess whether cell phones exceed the radiation
threshold.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A cell phone uses microwaves to transmit pulses of
radio energy through the phone's antenna to a larger antenna or
tower at a base station.
</P>
<P>
   The base station is connected to a computerized mobile telephone
switching office (MTSO).
</P>
<P>
   When the phone is turned on, in a split-second it determines
which base station to contact, depending on which has the strongest
signal.
</P>
<P>
   The phone transmits a rapid burst of information _ an electronic
serial number _ to the base station. In a responding burst of
electronic information, the base station assigns a ``channel'' to
the phone on which to conduct a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The MTSO then assigns the cell-phone caller a voice frequency or
channel to use during a particular conversation. This all takes
place in a fraction of a second.
</P>
<P>
   The MTSO is able to determine whether the call is being made to
another cell phone user or to a person using a conventional phone.
If the call is being made to a conventional phone, the MTSO routes
the call into the local telephone network which then takes over the
call.
</P>
<P>
   If the call is being made to another cell phone user, the MTSO
contacts the other cell phone using microwave signals. The signal
is sent to a series of base stations (and perhaps even a satellite
if the call is long-distance) and then is picked up by the
receiving cell phone.

TEXAS TOWN BASKS IN NIKE ADS' SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The make-believe town of ``Bracketville,'' a basketball
community conjured up and sponsored by Nike to promote the NCAA
Basketball Tournament, might soon lose its fictional standing and
be swallowed up by the very real South Texas town of Brackettville.
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds, maybe thousands of people, they were never
different places to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local people are in an uproar about it,'' said
Brackettville City Manager David Luna. ``They want to know how it
happened and what can we do to get more exposure. They love it.''
</P>
<P>
   An ad agency conceived Bracketville, the Nike town with just one
``t.'' The agency designed the town name to reflect the tournament
bracket that outlines the 64 teams that are invited to the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Brackettville, the Texas town, started as a general store built
near Fort Clark in Kinney County, just 22 miles from the Rio
Grande. Fort Clark was one in a series of forts built to protect
settlers from Comanche and Apache raiding parties. Fort Clark was
also the home of the famous Black Seminole Indian scouts, several
of whom became Medal of Honor winners.
</P>
<P>
   Brackettville is also the home of Alamo Village, the movie set
where John Wayne filmed the epic movie ``The Alamo.'' The set
remains as a family theme park and continues to be a movie set.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 2,000 people who live in Brackettville appear to like
basketball OK, but there isn't a local college that can aspire to
the national tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In the fictional Bracketville, everybody loves basketball and
the local drive-in theater shows basketball movies all the time.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a drive-in in Brackettville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out-of-town people have been calling here asking where they
can go to buy a Nike hat or something, so they can say they bought
it in Brackettville,'' Luna said. ``We have to tell them we don't
have a place in Brackettville that sells Nike products.''
</P>
<P>
   The city manager said he thinks that might change if the
sporting goods company decides to make the Bracketville commercials
a yearly event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked to the promotional people who handled the
commercials for Nike and they contacted the company,'' Luna said.
``They let them (Nike) know that all this interest had occurred and
Nike ended up sending 21 boxes of balls and bats and sports-related
items to the schools here.''
</P>
<P>
   Luna said Nike is now the favored brand name at the local
schools, and school teams are hoping for a lasting relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a big-time public relations gain for Nike,''
Luna said of his southwest Texas community between Uvalde and Del
Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Because the public has made a connection between the fictitious
town and the real one, Nike has sent film crews into Brackettville
to shoot additional footage for their commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shot at the courthouse and at the hardware store that's
smack dab in the middle of town,'' Luna said. ``They shot at two or
three places, and I have a feeling there will be more of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city manager said local people are clamoring for more,
enjoying the new spotlight on their community. ``They want us to do
more, but you and I both know the tournament is winding down and
when it's over, it's over,'' Luna said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are lingering hopes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools are quite interested in advertising for Nike. They
think they might get a scoreboard out of it.''

FORMER OFFICIAL CHALLENGES CHINA TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A former senior official who spent seven years in
prison for sympathizing with democracy advocates has challenged the
authorities to abide by the Chinese Constitution and stop
restricting his freedom to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   The former official, Bao Tong, 67, has risked re-arrest over the
last year and a half with public calls for democratic changes and a
re-appraisal of the 1989 student demonstrations in Tiananmen
Square, which were officially labeled as counter-revolutionary and
violently crushed.
</P>
<P>
   On March 13, as China worked to fend off a U.S.-sponsored
resolution censuring China's rights record at a U.N. meeting in
Geneva, Bao wrote a letter to the Chinese authorities. It was
distributed to reporters Tuesday by Human Rights Watch, a group
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Bao charged that the government had whitewashed
its human rights record in a recent report and that based on his
own treatment he felt he had to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an old man, and I have neither fear nor illusions, but I
feel obligated to confront such violation of a citizen's civil
rights, even if that means my own imprisonment,'' Bao wrote.
</P>
<P>
   By continuing his lonely advocacy here _ most dissidents are now
in prison or in exile _ Bao is taking a serious risk. Although he
theoretically regained his rights as a citizen in May 1998, he said
in the letter that security agents have since warned him eight
times that his statements ``endangered state security.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bao granted many interviews to foreign journalists
despite harassment and warnings from officials. In the letter he
said his treatment had worsened in recent months, with six agents
following him day and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come with me when I accompany my granddaughter to school,
and when I go to the hospital, bank or shops,'' he wrote. ``They
watch very closely to see who I talk to, what I do and what I
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Bao challenged the authorities to compare his treatment with the
right to free speech enshrined in China's Constitution and laws,
and urged the U.N. Human Rights Commission, which is meeting in
Geneva, to note the inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, when student demonstrations in favor of democratic
change erupted, Bao was a senior aide to the Communist Party
chairman at the time, Zhao Ziyang, helping him to plan economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In late May 1989, less than two weeks before the army crushed
the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square and Zhao was ousted for
being too soft, Bao was arrested and imprisoned, ostensibly for
sharing information about the coming crackdown with the students.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years in prison he had two years of virtual house
arrest with no political rights. But in May 1998, when that
probation ended, he defiantly spoke to foreign reporters, saying
China urgently needed political change. He has been under police
scrutiny ever since, required to live in a monitored apartment
where his telephone is sometimes shut off.
</P>
<P>
   His former boss, Zhao, has been under house arrest since 1989
even though no legal charges were filed against him.

PATTI SMITH IS BACK, AND SHE'S STILL `GUNG HO'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Forget the '60s,'' punk/poet icon Patti Smith said in an
interview at last week's South by Southwest conference, ``and the
'70s and the '80s and the '90s. We're living in the 21st century.
There's work to be done and fun to be had.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day she was onstage at Austin's Waterloo Park,
hollering, ``People, the time is now! Wake up! Wake up!'' as her
amazing, two-hour-plus show crashed to a close in a howl of
feedback and shredded guitar strings.
</P>
<P>
   To be a longtime fan was to leave the show with a sense of
profound happiness _ and relief.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is one of the most important, elusive voices to emerge
from the New York punk scene, an adventurer who dared to mix poetry
indebted to Arthur Rimbaud and music indebted to '60s rock and soul
into a shape-changing, valiant whole.
</P>
<P>
   And to see her back _ radiant, singing as well as ever, leading
a crack band and dancing like a high schooler _ is a thrill of
major proportions, because of what she's done, and what she hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   After establishing herself with records such as her 1975 debut
``Horses'' and its follow-up, '76's ``Radio Ethiopia,'' Smith's
career has been one of long gaps, few live appearances, and more
than a little tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the worst times have been the most recent. Smith
released nothing between 1979's ``Wave'' and 1988's ``Dream of
Life,'' preferring to live in suburban Detroit, raising children
with her husband, former MC5 guitarist Fred ``Sonic'' Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was another long gap _ until 1996, when she put out
``Gone Again.'' That CD, and '97's ``Peace and Noise,'' were dark
records that explored a host of losses: Her husband; former
bandmate Richard Sohl; Kurt Cobain; her brother Todd; and her
one-time roommate Robert Mapplethorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Released last week, ``Gung Ho'' is a far more upbeat,
pop-friendly affair, filled with hope for community and romance _
and historical references that include Ho Chi Minh, the slave trade
and Gen. George Custer's wife. It's as if Smith has been healed by
time and is now ready to take on the world again, and this
positivity and a sense of purpose and immediacy easily carry ``Gung
Ho'' past a few clunker couplets and ``Libbie's Song,'' an
unsuccessful stab at country.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Voice'' begins the CD with these lines: ``In the garden of
consciousness/In fertile mind there lies the dormant seed.'' As the
song progresses, you realize that in Smith's perfect world we would
all help out someone less fortunate. Several songs later, on
``Upright Come,'' she sings ``Swift is the arrow/Dark is the
thorn/The slate is clean/The future awaits/Awake.''
</P>
<P>
   These sentiments may be viewed as corny and archaic in this
irony-obsessed world, but Smith makes her case very well. She was
always an outsider, an iconoclast, a rebel, and watching her at the
Austin show was a delight: After 25 years, Patti Smith can still
summon up the fierce joy of being alive, can still address the
world in ways that make us think a little harder.
</P>
<P>
   She carries with her an appreciation for rock's history and for
how today and yesterday intersect.
</P>
<P>
   Two examples: ``Strange Messengers,'' which Smith wrote with
longtime guitarist Lenny Kaye, is a heart-rending look at slavery.
With a nod to the first great anti-slave song, the Billie Holiday
classic ``Strange Fruit,'' Smith casts the slaves as bearers of
history, totems for man's inhumanity to man, people whose cries and
pain will be heard as long as we remember the past and try to learn
from it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Glitter in Their Eyes,'' a fun, upbeat pop-rock
song with an instantly memorable chorus that warns young people
against being simply mindless consumers: ``They'll trade you
up/Trade you down/Your body a commodity/Our sacred stage/Has been
defaced/Replaced to grace/The marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   A more searing indictment against the dumbing-down of pop music
and pop culture can scarcely be imagined _ and the fact that Smith
casts it in what could be a pop-radio hit just makes it hit all the
harder.
</P>
<P>
   This is Smith at her best: Cunning, angry, literate, moral,
intriguing, vital. ``Gung Ho'' is a swirl of images and topics, one
that is not afraid to move through a variety of emotions or shoot
for the moon and sometimes miss. When Smith succeeds, she is
brilliant. When she misses, she misses big. But at least she isn't
afraid to lay her soul and her thoughts bare.
</P>
<P>
   That was once the norm in rock 'n' roll, and now it's the
exception. And in that way Smith is the most impressive sort of
veteran rocker: She sings these songs with the zeal of a
19-year-old cutting a debut, tempered with the hard truths and
knowledge of the world that are (or should be) part and parcel of
being a 52-year-old mother and widow. And in combining the two, she
now sounds like both an oracle and a wandering spirit.

<P>
   KYOTO _ The woman who in inspired ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' the
best-selling novel about Japan which is soon to be filmed by Steven
Spielberg, is threatening to sue its American author, accusing him
of libelling her in his depiction of the book's central character.
</P>
<P>
   The principal complaint of Mineko Iwasaki, the legendary Kyoto
geisha who supplied much of the detail about life in the closed
world of Japan's pleasure quarters is with Arthur Golden's detailed
descriptions of the custom known as mizuage, by which a geisha's
virgnity is auctioned off among her patrons to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong, wrong, all, ALL wrong,'' she told The Independent
in an interview at her home in the old Japanese capital, Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I would never sell myself for any amount of
money... He says that it is fiction, but people do not read it in
that way. They think it is my story, they think that I did all
those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its publication in 1997, ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' has sold
4 million copies in English and been translated into 21 languages.
Spielberg has bought the rights to make the film, and has already
sent researchers to scout out locations.
</P>
<P>
   But in Gion, Kyoto's famous and exclusive geisha quarter, where
the action of the book is set, the shutters have come down since
the publication of a Japanese translation last November.
</P>
<P>
   A debate about the book organized by its Japanese publisher had
to be cancelled after it was collectively boycotted by the Gion
geisha community.
</P>
<P>
   According to people in Kyoto, the geisha are furious that the
book's success has torn the veil from their closed and secretive
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Gion, there are things that are tacitly understood, but not
discussed publicly,'' says Yoshiki Nishiyama, of Golden's Japanese
publisher, Bungei Shunju. ``Because this book is written in such
detail, people can't accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden insists that, despite being fiction, the details of the
book are accurate and he stands by his claim that the details of
mizuage were given to him by Mrs. Iwasaki based on her own
experience of deflowerment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never have said such a thing if I'd thought that she'd
have been so upset,'' says Golden. ``But she's seen any number of
articles in which I discuss what she told me with great pride, and
she's never objected before.'' &QL;

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The film actors who attracted the most enthusiastic
reviews this Oscar season are not to be found in Hollywood, or even
in the movies, but thousands of miles away in a modestly budgeted
production of a Sam Shepard play on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   This might be awards season in the movie industry, but when it
comes to current productions, there is nothing on screen to match
the adulation being poured over Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C.
Reilly, both of them veterans of the films of Paul Thomas Anderson,
as they take alternating turns at playing Austin and Lee, the two
brothers in Shepard's play ``True West.''
</P>
<P>
   Their complementary performances have been likened by The New
York Times to a prizefight, ``the season's most exciting slugfest
by far.''
</P>
<P>
   The Circle in the Square Theatre is booked out for weeks. And
while there is nothing unusual about prominent film actors making a
splash on stage (think of Dustin Hoffman in ``Death of a Salesman''
a few years ago and, more recently, Brian Dennehy), the fact it is
Reilly and Hoffman causing a stir is curious, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them are about as far from the classic image of a movie
star as one can imagine. Neither is particularly dashing in looks _
in fact, both are distinctly chubby _ and neither tries much to
give a good account of his physical attributes.
</P>
<P>
   As for cultivating an on-screen persona, Hoffman has been
particularly fearless in playing repellent characters (including
the masturbating computer engineer in ``Happiness'' and the
snobbish Freddie Miles in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'').
</P>
<P>
   In other words, unlike Paul Newman and Robert Redford and the
other sexpot male stars of times past, the pair's appeal is based
entirely on their electrifying acting talents. And as such, they
could just be the new kings of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, something very odd is happening to the image of
the leading man, and it's not only hits on Broadway that bear this
out.
</P>
<P>
   Just take a look at the list of best-actor nominees at this
year's Oscar ceremony. Of the five, only Denzel Washington is true
matinee-idol material. The others, not so long ago, would have been
placed firmly in the category of character actors, not leads.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey may have a fascinating face but he is nobody's idea
of a classic good-looker; Russell Crowe is way too tortured and
angst-ridden to have carried the Hollywood blockbusters of old; as
for Richard Farnsworth, at 79 the oldest nominee ever, he has been
stuck with bit parts his whole career until now.
</P>
<P>
   But where the character actors are triumphing, the more
conventional leading men seem by contrast to be treading water or
even floundering badly.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford suffered a big-budget bomb last year (``Random
Hearts'') and has dropped out of the lead in Steven Soderbergh's
upcoming drug-trade movie, ``Traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicholson has not worked in three years. Leonardo DiCaprio
made heavy weather of choosing his lead role in ``The Beach,'' only
a modest box-office success, and is now agonizing once again over
what he should do next.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis had a better year, thanks to the runaway success of
``The Sixth Sense,'' but that was a shoestring project he picked
for love of the craft. His supposed blockbuster, ``The Story of
Us,'' co-starring Michelle Pfeiffer, fizzled and died in a few
short weeks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most successful of Hollywood's A-list men last year
was Tom Cruise, but that success came largely by breaking the
A-list rules.
</P>
<P>
   First he took 14 months out to appear in Stanley Kubrick's
``Eyes Wide Shut'' _ hardly mainstream material, despite the big
marketing push from Warner Bros. _ then he took a massive cut in
pay to play a macho sex guru in P.T. Anderson's distinctly arty
ensemble piece ``Magnolia.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Peter Bart, the editor-in-chief of the trade-bible Variety,
wrote recently, ``No one's taking up a collection for unemployed
superstars, but their absence reminds us of a phenomenon that has
agents and studio executives worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when Hollywood, more than ever, depends on
star-driven vehicles, it's getting harder to put the stars together
with the vehicles.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just the actors who are undergoing a radical
change. Much of Hollywood's top talent is seemingly in a crisis of
one sort or another. James Cameron, director of the most successful
movie of all time, ``Titanic,'' has yet to name a follow-up
project.
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Tarantino, hailed as the face of the next wave in
American cinema a few years ago, has all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Even Steven Spielberg, the most revered man in Hollywood, with
the apparent freedom to do exactly as he chooses, has only just
made up his mind what film to make next (the Kubrick
work-in-progress ``A.I.'') after a three-year hiatus, the longest
in his 30-year directing career. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is all this just coincidence? Or the result of Hollywood's
well-known propensity for unpredictability? Or is it the sign of
something more significant?
</P>
<P>
   One clear consequence of the loss of direction in the mainstream
is the quirky, refreshingly original, often subversive nature of
this year's Oscar-nominated movies. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 900) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The film included a critique of the hallowed American family
(``American Beauty''), an attack on U.S. corporate values (``The
Insider''), a wacky headtrip of a film about celebrity and
individuality (``Being John Malkovich''), a comedy of manners about
two late-Victorians (``Topsy-Turvy''), and a slow-moving saga about
a lawn mower (``The Straight Story'').
</P>
<P>
   It's just as well ``American Beauty'' found its unexpectedly
large audience, or else the Academy might have had to contemplate
giving its grand prize to a film almost nobody had seen. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it would be a mistake to declare the star system dead _
just look at Tom Hanks, who has hardly put a foot wrong in years,
or Julia Roberts, who can score a hit whether her films are good
(like the sassy legal drama ``Erin Brockovich'' which just opened
in the U.S.), so-so (``Notting Hill''), or awful (``Runaway
Bride'').
</P>
<P>
   But true stars like these are increasingly rare, their number
and reliability rarely justifying the monstrously large paychecks
they receive.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing feeling at the big studios that the A-list
has largely priced itself out of the market. Cost-cutting is the
watchword everywhere these days, and memories of Demi Moore's
bloated $12 million payday for a stinker such as ``Striptease'' are
still fresh in many minds. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FOURTH OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Andrew MacDonald and Danny Boyle, producer and director of
``The Beach,'' have admitted, the presence of a star like Leonardo
DiCaprio on set skews everything and pushes up costs to such an
extent that it becomes a distraction, regardless of the depth of
the star's talent. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FOURTH TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the past, this superstar warp effect didn't matter because
audiences seemed to respond to big names, big action and big
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``high concept'' movie, which should have been
called the low-concept movie because it consisted of an idea that
could be rendered in 25 words or less, was the crowning triumph of
the industry deal-makers in the 1980s, but also the near-death of
cinema as an art form.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons of cost, audience fatigue and increased artistic
ambition, the high-concept movie nowadays seems to be on the way
out. The likes of ``Godzilla,'' ``Armageddon,'' ``Wild Wild West''
and the latter-day Batman films have barely justified their
dizzying price tags in box-office returns.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a leading lieutenant of Dreamworks SKG's Jeffrey
Katzenberg, one of the inventors of the genre, even went so far as
to declare that ``the high-concept movie is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign of the times, Disney is embarking on its
forthcoming grand spectacle ``Pearl Harbor'' with a financing plan
more common to low-budget independent movies: it is asking
everyone, from director to crew, to agree to work on deferred
payments, which is to say their salaries will only be made up in
full if the film is a success. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,400, OR CONTINUE TO 1,700) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   These days, the studios try to steer clear of producing too many
films themselves, preferring to leave the nitty-gritty to small
independent outfits with which they have struck distribution
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a desire to imitate the success of an independent
company such as Miramax, now part of the Disney family, has turned
into a convenient way of avoiding excessive financial risk; the
happy consequence of this has been a far greater audacity and
artistic freedom than was ever possible in the more centralized
days of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And it has eroded the power of stars in favor of the director,
the hands-on producer and even that much-maligned Hollywood animal,
the screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this new atmosphere more apparent than during the
Oscars circus. A few years ago, it was the big studio films that
went up for Academy Awards; the winners were essentially a perfect
expression of what Hollywood perceived its ideal product to be.
</P>
<P>
   Now the game has grown much more complicated. The awards have
turned into a marketing tool whereby relatively small films can be
grown into much bigger ones (look at ``Pulp Fiction,'' or ``The
English Patient,'' or ``Shakespeare in Love'' _ not,
coincidentally, all Miramax pictures).
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that winning an Oscar was the great achievement,
and the guarantee of a nice earnings hike at the box-office.
Nowadays, the real knack is to be nominated, and then to milk the
attention the nominations bring for all they are worth.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy accounts for much of Miramax's success and is now
widely copied by the other prestige companies in Hollywood such as
Dreamworks SKG and New Line. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey may have a fascinating face but he is nobody's idea

for Richard Farnsworth, at 79 the oldest nominee ever, he has been

made heavy weather of choosing his lead role in ``The Beach,'' only
a modest box-office success, and is now agonizing once again over

<P>
   Bruce Willis had a better year, thanks to the runaway success of
``The Sixth Sense,'' but that was a shoestring project he picked

company such as Miramax, now part of the Disney family, has turned

artistic freedom than was ever possible in the more centralized

   HOLLYWOOD _ The film actors who attracted the most enthusiastic
reviews this Oscar season are not to be found in Hollywood, or even
in the movies, but thousands of miles away in a modestly budgeted
production of a Sam Shepard play on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   This might be awards season in the movie industry, but when it
comes to current productions, there is nothing on screen to match
the adulation being poured over Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C.
Reilly, both of them veterans of the films of Paul Thomas Anderson,
as they take alternating turns at playing Austin and Lee, the two
brothers in Shepard's play ``True West.''
</P>
<P>
   Their complementary performances have been likened by The New
York Times to a prizefight, ``the season's most exciting slugfest
by far.''
</P>
<P>
   The Circle in the Square Theatre is booked out for weeks. And
while there is nothing unusual about prominent film actors making a
splash on stage (think of Dustin Hoffman in ``Death of a Salesman''
a few years ago and, more recently, Brian Dennehy), the fact it is
Reilly and Hoffman causing a stir is curious, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them are about as far from the classic image of a movie
star as one can imagine. Neither is particularly dashing in looks _
in fact, both are distinctly chubby _ and neither tries much to
give a good account of his physical attributes.
</P>
<P>
   As for cultivating an on-screen persona, Hoffman has been
particularly fearless in playing repellent characters (including
the masturbating computer engineer in ``Happiness'' and the
snobbish Freddie Miles in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'').
</P>
<P>
   In other words, unlike Paul Newman and Robert Redford and the
other sexpot male stars of times past, the pair's appeal is based
entirely on their electrifying acting talents. And as such, they
could just be the new kings of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, something very odd is happening to the image of
the leading man, and it's not only hits on Broadway that bear this
out.
</P>
<P>
   Just take a look at the list of best-actor nominees at this
year's Oscar ceremony. Of the five, only Denzel Washington is true
matinee-idol material. The others, not so long ago, would have been
placed firmly in the category of character actors, not leads.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey may have a fascinating face but he is nobody's idea
of a classic good-looker; Russell Crowe is way too tortured and
angst-ridden to have carried the Hollywood blockbusters of old; as
for Richard Farnsworth, at 79 the oldest nominee ever, he has been
stuck with bit parts his whole career until now.
</P>
<P>
   But where the character actors are triumphing, the more
conventional leading men seem by contrast to be treading water or
even floundering badly.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford suffered a big-budget bomb last year (``Random
Hearts'') and has dropped out of the lead in Steven Soderbergh's
upcoming drug-trade movie, ``Traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicholson has not worked in three years. Leonardo DiCaprio
made heavy weather of choosing his lead role in ``The Beach,'' only
a modest box-office success, and is now agonizing once again over
what he should do next.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis had a better year, thanks to the runaway success of
``The Sixth Sense,'' but that was a shoestring project he picked
for love of the craft. His supposed blockbuster, ``The Story of
Us,'' co-starring Michelle Pfeiffer, fizzled and died in a few
short weeks. &QL;

FASTER THAN YOU CAN SAY SOUP 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be hard to find a more powerfully complex natural
convenience food than miso. This Japanese paste of fermented beans
(usually soy), grains (usually rice) and salt can be a revelation
to the home cook looking to give food a fast flavor boost.
</P>
<P>
   Miso _ think of it as soy sauce squared, more intense but not
saltier _ can be used in dressings for salads, meats, tofu and
vegetables. It is often mixed with sesame seeds, mirin (sweet
wine), sake or even eggs to make an intensely flavored sauce.
</P>
<P>
   But miso's most amazing feat is turning a cup of hot water into
soup in about 30 seconds. This ultrasimple soy-based soup _ a
tablespoon of miso whisked or blended into water _ is delicious.
</P>
<P>
   The soup can be used in place of stock in many recipes calling
for Asian flavors, but you have to take care, as it has much more
character than most stocks and could easily overpower the other
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional miso soup _ the kind served throughout Japan and in
most Japanese restaurants in the United States _ is a little more
complicated, and begins with dashi, a Japanese stock made with kelp
(konbu) and flakes of dried bonito (a relative of tuna). Although
dashi has definite character and is easy enough to make, it is a
light stock, pretty much overpowered by the miso anyway. For the
home cook, it is usually not worth the extra work.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer to put my energy into turning miso soup into a meal,
adding cubed tofu and a couple of vegetables _ minced scallions or
carrots, or some sliced shiitakes _ at the last moment. Those who
do not find tofu alluring might throw some shrimp or boneless
chicken pieces into the soup, where they will cook in two or three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The best miso (and the kind most commonly found in stores)
develops its flavor over months or years of fermentation and aging.
Depending on other ingredients, it can be smooth or lumpy, and it
ranges in color from white (actually tan, in most cases) to yellow
(golden) to red or brown.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, thick, dark brown hatcho miso is used to make
soup, but the lighter varieties, which are more often used to make
dressings and sauces, are fine too.
</P>
<P>
   Fine miso is unpasteurized, containing cultures as yogurt and
cheese do, and inexpensive: it's tough to spend more than $8 on a
pound. It is sold in plastic tubs or jars in Japanese markets
(Katagiri, at 224 East 59th Street, has an extensive selection),
although other stores, including those that sell natural foods,
carry it as well. It has a long shelf life, keeping for at least
several months in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a quick-made pasteurized miso, which does not
contain living cultures. It might last even longer, but has
decidedly less character.
</P>
<P>
   But about that soup: figure about a tablespoon of miso per cup
of water, which means about a third of a cup to serve four people.
You may like the soup more or less intensely flavored, but don't
make the common mistake of new cooks and use too much: the soup may
be too strong to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The only trick lies in dissolving the miso properly so that you
create a smooth, almost creamy soup rather than a lumpy one. Just
whisk or blend the miso with a few tablespoons of hot water before
adding the rest of the liquid. Cook the soup gently, for just a
minute or so, to preserve the miso's flavor and aroma. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEARLY INSTANT MISO SOUP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 15 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup miso, preferably dark
</P>
<P>
   { pound tofu, cut into {-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   \ cup peeled and minced carrots
</P>
<P>
   \ cup peeled and minced scallions. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Turn
heat to low, and mix about { cup water with miso in a bowl or
blender; whisk or blend until smooth. (If you have an immersion
blender, the fastest and easiest tool for this, do the operation in
a tall measuring cup.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Pour miso mixture back into hot water and add tofu and
carrots; stir once or twice and let sit for a minute, just long
enough to heat tofu through. Add scallions and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: For miso soup with shrimp or chicken, substitute
{-inch cubes of peeled shrimp (deveined, if you like) or boneless,
skinless chicken for tofu. Cook 2 minutes, or until nearly done.
Add carrots and, when soup is done, scallions.

&HT;     SCIENTISTS PUZZLED ABOUT TREATING EFFECTS OF GASOLINE
ADDITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Decades after they approved the use of the
gasoline additive MTBE to clean the air, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency scientists still do not know how to effectively
remove it from soil and ground water or how to treat people who
inadvertently consume it.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientists do know that the bad-tasting chemical has
adversely affected ground water in at least 38 states, according to
members of the American Chemical Society who met in San Francisco
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the EPA has yet to study the health effective of the
additive or found efficient, inexpensive ways to clean up the
thousands of sites where MTBE has leaked from boats, cars,
refineries, pipelines or underground tanks into water, said Matthew
Small, an EPA researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the problem is there. We know the problem is real. We
know the problem is growing,'' Small said. ``The states want EPA to
complete human health studies that lead to (standards). It's going
to take time.''
</P>
<P>
   Small estimated that it would be 2006 before there was an
enforceable federal standard.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Davis, senior scientist in the EPA's National Center
for Environmental Assessment in Research Triangle Park, N.C., said
the EPA has been working with other agencies to try to determine
the health effects of MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   But most of its effort has been aimed at measuring effects of
inhaling MTBE as people stand by gas pumps, and not from drinking
it as a pollutant in water, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   At least three studies have found that MTBE causes cancer in lab
animals. In 1997, an influential interagency task force, of which
the EPA is a member, determined that MTBE had the potential to
cause cancer in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the EPA had not been quick to launch human health
studies because ``information we had under (the law) in late 1980s
and early 1990s didn't show MTBE was toxic relevant to other toxics
we see.''
</P>
<P>
   California and Alaska already have decided to phase out MTBE,
and other states are considering it.
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfied with EPA's record, a San Francisco environmental
group, Communities for a Better Environment, filed a petition
Monday with the EPA asking it to regulate MTBE under the Toxic
Substances Control Act.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol Browner announced last week that she
would seek to regulate MTBE under the toxic substances law, which
would let the agency limit or ban the chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Browner also asked Congress to give EPA the authority to move
even more quickly to control it and to replace the requirement for
the use of an additive in heavy air pollution areas with a standard
to use renewable fuels like ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA authorized the use of MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl
ether, as an octane booster in the 1970s. The Clean Air Act of 1990
required that regions with severe air pollution use an
oxygen-adding compound such as MTBE or ethanol, an alcohol, to
reduce the auto emissions that form smog.
</P>
<P>
   Most gasoline with such additives contains MTBE. Refineries
chose it because it is made of products related to refining. Many
Midwestern states selected ethanol, which comes from corn and other
organic matter. Thus far, ethanol has not created ground water
problems, though some scientists think it can exacerbate MTBE
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers started to find widespread problems with MTBE in
water supplies by the early 1990s. The chemical dissolves in water
and does not cling to soil particles. It moves 75 times faster
through the ground than other pollutants in gasoline such as
toluene, xylene and benzene.
</P>
<P>
   At least people know when MTBE is there, say scientists. They
complain of a bad taste at about 0.5 parts per billion compared to
above 5 parts per billion with a solvent like trichloroethylene, or
TCE.
</P>
<P>
   Some MTBE cleanup methods have worked on a small scale by
forcing oxygen into the ground water, encouraging bacteria that
eats the MTBE. Others have pumped the water through carbon filters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 38 states, the EPA reported that:
</P>
<P>
   _ In California, 40 wells in public water systems are
contaminated with MTBE, among them South Lake Tahoe, Santa Monica,
San Jose and Napa.
</P>
<P>
   _ New Hampshire has found MTBE in 215, or 18 percent, of its
1,150 public water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maine has located MTBE in 16 percent of its private wells.
</P>
<P>
   _ Montana's public wells are thus far free of MTBE, but 30
percent to 50 percent of its leaking underground storage tanks show
the additive in the plume created by the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Kansas, 18 of 1,122 public water supply system have wells
contaminated with MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wisconsin, which uses more ethanol than MTBE, still has MTBE
in half of its leaking underground fuel tanks. In the southwest
corner of the state, there is a 4,500-foot plume containing MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Baltimore and Washington metropolitan area has MTBE in 66
of 1,060 public water systems. More than 210 private wells contain
MTBE.

CHOCOLATE COFFEE CREME BRULEE

<P>
   Creme brulee is all about contrast, about the way the crackling
crust of hot caramelized sugar yields to the creamy richness of the
cold custard underneath. It's a perfect dessert made with just
vanilla, but I wanted to take it to another level.
</P>
<P>
   Literally.
</P>
<P>
   What I conceived is a layering of two separate flavored custards
under that crunchy crust. A spoon scooped into this creme brulee
captures not just the caramelized topping but also a base of
chocolate and a center of coffee custard. The flavors almost
cascade.
</P>
<P>
   Odd as it may sound, I took my inspiration for layering from a
fish terrine made with a base of pale ivory fish mousse under an
intense orange lobster mousse. To combine them neatly, the bottom
layer is frozen before the top layer is added. I wasn't sure if
this technique would work with custards, which are thin and runny
compared with firm mousses.
</P>
<P>
   My pastry chef, Chris Broberg, put my concept to the test.
First, he made a dark chocolate custard _ like the most intense
chocolate pudding you can imagine _ and froze it in ramekins
overnight.
</P>

   The next day, he poured a coffee custard over the tops, then
baked the ramekins until the edges were set.
</P>
<P>
   Once they cooled, we could see that our little trick had worked.
The top layer solidifies before the bottom layer melts.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage to this creme brulee is that most of it can be _
in fact, must be _ made in advance. The custards can be baked up to
two days ahead (though one day is optimal), then caramelized just
before serving.
</P>
<P>
   I like to keep the caramel layer very, very thin, just a hint of
crackle across the top. We use a miniature blowtorch to caramelize
the sugar, but a broiler works very well.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the custards very carefully, moving them around if they
begin to caramelize unevenly, and pulling any from the heat before
they get too dark. Bitterness from burning ruins the contrast.

   CHOCOLATE-COFFEE CREME BRULEE
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 2 hours, plus overnight freezing and chilling
</P>
<P>
   For the chocolate custard: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3{ tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   \ vanilla bean, halved lengthwise, seeds scraped out and
reserved
</P>
<P>
   For the coffee custard: &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   2{ tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon instant coffee
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   \ vanilla bean, halved lengthwise, seeds scraped out and
reserved
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra-fine granulated sugar.
</P>
<P>
   1. To prepare chocolate custard, whisk together 2 tablespoons
sugar and the cocoa in a small bowl. Bring cream to a simmer in a
small saucepan. Add cocoa mixture and whisk well. Return to a
simmer, then turn off heat and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, remaining
sugar and vanilla bean scrapings. Whisk in cooled cream mixture.
Strain custard through a fine sieve and divide among 6 4-ounce
ramekins or custard cups. Cover with plastic and freeze for at
least 8 hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. To prepare coffee custard, whisk
together the egg yolks, sugar and instant coffee in a medium bowl
until coffee dissolves. Whisk in the cream and vanilla bean
scrapings. Strain mixture, then pour it into ramekins over frozen
chocolate custard.
</P>
<P>
   4. Arrange ramekins in a baking pan and place it on oven rack.
Pour enough very hot water into pan to reach 2/3 of the way up
sides of ramekins. Cover baking pan with foil, and prick in a few
places with a knife. Bake custards 40 to 45 minutes, until set
around edges but still slightly jiggly in center. Transfer ramekins
to a rack and cool. Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours or
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   5. Right before serving, sprinkle a thin, even coating of
extra-fine granulated sugar on each custard. Using a preheated
broiler or kitchen blowtorch, caramelize sugar. It will take about
1 to 2 minutes under a broiler, about 30 seconds with a blowtorch.

TIME INC.'S NEW LAUNCH, REAL SIMPLE, DECLARES LESS IS MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who would have suspected when People magazine first appeared on
newsstands that it would spawn People en Espanol and Teen People?
And who would have predicted the visual impact of Martha Stewart
Living when it debuted to a collective response of ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Another seminal moment in magazine publishing could be happening
this week in a newsstand near you. The People magazine group, a
division of Time Inc., is launching Real Simple, a magazine that is
supposed to whack through the clutter of our lives and show us the
path to better living through having and wanting less stuff.
</P>
<P>
   It exists because of the ``voluntary simplicity movement,'' says
Susan Wyland, the magazine's managing editor. She says she is the
target audience, a woman ``overextended'' and ``struggling for
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   To create a vehicle for less, Real Simple carves a niche on the
bones of magazines that promoted more. Real Simple emulates many of
them, offering one-dish-dinner recipes, financial advice and a
stress-reduction technique. There is also a departure point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we wanted to do something different and relevant that
speaks to women. I thought, `What if there was a magazine that
could guide you in every aspect of your life?'''
</P>
<P>
   Wyland included pieces that address do-it-yourself rituals,
passion, meditation, nature and practical solutions _ elements that
are rarely found on other indexes.
</P>
<P>
   The look of Real Simple is in the familiar Martha mode. When
Martha Stewart Living premiered, its serene imagery changed the way
products were photographed and the way magazine pages were
designed. Designers, advertisers and photographers emulated the Zen
quality of light-filled, simple settings and heroic objects. That
style still rules the printed page. Real Simple dutifully follows,
adding a few edgy shadows, where Martha Stewart Living is heavy on
pastels.
</P>
<P>
   Wyland knows how to do the Martha look. She spent 3 1/2 years at
the helm of Martha Stewart Living. She is quite aware of the
similarities and refuses to diss the competition, even though her
efforts could pass for Martha Stewart Living Lite.
</P>
<P>
   But real simple does not mean easy, or inexpensive. Within the
fashion pages, $365 wool T-shirts are depicted as a ``new basic.''
What happens when you search for simplicity is found in an essay
from Meghan Daum, a writer who moved from Manhattan to Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that living a simple life of your own volition is
more difficult than living a complicated life because somebody else
told you to,'' writes Daum.
</P>
<P>
   Living more simply does not necessarily mean living with less or
without the products of such advertisers as Neiman Marcus, Ralph
Lauren and De Beers.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Sareyan, the magazine's publisher, tries to explain
the concept of simplicity. ``People want beauty; they don't want to
be deprived,'' he said. ``Simple is not about plain or
uncomplicated. It's about balance, being smart and having quality
over quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   Which seems a lot to ask of a monthly publication, even if it
does come from the makers of People, People En Espanol, InStyle and
Teen People _ a money-minting machine that pulls in $350 million in
pretax earnings for parent company Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   There are pieces that work _ establishing serene spaces in our
homes is a lovely idea. The photographs fairly hum with a
meditative mantra and are coupled with suggestions such as, ``Sleep
better by taking the stress out of your bedroom. Replace everything
that doesn't suggest relaxation _ a desk, a TV _ with comfortable
furniture and soft lighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The final page, a premium piece of magazine real estate, is
given to a meditation rather than to hyping multiple advertisers'
products. This, too, is a nice touch; it will be interesting to see
whether this element stays in this position.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of Real Simple raises a paradox _ if life is to be
kept simple, shouldn't we strive for fewer subscriptions and less
junk mail?
</P>
<P>
   Wyland address the junk-mail topic in her first issue but
maintains there is a constant, evolving need for the subjects she
and her editorial staff have planned. Living a life Real Simple
means a constant need for operating instructions.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict of interests is not lost on media watchers. ``How
many things can you make simple?'' asks Steve Greenberger, a senior
vice president at MediaCom. Even the big-office guys at Time were
skeptical. Norman Pearlstine, Time editor in chief, admitted as
much to The Wall Street Journal. ``A number of us had a hard time
imagining the table of contents to take it forward, but the more I
have seen it, the more I have come to understand it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are parts of the magazine that cause an upward strain on
the eyebrows. A millennial spin is put on tuna-noodle casserole by
turning it into Tuna Noodle Bowl. Capers, carrots, sugar-snap peas,
tuna and bowtie pasta are piled, artistically, into a shallow dish
that is sure to be scorned by most children.
</P>
<P>
   There is the obligatory skin-care story with multiple pages of
instruction on keeping the daily routine simple. Another story
covers paying your bills online, which is not new, but it does
illustrate a new department in many magazines _ the latest line on
online.
</P>
<P>
   Wyland, whose last job was with Family.com, the Disney family
Web site, says there will be an online-related story every month.
This connection to the online world is a natural, since America
Online and Time Warner are becoming one. Real Simple will be
featured on the AOL home page for the next month, and AOL
subscribers will be offered special magazine subscription rates.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else, the rate is $19.95 for the eight issues
planned for 2000, or $2.95 on the newsstand. Next year, there will
be 10 issues, with December/January and June/July as the double-up
months.
</P>
<P>
   This cross-pollination of print and PC is great at bolstering
the subscription sales. Anne Moore, president of the People group,
told The New York Times. ``We can leverage Time Inc. assets to
promote the magazine, and when you crank up AOL on top of that and
use the power of their 21 million subscribers _ well, put it this
way, I haven't broken out in a sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial printing for Real Simple is 400,000 _ the largest
first edition ever published by a Time Inc. start-up.
</P>
<P>
   There are problems with the first issue of Real Simple. In
trying to establish a unique look, several visual clues typical to
all magazines are deleted, and that makes reading this one a
challenge. The variety of type styles, columns widths, lack of
headlines and other missing graphic devices create visual
confusion. Is it an ad? Or is it a story? Where did the story
begin?
</P>
<P>
   Wyland admits there are graphic problems that they ``are
thinking about changing for the second issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine needs to find a workable style. The monthly format
is just the beginning of Real Simple. Wyland foresees books as the
logical extension of the simple life _ Real Simple Food, Real
Simple Clothes, Real Simple Looks.
</P>
<P>
   Really.

READING `WINNIE THE POOH' ON THE PC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know what it is about Winnie the Pooh that makes me want
to play with him. Not exactly how I like spending my Friday nights,
but I've gotta admit ``Disney's Winnie the Pooh Activity Center''
(Disney Interactive for PC, $40, all ages) has probably been the
most exciting thing happening in my social life since, well, the
Little Mermaid.
</P>
<P>
   This game revolves around the ``Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery
Day'' story. Through pop-up windows, players read the tale, while
at the same time solving a variety of challenges that star Winnie's
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Stop giggling _ this is actually pretty fun. I don't plan on
becoming an interior designer anytime soon, but helping clean up
and decorate Owl's room has occupied me for a few hours. Now if I
could only clean up my pigsty.
</P>
<P>
   Players must also guide Pooh and Piglet through an obstacle
course, build a bridge to stop floating debris and create matching
Heffalumps and Woozles _ whatever those are. I like Pooh and his
pals, but I don't like 'em ``that'' much.
</P>
<P>
   Think I have more racing games on my desk than I do nasty
Post-it notes from editors irked that I never turn my stories in on
time. Right now, the only one that's worth a flip _ the racing
games, not the editors _ is ``Ridge Racer 64'' (Namco for N64),
Nintendo's very successful attempt at porting over a game that did
so well on the Sony PlayStation, that old thing.
</P>
<P>
   Players choose from more than 25 cars and nine courses,
including four new courses that the PlayStation obviously couldn't
handle. That's where ``RR64'' excels: The courses are imaginative
and gorgeously detailed. We've seen construction sites and mountain
ranges and desert roads, but ever play a racing game in which the
course swings by a luxury liner? At night, with all the lights
glimmering? ``That's'' cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``RR'' also pays lots of attention to small details: smoking
tires, skid marks, working (and sometimes nonworking) headlights
and lens flares are all here, making the game that much more
realistic. Good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of ``Jackie Chan Stuntmaster'' (Midway for
PlayStation, ages 13 and up, $40) sounded as simple as it did
promising: Kick everyone's behind. But even in this day and age of
Next Gen gaming or whatever, it's easy to mess up something as
simple as a walk-around-and-beat-up-people fighting game.
``Jackie's'' got its cool moments, like you can waste three guys
with one pool stick. But the control's too unresponsive and the
game play's too clunky; it's more frustrating than fun. Rent one of
his movies, instead.

   UGANDA-CULT (Rugazi, Uganda) _ In one room, the concrete floor
looked a little newer and, on a hunch, the police began to dig.
First they found a human foot, sole upturned, poking up from the
rubble. Within a few hours Tuesday, 28 corpses were hauled out of a
pit _ carefully sealed over with cement, maybe months ago _ inside
the house owned by a leader of a cult in western Uganda. By dark,
the pit was only half emptied. It was, on one level, another
horrifying discovery in the two weeks since more than 300 people
were found burnt to death at a church not far from here. The death
toll, from three different sites, has now risen to at least 593.
There are at least two more suspected grave sites. But the
discovery of the pit may also indicate just how well-organized and,
perhaps longstanding, this march to mass murder in Uganda was. By

   SCOTUS-SEARCH (Washington) _ An anonymous tip that a person is
carrying a gun is not enough to justify a stop and frisk by the
police without some further sign that the information is reliable,
the Supreme Court ruled with surprising unanimity Tuesday. The
court rejected the argument put forward by Florida, the Clinton
administration and a broad coalition of state attorneys general
that because guns are inherently so dangerous, the police can act
on a tip involving a gun on the basis of less evidence than the
Constitution would otherwise require. While the decision was an
important ruling that placed a constitutional curb on a particular
type of police-citizen encounter, the court did not address the
more controversial and heavily freighted question of what actions
the police can take based not on a tip but on their own observation
and judgment. In the current climate of increased tension over
police tactics, the court's ruling in January that unprovoked
flight at the sight of a police officer can justify the police in
chasing and frisking the person may prove more significant. By

   TENN-EXECUTE (Nashville) _ Philip Workman, who was convicted of
killing a police officer during a fast-food restaurant robbery in
1981 in Memphis, could become the first person executed in
Tennessee in 40 years. Lawyers for Workman, whose execution is
scheduled for April 6, have made a fairly compelling case about the
fairness of his trial, including some ballistics evidence that
suggests the officer may have been killed by friendly fire from
other cops. The only eyewitness at the trial has recanted, saying
he fabricated his story after being coached and threatened by
police. And just a few weeks ago, the medical examiner turned over
a potentially exculpatory x-ray of the victim that had never been
seen by the defense. The issue may ultimately be whether Workman is
guilty of felony murder even if he didn't fire the fatal shot
because he clearly committed the crime that led to the officer's
death. The question is now before the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of
Appeals. By Kevin Sack. (1200 words)

   The word terroir, French for soil, has an almost mystical
meaning in Burgundy. It connotes not only the character of a
vineyard's soil but the soul of the terrain as expressed through
the wine.
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy, where vineyards are often divided into tiny plots
among many winemakers, the concept of terroir can be tested because
the source of the grapes is often easy to determine. But elsewhere,
terroir becomes trickier to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   In California, wines have long been identified by the dominant
grape rather than by the land where those grapes were grown. But as
Californians learned more about the characteristics of different
areas, they began to include geographical distinctions on labels.
</P>
<P>
   First came county designations and then subdivisions like
Carneros or Santa Maria Valley. Some wineries go even further and
identify the single vineyard from which their grapes were grown.
Sometimes these vineyards are owned outright by a single winery,
but in many cases independent grape-growers may sell their produce
to as many wineries as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton Ranch, a vineyard in the Russian River Valley of Sonoma
County, sells chardonnay grapes to more than two dozen wineries.
Back in 1967, when Warren Dutton first planted chardonnay grapes on
a 60-acre plot, it might have been easier to taste the wines for
terroir, but Dutton's son, Joe, said that today Dutton Ranch
consists of more than 1,000 acres scattered over 43 sites, too
broad an area for generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the wines I tasted shared a zesty acidity and bright
green-apple flavors. They seemed better able to stand up to oak
barrel aging than many chardonnays.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dutton said the vineyard sites are all within 10 miles of
one another and share the same climate. The Duttons, by the way,
have started their own winery, Sebastopol Vineyards. &QL;

   HBO boldly claims its latest original documentary is ``150
minutes of television that could save your life.'' And it delivers.
</P>
<P>
   The groundbreaking special ``Cancer: Evolution to Revolution,''
which premieres at 8 p.m. Thursday on HBO, is making the signal
available for free to all cable operators during its showings.
</P>
<P>
   Directed and produced by veteran health journalist Joseph Lovett
and narrated by tireless Hollywood cancer fund-raiser Lily
Tartikoff, the documentary urges cancer patients to take an active,
aggressive role in the treatment of their disease.
</P>
<P>
   This new kind of medical consumerism can be a lifesaver.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Gary Schine, a 46-year-old Rhode Island
businessman. Nine years ago, his physician told him there was no
hope to stop the disease. But Schine did his own research and found
a clinical trial in San Diego that had been recently approved. The
treatment put his cancer in remission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had listened to his doctor, he'd be dead,'' said Lovett,
who lost his father, two brothers and sister to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The special is not intended to encourage rebellion against
doctors. The underlying philosophy is that patients and doctors
should be partners in fighting the disease. And, in a field where
breakthroughs and advances occur on a monthly basis, many doctors
suffer information overload. A patient may spot an option to doctor
missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it inspires people to challenge their doctors, to go
out on their own and make sure they get as much information as they
can possibly get about their disease,'' said Tartikoff, whose
husband, Brandon, died of Hodgkin's disease in 1997 after battling
it for 16 years. ``The message of this special is to be active, to
be informed, to be smart and, at the very least, to never give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary provides a plethora of cancer resources, all of
which are also listed at www.hbo.com. Information also is available
at the National Cancer Institute's help line, (800) 422-6237.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett uses a combination of stunning statistics, intriguing
research and touching personal stories to present the state of
cancer in the new millennium. There is both humor and horror.
</P>
<P>
   In one segment, a young boy who lost his sister to cancer
screams, ``I hate cancer. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate
it.'' Women compare the scars of breast cancer surgery. And, in
another, a charming 11-year-old girl shows off her collection of
hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of my favorite ones,'' she says, smiling and
holding up a wild, multicolored hat for the camera, ``but it
doesn't match anything so I can't wear it.''

&HT;     IMAGES CAN DECEIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First impressions are important. In politics, early
images of presidential candidates often freeze in our heads
regardless of how irrational or inaccurate those perceptions may
be.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we have Vice President Al Gore seemingly stuck in a
permanent time frame as wooden and stiff, which is the way we saw
him during his cautious years as President Clinton's sidekick. And
Texas Gov. George W. Bush could live forever with a reputation for
being half a bubble off plumb, which stems primarily from his early
verbal stumbles on foreign policy questions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet common sense tells us that both men are far more complex,
intelligent and personable than their images. Boring dummies do not
quickly and overwhelmingly win the presidential nominations of
their parties.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is making a major effort to shake the totem pole problem,
but it is tough going. He truly does have a funny bone in private.
I have seen it in action. But getting that message out to the
public is a tedious process, requiring the accumulation of one
witty speech and interview after another.
</P>
<P>
   Gore gave such a speech last Saturday night before a cynical
audience of jaded journalists and prominent government officials.
He brought down the house with self-deprecating jokes and jolly
jabs at his rival, Bush. The laughter and the subsequent standing
ovation were bipartisan, which is the way it should be when an
American statesman turns in a great performance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore didn't write the lines himself. Anonymous speechwriters
were invented expressly to help out busy politicians. But at the
banquet, sponsored by a journalistic group called the Gridiron
Club, he produced some good ad libs and delivered his talk with
such gusto and glee that ``wooden'' seemed an outdated description.
</P>
<P>
   ``My inner alarm bells go off in a room where everyone's dressed
the same,'' he quipped, comparing the robes of the Buddhist monks
at his controversial 1996 fund-raiser with the white-tie uniform of
the male Gridiron guests. He made several cracks about the Buddhist
event, which has become symbolic of excessive campaign fund-raising
tactics. ``I remember wondering, `Which one is Richard Gere?''' he
joked.``And I remember admiring the majestic, burnt-umber robes and
thinking, `Hmmm earth tones.'
</P>
<P>
   `` So now it's down to George Bush and Al Gore,'' he went on.
``Finally, some refreshing new names in American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He confided that during a debate with Governor Bush, ``I'm going
to lay a little trap for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing off former Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen's famous put-down of President George Bush's running mate,
Dan Quayle, after Quayle compared himself with President John F.
Kennedy, Gore said,`` I'm going to say something critical so he has
to defend President Bush. That's when I'm going to say, Governor, I
knew George Bush. George Bush was a friend of mine. And you, sir,
are no George Bush which I think will hopelessly confuse him!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is also trying to shake off his early image in other ways _
for instance, proposing a new federal endowment fund to underwrite
elections as a way of achieving fundamental campaign finance reform
and getting himself off the hook as an abuser of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, is also working to change the early
impression voters got of his mental limitations.
</P>
<P>
   He refuses to do any more pop quizzes, at which he has proved to
be something less than a genius. He sticks to subjects he is
familiar with as governor and he is working on two things: trashing
Gore and using appearances where he can exhibit his considerable
personal charm.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is basically an affable fellow with more political smarts
than the public realizes. Gore does recognize Bush's intellect, and
while he is willing to joke about it, he does not underestimate it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush likes to accuse Gore of being ready to do and say anything
to get elected. But it takes one to know one. Bush proved in the
South Carolina primary he would stoop lower than a turtle if it
meant winning. Not a noble strategy, but not a stupid one either.
</P>
<P>
   So we have two smart, ambitious guys with good genes and
different views of how to run the country going head to head for
the presidency. We could do worse _ and have.

FINE VALUES FROM ITALY'S SUN-BAKED SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Southern Italy is torrid in more ways than one these days. In
the course of a few years it has become one of the most
sought-after wine-producing regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Not by wine drinkers, at least not yet, except for a handful of
smart folks who know enough to shrug off labels and grapes, and
concentrate on values. No, the wine people who are most interested
in southern Italy at the moment are big producers from the north
like Antinori, Santa Margherita and Zonin, who, lured by bargain
prices, are buying hundreds of acres of actual or potential
vineyard land, and importers from Britain and the United States
looking for good affordable wines.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the talk in the wine trade was of Tuscany,
Piedmont and the Veneto, with Lombardy, the Alto Adige and Friuli
following along. Now, Abruzzi, Campania, Apulia, Sicily and
Sardinia are hot topics, with Calabria, Basilicata and even obscure
Molise beginning to be known for their wine and wine potential.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if southern Italy hasn't been involved in wine in
the past. The Greeks, who colonized the region before Roman times,
called it Oenotria, which comes from the word oinos, Greek for
wine. Greco del Tufo, from Campania; greco di bianco and greco nero
from Calabria; and grechetto from north of Rome all trace their
origins to early Greek settlers.
</P>
<P>
   These sun-baked provinces have always produced wine, most of it
heavy alcoholic stuff shipped off in bulk for blending with thin
northern wines. There have been good wines made here, too. The
Mastroberardinos have been making fine wines near Naples for
generations, while families in Sicily have produced well-known
wines like Corvo and Regaleali for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds of other wines have been made and enjoyed in the
south, ignored by the Northerners and totally unknown to the rest
of the world. Suddenly, people are talking about grapes with names
like negroamaro, cannonau, primitivo, aglianico (which derives from
Hellenic) and the nero d'Avola, the best grape of Sicily and
perhaps one of the best in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Italy is usually defined as everything south of Rome,
plus the Abruzzi to the east and the islands of Sicily and
Sardinia. On the mainland, almost all of this region is cut off
from the north by the Appenine mountains, meaning it suffers few of
the weather problems that plague Tuscany and the Piedmont. It is an
area as yet untouched by large international demand; it's out of
reach for wine enthusiasts who drive down from Germany and
Switzerland to bid the prices of Italian wines up to Bordeaux and
Burgundy levels.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Italy is an impoverished region. Unemployment in the
Veneto, the booming industrial and wine-producing region around
Verona in the north, is about 4 percent. In the far south, it is 15
to 20 percent, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Italy, at least until now, has enjoyed a special kind
of stability, unknown in more modern cultures. As Leonardo
Locascio, an American importer, said: ``These regions have lived
under so many conquerors _ Greeks, Muslims, Normans, Spanish _ that
there has always been a visceral attachment to family and land,
particularly land. Property, at least until recently, never changed
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently,'' he explained, ``the price of a bottle of wine
rarely reflects rising land prices the way it does in northern
Italy, where prime vineyard land currently sells for $200,000 an
acre.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, low demand, a willing work force, good land prices and
unfamiliar wine names all contributed to what is still an
attractive relationship between price and quality. Many of these
wines are between $8 and $12 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the names are unfamiliar. Sicilian wines, for example,
have long been widely available in this country. Now, there are
some new ones. Try the La Segreta wines from Planeta, particularly
the merlot-based red. Or Regaleali's delightful Nozze d'Oro (Golden
Wedding) sauvignon blanc, created for the fifth wedding anniversary
of the owners, Giuseppe and Franca Tasca. Morgante's nero d'Avola,
which resembles a young syrah, is also worth seeking out.
</P>
<P>
   Sardinia, a truly remote wine source a decade ago, now exports
several intriguing wines from Argiolas, including Turriga, a red
blend of cannonau and malvasia nera, and a Cannonau di Sardegna
Riserva from Sella &AMP; Mosca, the island's largest wine producer.
Cannonau is the local name for grenache, the principal grape in
Spain, which once owned Sardinia. For a unique but engaging
cabernet sauvignon, try the barrel-aged Marchese di Villamarina,
also from Sella &AMP; Mosca.
</P>
<P>
   Mastroberardino is still the most respected wine name in
Campania, and for me its most respected red is its Taurasi, made
from the aglianico grape. The riserva is aged up to four years and
can be laid down for many more. Falerno del Massico Rosso, from the
Villa Matilde, is another Campania red worth sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Mastroberardino is also the best-known source of
greco del Tufo, a fine dry wine with a hint of almonds on the
palate. For an inexpensive red that still manages to display some
complexity, the Copertino Riserva, made from the negroamaro grape
at a cooperative in Apulia, is a good bet, although, like others on
this list, not yet widely distributed. The Vigna Spano from Calo,
another Apulia producer, is a bigger wine, with depth and a long
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Another Apulian wine rather well known in America is Salice
Salentino, also made from the negroamaro grape. It, too, is a big
wine, made to last. A prominent producer is Taurino. It also comes
in a rose version. (One day, southern Italy's rose wines will be
much sought after. They are lighter than the reds but have body and
lots of flavor. Some people apparently age them successfully.)
</P>
<P>
   The aglianico grape turns up in another relatively well-known
red wine, Aglianico del Vultura, from vineyards near Potenza, in
Basilicata. This is another keeper, with great power and
concentrated flavors. I'm told the 1985's are just now at their
best.
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few of the hundreds of wines produced in the
southernmost reaches of the Italian boot. If they are not yet in
your local shops, try the ones that are. A whole new world of wine
awaits.

AMERICAN CHEESES CATCH UP TO THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would have been impossible to produce a book like ``The New
American Cheese'' 20 years ago. Back then, only about a quarter of
the 50 or so American cheese makers featured in this big, lavishly
photographed volume by Laura Werlin (Stewart Tabori &AMP; Chang, $35)
were in business.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution is not too strong a term to describe what has
happened on the American cheese-making scene in recent years. It is
part of the new can-do spirit of American food producers, inspired
by Europe to innovate and excel.
</P>
<P>
   Though the author, a food writer, says that the Pilgrims brought
goats with them on the Mayflower and used the milk to make ``curds
and whey,'' American goat milk cheeses were virtually nonexistent
before the late 1970s. It took another 10 years for sheep's milk
cheeses to appear. The book clearly shows that American cheese
makers are making up for lost time, creating cheeses that can rival
famous imports.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with a strongly worded foreword from Steven
Jenkins, the cheese expert at Fairway, who praises the best America
has to offer while condemning regulations that standardize cheese
making. The work of artisans, he says, is why American cheese ``is
catching on like wildfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the book is devoted to profiles of small cheese
companies, and as the list unfolds, the reader's curiosity is
whetted about some of the enticing cheeses they are creating, like
a Roquefort-style Bergere Bleue, from Northland Sheep Dairy in
Marathon, N.Y., and Ewezarella, a sheep's milk mozzarella, from
Bass Lake Cheese Factory in Somerset, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   At one long-established company, Vella Cheese of Sonoma, Calif.,
a new cheese was created when a supply of Monterey Jack was
unintentionally left to age. The result was Dry Jack, a hard
grating cheese. Other cheeses are fledgling experiments, like the
Sagpond Farmstead Emmenthaler that the winemaker at Wolffer
Estates-Sagpond Vineyards in Sagaponack, N.Y., started making two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The alluring collection of recipes in the book include those in
which the cheese takes center stage, like cheese fondue or macaroni
and cheese. In others, like salads, it amounts to a flavorful
garnish. A gougere, a kind of cheese puff, is a classic that has
been bolstered with hot red pepper. Sauteed spinach with blue goat
cheese, caramelized onions and currants amounts to a piquant
rethinking of creamed spinach.
</P>
<P>
   In most recipes, using a particular cheese is usually not
essential, and substitutes are given. That's good, since many, like
Mossholder, a semisoft cheese from Appleton, Wis., and Ku'oko'a
Farm's smooth Hawaiian goat cheese, are sold only locally.
</P>
<P>
   Ricotta in a bread pudding, fromage blanc to enrich a risotto,
and blue cheese on pizza or bruschetta are a few of the more
innovative recipe ideas. It is also clear from the recipes, which
emphasize fairly common cheeses, that the best, most distinctive
cheeses, like Cypress Grove's Marble Mountain, which is pyramid
shaped, are meant to be nibbled by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no order in which the book presents cheese
makers: Great Hill Dairy in Massachusetts, which makes a blue
cheese, follows Lovetree Farm in Wisconsin, which specializes in
aged sheep cheeses. A state-by-state listing of cheese makers
includes more than 100 that are not profiled, but does not give the
page numbers for those that are.
</P>
<P>
   General information does not apply just to American cheeses.
Readers are guided on how to evaluate cheese, with tips on good and
bad aromas, flavors and textures. They also learn how cheese should
be served, how to pair it with wine and how to cook with it. The
rule of thumb that four ounces of hard cheese makes one and a half
cups grated is one I will hard-wire into my brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New American Cheese'' offers about the best, most detailed
instructions on how to wrap and store cheese, complete with a chart
divided according to type of cheese. It would pay to photocopy it
and tack it to the refrigerator door. With a mouse-shaped magnet.

<P>
   RED PEPPER GOUGERE Adapted from ``The New American Cheese''
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, plus cooling
</P>
<P>
   { cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut in pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   } teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups coarsely grated Gruyere-style cheese (about 5 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely grated Dry Jack or other hard grating
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Grease baking sheet with a bit
of butter.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place one cup water in saucepan, add butter and gradually
bring to a boil. Remove from heat, add flour all at once and mix
vigorously with a wooden spoon until mixture comes together. Return
to heat briefly, until mixture starts to film pan. Remove from heat
and beat in eggs one at a time. (Alternatively, flour mixture can
be placed in food processor and eggs added one at a time, each
processed briefly to incorporate.) With wooden spoon, mix in
mustards, red pepper, salt and cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   3. Using pastry bag fitted with wide tip (or a small but heavy
self-sealing plastic bag with { inch cut off one corner), pipe
one-third of batter onto baking sheet in a ring about 9 inches in
diameter. Top with another third of batter, then the rest, to make
a three-layer ring. Or pipe batter into individual 2-inch mounds
about 1{ inches apart.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bake 20 minutes. If making large ring, reduce heat to 375
degrees and bake 20 minutes longer, until ring is puffed up, well
browned and sounds hollow when tapped. For individual puffs, bake a
total of 25 minutes without reducing heat. Remove finished ring or
puffs from oven. Cool on rack 15 minutes, then serve as hors
d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 1 large or 36 to 40 small gougeres, serving 6 to 8. &QL;

   The Kuhn Rikon grater looks like either a failed attempt at an
industrial fly swatter or a very awkward spatzle maker. But this
odd little tool is actually a cheese and chocolate grater. And
quite a good one at that.
</P>
<P>
   It peels cheese into round cuplike shavings as thin as tissue
paper, and works marvelously with chocolate, too.
</P>
<P>
   The grater's thick steel plate is perforated by precisely
punched holes each about the diameter of a pencil. The edges catch
hard cheeses, and the tool itself is sturdy enough not to give.
(Soft cheeses, though, get lodged in the holes.) Unlike box
graters, it has no sharp edges, so you don't have to worry about
your fingers.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, is the fineness of the gratings. With
hard, salty cheeses like Parmesan, you want gratings that are as
thin as possible so that they will melt quickly and be incorporated
into the dish without leaving large bits of cold cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Shavings from this grater do just that; they are like fluffy
snowflakes. The chocolate shavings look like miniature orecchiette
_ thin enough to melt immediately into a batter and pretty enough
to decoratively top a cake. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kuhn Rikon grater is $17.98 at Zabar's in New York City,
2245 Broadway (80th Street), (212) 787-2000. &QL;

 &HT;    NETANYAHU TAKES TO TV TO COMBAT ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As defiant as ever, former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday said he was the victim of a ``hunt'' and
denied police allegations of corruption while in office.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, in an interview on Israeli television, came after
Israeli police recommended that prosecutors file several corruption
charges against he and his wife, Sara.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, they are accused of trying to keep up to 700 gifts
they received while Netanyahu was in office _ including a gold
letter opener from Vice President Al Gore _ and accepting work from
a contractor who expected political favors. Police have been
investigating the couple, including long questioning sessions with
each, for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't define this as though they are after me, I would
define it as a hunt,'' Netanyahu said during the 50-minute
interview in which he often appeared sarcastic and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these allegations have no basis at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he lost a bid for re-election in 1996 and then dropped
out of politics, Netanyahu has been courted recently to make a
comeback, either for his Likud Party or a new party. His three
years in office were marked by a combative style, and reluctance to
carry out peace agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV interview, Netanyahu said the police investigation
could preclude another political bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They, in essence, are neutralizing me politically,'' he said,
apparently referring to the police.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on whether to charge Netanyahu lies with Attorney
General Elyakim Rubinstein, who has in the past refused to charge
Netanyahu on other police allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Police recommend that Netanyahu be charged with accepting a
bribe, breach of trust by a public official, obstruction of justice
and attempted fraud. Police said Sarah Netanyahu should be charged
with theft and attempted fraud. They also recommended charges
against two Netanyahu aides.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli law professor Ze'ev Segal said that Netanyahu, if
convicted of all his charges, could face three to seven years in
jail. He could also be barred from again seeking office.
</P>
<P>
   For now, that is a long way off. But, the recommendation is the
latest in a wave of scandals rippling through Israel's public
elite.
</P>
<P>
   Current Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his aides face a police
probe into his campaign fundraising. President Ezer Weizman is
being investigated for accepting more than $400,000 in gifts over
his political career from a French millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Rubinstein opened an investigation of the spiritual
leader of the large Shas political party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef,
because he compared a political opponent to ``Satan'' and a
biblical figure who set out to eliminate the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Such language can be considered incitement to violence and has
been closely scrutinized since the assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption scandals, especially, are seen as a sign of
growing influence of Israeli prosecutors in a still young country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standards have risen. The things that were possible in the
past and would have gone unnoticed are not possible now,'' said Uri
Dromi, publications director for the Israel Democracy Institute.
``The public is not tolerating it as it did before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netanyahu inquiry began shortly after the elections, when a
contractor submitted a bill to his office for work done for the
Netanyahus. It appears police believe the contractor did $50,000
worth of work with the understanding that Netanyahu would repay him
with political favors.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor has since become a witness for the prosecution.
Police accuse Netanyahu of trying to get the contractor to lie in
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The police searched the Netanyahus' home and properties, and
reportedly found gifts with the inscriptions removed and that had
been re-packaged. Israel Radio reported that the gifts were worth
more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he was allowed to take gifts for the office he is
provided by the government as former prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE CENTER, Iowa _ Agriculture, they tell you the moment you
get to Des Moines, no longer rules the local economy. Corn and pigs
are no longer kings.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not, but farm traditions die hard. Although almost
half of Iowa's pork producers went out of business between 1992 and
1997, the surviving family farmers cling to their debt-ridden,
often economically marginal farms the way grand old English
families hang on to their country houses, even when the roof leaks
and the servants are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Hogs still outnumber people here five to one. Lots of people eat
pork sandwiches, made from breaded, deep-fried tenderloins, instead
of hamburgers. At the Iowa State Fair, an 11-day extravaganza each
August, hungry Hawkeyes in bib overalls and print dresses flock to
a huge dining hall called The Pork Tent. And Iowa still chooses a
lissome young thing every year to wear a crown and a pigskin sash
that identifies her as the Iowa Pork Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Pork queen? Anywhere else, call a young woman a pork queen, and
she breaks down in sobs, heads for the guidance counselor and asks
her mother where she went wrong. In Iowa, the title is a badge of
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Big corporate operators have taken over the bulk of Iowa's pork
production, with dire results not only for the small farmer but
also for those of us who were raised on succulent pork chops and
pork roasts. Fat gives pork some of its flavor, but modern hogs are
bred to minimize fat; producers noticed that Americans were
choosing chicken over beef. Raised in close quarters inside
enormous metal buildings, the hogs foul the air for miles around,
and their meat is bland, dry and tough when cooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pork, the other white meat,'' the ads say. Right they are;
much of it, as Edward Behr wrote last summer in his erudite
newsletter, The Art of Eating, ``is as lean and characterless as
factory chicken breast.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Iowa's rich, dark soil holds onto people like Kelly
Biensen, a fifth-generation hog farmer, and his wife, Nina, a pair
of stubborn, well-educated souls who want to do things differently.
They are retro-pioneers who produce pork the old-fashioned way,
giving their pigs lots of room to move about and eschewing the
drugs and hormones many use.
</P>
<P>
   They have also organized a marketing group called Eden Farms,
which sells pork from their farm and 85 other family farms that
raise pigs known as Berkshires, which originated in England 300
years ago. The breed is well known for its flavorful meat,
well-marbled with fat.
</P>
<P>
   Try the gingered pork tenderloin at Bistro 43 in Des Moines, and
you will taste the difference. Jeremy Morrow, 32, the chef, told me
that he always has Eden Farms pork on his menu, prepared in a
number of ways. The meat is moist, tender and almost buttery, with
a bright, fresh taste. You know that you have hold of a piece of
pig.
</P>
<P>
   The Biensens know that their pork tastes better, but for them,
what is more important is that it commands a premium price. It has
enabled them to escape the trap of commodity pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Overproduction has driven the price of everyday pork below the
amount that it costs a small farmer to produce. Biensen said that
as a rule of thumb, it takes about $100 to raise a hog for market,
and the price has fallen below that level more often in the last
few years than it has risen above it. Most small farmers struggle
to break even.
</P>
<P>
   Things are bad for little guys everywhere. Glenn Grimes, an
economist who does studies for the National Pork Producers Council,
estimated recently that 8,000 hog farmers across the country quit
the business in 1998 and 8,000 more quit last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life has not been very easy,'' said Biensen, 47, who lives in
a battered farmhouse, surrounded by pens and barns and piggeries,
at the center of his 248 acres. ``We haven't lived as well as we
should. My wife has a Ph.D. in animal husbandry from Iowa State
University. We could have done other things if our goal was money.
But we wanted this, our own farm.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Biensen pronounces his family name, which is Alsatian in origin,
BUY-en-son. He wears steel-rimmed glasses that make him look rather
professorial, and as he talked, seated at a computer in a corner of
the worn family kitchen, a small, rueful smile flickered across his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big change is the cost of farming,'' he told me one snowy
morning in January. ``In only about 40 years, we went from $300 to
$500 for an acre of land, to $3,500 an acre. It has settled back to
$2,500, but that's still almost ten times as much. Forty years ago,
the biggest tractor was 70 horsepower. Now, they look like a house
coming across the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, labor is being replaced by capital as the
essential element,'' Biensen continued. ``The big producer, with
more to invest, gets bigger, and he can make a deal with the
packing houses. The more hogs you can give a packer, the higher a
price you get.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, it costs about 40 cents to produce a pound of
pork, which then sells for 38 to 39 cents. Eden Farms pork,
however, fetches roughly 50 cents a pound from its customers,
mostly clubs and restaurants in central Iowa. The Biensens grossed
only $2,300 in January 1999, not long after they began. But
business is growing steadily in their niche market: in December,
they grossed $13,800.
</P>
<P>
   Several things, Biensen suggested, account for the bland flavor
of most supermarket pork.
</P>
<P>
   One is the modern method of raising hogs in confinement _
``always indoors,'' he said, ``in the same exact spot for their
whole lives,'' eating there, sleeping there, defecating there,
through the slatted floor into vast, smelly manure lagoons. Moving
in and out of shelters, roaming in open lots, the way the Biensen's
pigs do, even in cold weather, seems to yield firmer, juicier,
tastier pork.
</P>
<P>
   Hogs that are too lean cannot stand the cold outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   A second factor is PSS, for porcine stress syndrome, which is
caused by a gene often carried by breeds used for factory farming.
It makes the animals more efficient _ that is, they produce more
pounds of lean meat per pound. But they often produce meat that
Biensen describes as P.S.E. The letters stand for pale, soft and
exudative. Exudative meat loses much of its moisture as it cooks,
which is why a fried pork chop can taste like leather.
</P>
<P>
   Beef is classified by the federal government, with ``utility''
at the bottom of the scale, ``prime'' at the top. The more
marbling, the higher the grade, but no such classification exists
for pork.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Prusa, a professor of food science at Iowa State University
in Ames, argued that moisture, not fat, is the key to flavor.
Low-fat, high-moisture pork, if not overcooked, can be delicious,
he asserted, although most top chefs pay top dollar to get pork
with a higher fat content.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that most home cooks and some chefs overcook pork
in their determination to kill any lurking trichinae, the parasites
that cause trichinosis. But with the disappearance of pork produced
from pigs fed on garbage, and major improvements in hog-rearing
methods, Professor Prusa said, the chances of contracting
trichinosis are nearly nil.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, he added, no one need fear pork cooked to medium _
160 degrees, with a bit of pink at the center. Other food
technologists assert that medium-rare pork, cooked to 145 degrees,
is perfectly safe. Some professional cooks here and abroad cook
pork less than that. Heston Blumenthal, the chef at the Fat Duck
near London, which has two stars in the Michelin guide, cooks his
chops, cut from the loins of Tamworth or Middlewhite hogs, less
than that, serving them at 135 degrees, still rosy-pink.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of someone getting sick from eating pork are a
thousand times smaller than those of picking up bacteria from
chicken,'' Blumenthal said. ``I think that pork is probably the
safest thing we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Breed also counts. Berkshires produce somewhat smaller loins,
which means fewer pounds of salable meat, but the meat has very
fine fibers, which give it greater water retention capacity, and
more tiny veins of intramuscular fat, which help to give it a more
full-bodied flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The Biensens raise both purebred Berkshires and Berkshire
hybrids, for which Berkshires are crossed with other breeds like
Durocs, one of the major commercial breeds. The 75 percent hybrids
grow faster, and the sows give birth to larger litters, while
retaining, Biensen said, the desirable characteristics of
purebreds.
</P>
<P>
   His charges are fed soybean meal, ground corn and vitamins and
minerals, but no animal byproducts and no antibiotics, which are
standard for many factory pigs. They are energetic, curious beasts,
mostly black with an occasional splotch of brown. Almost all of
them have a white flash on the face, a white tip on the tail and
white markings on all four feet.
</P>
<P>
   As I watched them, I thought about Wilbur, E.B. White's lovable
pig, who learns the hard facts about life and death in
``Charlotte's Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Biensen wants to sell his pork nationwide. Already,
he noted, Berkshire pork has attracted a wide following; Japanese
customers, who are notoriously picky about meat, like Berkshire
pork so much that they buy most of the production of farmers
affiliated with another marketing group, American Berkshire Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs across this country, dissatisfied with the pork available
through normal channels, have found alternatives. Alice Waters of
Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., turned to Niman Ranch, whose beef
had long been featured on her menus, and Niman Ranch eventually
hooked up with Paul Willis, an Iowa farmer. His and 36 other farms,
in Iowa and nearby states, now supply Niman, which sells to
restaurants (including Gramercy Tavern and Lutece in New York), a
few retail outlets (including Fairway and Eli's in New York and
Fresh Fields in Washington and Baltimore) and direct to consumers.
Telephone orders can be placed at (510) 808-0330, and Niman
promises Internet ordering soon.
</P>
<P>
   At Fairway, Niman Ranch's seven-rib rack Frenched is $8.99 a
pound. At Eli's Manhattan, Niman center-cut pork chops with bone
are $8.99 a pound, and shoulder roast is $5.99 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered another top-flight producer, Four Story Hill Farm
in Honesdale, Pa., 30 miles northeast of Scranton, by asking about
the source of the dish ``Black Pig Variation'' (a pig's trotter
stuffed with morels and a feather-light pork cutlet) that I tasted
at Seeger's, a superb restaurant in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   When I called the farm, Sylvia Pryzant, who runs it with her
husband, Stephen, told me that they custom raise poultry and pigs
for chefs like Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Wayne Nish in New
York, Charlie Trotter in Chicago and Thomas Keller in the Napa
Valley. The Pryzants also concentrate on Berkshire hogs, fed in
part on chopped fresh apples, mostly McIntoshes, and slaughter them
when they are younger (12 weeks old) and smaller (55 pounds dressed

JUDGE IN MICROSOFT CASE POSTPONES VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The judge in the Microsoft antitrust trial agreed
to postpone issuing a verdict in the case Tuesday to give
negotiators for Microsoft and the government more time to try to
reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had said last week that he would
issue his ruling Tuesday. But Tuesday morning his office announced
that he would delay his decision. However, the court did not say
for how long.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with what was then a deadline Tuesday, an appointed
mediator worked feverishly Monday evening to reach an 11th-hour
settlement in the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, some officials said they thought Microsoft's
settlement proposal, offered last Friday, was simply inadequate.
Others said they did not trust Microsoft to live up to its
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too long ago that Microsoft's president was saying
`to heck with Janet Reno,''' one official noted. ``I think
Microsoft is now paying for their prior credibility problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Another said simply: ``This proposal simply falls short of what
the public interest demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven by reports last week that Microsoft might settle the
case, the company's stock gained more than 7 percent on Thursday.
But on Monday it closed at $104.625, down $7.625, or 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Jackson called the litigants into his office and
told them they had another week to settle. If they failed, he said
he would issue his verdict a week later _ though several officials
said Monday that they believed he might hold off a few days because
of the continuing talks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ever since Jackson's strongly worded findings of fact in
November, the expectation has been that the verdict, when it comes,
would find that Microsoft violated the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Microsoft delivered a settlement offer with more than
a dozen proposals. Among them, the company said it would provide
computer makers a version of Windows that did not include access to
the company's Web browser, Internet Explorer _ although how that
would be accomplished remains unclear. Microsoft has argued since
1997 that Windows and Internet Explorer are one inseparable
product. Microsoft also agreed to charge common prices for Windows
so the company could not use pricing to penalize or reward computer
makers for their level of cooperation. Trial evidence showed that
Microsoft penalized IBM with higher prices for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The company also promised to make freely available the program
interfaces that allow software writers to link their programs to
Windows. Microsoft had been accused of holding those interfaces
back from companies that did not cooperate on other matters.
</P>
<P>
   While these proposals and others directly address some of the
conclusions in Jackson's findings of fact, most government
officials concluded that they were insufficient. But even those who
did not hold that view said the offers included so many technical
qualifiers, codicils and addendums that no one could tell whether
the proposals could actually be carried out effectively. What is
more, several officials said, the proposal offered no real detail
on how the offers could be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very serious enforcement concerns,'' one official
said. Microsoft declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement issue is of concern because government officials
do not want to find themselves required to monitor Microsoft's
day-to-day business behavior _ or be left to wait until someone
complains of a violation so that they have to file another lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, among the Justice Department officials and the 19
state attorneys general who are behind the suit, some still favor
breaking up Microsoft so that once that is accomplished, government
involvement would end. Others consider that idea Draconian and
unlikely to withstand judicial appeal.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the varied concerns about Microsoft's proposal,
the leading officials behind the lawsuit had decided by Saturday
that the proposal was inadequate. Despite the negative reaction,
through the weekend and into the evening Monday the mediator,
Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Chicago, continued sending e-mail messages to both sides, trying to
bridge the divide.
</P>
<P>
   If he had made significant progress, the parties would have
convened in Chicago on Monday for further negotiations. But the
state and federal officials were in their offices instead. Still,
several officials said the talks were still alive, if barely;
Microsoft was said to be clarifying some of its offers. Some
officials said they would not be surprised if Posner asked Jackson
to delay issuing his verdict by a few days, to give the talks every
possible chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Microsoft did expand or clarify its proposal enough to
satisfy some of the government officials, winning agreement from
the federal government and all 19 state attorneys general would be
a difficult and time-consuming process. The states are sharply
divided on the best approach, and some of them have not followed
the case closely enough to make a quick decision.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the talks stall, and Jackson issues his verdict, the two
sides could continue to negotiate. But at that point, the
motivations for Microsoft will have changed. By settling now, it
can forestall a legal ruling that the company holds a monopoly in
the personal computer operating-system business. That ruling would
empower lawyers to file even more private antitrust suits against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson concluded in his findings of fact that Microsoft holds a
legal monopoly. But that finding holds little if any legal force
until the judge issues his final verdict.

 &HT;    HOMES CAN BE REINFORCED AGAINST TORNADO DAMAGE, FEMA REPORTS
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even in powerful tornadoes, homes can be protected
from severe damage if they are strongly reinforced with the latest
building techniques, the Federal Emergency Management Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't control the weather, but, in effect, we can control''
the amount of damage caused by tornadoes, FEMA Director James Lee
Witt said as he released a report on the devastating Oklahoma City
tornado of May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   More than 280 people living in 15 states, including Florida,
Georgia and Texas, were surveyed for the study, which began days
after the tornado ripped through parts of Oklahoma and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Construction flaws and use of poor-quality materials resulted in
damage to thousands of homes that could have been avoided, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the homeowners surveyed said they did not know
they could act to prevent tornado damage to their homes. Others
knew the steps to take, but just didn't take them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much we can do to build stronger structures that will
stand up even if they are near the direct path of a violent tornado
_ or even in the direct path of weaker tornadoes,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA issued a set of recommendations for homeowners, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Retrofit masonry chimneys that project six feet above the roof
of the home with continuous vertical reinforcing steel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reinforce garage doors, particularly double-wide doors, or
install a replacement with better wind resistance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use drilled-in or cast-in-place fasteners to attach concrete
to other materials.
</P>
<P>
   _ Simplify roof designs, for example by avoiding dormers, to
resist their tendency to uplift in windstorms.
</P>
<P>
   He urged homeowners to upgrade their homes if they don't meet
the most recent national model building codes and standards. People
have a better chance of surviving a tornado ``if you make sure that
your building exceeds the national standards,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   The FEMA director also asked local officials in tornado-prone
areas to adopt and rigorously enforce the latest model codes and
national wind engineering standards.
</P>
<P>
   The FEMA team also found that manufactured homes don't resist
wind forces as well as conventional houses, but that manufactured
homes perform better during tornadoes if they are installed on
permanent foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Witt recommended that insurance companies offer lower rates to
people who anchor their manufactured homes or put them on permanent
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recommendations for building better against high winds is
important, but perhaps the most important thing to do when in the
direct path of a tornado is to seek shelter in a well-built safe
room or shelter,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Safe rooms can provide ''next-to-absolute level of protection,''
Paul Tertell, a civil engineer with FEMA, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA, working with the Wind Engineering Research Center at Texas
Tech University, has designed small windowless, structurally
reinforced rooms meant to be installed in the center of a home.
</P>
<P>
   After inspecting more than 90 towns that had been struck by
tornadoes, they found that small rooms in the central part of
houses often remained standing even when the rest of the dwelling
had sustained severe damage.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA officials said the safe rooms can withstand winds of up to
250 mph and protect occupants from a 14-pound object measuring 2
feet by 4 feet and flying at 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Safe rooms, built of steel and reinforced concrete, were
developed primarily for use in new houses, but some can be
installed in existing houses. Although anyone with adequate
building skills can construct the rooms, officials suggested hiring
a professional contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Materials for the safe room cost from $2,000 to $4,000,
depending on its size.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the safe room and a free brochure, ''FEMA 320: Taking
Shelter From the Storm,'' can be requested at 1-800-480-2520 or
www.fema.gov. The full set of recommendations for reinforcing homes
against strong winds is also available on the Web site.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I held the vibrant green sorrel leaves in my hands. They were
the color of a sprout and as fragile as flower petals. Moist, cool
and tender, they were nothing like the hard, starchy fruits of
winter. They seemed to possess both the optimism of spring and its
temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as I had done so many times before, I treated them like
spinach, wilting them in a hot pan and watching with dismay as the
fresh leaves rapidly shrank and turned the shade of food-service
broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrel is an odd vegetable. After seducing you with thoughts of
spring, it tests your honesty, your commitment to its flavor.
Despite its dull color when cooked, sorrel does taste bright and
exuberant.
</P>
<P>
   No other vegetable at this time of year has such power, or
complexity. Sorrel is fruity like rhubarb. It is tart like lemon.
It is herbal like basil. And it can be treated like all three.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, I was like many home cooks and chefs. I would
soften sorrel in a pan and add cream, or sometimes a little chopped
spinach for a side dish, or I would make a soup of it. But sorrel
is so much more interesting than that.
</P>
<P>
   The spade-shape leaves, which closely resemble young spinach,
are really an herb and are often sold in small bunches in the herb
section of markets. In France, sorrel is a familiar sign of spring.
Chefs use it to make tart sauces for rich fish like salmon or
pureed soups.
</P>
<P>
   But here in America, it is an esoteric green that shows up right
about now, maybe alongside shad, then gets pushed aside by
asparagus and artichokes. But what a shame.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs who understand sorrel use it inventively, almost
secretively. At Five Points, for instance, a thin layer of sorrel
separates layers of country bread and Gruyere in a savory bread
pudding. At Veritas, it is added to a mixture of herbs _ tarragon,
chives, basil and chervil _ and sprinkled over salad or roasted
fish. At Chanterelle, its tart, fruity leaves are treated like
rhubarb, mingling with green apple in, of all things, a dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of the most subtle uses of sorrel is in a risotto at
Fressen. Bright green fava beans and sugar snap peas are nestled in
warm rice. Right before serving, Lynn McNeely, the chef, whirls
blanched arugula and sorrel in a blender with olive oil, then
swirls the mixture into the risotto. The leaves, their color
preserved, tint the rice a pale green and give it a zesty, peppery
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   It is a smart dish, but hardly something I was planning to cook
at home. I wanted to understand sorrel better without having to
hire a sous-chef.
</P>
<P>
   As I discovered, all you really need to do is get in the
kitchen, swish the soft leaves around in water (they can be quite
dirty) and get cooking.
</P>
<P>
   I started off slowly, with the classics, to serve as a reminder
of what I knew and liked about sorrel. I wilted the leaves in
butter. When they are young and fresh, they seem to melt, their
structure breaking down until they are soft and silky.
</P>
<P>
   As with spinach, it is important to cook off the water, so that
the greens do not taste soggy. It was as good as I remembered _
vigorously tart _ and a great side dish to accompany sauteed fish
or roasted chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrel's sharpness can be softened by blending it with other
greens like spinach or chard. I did this two ways, first mixing
half spinach and half sorrel and wilting them in a pan. Another
time, I finished the blend of greens by pouring a little cream over
it and reducing it to a sauce. No surprise, the cream did not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Then I tried a recipe from ``The Herbfarm Cookbook'' (Scribner,
$40) by Jerry Traunfeld that calls for sauteing spinach and tossing
it with chopped sorrel, mint and anchovy. The sorrel was essential
as the acid in the dish, and yet it did not compete with the
spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Next I layered slices of potato in a gratin dish, covered them
with sorrel leaves, then another layer of potato. I mixed heavy
cream and chicken stock together, sprinkled fine gratings of
Parmesan cheese and Gruyere over the potatoes and put it all in a
hot oven.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, I pulled the dish from the oven. It was a
beautiful moment: the cream was bubbling, the potatoes had curled
and were coated with browned cheese. The sorrel had compressed to a
wafer-thin layer, and its rich, lemony flavor had permeated the
entire dish. Why not, I later thought, simply fold fresh leaves
into warm, creamy mashed potatoes?
</P>
<P>
   I moved on to another classic, an omelet. I heated butter in a
pan, cracked a few eggs into a bowl, added a dash of cream and sea
salt and frothed them with a whisk. When the butter was bubbling
and snapping, I poured in the eggs, then covered them with fresh
sorrel leaves. Once the bottom had turned a toasty brown, I swished
the eggs and sorrel, then flipped the omelet.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged from the pan looked like a nature collage with the
sorrel leaves preserved whole in the omelet. Their color had faded
so that they looked like grape leaves, and they gave each bite a
fresh, citrusy flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Another experiment was inspired by a dish at Five Points,
steamed mussels sprinkled with a chiffonade of sorrel. Here, sorrel
was used more like an herb. It seemed more garnish than herb until
I tasted it. The slices of sorrel fell into the shells and broth
but stayed fresh enough so that, every bite or so, I crunched down
on the fresh leaf and got a tart burst of flavor. It was a
delightful, easy touch.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, I chopped sorrel fine and mixed it with
chopped basil, parsley and tarragon, and used it as Veritas does,
sprinkling the mixture over salads and warm potatoes. It is the
same idea as the mussels, only less concentrated, balancing
sorrel's tartness with the pepperiness of basil and the clean
licorice flavor of tarragon. Using it raw like this is also the
only way to retain its bright green color.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Paging through ``How to Eat'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $35) by
Nigella Lawson, I came across a recipe for chickpeas with sorrel.
In it, the sorrel works like any other aromatic, whether coriander,
parsley or garlic. I simmered onion and garlic with cumin and red
chili, added first the chickpeas and then a large handful of
chopped sorrel.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrel's sharpness was just the right counterpoint to the sweet,
nutty legumes. In fact, it would work with almost any bean or
grain, whether black-eyed peas, lentils or farro.
</P>
<P>
   The last dish I tried was a potato-leek soup from ``Cafe Boulud
Cookbook'' (Scribner, 1999) by Daniel Boulud and Dorie Greenspan. I
learned from it, too. Rather than incorporating the sorrel into the
soup, as I have always done, Boulud's recipe starts with a
straightforward potato-leek soup.
</P>
<P>
   While it simmered, I made a sorrel cream by pureeing raw sorrel
and folding it into whipped cream. To serve the soup, I set a
spoonful of the stiff, green-flecked cream on the surface. It began
melting and frothing in the hot broth. Then something unexpected
happened. The soup turned the color of a baby pea leaf and its
aroma bloomed. It smelled faintly of leek, vibrantly of sorrel.
</P>
<P>
   My image of sorrel had also bloomed. I began thinking of it as a
lemon-flavored spring green. Eventually, I realized that is about
as accurate as saying that celery root simply tastes like celery.
Now, after seeing all that sorrel can do, even the idea of adding
it to a dessert no longer seems so outrageous. &QL;

   Q. When I fill out my census form, I am considering declaring
myself poor and African-American. That would be a lie because I am
middle-class and white, but it strikes me as responsive to a higher
ethic. Adding one more tally to a group known to be undercounted
would help right the inaccurate figures. Should I suppress my
socially conscious concerns?
</P>
<P>
   _ J. Sommer, New York
</P>
<P>
   A. You should express your concerns, but not in the way you
propose. While the census is seriously _ and, many say,
deliberately _ flawed, it is not so utterly discredited as to
justify the small civil disobedience you describe. Instead, write
to your representatives and demand the use of sampling techniques
that would yield a more accurate count, and urge your local
officials to make every effort to see that all are tallied. But
when the census form arrives, fill it out honestly.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the legal objection to falsifying the form, it is in
everyone's interest to make the count as accurate as possible. If
your policy were universally adopted, the census would be
discredited as little more than fiction, particularly the part
about the 35 Guamanians living in my apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My school's parking lot has only 47 spots for 100 students
who drive. I asked a school administrator where I could park off
campus legally. I parked where he told me, but my car was ticketed
and towed because the fire chief thought that the many cars on that
street caused a fire hazard. Who should pay for the impound and
ticket? Who is at fault?
</P>
<P>
   _ Joshua Fink, Englewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Bad advice offered in good faith is not bad ethics. If that
administrator says it will be sunny tomorrow, you can't sue him if
it rains. He is offering an opinion outside the authority of his
office. The responsibility to wear a hat is yours.
</P>
<P>
   If you parked in a legal spot, fight the ticket and ask the
school official to support you. If the spot was not legal, his
opinion doesn't change that, so you're stuck. Tell the official
what happened so he will know he is misinformed and will stop
giving bad advice. And who knows: he may offer to pay part of the
ticket to compensate for his bad advice.
</P>
<P>
   Q. At a gourmet market where I shop, more than a few customers
help themselves to handfuls of nuts and dried fruits without
paying. This is clearly unsanitary. I've mentioned it to the
cashiers, who say that no one in charge cares enough to stop it.
May I say something to these freeloaders or should I ignore the
situation and fume inwardly?
</P>
<P>
   _ N. Levy, New York
</P>
<P>
   A. If you catch people actually napping in the pickle barrel,
you may jostle them awake and give them a stern talking to. In the
cases you describe, however, I think the health risk is minimal.
Perhaps what makes you fume is less a matter of hygiene than moral
outrage. However, while the behavior you describe sounds like
stealing to me, if the owners of the shop know about it and do
nothing to stop it, your ethical imperative is lifted. The store
may be willing to tolerate this sampling for the good will it
engenders, or at least to avoid the hassle. Their store, their
choice. My anti-fuming advice is to tell the owners that you intend
to shop elsewhere, and why, and then do so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. About a year ago, a friend borrowed $10,000 from another
friend of mine. Not only has the borrower not returned the money,
he also shows no inclination of ever doing so. By remaining friends
with the welsher without so much as a comment, am I condoning his
reprehensible behavior? Am I wrong to remain his friend?
</P>
<P>
   _ Lawrence Toffler, Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   A. If every time two friends quarreled and all their mutual
friends had to choose sides, none of us would have many friends
left. Fortunately, you are not obliged to cut off all ties to the
deadbeat, but you should not ignore his bad behavior. Use your
continued association to remind the defaulting friend of his
obligation _ gently, but persistently _ and make it clear that you
do not condone his lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Your situation will become more difficult if the injured party
demands that you break off with the deadbeat. Then you may have to
take a side. But while there are indeed transgressions grave enough
to sink a friendship, for now, at least, this isn't one of them.
Still, I wouldn't lend him any money. Or a cup of sugar. Or a cup.

&HT;     CLARK DEFENDS ROLE IN DEMISE OF THE 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If only the San Francisco 49ers had had Steve
Young and Garrison Hearst healthy for the entire season, they might
have been a playoff team once again.
</P>
<P>
   That is the opinion of Dwight Clark, the man who lost a bid to
become club president and fled to Cleveland to become vice
president and general manager of the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being a playoff contender, the 49ers tumbled to their
worst record in 20 years, 4-12, as Young missed the last 13 games
of the season after suffering concussions on consecutive weeks.
</P>
<P>
   People within the 49ers organization and around the league blame
Clark and Carmen Policy, now president and part owner of the
Browns, for the predicament the San Francisco club is in. The two
executives ran up a huge salary cap debt that had to be paid off in
a series of painful moves in February as the 49ers slashed $24
million from the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always understood the team would have had to go through
a couple of bad years'' as a result, said Clark, in Palm Beach for
the NFL owners meetings. ``I knew it would have happened at some
point and I wanted to stay around and go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the salary cap purge, the 49ers were not able to
seriously pursue any unrestricted free agents this year. It was all
they could do to get under the $62 million per-team cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a problem for the foreseeable future,'' general
manager Bill Walsh said. ``There was no way for us to acquire a
free agent of consequence because of cap problems. We're looking at
the draft. There are no short-form answers.''
</P>
<P>
   After Policy left for the Browns in the summer of 1998, Clark
campaigned for his club president's job. When then-owner Edward
DeBartolo Jr. told him that was not going to happen, Clark left for
Cleveland after the '98 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan was as long as Steve Young and Jerry Rice were
playing at a high level and gave us an opportunity to win a Super
Bowl, we were going to keep patching holes around them and make a
run at it,'' Clark said. ``At some point we knew because of the cap
situation we were going to go through a down year or two. I don't
think I'm without fault. The most important thing to me was I
didn't get to the point where the team was getting ready to
collapse and then bolt. I tried to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are waiting to hear from Young regarding his football
future. He is currently on his honeymoon with bride Barbara Graham.
The 49ers do not expect to hear from him one way or another until
after the draft April 15-16, perhaps not until June.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's situation is strictly a financial one. He is due to count
nearly $5.5 million against the 2000 salary cap. The 49ers want to
negotiate a more cap-friendly contract with him before June 1, the
date in which roster moves count toward the 2001 salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closing in on a time period when both their situations
have to be dealt with and addressed,'' Walsh said. ``We have two
months, basically, to get their situations resolved. With Steve
it's whether he's able to play. With Jerry it's a matter of us
being able to resolve his contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said the 49ers would probably hold onto the first of their
two first-round draft picks, No. 12 overall, and use it on one of
four need positions: quarterback, defensive end, linebacker and
cornerback. With or without Young, San Francisco will look to draft
a quarterback, though probably not with the 12th pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go into the draft taking the position we need a
quarterback for the future,'' Walsh said. ``We would have anyway.
Steve knows we're looking in the draft for a quarterback we can
nurture into a starting role.''

&HT;     FIRST THRILLER HARBINGER OF BRIGHT FOR AUTHOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: N.Y., Texas)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOBBIE HESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Larsgaard's thriller, ``The Heir Hunter'' (Delacorte
Press, $23.95, 356 pages), is a fast-paced debut that points to a
bright future for this writer.
</P>
<P>
   Like the author, Larsgaard's protagonist specializes in a very
lucrative field of private investigations. Nick Merchant and his
partner, Alex Moreno, hunt for the heirs of people who die leaving
no will and no known relatives. If they find the heirs, they get a
percentage of the estate.
</P>
<P>
   Merchant works out of the San Francisco office and Moreno out of
her home in Albany, N.Y. They are being squeezed by a very
unethical company in Los Angeles that is willing to pay bribes to
get early, insider information. As the story begins, Moreno is
going to the Columbia County (N.Y.) clerk's building to offer a
bribe to the attorney in charge of the county's probate files. The
probate attorney has agreed that he will give Merchant and Moreno
``an exclusive 10-day sneak preview'' of the files in exchange for
$5,000. But when he meets with Moreno, he demands $10,000 because
one of the files is worth more than six figures. When she reads the
files, she calls Merchant, saying she'll fax the file to him
because he isn't going to believe that they have got the case of a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Raymond Jacobs died in Hudson, N.Y., and left an estate
of $22,346,000. Excited, they start looking into Jacobs' life. What
they don't know is that the attorney also sold the information to
their chief rivals and for some unknown reason, the FBI wants no
one to look into Jacobs' past.
</P>
<P>
   The search will cause Merchant to break into Jacobs' home
searching for clues, then a hit man will shoot a cop and make the
FBI think Merchant did it. His apartment will be bombed, his
secretary murdered, his office torched as he keeps a step ahead of
the FBI and the hit man who is trying to kill him. His search will
take him to the Midwest, Austria and Switzerland. As he and Moreno
discover Jacobs' heirs, two will turn up murdered and Moreno will
try to keep the third alive as they try to get the money released
to her.
</P>
<P>
   Larsgaard makes a subject that could be boring into a real,
intriguing whodunit. Good characterization, terse dialogue and a
well-constructed plot add to a fascinating first work. I really
look forward to Larsgaard's second outing.

   ``The Chill Factor.'' By Chris Rogers. Bantam Books. $23.95. 325
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rogers' third mystery featuring bounty hunter Dixie
Flanagan is a Texas joyride.
</P>
<P>
   While on a stakeout, Flanagan discovers that her checking
account is missing a lot of money. After she captures the con,
Flanagan heads for the bank to discover what happened to her money.
Turns out someone got some of Flanagan's old canceled checks to use
in a scam to empty her account. But before she leaves the bank,
there is a holdup, a shot is fired and a little old lady who looks
suspiciously like her 66-year-old neighbor Edna makes off with
several bags of cash. Edna is chased down, shot and killed by the
police and the money is nowhere to be found. The day before,
another Granny Bandit had held up another bank, was shot and
killed, with the money gone missing.
</P>
<P>
   Edna's son begs Flanagan to try to find out what drove his
mother to such a crazy and irrational act. Of course, Flanagan gets
involved and uncovers the story of lonely widow who set out to
create a new life, with new friends and interests, only to become a
pawn in the hands of a cold-blooded killer with a devious plan to
destroy a former adversary.
</P>
<P>
   This is a chilling look at how con artists and others prey on
the lonely and the elderly. Flanagan is one of those smart-mouth
protagonists you can't help but like. Off-beat characters add up to
a fast-paced beach book.

ANOTHER EVIL EMPIRE,   THIS ONE IN THE MIRROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Japan, South Korea)  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chalmers Johnson starts his new book with an account of how he
came to change his view of the American role in the world. A
onetime supporter of the Vietnam War who now wishes he had ``stood
with the antiwar protest movement,'' Johnson, professor emeritus at
the University of California, San Diego, spent a decade studying
Japanese industrial policy. His research, which inevitably covered
the American relationship with Japan, led him, he writes, ``to see
clearly for the first time the shape of the empire that I had so
long uncritically supported.''
</P>
<P>
   The empire in question is the American empire, the term itself
indicating the extent to which Johnson has now come to see things
very critically. His new book, ``Blowback: The Costs and
Consequences of American Empire,'' is a take-no-prisoners tirade
against what he portrays as classic imperial overextension worthy
of Rome or the Ottoman Empire. His main contention is that the
United States, by resorting to ``bluster, military force and
financial manipulation,'' all harnessed to its goal of global
hegemony, is subjecting itself to acts of retribution around the
world _ that retribution being the ``blowback'' of his title. In
other words, the World Trade Center bombings and other
anti-American terrorist acts may be just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense Johnson's book is a useful and timely alert by a
man with robustly contrarian views. But Johnson's turn from
uncritical to critical about the American empire is a vastly more
radical project than just a warning. Underlying his book is a
strong but unsubstantiated conviction that the United States has
all along been little better than any other imperial power,
including the Soviet Union, seeking amoral advantage wherever and
however it could _ and reaping blowback as a consequence. Extending
blowback to just about every area of American action in the world
gives the book a boldly provocative edge; unfortunately, it also
makes Johnson sound like some of the more rigidly ideological
protesters he used to disdain.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Johnson fails to raise important
questions or to make persuasive arguments about the deleterious
consequences of the global American presence. Among the questions
is whether it is really necessary for the United States to maintain
some 65 major military installations outside its borders. Johnson
describes the most important of those installations, in Okinawa, as
a place where the impact of so many soldiers on such a small island
has been ruinous for the permanent inhabitants. One of his major
villains is the International Monetary Fund, whose narrow
America-centered view of developement is, in Johnson's jaundiced
view, responsible for economic hardship around the world, and this
view, though sketchily presented, merits a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also mounts a thought-provoking critique of American
behavior during the Korean crisis of 1994 and 1995, when North
Korea seemed about to embark on a nuclear weapons program. He
demonstrates that the threat was grossly exaggerated to begin with
and then deceitfully managed, with the result that the Korean
peninsula is more potentially dangerous than it was before. His two
chapters on China, which he portrays as a likely superpower of the
21st century, are incisive, informed and common-sensical.
</P>
<P>
   These sections of Johnson's book are marred by an overriding,
sweeping and cranky one-sidedness. The basic problem is that
Johnson is a good deal readier to see hidden similarities _
between, say, the nature of the former Soviet satellite East
Germany and the American ``satellite'' Japan _ than to admit
obvious distinctions. His account of the American relationship with
South Korea is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   He begins with the highly debatable assertion that for much of
their history North and South Korea were ``nearly indistinguishable
in terms of human rights abuses and Stalinist-style development
policies.'' Johnson then focuses largely on the suppression of a
democratic uprising in 1980 in the city of Kwangju against South
Korea's military dictator of the moment, Gen. Chun Doo Hwan.
</P>
<P>
   To Johnson, Chun's crackdown, more violent than China's
Tiananmen Square crackdown a decade later, was of a piece with
Soviet repression in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 and
illustrates the basic similarity between Soviet and American
imperialisms.
</P>
<P>
   It is a deceptive, even cynical argument. Nobody that I know of
has much love for Chun or approves of his handling of the Kwangju
crisis, but Johnson's eagerness to draw Soviet-American parallels
leads him to pass lightly ever crucial facts and arguments. Most
generally, he does not consider that the invasions of
Czechoslovakia and Hungary were Soviet totalitarianism expressing
its nature, whereas the slaughter in Kwangju represented neither
American values nor American goals. He dismisses as almost
irrelevant the signal fact that no American troops were in Kwangju
but Soviet forces were in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Equally troubling, Johnson relies on a few snippets of very
inconclusive evidence to accuse American officials in Korea and
Washington of authorizing General Chun's Kwangju actions in
advance, but he ignores a substantial evidence and published
testimony that point to a contrary conclusion. Johnson even muses
that when General Chun later was tried for the Kwangju massacre,
these American officials ``might well have belonged in the dock
alongside their Korean colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important perhaps, Johnson fails to offer alternatives to
American policy in Korea or the likely consequences of those
alternatives. In Hungary and Czechoslovakia the alternative to the
Soviet invasion was the survival of less repressive new
governments. In Korea the alternative to continued backing for Chun
would probably have been a collapse of order in South Korea, which
might have induced North Korea to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is even unwilling to give the United States any moral
credit for the overall outcome of its engagement in Asia: namely,
conditions of relative peace and stability in which a core of
fairly prosperous democracies has emerged. Johnson may label these
democracies _ among them Japan, South Korea and now possibly even
Indonesia _ as mere ``satellites'' of the American empire, but that
characterization probably says more about Johnson than it does
about the realities of world politics.  &QL;

 `THE FILTH AND THE FURY': A ROCK BAND THAT HURLED ROCKS AT '70s(Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By any reasonable standard, the Sex Pistols would scarcely rate
a footnote in the annals of rock 'n' roll: in the 26 months of
their existence, they recorded exactly one album, were dropped by a
succession of record labels and self-destructed in the course of
their only tour of the United States. But the violent obliteration
of reasonable standards _ of rock decorum, of musical competence,
of decent behavior _ was what the Sex Pistols were all about.
</P>
<P>
   In case you thought the passage of time and the putative
coarsening of popular culture had dulled the group's ferocity,
``The Filth and the Fury,'' Julien Temple's electrifying new
documentary, will make you think again. The film presents the Sex
Pistols in all their scabrous glory: spewing obscenities on British
television, spitting at journalists and fans and generally smashing
through the drabness and hypocrisy of 1970s Britain like a brick
through a shop window. At a time when every obscenity or aesthetic
shock tactic feels like the product either of careful market
research or dutiful graduate-school training, the filth and fury of
British punk rock at its moment of impact retains a surprising
dignity. These people hated everything, but at least they believed
in something.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20-odd years since their chaotic rise and messy demise, a
number of legends have sprung up in the Sex Pistols' wake, among
them that they were never a rock band at all but rather an impish
piece of Conceptual Art masterminded by their manager, the
erstwhile London boutique owner Malcolm McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   Temple allows McLaren to repeat his claim that the Sex Pistols
were ``my sculpture, my painting, my little artful dodgers,'' but
``The Filth and the Fury'' is devoted to the anti-McLarenite
version of Sex Pistols history. In this view, most passionately
argued by Johnny Rotten, the band's lead singer and intellectual
conscience, punk was the spontaneous organic expression of
working-class rage and boredom and McLaren was a poseur and an
opportunist who stole the band's money and turned its members
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Though Temple stacks the deck somewhat _ his interviews with
McLaren are played over the image of a rubber bondage mask swelling
with what we can only assume is hot air _ he makes a persuasive
case that the Sex Pistols were nobody's art project. And his own
artfulness lifts ``The Filth and the Fury'' above the run of the
rockumentary mill, placing it in the rarefied company of D.A.
Pennebaker's ``Don't Look Now'' and ``The Decline of Western
Civilization,'' Penelope Spheeris' 1981 anatomy of the Los Angeles
punk scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Filth and the Fury'' is a bit like punk fashion, a rough,
safety-pin-in-cheek assemblage of found materials: BBC public
affairs programs that seemed to have been modeled on Monty Python
parodies; mock superhero cartoons recycled from ``The Great Rock
and Roll Swindle,'' Temple's earlier Sex Pistols epic (never
released in this country); grainy evening-news glimpses of
Britain's social disintegration; and scenes from Laurence Olivier's
``Richard III.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad King Richard in doublet and hose is a devilish premonition
of Johnny Rotten in his torn black suit coat and skinny tie,
rolling his eyes and his Rs, pronouncing anarchist to almost rhyme
with antichrist and burning with a hard, gemlike flame of
intelligence and rage. If there is one complaint to be made about
``The Filth and the Fury,'' it is that there's not enough music;
only three songs are performed in something like their entirety.
But they're songs you want to hear: ``Anarchy in the U.K.''
(twice), ``Holidays in the Sun'' and, of course, ``God Save the
Queen,'' the No. 1 single in England in the summer of 1977, which
could not be heard on the BBC or even mentioned in the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Young once sang, apropos of Johnny Rotten, that ``it's
better to burn out than to fade away.'' The demise of the Sex
Pistols was as fast and ugly as their music. Temple doesn't avert
his gaze from the wasted life of Sid Vicious, a young groupie who
replaced Glen Matlock as the group's bass player, in spite of his
utter lack of musical aptitude, and who died of a heroin overdose
after being charged with killing his girlfriend. Nor does the film
ignore the betrayals and recriminations that followed the group
across the Atlantic, and finally destroyed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Filth and The Fury,'' like the career it documents, ends
on a San Francisco concert stage, with Rotten demanding of the
audience, ``Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?'' It was a
rhetorical question at the time, but in retrospect, the answer is
no. The Sex Pistols gave everything they had, and Temple's film is
a gift to them and to their fans. Nihilism like this makes you glad
to be alive.

`LONG NIGHT'S JOURNEY INTO DAY':   FOLLOWING SOUTH AFRICA'S ROAD TO
TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Long Night's Journey Into Day'' is a beautiful and
often disturbing reflection on the nature of truth and forgiveness.
This documentary, directed by Frances Reid and Deborah Hoffmann,
captures the mandate of one of the most unusual social phenomena of
the last century, the Truth and Reconciliation Committee of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's function, after the fall of apartheid, was to
sift through the crimes of an era of systematic racism and decide
who would be allowed to seek amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process is not about pillorying,'' says Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, the committee's chairman. ``It's actually about
getting to the truth, so we can heal.'' To be granted amnesty, the
applicants have to tell the truth. According to on-screen text at
the film's opening, more than 7,000 sought amnesty, and the
documentary chooses four stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers' structure is simple and direct, like the
hearings themselves. They start with a case that many may be
familiar with, that of the American student and rights advocate Amy
Biehl, who was killed by black South Africans. Biehl was attracted
to South Africa because of her love of the work of Nelson Mandela,
and her death was particularly tragic; she was the victim of
resentment that couldn't have had less to do with her.
</P>
<P>
   Here we get to see how the hearings were held, in front of a
crowd and broadcast on television so the entire country witnessed
the accused's contrition. You may feel a chill pass through you
when Biehl's parents find it in their hearts to approve the
application for amnesty by the convicted killers of their child.
The mother of one of the accused is as heartbroken as Biehl's
parents, and the process does not buy her a moment's peace.
</P>
<P>
   The directors recognize that the drama in this story is so
potent it doesn't require any icing and that there's a bigger story
between the lines, a subtext about psychological violence visited
on a country, generation after generation.
</P>
<P>
   The subtle complications of ``Long Night's Journey Into Day''
take hold as another applicant, Robert McBride, convicted of a
bombing that took the lives of three whites, talks about his
suffering, describing the crude gradations of dehumanization that
were accepted in South Africa: ``colored'' and ``nonwhite.'' Driven
to strike back, he says on the stand that he has ``served a
sentence longer than any apartheid minister.''
</P>
<P>
   This attempt to bring closure to the jagged wound of apartheid
has so far to go that each of the stories sends a jolt of hurt to
your nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the episodes is more wrenching than the one before it.
The most heart-rending is the last, which reports on the shooting
of seven ``terrorists'' by the police, including video scenes of
the corpses being callously jerked by rope across bloody asphalt.
(The victims' mothers become hysterical during the hearing when the
tape is run.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest shock comes at the revelation that the secret police
essentially recruited angry young black men, trained them to become
revolutionaries and then killed them. Of the 25 police officers
involved in this grim event, only two seek amnesty, and one is a
black who infiltrated the group and instigated its members'
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Night'' offers its own definition of justice. Tutu calls it
``restorative justice,'' noting the need to confront these events
in the light of day. It's not totally curative, because justice can
never really be delivered in these circumstances; the ache of
racism and its violent aftermath still remain. This is an issue
that the film addresses with as much integrity as the committee
shows in its own efforts.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush is gaining the endorsement of former rival Steve
Forbes in the latest move toward reconciliation within the
Republican Party after a bruising primary contest. Forbes, the
wealthy magazine publisher, plans to announce his support Tuesday
night at an appearance with Bush in Manville, N.J., Forbes' home
state. Forbes adviser Greg Mueller confirmed the planned
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ILLITERACY PROPOSALS SPELLED OUT
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Asian-American businesspeople at the headquarters of
Sallie Mae in Reston, Va., George W. Bush called illiteracy among
schoolchildren a ``national emergency'' Tuesday, and proposed
spending $5 billion over five years to address the problem. The
money would pay for diagnostic programs to identify troubled
children in kindergarten and first grade, and pay teachers a
stipend of $230 a day to receive training in diagnosing student
reading problems. The program's biggest emphasis _ $900 million
annually _ would be on literacy programs designed and implemented
at the local level. Sallie Mae is the nation's largest provider of
student loans.
</P>
<P>
   GIULIANI'S COOLNESS HEATS UP RACE
</P>
<P>
   A new poll suggests that Rudy Giuliani's unsympathetic response
after the latest police shooting of an unarmed black man is hurting
him in his Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton. A Zogby
International poll shows Giuliani's seven-point lead has vanished
following the killing of Patrick Dorismond on March 16. Clinton now
has 45 percent to Giuliani's 42 percent _ within the poll's
3.8-point margin of error. Eighty percent of the people polled said
the mayor should have offered condolences to the victim's family,
and one in four said the issue would be a factor in whether they
vote for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   POWER STRUGGLE NOT OVER YET
</P>
<P>
   A day after his chairmanship of the Reform Party was upheld by a
federal judge, Pat Choate moved to stabilize the fractured third
party with plans to raise $1 million in the next several months and
to reach out to his vanquished rival. But there was no sign that
Jack Gargan, ally of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura who fought Choate
for the chairmanship, would accept the gesture. Gargan vowed to
leave the party and take his supporters with him after U.S.
District Judge Norman Moon ruled that the chairmanship belongs to
Choate.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T FORGET YOUR DAY JOB
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's quest for the White House has left him with
little time to spend on state business in the Texas Capitol.
According to the governor's official calendar and records kept by
his campaign, during the 25-week period from Oct. 1 through March
23, Bush spent 103 days out of the state campaigning and 20 days in
his state office doing the job he tells voters qualifies him to be
president. Bush's calendar, which tracks his Monday-through-Friday
work week, showed him in his office just one day each in January
and February, three so far this month, three in December and six
each in October and November.
</P>
<P>
   TEST FOR WELCOMING MCCAIN SUPPORTERS
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights organization, have been
pressing for a meeting with George W. Bush since last spring, but
Bush has demurred because the group's leaders supported Bush's
chief rival, John McCain. ``We think that's shortsighted,'' said
Richard Tafel, a top Log Cabin official. ``We are exactly the
people he should be meeting with. A lot of McCain people are
watching the Bush campaign wondering if they want us back, whether
we will be welcome in the party.'' Bush spokesman Scott McClellen
said there probably would not be a meeting _ because the group
``continues to politicize'' the question of whether there would be
a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACKS IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   In the latest effort to influence the presidential race via
secret contributors, a group of high-profile California Republicans
is running TV ads calling Al Gore a hypocrite on campaign finance
and other issues. Former California Gov. Pete Wilson is raising
money for the new group, Shape the Debate, but the donor list is
not public information. Patterned after the game show
``Jeopardy!,'' the 30-second spot pretends to be a show called
``Hypocrisy.'' A contestant chooses ``political hypocrites for
200'' and is told: ``He says he supports campaign finance reform,
but held an illegal fund-raiser at a Buddhist Temple.'' The answer:
``Who is Al Gore?''
</P>
<P>
   ROLE REVERSAL
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush have swapped places, the Boston Globe
has observed. To wit: Months ago, Bush's personality was his
biggest asset; now Gore's personality is a bigger asset than
Bush's. Months ago, Bush's leadership style was a big plus for him;
now Gore's leadership style is a bigger asset. Months ago, Bush was
considered the candidate most likely to appeal to independents;
now, Gore is. The Globe called this change in dynamic one of the
most astonishing alterations in a political campaign in history.
</P>
<P>
   LIKE VENUS AND MARS IN ELECTION, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore will need a substantial turnout of women in his home
state in November, according to a new poll, because the gender gap
so visible across the country is also a major factor in Tennessee.
The Mason-Dixon poll shows that while women in Tennessee favor Gore
by a margin of 20 points over George W. Bush, men prefer Bush by an
8-point margin. Overall, Gore leads Bush, 47 percent to 41 percent,
with 10 percent undecided. The poll, conducted 10 days ago, has a 4
percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   OK, WOMEN, LET'S BRUSH UP HERE
</P>
<P>
   They are the most sought-after voters, the ones who can make or
break presidential campaigns. But when it comes to knowing facts
about politics, women inexplicably lag behind men. That conclusion,
reached in a study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the
University of Pennsylvania, is true for issues ranging from
positions on nuclear test ban treaties to abortion rights. Of 25
questions about specific issues in this year's presidential
campaign or the backgrounds of four major presidential candidates,
women outperformed men on only one question _ about the Democratic
candidates' positions on public financing of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT BETTER PLACE FOR SHOW BIZ?
</P>
<P>
   After a rocky start marked by resignations and charges of
disorganization, planning for the Democratic National Convention is
picking up steam. The convention delegates' biggest job in August _
nominating the Democrats' presidential candidate _ is already
settled; Al Gore has the nomination sewn up. What the party wants
most from Los Angeles is a good show _ and a smooth one. Sherry
Bebitch of Claremont Graduate University's School of Politics and
Economics, doubts that any convention glitches _ and there will be
glitches _ will reflect badly on Gore. She figures people will
chalk it up to ``Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   NELSON LOOKING GOOD IN NEBRASKA
</P>
<P>
   In the contest to fill the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Bob
Kerrey in Nebraska, former Gov. Ben Nelson, also a Democrat, leads
the six potential Republican nominees. An Omaha World-Herald poll
shows Nelson would defeat each of the Republicans by a margin of
more than 2-to-1. The leading Republican, state Attorney General
Don Stenberg, has been an outspoken opponent of abortion,
characterizing certain procedures as something close to
infanticide. The poll found that Nelson had a favorable rating of
71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   HE'D BEEN BETTER OFF NOT VOTING
</P>
<P>
   James Epperson faced no opposition in the March 14 Republican
primary for his county commissioner seat in Edwards County, Texas,
so he crossed over to vote in the Democratic primary. But now,
because he voted in the Democratic race, Epperson cannot run for
his own seat as a Republican in November, according to Texas state
election laws. ``I just made a stupid mistake. That's all it boils
down to,'' Epperson told the San Antonio Express-News.

&HT;     JURY VERDICT OPENS DOOR TO MORE LAWSUITS AGAINST TOBACCO
COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By EMILY GURNON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A jury verdict awarding $20 million in punitive
damages to a former smoker who is now dying of lung cancer is the
latest in a handful of significant courtroom defeats for the
tobacco industry in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Superior Court case involved a Ventura County
woman, Leslie Whiteley, who was awarded $10 million each from the
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Philip Morris Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the jury awarded Whiteley and her husband an
additional $1.7 million for medical costs and pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The case is significant because it is the first lawsuit the
industry has lost involving a smoker who took up the habit after
government-mandated warning labels began appearing on cigarettes in
the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   It proves that ``the tobacco companies are wrong that just
getting Congress to put this warning label on a product is going to
protect them from misleading the public for 50 years,'' Madelyn
Chaber, the lead lawyer for Whiteley and her husband, said after
the verdict on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Whiteley case was the third straight major defeat for the
tobacco industry on the West Coast. Those and other adverse
verdicts have sent the value of Philip Morris shares plummeting.
The company makes about half the cigarettes sold in the United
States each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't really expecting any good news to come out of that
trial,'' said Brian Eisenbarth, a portfolio manager and tobacco
industry analyst with Collins &AMP; Co. LLC in Larkspur, Calif., whose
company owns some Philip Morris stock. ``The chances of winning at
the jury level, I think, are slim for the tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is ``not a lot of money'' for the gigantic companies,
Eisenbarth said the verdict may encourage other sick people who
began smoking after the warning labels came out to take their cases
to court. ``The problem is, this is only one person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But industry representatives denied the verdict represents a
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juries in general tend to believe, and we believe, that
despite today's verdict smokers have long been aware of the
significant inherent risks of smoking, and that people who choose
to smoke in the face of these known risks should not be financially
rewarded,`` Seth Moskowitz, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said tobacco companies have won six out of the last nine
cases involving individuals and smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Moskowitz said that California juries tend to behave differently
than those elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must remember that we are in a state where people are not
allowed to smoke even in bars,'' he said. In future cases, the
company will take into account the fact that ``jurors in Northern
California come into the courtroom with a different mind-set'' and
it will ``provide additional information to help (them) put the
facts in the proper perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the cases the industry has lost in recent years, three have
been overturned on appeal and two have had their damages amounts
reduced by judges. R.J. Reynolds has said it will file a post-trial
motion to get the Whiteley verdict overturned by the judge; if that
fails, it will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds currently has about 530 cases pending against it,
Moskowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos. could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteley, a 40-year-old mother of four from Ojai, used her lunch
money to buy her first pack of cigarettes out of a vending machine
when she was 13. She smoked Marlboros and Camel Lights, averaging
two packs a day. She quit smoking 25 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Chaber said Whiteley's family was ``very happy'' about the
verdict, ``but it comes at the expense of her life. They would be
happy to trade this money back in exchange for her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said she would probably die this year.

STOCKHOLDER ACTIVIST LOSES ANOTHER FIGHT WITH JAPANESE COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A Japanese shareholder activist, whose failed effort to
buy a company in Japan's first hostile takeover fight attracted
widespread attention, suffered a second defeat Tuesday when that
company repulsed his requests to raise its dividend and make him a
director.
</P>
<P>
   Shoei Co., a small electronics parts maker with valuable real
estate holdings that are not reflected in its share price,
announced at the annual shareholders meeting that the requests by
Yoshiaki Murakami had been voted down. But it did not give a
precise vote, and Murakami's aides indicated he might challenge the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Murakami is a former civil servant who quit public service
nearly a year ago and formed his own investment group with the goal
of investing in poorly run Japanese companies and driving their
share prices up. He is regarded as somewhat of a threat to the
entrenched corporate interests in Japan, where many companies own
controlling stakes in each other and the well-being of individual
shareholders is largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   His struggle to acquire Shoei in a tender offer to shareholders,
which failed last month despite the 14 percent premium he offered,
was widely viewed as a test of corporate Japan's willingness to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Murakami did gain control of 6.52 percent of Shoei, however, and
said he would try to press the company to disperse the roughly $660
million in unrealized gains on its real estate and securities
holdings through a higher dividend to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Shoei has aggressively resisted Murakami. It has hired Hideaki
Kubori, a prominent lawyer best known for his efforts to fight
sokaiya, or shareholder racketeers linked to the Japanese mob, in a
not-so-subtle effort to cast Murakami as an unsavory character.
</P>
<P>
   The company also marshaled the support of bigger, more powerful
members of its corporate group, or keiretsu.
</P>
<P>
   Shoei is part of Fuyo Group, clustered around Fuji Bank and its
sister financial companies like Yasuda Fire &AMP; Marine Insurance Co.
and Yasuda Trust Bank. Members of the group control more than 60
percent of Shoei's shares, and the company's board has long served
as a sort of preserve for former Fuji executives. This type of cozy
system exists throughout corporate Japan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even with the defeats of Murakami, however, his public challenge
to the system has helped highlight what critics call its stifling
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Murakami received the backing of Jean-Marie Eveillard and
Charles de Vaulx, who manage the First Eagle SoGen investment
funds, and other foreign money managers, as well as many individual
shareholders. According to Shoei, of the 253 shareholders who
presented their proxies, 150 backed Murakami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think this effort was a failure,'' said Kenya
Takizawa, a partner in Mergers and Acquisitions Consulting Inc.,
Murakami's firm. ``Of course, we didn't win the game today, but it
was a much closer match than we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall vote count, however, remained unclear. When Murakami
asked Shoei's president, Tanehiko Kamiura, to enumerate the votes
for and against, Kamiura demurred, according to Takizawa. He was
not at the meeting but got a report from others there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there was confusion,'' he said. ``For us, it is
not clear how many voted for Murakami's proposals and how many
against, so we will ask to examine the proxies.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Murakami might take legal action if there were any
discrepancies in the count.
</P>
<P>
   Takayuki Uchiyama, a spokesman for Shoei, said that as most
senior executive of the company, it was Kamiura's responsibility to
count the proxies received in advance of the shareholders' meeting.
``He said more than two-thirds of the shareholders opposed the
proposals,'' Uchiyama said. ``It is up to the chairman's judgment.
He is entrusted with the count.''
</P>
<P>
   Makoto Saito, a spokesman for Yasuda Trust Bank, said the bank
had voted against Murakami's proposals because it trusted current
management and was not interested in fatter dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessarily better to receive the dividends in
cash,'' Saito said. ``We prefer the accumulation of capital and
internal reserves.''  &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Chilly air will continue to circulate into the Northeast around
a sprawling low pressure zone over southeastern Canada. Gusty
breezes will add to the chill of the day from the eastern Great
Lakes to the Northeast Coast. Sunshine will be limited near the
northern Appalachians, where scattered mountain snow showers and
valley sprinkles will occur. Coastal areas will stay dry with a
mixture of clouds and sun.
</P>
<P>
   A front separating summer heat over South Texas from cooler air
to the north will be the focus for clouds and thundershowers. A
cluster of thunderstorms will weaken early Wednesday over East
Texas and Oklahoma, but will regenerate during the midday over the
southern Mississippi Valley. Some storms will have hail and
damaging winds.
</P>
<P>
   Lighter showers will dampen parts of the western Plains and
northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: RADIOACTIVE SNOW
</P>
<P>
   Mountains are water reservoirs for the West, collecting and
storing snow during winter. Once the dry season begins in late
spring, runoff from melting mountain snow provides fresh water for
many communities. To ascertain the amount of water in the snow,
water officials sometimes employ gamma radiation. In autumn,
detectors aboard low-flying aircraft sense gamma rays naturally
emanating from bare ground. Readings are repeated the following
spring. Based on the reduction of gamma rays by the snowpack, the
amount of water stored in the snow can be determined.

 &HT;    Remember: Nature is not on the clock
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, March 30. Story goes with graphic

<P>
   If there's one thing gardeners know to count on it's that there
are few givens when it comes to the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   That's an important reminder now that you've checked out Home &AMP;
Garden's bloom calendar in this section. The chart should help you
achieve the most attractive color combinations and time the bloom
periods of plants so that as one splash of color fizzles another is
about to burst.
</P>
<P>
   As you use the calendar, allow us to provide a few reminders:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cameo vs. lead roles: Some plants bloom for only a few days
while others flower for weeks and even months.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Size does matter: Big plants produce showier displays than
small ones. One blue mophead hydrangea will have more impact than a
dozen blue ageratum.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Millennium madness? You can usually bet on when a dogwood or
azalea will bloom. But some plants vary from year to year because
of a variety of factors. (Read on ...)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bizarre temperatures: Spring arrived early in Georgia, forcing
many plants to bloom three to four weeks ahead of ``schedule.'' By
the same token, freezes, known to occur as late as April, can wipe
out an early or even normal display of color. ``Temperature is the
real biggie,'' said Mildred Pinnell, horticulturist at the Atlanta
Botanical Garden.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Swamps and deserts: Droughts, such as the current one, can
affect when plants bloom, though most gardeners are able to manage
with proper watering techniques.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Their own little worlds: Remember that microclimates exist
within climates. These pockets shelter plants from exposure and can
affect bloom times.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dirty business: Soil conditions can have an impact, too. In
poor, unamended soil, for example, plants will struggle and lag
behind others.
</P>
<P>
   With those things in mind, make a date with your plants.
</P>

   ISRAEL-NETANYAHU _ JERUSALEM _ Israeli police Tuesday
recommended that former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be
charged with accepting a bribe and illegal gifts while in office.
The charges, if filed and if they lead to a conviction, could bring
a jail sentence. Police also recommended that Netanyahu's wife,
Sarah Netanyahu, be charged. The bribery recommendation stems from
work a contractor did on the Netanyahus' private house, apparently,
police say, in expectation that the prime minister would give him
contracts. The gifts included those from foreign dignitaries,
including a gold letter opener from Vice President Al Gore.
Netanyahu will hold a televised news conference at 1 p.m. EST to
dispute the allegations. (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

   CLINTON-SCFLAG _ COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Few, if any, local NAACP
officials will be in the audience Wednesday when President Clinton
speaks at a fund-raising dinner in Columbia, where he's expected to
denounce the Confederate flag flying atop the Statehouse. What
would seem a natural rally for flag opponents, such as the NAACP,
is complicated by the organization's national economic boycott of
South Carolina. ``We would have preferred that the president come
in and leave,'' said Dwight James, executive director of the
NAACP's South Carolina conference. ``We are hopeful that any
visitors coming in for the dinner will not stay in hotels or
frequent other tourist venues in Columbia.'' A look at how the
boycott is inconveniencing black organizations and colleges, pegged

<TEXT>
<P>
   At the beginning of the new millennium, one of the surprise
successes of the publishing season is a 1,000-year-old masterpiece.
The book is ``Beowulf,'' Seamus Heaney's modern English translation
of the Anglo-Saxon epic, which was created sometime between the 7th
and the 10th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The first great poem to be written in English, or rather, Old
English, ``Beowulf'' has been required reading in university
classics courses for decades: Beowulf, the legendary dragon slayer
and the model for countless heroic figures that followed him.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a best seller in Britain and the United States
(where it is published by Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux). On Sunday it
will be No. 13 on The New York Times Book Review list. There are
80,000 copies in print in the United States, an exceedingly high
number for a volume of poetry. A British list on which it ranks No.
5 describes it as ``much praised retelling of Anglo-Saxon
chiller.''
</P>
<P>
   To coincide with the publication of the Anglo-Saxon chiller,
Heaney, the Nobel Prize-winning poet, recorded the poem on tape (on
sale in Britain but not yet in the United States). The rolling
timbre of his mellifluous voice fills ``Beowulf'' with drama and
intensity and underscores the narrative elements of the text. This
is a story to be told.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Heaney tested his memory and began
reciting the poem, warming to the words as he spoke them: ``So. The
Spear-Danes in days gone by/and the kings who ruled them had
courage and greatness.'' Characterizing the difference between the
Anglo-Saxon and the Heaney versions, he said: ``The original is
barbaric in a beautiful way. To encounter `Beowulf' is like taking
a sledgehammer to a quarry face. You must bang in there'' _ and
make one's own imprint.
</P>
<P>
   In the writing, as in Heaney's recitation, there is an Irish
tinge, and occasional words that are more Ulster than Anglo-Saxon,
but the translation is authentically of its period and genre. It
is, he said, about one-third Heaney, two-thirds ``duty to the
text,'' and is therefore a merging of the anonymous author and the
contemporary poet. To appeal to the scholars among readers, the
poem appears in both versions on facing pages of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Heaney began the adaptation in the mid-1980s at the suggestion
of the editors of ``The Norton Anthology of English Literature.''
After he translated 100 lines, he said, the project ``fell into
desuetude.'' A dozen years later, he set aside the time and took up
Beowulf's sword with greater enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough came with his discovery of the verb ``thole'' in
the text. Anglo-Saxon for suffering, it was a word that he had
heard in his childhood in Northern Ireland. That offered him a
bridge between cultures and centuries. Searching for an equivalent
oral tradition, he remembered his father's cousin Peter Scullion, a
man who had ``a large voice and a very stately method of speech.''
As Heaney said, ``That's how I got started on `Beowulf,' with those
voices from my country past.''
</P>
<P>
   The first problem was the first word, hwaet in Old English,
which had been translated as lo, hark, behold, attend and listen.
By choosing the more conversational ``so,'' Heaney called for
attention and plunged the reader into the middle of the story.
</P>
<P>
   While working on the translation, he was guided by Alfred David,
an Anglo-Saxon scholar who acted as a kind of ``minder,'' keeping
the adapter within the boundaries of the text. Still, Heaney
managed a few personal insertions, for example his use of the word
gumption. For him, gumption had an Anglo-Saxon forthrightness about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Why Beowulf now? ``Well,'' he said, ``because I did it.'' He
laughed and elaborated: ``My motive was a kind of dumb sense of
challenge, facing up to something that's absolute. In a way,
Anglo-Saxon poetry cannot be translated'' (although, as was pointed
out, there have been more than 60 English translations of
``Beowulf'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of the lines as being big monkey wrenches welded
together,'' he said. ``Very strong, forceful things, and modern
English doesn't quite have the material to match it.'' At that
point, invention took over.
</P>
<P>
   As he worked on his version, he did not read it aloud. ``You
listen into yourself,'' he said. ``It's one of the curious
questions of composition of verse. You hear it in your own voice.''
As he wrote it, he could also ``hear the heft of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the story are Beowulf's three great battles,
against the monster Grendel, Grendel's mother and, 50 years later,
a dragon. Years ago, John Gardner's ``Grendel'' told the adventure
from the monster's point of view. While Heaney admired that novel
as a post-colonial reading of the poem, he said that he found the
dragon a more interesting character: ``The dragon lurks
underground, and he is awakened by accident. Psychologically, this
is the way trouble enters a life or a society. The dragon is
haunting, a condition in the imagining of the poet. Grendel is a
scene in a movie.'' To illustrate, he offered a brief mime of
Grendel gobbling up everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Heaney said that he agreed with J.R.R. Tolkien, who in an essay
on ``Beowulf'' assumed that the original author was an individual,
imaginative writer rather than a folkloric invention. Working on
the poem, he said, ``I've come to love the earned wisdom, the
homiletic aspect. There is an intonation of a grave but sturdy
human understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beowulf'' fits as a new chapter in the continuing saga of
Heaney. In his career, he has gone through cycles, which the critic
Helen Vendler has characterized as anonymities, archaeologies,
anthropologies and so on. He acknowledged the accuracy of Vendler's
categories: ``The first four books were looking into the ground,''
he explained. ``They were archaeological and self-exploratory.''
</P>
<P>
   The next few books were ``airier.'' Later he confronted
political questions in Ireland and then returned to more personal
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he wrote poetry, he quoted his friend Joseph Brodsky,
who said that he wrote poetry ``to get a buzz from the language.''
``The excitement of something coming out right, that is indeed its
own reward,'' Heaney said. ``As a young poet, you need
corroboration, and that's what publication does.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He began writing poems as a schoolboy, without a sense of risk:
``The first poems where I risked failing, where I was a-tremble
with the need that this would work, were written in November 1962
when I was 23.'' Those poems were inspired, he said, by ``the
voltage of reading'' Ted Hughes. Published in The Belfast
Telegraph, they in effect began his career.
</P>
<P>
   For all his subsequent productivity and acclaim, he hesitated
about claiming poetry as his profession. ``I came from a farming
background, and my career was teaching. My attitude was that you
had a job and poetry was a grace of sorts but not a profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed, of course, in 1995, when he was awarded the
Nobel Prize for literature, or as he calls it, ``the Stockholm
intervention.'' He explained his continuing reserve on the subject:
``You cannot possibly begin a sentence, `I have won,' which ends
with `Nobel Prize.' It's against all decorum.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he began a poem with ``a memory energy around a
specific image,'' which might be verbal or visual. ``I tend to
revise as I go along,'' he added. ``There are poems I write quickly
of which I am totally grateful, and then there are poems I write
more slowly, which gradually attain inevitability. And then there
are ones that you're not quite sure of yourself.'' Naturally the
poems he likes best are those that derive from immediate
inspiration: ``Something breathes _ exhalation.''
</P>
<P>
   How does he know when a poem is finished? ``When it leaves you
alone and you leave it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In speaking about the power of poetry, Heaney once said that
``no lyric has ever stopped a tank,'' but on the other hand the
impact can be unlimited: ``It is like the writing in the sand in
the face of which accusers and accused are left speechless and
renewed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the writing in the sand analogy,'' he said, ``because
poetry is totally fragile and creates a moment of concentration. If
you meet people to whom poetry means something, there's an
excitement and a conveyance of value. `Miles to go before I sleep'
is, in one sense, an obvious simple poem, but in another sense for
many people it houses understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I don't think art necessarily changes the world.
It changes, as Frost said, the plain of regard. It helps your
certitude as a creature, as a consciousness. If you steady yourself
in front of a work, whether it is painting or poetry, it has a
verifying effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He interrupted himself: ``God these are very tricky words.'' And
then went on: ``As a reader, my hero is Czeslaw Milosz. When I hear
that voice which is wise and full of wisdom-speak, I feel
steadied.''
</P>
<P>
   In writing and speaking about other writers, Heaney has only
occasionally referred to Samuel Beckett. Once he said that Beckett
was ``the most admirable writer we have known in our time,''
because he was ``purely the writer'' and ``purely himself.''
</P>
<P>
   To explain his distance from his countryman and fellow laureate,
he said: ``I didn't learn from Beckett in my own writing. I'm in a
different family or a different reservation.'' His artistic
predecessors are not Joyce or Beckett but the Irish poets Yeats and
Patrick Kavanagh _ ``from the rural Irish outback, the un-European
line.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a Beckettian line in Heaney's ``Beowulf'':
``For every one of us, living in this world/means waiting for the
end.'' When that line was quoted to him, Heaney said that he does
not believe in an afterlife, but does believe ``in a phrase like
eternal life.'' ``Life is sacred,'' he said, ``and I would very
unwillingly relinquish'' that conviction.
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that he himself _ turning 61 on April 13 _
was having a good life, he said, with a smile, ``It's not that I
deny it.'' But he placed a finger in front of his lips as if to
keep that fact a secret. Of his life as a poet, he said he could
not have imagined it when he was a young man. ``It is a kind of
surprise,'' he said. ``Ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he admitted that each time he took up his pen, he felt a
``sense of the perilousness.'' ``I think every poet thinks he's
written his last poem. Yeats used the phrase, the will doing the
work of the imagination. That's a marvelous statement. It's the
fear at the back of a poet's mind, that you're going on because of
habit, not because of necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as Beckett said, ``habit is the great deadener.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he agreed, and then sounded an optimistic note: ``But
it's also a great keeper of things. It's got a virtue. One
definition of meter would be the habit of doing it.''

   BKC-WISCONSIN _ When Dick Bennett became head coach at Wisconsin
five years ago, his new players were presented with a theme _ start
the dream. Saturday, the Badgers will actually reach out and touch
the dream as they meet Michigan State in the Final Four in
Indianapolis. They've won with a style that's not flashy or

first Final Four in 59 years. (Barnhart, Atlanta

   GLF-MARTIN _ ATLANTA _ For three years, Casey Martin has tried
to understand why the PGA is against him playing on tour. Martin,
bothered by a disease that affects his ability to walk, has a legal
right to ride in carts while playing on the PGA Tour, and that's
what he'll be doing this week at the BellSouth Classic. But the
latest decision from the PGA _ to take the case to the Supreme
Court _ has angered Martin. ``It has become personal,'' he says.

   BBO-ENRON-FIELD _ HOUSTON _ Tal Smith was the biggest 7-year-old
fan of the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park that summer afternoon in
1940. As much as he was taken by the grace of Ted Williams, Smith
was just as overwhelmed by the giant outfield fence known as the
Green Monster and the meandering quirks and cozy charm of the
stadium where he could almost reach out and touch Dom DiMaggio or
Bobby Doerr. Now as president of the Houston Astros, Smith brought
his love of ballpark nuances and idiosyncrasies to the design of
the new Enron Field, a $250 million palace in downtown Houston.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The haunting ``Journey to the Sun'' teems with life.
Set in Istanbul, it tells the story of Mehmet (Newroz Baz), a young
man with one of the more interesting occupations you'll see in
modern movies. His job is to find leaks in the water pipes below
his city, and he uses a long brass rod he places on the pavement,
listening through it to catch the rumbles. He even employs the rod
to impress his girlfriend, Arzu (Mizgin Kapazan), using it to tell
how far the approaching train is from their stop. The rod becomes a
rather awkward metaphor in ``Journey,'' as Mehmet discovers an
entire world his senses didn't detect: he can hear turmoil under
the streets but not on them.
</P>
<P>
   The writer and director, Yesim Ustaoglu, quickly does away with
the device. It's an arresting image, though, Mehmet and his rod:
the filmmaker uses it evocatively, and it's missed when it's gone.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmet becomes friendly with Berzan (Nazmi Qirix), who sells
music from his street cart. Berzan is a Kurd, and his father was
beaten and kidnapped. Because of his dark skin, Mehmet, too, knows
what it is like to be picked on. Berzan is part of the Kurdish
rebel underground in Turkey, and his friendship with Mehmet
provides an unexpected education for him. He learns of persecution
firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   After a search of the bus he is riding, Mehmet is pulled off and
viciously interrogated. A man fled the bus, leaving a gun in a
knapsack behind, and the authorities assume that it is Mehmet's. By
the time they are done with him his face is a patchwork of wounds,
and the image of him emerging from a tunnel, dragging his rod
behind him, is unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Ustaoglu has a knack for details. When Mehmet sees a woman on
the streets wearing stockings with exposed seams and admires them,
Arzu has a co-worker draw seams on her legs. Arzu grew up in
Germany, and when she gets to know him better, tells him, ``Ich
liebe dich.'' Ustaoglu's accumulation of emotional detail quietly
pays off, and ``Journey to the Sun'' vibrates with knowing.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow of Graham Greene looms over the film as it tracks the
moral education of an innocent. After Mehmet loses his job, his
roommates turn him out into the streets. Only Arzu sticks by him.
</P>
<P>
   He is determined to find out more about Berzan's struggle. ``My
nanny used to say, if you have a nightmare, turn over,'' Berzan
says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A puzzled Mehmet responds, ``How can you turn over when you're
asleep?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Journey to the Sun'' is an incisive drama about a waking
nightmare.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maynard James Keenan's Hollywood loft is a shrine
to identity confusion. Red curtains, dozens of sticks of incense
and statues of Eastern deities lend an aura of spiritual searching
to his front room; at the same time, barbells and weights place him
firmly in the cult of body worship. Then there are the soundproof
walls and studio equipment of a rocker and artist, and finally a
sense of clutter and an aversion to deep cleaning that give the
room the look of a bohemian bachelor pad.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan is a former Army enlistee and art student best known as
the reclusive, emotionally riveting singer for the heavy-rock band
Tool. But on a recent afternoon he was in the clothing of the new
group A Perfect Circle, of which he is also the singer. As further
testament to his identity confusion, Tool was rehearsing for a new
album in the back room of his loft while he was in the front,
sitting with Billy Howerdel and giving an interview about A Perfect
Circle, which is set to release its first record, on Virgin, on May
23.
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Circle began as instrumental compositions by Howerdel,
a New Jersey native who met Keenan while working as a guitar
technician for the hyperkinetic ska-rock band Fishbone. Howerdel
went on to work as a guitar tech with Tool, the Smashing Pumpkins
and Nine Inch Nails, and more recently worked as a computer
engineer on Guns 'n' Roses' painfully gestating next album.
</P>
<P>
   All along he had been making connections and plotting his entry
into the creative side of the music world. Two years ago he began
writing the music that would become A Perfect Circle. At first he
composed half-hour-plus songs that he imagined as soundtracks for
visually rich movies like ``City of Lost Children.'' Then he
shortened his pieces and imagined them as tighter pop pieces sung
by a woman. Finally Keenan entered the picture, writing lyrics to
the songs and rushing Howerdel into a recording contract faster
than he ever thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   Some Tool fans may not be happy with A Perfect Circle, not
because the music isn't as heavy and monochromatic as Tool's, but
because there hasn't been a new Tool album since ``Aenima'' in
1996. With A Perfect Circle scheduled to tour as an opening act for
Nine Inch Nails this spring, it would seem as though the Tool album
would be delayed even further.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan, however, said that he did not believe A Perfect Circle
would interfere with his more popular band. Though the others in
Tool are said to have been upset with him for signing to a new
major label contract without them, Keenan denied this. ``There's a
range of emotions they've gone through,'' he said. ``Most people's
base reaction would be anger or jealously. But they're very
rational people, so they came back to accepting that this was
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the long wait for a new Tool record was a
drawn-out legal battle between the band and its record label, with
each suing the other. Tool claimed that its contract was no longer
valid; the label, Volcano (which took over Tool's contract after
the breakup of its former label, Zoo Entertainment) claimed that
Tool owed it seven more albums and $25 million in damages. Last
year, however, the lawsuits were dropped when Tool renegotiated its
relationship and contract with Volcano.
</P>
<P>
   But a strong animosity toward the music business lingers in
Keenan's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if an artist only sells one record, the profits
should be split at the very least,'' Keenan said. ``This has gone
on long enough, this system of having to pay for everything
yourself and then getting only one-tenth of the money made on your
art.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Tool and A Perfect Circle, Keenan said: ``The music
was very different, so I responded differently. The process that we
go through in recording with Tool is very organic, but at the same
time it is very thought out. There is a very left-brain process of
dissecting what we're doing and drawing from source material; it's
very research oriented and esoteric.
</P>
<P>
   ``With A Perfect Circle the process is far more mechanical and
computer oriented, but at the same time it is also far more
emotional and intuitive. Tool is more a left-brain masculine
result, and this is more a right-brain feminine result.''
</P>
<P>
   The music on A Perfect Circle's debut album ranges from
straight-forward big-riff rock to heavy, droning soundscapes to
clean, simple pop to hard, heavy emoting. Howerdel said he was
happy with the results. ``I didn't even know that a human could put
lyrics to some of these songs,'' he marveled.
</P>
<P>
   Stomping on Summer
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync albums may be flying out of stores faster than Harry
Potter's Nimbus 2000 broomstick, but this summer the good boys may
be taking a back seat to the bad boys. The summer season is shaping
up to be the revenge of hard, loud, ugly rock 'n' roll. At least
four hard-rock tours are to stomp through amphitheaters, arenas,
stadiums and fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzfest has announced its lineup, which includes the tour's
namesake, Ozzy Osbourne, along with Pantera, Godsmack, Incubus,
Monster Magnet, P.O.D., Static-X, Tap Root, Crazy Town, and Kittie.
Tickets for the July 24 show at the PNC Bank Arts Center in
Holmdel, N.J., will be on sale on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Warped Tour, which includes less heavy, more
punk bands, including Green Day, NOFX, Long Beach Dub All-Stars,
Mighty Mighty Bosstones and the Suicide Machines, and the rappers
Jurassic 4. The tour comes to Randalls Island on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   In addition a music-booking company called the Agency Group,
which represents Slipknot, Coal Chamber and Sevendust, is trying to
jump on the new hard-rock bandwagon with its own tour, called
Tattoo the Earth. Finally Korn's Family Values Tour, gearing up to
run in late summer and early fall, has been busy looking for its
own headliner.

CBS TAKES A GAMBLE ON A BLITZ OF `FALCONE'
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ ``Falcone,'' a new CBS series about the Mafia
loosely based on the 1997 movie ``Donnie Brasco,'' is hardly making
its debut in typical television style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' will have its premiere on Tuesday from 9 to 11 p.m.
But then, in a highly unusual move, the show will continue for the
next seven nights (except Sunday) from 10 to 11.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the network _ and the show's creators and actors _
will know within a week if ``Falcone'' has found an audience and if
CBS will continue making the show, since no other episodes have
gone before the camera. No previous television series has succeeded
or died so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand we're absolutely thrilled because CBS is
putting us on for eight nights _ it's a unique event for a
series,'' said Bobby Maresco, who is part of a writing team with
Ken Solarz that helped create the series. ``On the other hand, it's
nerve-racking. If there's an audience we'll know right away and if
there's not an audience, well, we'll know right away, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The star of the show, Jason Gedrick, who plays an FBI agent who
goes undercover to join the New York mob, put it another way.
``It's a gutsy move by CBS; it's a huge gamble. It's giving the
show a lot of credibility. It makes us all nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is taking the gamble for three reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that the show will follow the National Collegiate
Athletic Association Men's Basketball Championship game. CBS
executives hope that male viewers who tune in to the championship
game on Monday, when ``Falcone'' will be heavily promoted, will
return the next night, giving ``Falcone'' a large audience for its
two-hour premiere.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason is that CBS, like the other networks, is
struggling to retain audiences for its series through any strategem
that would separate its shows from the rest of the pack. Network
television audiences have diminished because of competition from
cable and the Internet and because many shows are considered lame.
Running ``Falcone'' for eight nights gives the series an unusual
identity _ and a head start _ among its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, CBS is seeking to quickly move onto the terrain of the
highly successful HBO series ``The Sopranos,'' about New Jersey
mobsters with middle-class aspirations. Although the HBO show's
language, violence and sex would be unthinkable on network
television, the critical and audience success of ``The Sopranos''
is obviously a source of envy for CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that `The Sopranos' has been extremely successful was
part of our decision to go ahead with this show,'' said Leslie
Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS television. He added:
``The show stands on its own with or without `The Sopranos.' But
there's no question that `The Sopranos' added to our belief that
this show had a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is also unusual because it is based on the film
``Donnie Brasco,'' directed by Mike Newell and adapted by Paul
Attanasio, from ``Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia,''
a memoir by Joseph D. Pistone and Richard Woodley. It is unusual
for a film to be turned into a successful television series,
although there have been a handful, including ``MASH'' and ``Buffy,
the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pistone led a double life as a law-abiding family man and an
undercover agent for the FBI. The film starred Johnny Depp as
Donnie Brasco, the alias for Pistone, and Al Pacino as a low-level
hoodlum who was his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The television series came about after talks between Moonves and
Mark Johnson, a producer of the film who is now an executive
producer of the television series. Johnson said the name was
changed from ``Donnie Brasco'' to ``Falcone'' to avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make clear that this was not the movie and that
it was an entirely different animal,'' Johnson said. ``We got no
mileage in calling the show `Donnie Brasco.' The television show is
not `Donnie Brasco' on television. It was inspired by the same book
that turned into the movie. But we're not trying to replicate it in
any way.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the film, which dealt only marginally with
Pistone's wife and children, Johnson said that the television
series would focus on Pistone's troubled family life _ the
potential physical dangers to his family as well as the emotional
upheaval stirred by the FBI agent's double life. In real life,
Pistone is married with three daughters, but in the series he has
two.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Gedrick, who has had top roles on television shows like
``EZ Streets'' and ``Murder One'' as well as the mini-series
``Mario Puzo's `The Last Don,''' the show stars Titus Welliver,
Robert John Burke, Lillo Brancato Jr. and Sonny Marinelli. Patti
LuPone and Eric Roberts appear in recurring roles.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives said they could not recall a time when a series
ran so many nights in such a short time span, although other types
of shows have been on every night of the week.
</P>
<P>
   At its start, the hugely successful ABC game show ``Who Wants to
be a Millionaire'' ran 15 nights in a row. And in 1977, ``Roots,''
the television adaptation of Alex Haley's best-seller about
slavery, ran eight nights in a row on ABC. But ``Roots'' was not a
series like ``Falcone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' itself was hampered at the outset by its violent
content. The series was tentatively set to appear last fall, but
the high school killings in Colorado led Moonves to delay the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine happened a few days before we scheduled our shows,''
Moonves said. ```Falcone' was an adult drama. There was a certain
violence in the piece. We thought the timing was bad. Now we
don't.''

&HT;     FBI DIRECTOR ASKS FOR TOUGHER INTERNET CRIME LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ FBI Director Louis Freeh urged Congress Tuesday to
ease restraints on law enforcement officials so they can more
aggressively pursue Internet criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh praised pending legislation co-sponsored by Sens. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., and Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. that would make it easier for
investigators to trace e-mails and other Internet communications.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director told the Senate subcommittee on technology,
terrorism and government information that present law requires
investigators to obtain multiple court orders so they can trace a
single communication across judicial districts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require only a single judge's ruling for law
enforcement officials to trace Internet crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not asking for extraordinary powers,'' Freeh told the
panel. ``We are not asking for any more authorities than are
currently contemplated under the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer-Kyl bill would:
</P>
<P>
   _ eliminate the requirement for federal prosecution that an
Internet crime inflict a minimum of $5,000 damage;
</P>
<P>
   _ allow federal prosecutors to go after juvenile offenders as
young as 15 in Internet crime cases. Present law bars prosecutions
of defendants under 18 years of age in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   _ remove the existing six-month minimum sentence for convicted
offenders, which Kyl said keeps lesser offenders from being tried
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh told the panel that Internet crimes should also carry
tougher penalties. The damage caused by Internet criminals
outweighs the length of jail terms currently handed down in such
cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said the FBI needs a bigger budget to go after these new
Internet criminals, explaining that the bureau's computer intrusion
caseload had doubled since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He said the FBI handled almost 500 cases of cyber child
pornography last year, including instances where adults arranged
via the Internet to travel across state lines to have sex with
minors. This type of crime is `a completely new phenomenon,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a member of the panel, noted
that even the FBI's web site was brought down by hackers last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said Congress must make it possible for private companies
victimized by cyber crime to come forward and prosecute offenders
without fear of disclosing their own trade secrets. He said he
would support a measure to close judicial proceedings to the public
in some cases to protect a business' confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, Freeh said that the FBI coordinates its
anti-terrorism efforts with many nations, including `almost a
seamless'' relationship with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He reported that FBI agents and computer examiners had worked
with other nations to get `direct access to computers, hard drives,
which in some cases were the actual plans of terrorists to murder
Americans, large numbers of Americans.''

WENDELL CASTLE TRANSFORMS ART INTO ENTERPRISE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL WELLMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While many chief executives have nailed down the art of the
deal, not many know the deal on art.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Wendell Castle, artist in residence at the Rochester
Institute of Technology and one of America's foremost furniture
makers. His one-of-a-kind art pieces grace corporate collections
all over the country and are in cultural emporiums like the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution and the Art
Institute of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to ask the price, well, you can't afford it. His
pieces start around $20,000 and then begin to become expensive.
</P>
<P>
   So why has Castle decided to disrupt a successful art career at
the age of 67 and become an entrepreneur? Last year, he started a
business called Icon Design that will market a ``budget'' line of
his works _ the Wendell Castle Collection, as it is called _ for
prices ranging from $1,000 to around $15,000. Icon will also look
into producing pieces designed by other furniture makers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his motivation for going downscale was to make more
money, Castle said. ``There are only two ways I can think of if you
want to have a better income out of it: you can either make more or
charge more,'' he said. ``I sort of tried the making more back in
the early '80s and really didn't like it. There was always somebody
saying, `What am I going to do next?' It distracted me so much that
I couldn't really concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charging more is a great option,'' he added. ``But you can't
just do that instantly. You kind of have to tweak the prices up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wanted to do more than that. I had all these ideas for
things that I probably was never going to do because they really
weren't far out enough to justify making one.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, hundreds of thousands of Americans start their own
businesses, from gift-basket ventures to Web retailers. No matter
how high- or low-technology their products are, most of these
entrepreneurs share two distinct traits, the experts say: A desire
to run their own show and a knack for seizing opportunities nobody
else sees. Castle filled the bill on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   His brainstorm came when he starting running numbers through his
head. The effort of making more than just one would pay off
financially if he made 20 copies, or 50, he figured. But then, he
said, ``I thought, if you have something really nice why do you
want to stop at 20 or 50, especially if somebody else is making
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he was talking mass production _ on a limited scale _ and
that takes more than a studio, even if the studio is as large and
rambling as Castle's in Scottsville, near Rochester. The Wendell
Castle Collection is already being made on a small scale in the
studio, but is about to be transferred to Icon's new
37,000-square-foot plant in nearby Le Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Castle designs the pieces _ sold at Holly Hunt in New York and
other locations _ for the new line and builds prototypes, but after
that the work is turned over to his crew. He expects to add designs
every year and to retire pieces that don't sell. After all, as he
put it in Rule No. 10 of a 1996 poster, ``My 10 adopted rules of
thumb,'' that graces his Web site (www.wendellcastle .com): ``If
you hit the bull's-eye every time, the target is too near.''
</P>
<P>
   The new plant was bought last fall and is expected to be in full
operation this spring. It will eventually have about 50 workers and
will be laid out with production efficiency in mind _ unlike the
Scottsville studio with its Escher-like stairs that seem to lead
down to higher levels when they are not taking you up to lower
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Going to all of this trouble to open a plant also points out
another reason to produce in quantity, although Castle said it was
not the most important one: ``An artist really never has a business
that you can sell. Other businesses have value. You build a
business up, and you can sell it to somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   But back to the president and chief executive formerly known as
the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Icon is about a $2 million project, Castle said. He said he had
sold 30 percent of the company to raise $1 million and then had
received low-interest loans and grants to cover the rest. He
estimates revenue of $1.2 million for this year, and expects the
company to become profitable in 2001. Most of that business, he
says, will be with people who use architects or interior designers.
To his delight, people who already own his art pieces are also
buying his new line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another way of doing this is to not sell any of it and start
much slower,'' he added. ``I didn't have a million dollars lying
around, but I could come up with a couple hundred thousand and
start much smaller and grow.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you're in your 60s, he added, ``the idea of slow isn't
so appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this has created new challenges. Castle has always been
skillful at marketing his artwork, but the intricacies of marketing
an entire company are of a different magnitude. He is involved with
bringing in a public relations team and a marketing team _ another
associate, Hunter Kariher, the operations officer, will run the
plant day to day. ``Everything I've ever done in my whole life, I
think I probably jumped in naively,'' he said. ``I didn't realize
how much we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this he is still carrying on at RIT, where he
has no teaching schedule but does give seminars, ``where we talk
about current issues, design problems, problems of starting a
business _ some of the practical things that go along with
furniture making in addition to aesthetics.''
</P>
<P>
   Is something lost when an artist takes on the role of
full-fledged entrepreneur?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think that it's possible to wear two hats,'' Castle
said, ``though it is pretty hard to wear them at the same time. You
have to take one off to put the other one on. And the transition is
not instant. It takes a little adjustment period. Right now I'm in
the production mode, and after this spring we're introducing about
12 new things so some pressure will be off. And at that point I
really can get back to some art work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If economics didn't enter the picture,'' he added, ``the art
work would be the clear choice.''

investigators to trace e-mails and other Internet communications.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director told the Senate subcommittee on technology,
terrorism and government information that present law requires
investigators to obtain multiple court orders so they can trace a
single communication across judicial districts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require only a single judge's ruling for law
enforcement officials to trace Internet crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not asking for extraordinary powers,'' Freeh told the
panel. ``We are not asking for any more authorities than are
currently contemplated under the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer-Kyl bill would:
</P>
<P>
   _ eliminate the requirement for federal prosecution that an
Internet crime inflict a minimum of $5,000 damage;
</P>
<P>
   _ allow federal prosecutors to go after juvenile offenders as
young as 15 in Internet crime cases. Present law bars prosecutions
of defendants under 18 years of age in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   _ remove the existing six-month minimum sentence for convicted
offenders, which Kyl said keeps lesser offenders from being tried
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh told the panel that Internet crimes should also carry
tougher penalties. The damage caused by Internet criminals
outweighs the length of jail terms currently handed down in such
cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said the FBI needs a bigger budget to go after these new
Internet criminals, explaining that the bureau's computer intrusion
caseload had doubled since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He said the FBI handled almost 500 cases of cyber child
pornography last year, including instances where adults arranged
via the Internet to travel across state lines to have sex with
minors. This type of crime is `a completely new phenomenon,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a member of the panel, noted
that even the FBI's web site was brought down by hackers last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said Congress must make it possible for private companies
victimized by cyber crime to come forward and prosecute offenders
without fear of disclosing their own trade secrets. He said he
would support a measure to close judicial proceedings to the public
in some cases to protect a business' confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, Freeh said that the FBI coordinates its
anti-terrorism efforts with many nations, including `almost a
seamless'' relationship with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He reported that FBI agents and computer examiners had worked
with other nations to get `direct access to computers, hard drives,
which in some cases were the actual plans of terrorists to murder
Americans, large numbers of Americans.''

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRIEDKIN-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ William Friedkin was a golden boy
in Hollywood in the early 1970s. Two of his films, ``The French
Connection'' and ``The Exorcist,'' were among the most successful
of that decade. But Friedkin responded to sudden wealth and power
with the kind of self-destructive arrogance all too common in
Hollywood. The town waited for him to fail. And he did. ``Sure, I
was arrogant, I let success go to my head, I did not suffer fools
gladly,'' said Friedkin, the director of the new drama ``Rules of
Engagement,'' which opens Friday. He spoke quietly. ``I probably
was more enamored of myself than my talent deserved,'' he said. ``I
thought I was infallible. I wasn't.'' At the age of 64, Friedkin
accepts his infallibility with a shrug, and still seems brashly
confident. But the years have taken their toll. By Bernard
Weinraub. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CORPORATE-VILLAIN-FILMS (Undated) _ Midway through ``Erin
Brockovich,'' I began to peel off from that hugely likable movie
and consider its curious new genre, whose template had already
hardened. Once again, as in ``The Rainmaker'' and ``A Civil
Action,'' a David law firm was suing a Goliath corporation on
behalf of the company's victims. Once again, the corporation was
responding with a conspiracy of silence and intimidation. And once
again I had that uneasy feeling that something was missing: a
credible, complex opponent. By Phillip Lopate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HIP-HOP-FILMS (Undated) _ Hip-hop, to the discomfort of artistic
purists and cultural puritans alike, has become the lingua franca
of global youth culture. Nowhere is this more evident than at the
movies, where hip-hop increasingly provides not only a source of
subsidiary revenue (thanks to soundtrack sales), but a repertory of
styles, references and attitudes now showing at theaters
everywhere. By A.O. Scott. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-FIDELITY-FILM (Undated) _ In the transition from novel to
film, Rob, the hero of ``High Fidelity'' _ Nick Hornby's 1995
novel, Stephen Frears's new film _ undergoes some minor
transformations: he ceases being British and becomes American,
relocates from London to Chicago and sees his last name change from
Fleming to Gordon. The first two changes were no doubt to
accommodate the casting of the Chicago native John Cusack; the last
you can speculate about on your own. Otherwise, much remains the
same. Rob is still the owner of a marginally failing vintage record
shop, still called Championship Vinyl, which is still manned by
``the musical moron twins,'' Dick and Barry; he is still moping
about his love life, especially his recent dumping by his
girlfriend, Laura; and he is still the gloomy underachiever whose
relentless navel-gazing is made palatable by his honesty about his
shortcomings and his often quite funny insights about men, women
and romance. As film adaptations go, this one is almost fiercely
faithful. By Jamie Malanowski. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATRICK-STEWART-THEATER (New York) _ Patrick Stewart's first
``Ride Down Mount Morgan,'' at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in
1998, brought him mixed reviews and a mild concussion. So why has
he decided to star again in the Arthur Miller play _ this time on
Broadway? ``There are some roles that gnaw at you,'' the Royal
Shakespeare Company veteran and ``Star Trek: The Next Generation''
captain said recently; he was taking a lunch break during
rehearsals. ``Leontes in `The Winter's Tale' is one, and Lyman Felt
in `The Ride Down Mount Morgan' is another. There's this impulse
that I must do it again, that I almost got it right, but not
quite.'' In the play, Stewart, 59, plays a bigamist who has led a
self-indulgent life; the character is in part Miller's comment on
the Reagan era. By Mervyn Rothstein. WITH PHOTO. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EILEEN-HECKART-THEATER (New York) _ Eileen Heckart has been
acting for more than 50 years now, almost always as the second
banana. She was the alcoholic mother whose son is drowned in ``The
Bad Seed,'' the spinster teacher in ``Picnic'' on Broadway who gets
tipsy. ``You do one, they have no imagination,'' said Heckart about
all the drunks she has played. Sometimes she is the aunt, as in the
Mary Tyler Moore television show. She was Marilyn Monroe's waitress
friend in the movie ``Bus Stop.'' But this time, and at 81, Heckart
has the lead. Indeed, she dominates the stage at the Promenade
Theater for nearly every one of the 110 minutes of ``The Waverly
Gallery,'' Kenneth Lonergan's memory play about his grandmother's
decline, in which Heckart portrays Gladys Green, a woman who is
gradually becoming senile. By Dinitia Smith. WITH PHOTO. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARK-O'CONNOR-VIOLINIST (New York) _ When the cellist Yo-Yo Ma,
the bassist Edgar Meyer and the violinist Mark O'Connor take the
stage on Wednesday at Avery Fisher Hall to play selections from
their best-selling album, ``Appalachia Waltz,'' and its new sequel,
``Appalachian Journey,'' most eyes will be on Ma. The trio's
celebrity, its meal ticket, he is a classical-music superstar,
perhaps the greatest string player of our time. But he's not as
remarkable a musician as his 38-year-old ensemble-mate on violin.
O'Connor's unfinished trajectory, from largely self-taught fiddle
player to concert-hall virtuoso and classical composer, is already
one of the most spectacular, if underpublicized, journeys in recent
American music. By Tony Scherman. &QL;

   TV-DIRTY-PICTURES (Undated) _ Exactly 10 years ago this Friday,
Dennis Barrie became the first American museum director known to be
indicted for doing his job. Barrie, then 42 and director of the
Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, was well aware that there
were objections to the new exhibition there: photographs by Robert
Mapplethorpe, which included depictions of sadomasochistic
homosexual acts and portraits of nude children. Business leaders
had pressured the center to cancel the show, but the opening for
museum members the evening before had gone smoothly, so Barrie was
optimistic. But Barrie and the art center were indicted on
obscenity charges (pandering and using minors in pornography).
``Dirty Pictures,'' the television film version of Barrie's story,
is scheduled to have its premiere next month on Showtime. Barrie is
played by James Woods in the first criminal trial in the United
States over the content of a museum exhibition. By Anita Gates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-VIDEO-ART (Undated) _ On March 23, 1969, the infant medium of
video art launched a guerrilla raid on broadcast television. The
attack, a show titled ``The Medium is the Medium'' and described in
the program guide as ``six avant-garde artists take over
television,'' consisted of a barrage of abstract images and visual
non sequiturs. And if most viewers were too busy singing along with
Peter, Paul and Mary on ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' to
notice the artistic coup d'etat, the broadcast nevertheless marked
a turning point in the history of an art form that is now firmly
entrenched in the bastions of high culture. Excerpts from the ``The
Medium is the Medium'' return to broadcast television this Sunday
at 4 p.m. when WGBH in Boston presents ``The Electronic Canvas,'' a
history of video art that highlights that city's crucial
contribution to the medium. By Miles Unger. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

HOUSTON MUSEUM HAS HIGH HOPES FOR ITS NEWLY OPENED AUDREY JONES
BECK ANNEX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was a public-relations gift from the gods. Under an
ominous sky, a press procession left the safe confines of the
Caroline Wiess Law Building of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, to
tour its newly opened sibling, the Audrey Jones Beck Building. It
was a nervous parting from the confident grace of the main museum's
Mies van der Rohe glass-and-steel design, heading toward uncharted
territory.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the nagging doubts began to settle in, the sun
knifed through the clouds, casting an Emerald City iridescence over
the new Beck building. Suddenly, all that was uncertain about the
new building became inviting, its granite blocks taking on a
marbleized gloss, its burnished bronze accents assuming the shade
of Godiva chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Being diplomatic, one might term the exterior of the Beck
building, which officially opened Saturday, as admirably
restrained. A harsher critique would deem it just this side of
utilitarian. To be sure, it takes its puritanically elegant cues
from Joseph Havel's 9 1/2-foot bronze curtains, which unassumingly
frame the front entrance.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum's astringent touches amount to an architectural
red herring. The unadorned Beck exterior camouflages an interior of
boldly vertiginous and intimate proportions. Indeed, to say that
the $85 million Beck building is a mere addendum to the
well-established Museum of Fine Arts is akin to calling Paris'
Georges Pompidou Center a design trifle. It is abundantly clear
that Houston's art hierarchy intends for its newly charged museum
to be a national must-see destination, sheltering an exhaustive
collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Beck addition, culminating a 15-year expansion project, has
helped vault Houston's Museum of Fine Arts from the nation's 30th-
to its sixth-largest museum in floor space. When one adds the
exhibition space of the museum's Wiess Law building to the newly
opened Beck, one arrives at a head-turning total of 158,150 square
feet. That number alone, combined with the more than 40,000 works
that make up the museum's permanent collection, pushes the Museum
of Fine Arts from back burner to contender status overnight. And
because the Museum of Fine Arts already lures a reported 1 million
visitors annually, one of the largest draws in the Southwest, its
new addition spurs some museum officials to boast about it becoming
the country's ``mini-Met'' _ as in New York's Metropolitan Museum
of Art.
</P>
<P>
   That's setting the bar pretty high, but it might not be so flip
a goal considering the Beck building's prodigious second floor.
That level is a maze of 28 galleries that takes patrons from Roman
and Greek vases and artifacts to Picasso via the Renaissance and
Baroque periods. Just a brief sampling of the exhibits
commemorating the Beck building's official opening, from ``Faces of
Impressionism: Portraits From American Collections'' to ``A Closer
Look: English Silver, 1670-1760,'' speaks volumes about the
museum's versatility.
</P>
<P>
   The building's architect, Spain's Rafael Moneo, renders an
intimate, discreet introduction to the museum by lowering the
ceiling just inside the main doors.
</P>
<P>
   But within a matter of feet, Moneo sends the ceiling rocketing
up to an atrium that bombards a Roman marble sarcophagus relief
below with columns of natural light. The main lobby's escalator, a
potential eyesore, is invisible, thanks to its sheathing in a mocha
skin of bronze.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast to the blaring list of the museum's benefactors on
the main atrium wall, Moneo's tasteful overall design never needs a
bullhorn to broadcast its intentions. ``So many museums insist on
being so much about architectural statements that they kill the
art,'' says Barry Walker, curator of prints and drawings at the
Museum of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   From the canny choice of materials (creamy Portuguese limestone,
Dakota mahogany granite, and tongue-in-groove oak floors) to the
classical sense of proportion, Moneo successfully skirts that line
between grand and grandstanding. His deft choreography of
partitions and temporary walls creates intimate galleries within
meandering spaces. And many of Moneo's gallery entryways are lined
in gold-tinted bronze, calling to mind frames for the galleries
themselves. ``It seemed to me that bronze doorjambs make a
connection with the golden frames around so many of the Old Masters
collection,'' says Moneo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beck building's principal leitmotif is light itself.
One's eyes are ineluctably drawn to its wide assortment of
skylights. Each serves as a gallery prism, refracting natural light
to let it fall gently on a work of art without assaulting the
viewer with glare.

UNDATED: with glare. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One skylight, hanging 79 feet above a courtyard, dissects the
sun's rays so that they caress Paul Manship's monumental bronze
work ``Hercules Upholding the Heavens.'' ``Light is a much-changing
entity here,'' says Moneo on the roof of the museum, shaking his
head as if Houston's fickle light were a stalwart challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But Moneo's skylights are not just some ego-sating bit of
trickery. They show his willingness to tamp down his architectural
prowess in favor of creating the natural illumination that would
have surrounded each painting in its time. Moneo also understands
that unfiltered natural sunlight risks being a blunt instrument,
obscuring more than enhancing. ``In fact, what we decided on
finally was to take a combination of the cooler artificial light
and warmer incandescence of natural light for certain works,'' says
Mary Morton, the museum's assistant curator of European art.
</P>
<P>
   THE MUSEUM'S AMBITIONS are certainly bold when it comes to the
panorama of art it contains. The building's 10 galleries and
sculpture niches on its first floor boast a broad collection of
19th- and early 20th-century American art, tapping into the
museum's permanent collection of 5,000 prints and 650 drawings in
that genre. ``Bayou Bend,'' the special wing of the Museum of Fine
Arts devoted to an excerpt from the museum's decorative arts
collection housed in a nearby mansion, is a low-ceilinged, cozy den
of furniture and ceramics accented by such late 18th- and early
19th-century American painting classics as Thomas Cole's ``Indian
Pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Down an echo-chamberlike side-lit corridor, meant to evoke a
cavernous mansion setting, is a stunning collection of works by
Frederic Remington, including ``Fight for the Water Hole.''
``Somehow, this setting seems to reveal even more clearly that
Remington's brush-stroke technique was heavily influenced by the
French impressionists,'' says Wynne Phelan, the Museum of Fine
Arts' conservation director.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the first floor, the galleries follow a logical
American chronology, departing Remington for the luscious society
portraits of John Singer Sargent, including ``Mrs. Joshua
Montgomery Sears.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beck's lighting scheme is so in sync with the art's
requirements that it can extract both the brooding solitude of
William Merritt Chase's ``Mother and Child (The First Portrait)''
and the bronze gleam from ``Diana,'' by Frederick William
MacMonnies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such is the way that everything is lit now _ and keep in mind
I've worked here for 14 years _ that I often come upon something
and say, `My God, I didn't really know we had this,' '' says Janet
Landay, exhibitions curator at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, it is in the kickoff point for the Beck's
28-gallery second floor _ the museum level that most aspires to
``mini-Met'' heights _ that one discovers several weak spots.
Though housing some choice examples of Hellenic art such as a Greek
myrtle wreath dating from 330-250 B.C., its overall cache of
Mediterranean-based art is noticeably thin. And the meandering
warren of galleries that follows can occasionally lose its thematic
or chronological flow, careening a hundred years off in a confusing
tangent.
</P>
<P>
   The Beck does recover its footing in the area devoted to the
second half of the 14th century, with a collection of
ecclesiastical subjects executed by Florentine, Sienese and Spanish
artists. The intersection of Moneo's luminous touch and great art
occurs with Sandro Botticelli's ``The Adoration of the Christ
Child.'' James Clifton, the museum's curator of Renaissance and
Baroque painting, marvels at how well the Botticelli ``benefits
from all of Moneo's natural light, bringing out all the colors,
helping accentuate the work as a real art object, not some
artificially lit reproduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Camille Corot to create ``Orpheus Leading Eurydice From the
Underworld.'' ``Be it music or descriptions by the artist himself,
all of it makes the art come even more alive,'' says Beth
Schneider, the museum's education director.]
</P>
<P>
   THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY to appraise the overall impact of the Beck
building's arrival on the museum landscape, some signs already hint
at its impact. It is no mean feat that the Beck commemorated its
opening by adding three masterworks to its collection: a Greek
sculpture heralding the Golden Age of Athens, a Francesco Solimena
painting and a Picasso print.
</P>
<P>
   On a more subtle level is the new museum's sublime harmony of
internal design and its highly accomplished art. Surrounding
Edouard Vuillard's ``The Promenade,'' Henri Rousseau's ``The Eiffel
Tower'' or Georges Braque's ``Fishing Boats,'' the gallery's wall
colors, pale rose, taupe or blended yellow-ocher, seem to magnetize
the tints of the works almost literally out of their frames.
</P>
<P>
   This moment of synthesis between artwork and gallery only
confirms that the Beck is ambitious indeed. By actually teasing the
individual shades from a static canvas, the new design has elevated
the visceral experience of viewing the art. Any museum, new or old,
should aspire to nothing less.

&HT;     REFORM PARTY SEEKS SUPPORT FOR ROLE IN TV DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Reform Party opened a campaign Tuesday to rally
enough public support to enable expected nominee Pat Buchanan to
qualify for the nationally televised campaign debates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Pat Choate, the party's 1996 vice presidential
candidate, said the step-by-step effort over the next six months is
designed to generate a 15 percent showing in nationwide polls for
the Reform party nominee by September.
</P>
<P>
   The private Presidential Debate Commission requires participants
in the influential debates to have earned the support of at least
15 percent of the voters in nationwide polls to win a seat at the
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Latest polls show Buchanan facing an uphill challenge to meet
the 15 percent minimum. A CBS News survey released Monday showed
Buchanan drawing just 4 percent of the vote, compared to Bush with
46 percent and Gore with 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even among independent voters, Buchanan was trailing, with 5
percent of the vote compared to 45 percent for Bush and 35 percent
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Choate said that a federal court decision ending a divisive
struggle over control of the Reform Party has freed to party to
fully plunge into the coming election campaign ``in an aggressive
way and build a very competitive challenge'' to the Republican and
Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
   Choate outlined an ambitious effort by the Reform party
designed, in part, to generate public support for the nominee to
take part in the debates.
</P>
<P>
   Choate:
</P>
<P>
   _ Challenged Gore and Bush to agree to admit the Reform party
nominee to the fall debates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Demanded that the two rivals drop claims of being reformers
because it sows ``confusion.'' Choate insisted that Gore and Bush
cannot claim the mantle of reform unless they match Buchanan's
rejection of campaign donations from political action committees
and the unlimited, unregulated soft money given political parties
by corporations, unions, special interests and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walk the walk if you're going to talk the talk on reform,''
Choate told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   _ Announced plans to establish a national party headquarters in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vowed to raise $1 million by August to augment the $2.5
million in federal funds for the party convention and $12.6 million
for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ Promised three grassroots conferences via the Internet on such
hot button issues as political reform, trade policy and China.
</P>
<P>
   _ Announced nine committees to flesh out the Reform party's
infrastructure in time for its three-day national convention in
Long Beach, Calif., beginning on Aug. 12 _ just two days before the
Democratic convention in nearby Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Choate emphasized the importance of the Reform nominee
participating in the debates, noting that the success of party
founder H. Ross Perot's challenge to the two-party system was
directly affected by his participation in the debates.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, the Texas billionaire who won a seat at the campaign
debates in 1992, captured 19 percent of the popular vote _ the
strongest showing for a third party or independent candidate since
former President Theodore Roosevelt won 27 percent of the vote in
1912.
</P>
<P>
   But after Perot lost a court challenge in 1996 to get into the
presidential debates, he captured barely 9 percent of the popular
vote in his second bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has already filed a complaint with the Federal Election
Commission on March 20 asking the bipartisan panel to overturn the
15 percent rule established by the Commission on Presidential
Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan contends that the debate commission is violating a law
enacted by Congress in 1974 that awards benefits such as federal
matching funds and federal campaign subsidies to any party that
wins national party status by securing 5 percent or more of the
popular vote in a presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of its success as a ``minor party'' in 1996, the
Reform party nominee qualifies for $2.5 million in federal funds to
finance the party convention and $12.6 million to finance the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore, as representatives of a ``major party,'' qualify
for $13.5 million in convention funding and $67.6 million for the
fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC has 90 days to respond to Buchanan's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Choate vowed federal court action by the Reform party if the FEC
fails to adopt the Reform party's position.
</P>
<P>
   The legal follow-up coupled with steps outlined on Tuesday
should enable the Reform party to generate widespread public
support for its candidate to take part in the debates, Choate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're going to see over the next several months is this
party is going take a real lead in discussing the issues,'' Choate
said. ``We'll then go into a national convention and we will be
unified in that convention. We should come out of that convention,
I would say, in striking distances of that 15 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Choate said that the Reform party is on the November ballot in
22 states so far, with plans to get on the ballots in all 50
states.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a conservative commentator who unsuccessfully sought
the GOP presidential nomination in 1992 and 1996, left the GOP last
October to join the Reform party.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ended weeks of party infighting on Monday,
ruling that Choate and his faction of the party allied with Perot
had legally ousted Jack Gargan, an ally of Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura, at a party meeting in Nashville, Tenn., in February.

&HT;     JUDGE DELAYS RULING IN MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge on Tuesday delayed delivering his
ruling in the antitrust case against software giant Microsoft Corp.
to give the company and Justice Department officials time to reach
a settlement, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said last week
that he would be willing to postpone his decision _ which had been
expected Tuesday _ if he saw progress toward an out-of-court deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Jackson will delay his ruling until April 7 to give
both sides a chance to reach an agreement _ something the judge has
publicly stated he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, U.S. officials rejected a Microsoft proposal,
saying it didn't meet enough of the government's demands. But the
two sides have continued to negotiate through Judge Richard Posner,
chief judge of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago,
who has been mediating the case since last November when Jackson
asked him to help both sides reach a settlement. On Tuesday neither
Microsoft nor representatives of the Justice Department and the 19
states that brought the suit in 1998 had any official comment on
where things stood.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ronald Cass, an antitrust expert at Boston
University, Jackson's delay provides new hope that a settlement,
which seemed unlikely last week, could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people had more or less figured a settlement wasn't
in the cards, but this move by Jackson shows that Microsoft and the
government are making a real effort to end this case,'' Cass said.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson does issue his ruling, he is expected to deal harshly
with the Redmond, Wash.-based company. On Nov. 5, Jackson issued
``findings of fact'' that said Microsoft had used its monopoly
power to stifle innovation, reduce competition and hurt consumers
by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows
operating system. A computer's operating system is the core program
that allows other programs, such as word processing, to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Because Windows runs 95 percent of all computers, Jackson said,
Microsoft's bundling, or tying together, of its operating system
and its browser means that browser competitors _ such as Netscape _
are at a severe disadvantage when it comes to selling their own
browsers. This Microsoft practice led to less competition and less
innovation, which hurt consumers, he said. Microsoft contends that
the browser, which allows users access to the World Wide Web, is
not a separate product but an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
The November findings represent Jackson's conclusions about which
side presented the most believable case during the year-long
hearing that opened in his court on Oct. 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will use those findings to determine whether Microsoft
actually broke the law. But since his findings of fact were against
the company, many antitrust experts say they expect he will
conclude that it did violate antitrust law. If he does, the case
will move to its final phase: the penalty stage. At that time,
Jackson could order the breakup of the company into separate parts
to end its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's latest proposal to settle the case reportedly would
allow manufacturers of computers or software to modify Windows so
that rival products, such as Internet browsers, could be attached
to the operating system. The company also would offer a version of
Windows that would not include Microsoft's own Internet Explorer
browser.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal, Microsoft also reportedly offered equal pricing
and shipping terms to all computer makers who use its Windows
operating system software. Such a move would end Microsoft's
ability to offer pricing breaks to computer retailers that favor
other types of Microsoft software, such as Microsoft Word, over
competing products.
</P>
<P>
   Government sources said federal and state lawyers reviewed
Microsoft's proposal over the weekend but decided it lacked enough
assurances that the company would not bundle future software
products to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   While backing away from proposals to break up the company, the
Justice Department was expected to demand that Microsoft limit the
number of software products that the firm can add to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft wants to make a deal, experts said, the company
will do it before Jackson's ruling on whether the firm broke the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings of fact showed that he found the government's
case against the company credible and that he rejected as
``specious'' virtually all of Microsoft's arguments.
</P>
<P>
   With a half-dozen private antitrust suits now filed against the
company, Microsoft wants to avoid giving the plaintiffs' lawyers
any negative ruling by Jackson, which they could use as a potent
weapon in their civil suits against the firm. Microsoft stock rose
following news of the delay, climbing as high as 107-7/16 before
settling at 116, up 1-15/16 for the day.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We will be traveling by airplane with a 2-year-old and were
wondering what to do about equalizing the pressure in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   _ T.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: As the airplane rises and descends, the air in the inner ear
expands or contracts as the pressure changes. There are as many
cures for this as for hiccups. To assist your youngster, have him
chew gum, yawn or suck on a lollipop during takeoff and landing.
The other tried-and-true technique is to pinch the nostrils closed
and blow, which backs up air into the ears, causing a ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had my 1- and 3-year-old nephews visiting my home. The
3-year-old wrote on my newly painted white walls with a green
crayon. I've tried Fantastik, 409, warm water and even hairspray,
but the crayon isn't coming off. Any suggestions? I can repaint, if
there are no other solutions.

   Spray the wall with WD-40 and wipe with a soft cloth. If there
is still some crayon gracing the wall, use a little Ivory

should do it, according to Binney and Smith, maker of the Crayola
Crayons that often end up in some very creative places!

   Q: I have a 7-year-old fascinated with miniature corn on the
cob. He wants to know where they grow, and if we can get the seeds
to grow them in our yard. Clayton is going to be watching daily for
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michelle R.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's doable and the time is now. Grow baby ears of corn with
any variety of sweet corn. The trick? Plant the corn close
together, and harvest the ears earlier than usual. Full-size corn
plants are spaced about a foot apart and harvested after the silks
have turned brown. Mini-corn is the product of cramming plants
together, stunting their growth. Harvest is just before the silks
turn brown.
</P>
<P>
   Pick these puppies five days after the silk appears, and peel
carefully to reveal a tiny but perfectly formed ear about 3 inches
long.

<P>
   _ Polly Metz
</P>
<P>
   A: Neil lives in Houston and heads a company that develops
educational software. Marvin lives in Alexandria, Va., and is a
partner in an investment firm. Jeb's full name is John Ellis.

<P>
   Q: How do I get in touch with the Guinness Book of Records to
report a record in an unusual category?

categories are continually added. Write Guinness Media Inc., 6
Landmark Square, Stamford, Conn. 06901, or e-mail
infousa(at)guinnessrecords.com. Keep me posted _ I would love to
know if a Texan is among the likes of the 60 members of Singapore's
Nanyang Technological University who hold the record for the
longest paper clip chain (16 miles, 978 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a strange mold/fungus popping up in our back yard,
near our swimming pool. It is bright yellow and puffy, and when
lifted up there is a bright red, almost liquid-type substance
underneath. Any idea what this is? It has shown up between cracks
in the cement patio and now is growing on a rock bed. I have been
cleaning the affected areas with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   _ J. Miller
</P>
<P>
   A: Mycologist (fungi guru) David Lewis suspects this fungus is a
plasmodium. You do not need bleach to clean it away _ a simple
garden hose will do. Lewis says you may have to live with the
fungus (it's not poisonous, just unsightly) until it goes away.
Plasmodium thrives on dampness and eats bacteria and algae. Want
Lewis to identify it? Pick some and dry it well (over a light
bulb), slip it in a plastic bag and mail it to him, Route 2, Box

IMF SHOULD EXPAND ROLE IN GLOBALIZATION, SAYS INCOMING CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Laying out his vision of the future of the
International Monetary Fund, Horst Koehler, the new managing
director, said Tuesday that rather than shrinking as some critics
have suggested, the fund should expand its role as ``a crucial
cornerstone'' of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks in one of the first interviews he has given since
his appointment this month came amid a welter of conflicting
proposals for reforming the IMF, one of the world's important
financial institutions, both in the U.S. Congress and in the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of some of those arguments, notably in a report this
month from a congressional commission led by Professor Allan H.
Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, was that both the IMF and
its sister institution, the World Bank, should be radically pared
back because they often do more harm than good in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers has opposed some of the
commission's findings, and Koehler, a 57-year-old former high
official in the German finance ministry, sought in the interview to
avoid an impression that he and Summers were on a collision course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do see a lot of communality in the ideas expressed by Larry
Summers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the 45-minute interview at his office at the
London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
where he will leave as president to join the IMF, Koehler made
clear that his concept of reform would not limit the broad reach of
IMF influence that some critics want trimmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own vision is, in rather broad terms, that the IMF should
be even more than in the past a crucial cornerstone to secure
growth and stability in the world, or in the global economy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we do with crisis management, aid to the developing
countries, the most important thing to achieve is sustained growth
in the world economy, and that's not only in developed countries
but really in the global economy including the developing countries
and the emerging markets. That's my most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that the huge capital flows that have
come to be associated with globalization had implications both for
the IMF's role as a lender and the relationship between its loans
and those available on the international capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that after the experience with the crises in Russia
and Asia,'' Koehler said, ``the IMF should be the center of
excellence for the international financial markets, for the
international financial and monetary system.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he said, the IMF should ``set up standards and
codes for sound banking systems, sound behavior and, based on that,
do more to prevent crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But he made clear that that did not preclude a shift in the way
the fund allocates its vast resources. ``The IMF also, of course,
has to adapt to changes in the world economy,'' he said. And,
reflecting the views of the Clinton administration, he said in
seeking to promote growth, ``the biggest part should be done by the
private capital markets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that there's need to review the focus of the IMF,''
Koehler said. ``And reviewing the focus also means that we have to
understand IMF lending in principle as a temporary lending and not
as a permanent lending which would substitute the possibilities of
the private capital markets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The German official is joining the IMF after 18 months as head
of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, an
institution established in the early 1990s to promote private
investment and market economic values in the former Soviet bloc
countries.
</P>
<P>
   He came into that job within weeks of the Russian default in
August 1998, and was obliged to write off a series of bad debts
from Russia. The experience has clearly bred a degree of caution.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler was one of the first Western officials to meet with
Russia's president-elect, Vladimir Putin, as he leapt to prominence
in the just-ended presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Koehler said Tuesday that the IMF should ``remain engaged
in Russia'' and while he praised Russia's ``progress in terms of
adjusting to a market economy'', he also urged the new Russian
leader to avoid his country's past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson from some experience in the past is that the IMF,
like others, should judge Mr. Putin and the Russian government not
just by their words but by their deeds. And I hope that President
Putin will build up new confidence in demonstrating that he's able
to take prior action before international support is coming in,''
Koehler said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the issues he addressed coincided with the U.S. view,
such as the notion that the IMF should be prepared for greater
transparency in its dealings with what he termed ``civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about demands from developing countries for the
cancellation of their debts, Koehler said that any debt
cancellation should only be part of a broader strategy for economic
recovery in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that the IMF lending should continue as a means of
influencing the broad economic development of these countries
rather than concentrate simply on emergencies. Without lending to
the developing nations, he said, the IMF would have little
influence on economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler was chosen for the top job at the IMF after tortuous
trans-Atlantic wrangling that had soured relations between the
Clinton administration and Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder,
who lobbied first for one German candidate _ Caio Koch-Weser, who
was vetoed by President Clinton _ then swung his weight behind
Koehler, who had said just four months earlier that he was not
interested in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's endorsement of Koehler was depicted in Washington as a
reluctant move designed principally to avoid further strains with
Germany. Some European officials supporting different candidates,
moreover, also raised questions about Koehler's qualifications,
despite his prominent role in designing the financial framework of
Germany's reunification and of the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler insisted those circumstances would not undermine his
authority at the head of the IMF ``I think that the dust will
settle after this rather heated debate,'' he said. ``I'm quite
confident that we'll do a good job.''

ON PATERNITY LEAVE, BLAIR WILL GET CHANCE TO PRACTICE WHAT HE
PREACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair has spent nearly three years
in office telling the British they have to shed their fusty
traditions and get with the times. Now his wife is telling him
there is no better place to stage the revolution than in his own
home.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair, 45, is seven months' pregnant with the couple's
fourth child, and last week she said that she expected Blair, 46,
to take some of the paternity leave that his government has just
made part of British law.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly closing off the exit that the singular importance of his
job might afford him, she noted admiringly that the prime minister
of Finland, Paavo Lipponen, 57, had stopped running his country
earlier this month to spend a week at home with a newborn daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, am promoting the widespread adoption of his fine
example,'' said Mrs. Blair, a high-powered London lawyer, at a
legal forum on employment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever doubt there was about who was being proposed as the
next fine example disappeared days later when the prime minister
was questioned by John Humphrys, the nation's best known radio
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Was his wife putting any pressure on him, Humphrys wanted to
know. Blair was uncharacteristically silent. ``I'll take that as a
yes, then,'' said the interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I want to take some time with the baby when he or
she comes, but I honestly don't know what to do,'' he said,
sounding more like a dithering Hugh Grant character than the
decisive prime minister of Britain. He then ditched the subject
with a bantering reference to the Blairite solution to all ills.
``I will have to find a third way through it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that path leading anywhere other than
across his doorstep and into the crib room, such is the pressure
that is building. ``Tony Blair has a unique opportunity to lead by
example, to show that fathers have a crucial role in their child's
life from the moment of birth,'' said Julie Mellor, the chairwoman
of the Equal Opportunities Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Newburn of the National Childbirth Trust, was blunter,
implying he would be a national wimp if did not seize the
opportunity. ``What Tony Blair does when his baby is born will be a
very powerful signal to other men about what real men do,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiona Mactaggert, a Labor member of Parliament from Slough,
said, ``Of course he has got to take some leave, though I suspect
he will do it in a sheepish way.'' Blair may be helped by the fact
that he lives only one floor above the shop.
</P>
<P>
   His is an intensely poll-sensitive administration, and the
opinion surveys are showing that a decision to take some time at
home would be particularly popular with women. There are more women
in the Labor parliamentary ranks than ever before, and the party
wants to maintain the favor of women, who flocked to vote for it in
1997 in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Blair is by all accounts actively involved in the lives of his
three children _ Euan, 15, Nicky, 14, and Kathryn, 11 _ and his
government has made developing explicit policies for parenting and
marriage one of its key pledges. On taking office in May 1997, he
said, ``Every area of this government's policy will be scrutinized
to see how it affects family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Britain incorporated the European Union dictate
giving new fathers the right to take up to 13 weeks off work during
the first five years of their children's lives, with employers
obliged to hold the jobs open during the absences, though not to
pay for the leave time. A government task force is looking into
broadening the benefit and mandating payments.
</P>
<P>
   Family values have become a big political issue in Britain as
evidence mounts that traditional structures are collapsing. The
independent Family Policy Studies Center published a report this
week showing that 38 percent of babies are born out of wedlock,
compared with 7.2 percent in 1964, and that the number of children
living in one-parent homes has trebled in 25 years, up to 4.4
million from 1.4 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The surprise pregnancy and new debate about parental leave have
focused attention on Cherie (pronounced shuh-REE) Blair, the first
spouse of a British prime minister to hold a full-time job. She is
widely photographed but rarely quoted, an adoring and silent first
lady standing by her husband's side at official functions flashing
her signature lopsided grin. She has kept her election year pledge
to serve as consort when duty requires but to steer clear of
politics and government and to keep working as a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Blair's election and the family's move into the
nation's most publicized residence, 10 Downing St., she was back on
the job. In her curly white wig and black barrister's robes at the
Mayor's and City of London Court, she presided as an assistant
recorder, or part-time judge, in an occupational compensation case
involving a British aerospace worker who suffered a hernia when a
machine tool drill slipped.
</P>
<P>
   She practices under her maiden name Cherie Booth, and her
speciality is employment law. She moves about the city with minimal
fuss and receives no special treatment. That came to light last
fall when she was stopped by a subway guard and forced to pay a $15
fine for having an underpaid ticket for her journey.
</P>
<P>
   She had a dazzling academic record at the London School of
Economics, topped all candidates in her bar exams, entered practice
in 1976 and remarkably swiftly was made a queen's counsel in 1995,
a title held by only the top 10 percent of English barristers. She
plans to return to work in September, and no one doubts she will
attain her ambition to be a High Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Indications of the insulation of the British judiciary from
politics abound, but one is that she was given her QC suffix by a
Conservative lord chancellor at a time when her husband had already
become the high-profile leader of the Labor Party. She herself
dramatized her independence by advising union leaders recently to
sue the Blair government and offering to represent them if they
went ahead.
</P>
<P>
   If Tony Blair had to go off salary during a leave, it would have
less effect on the household income than an interruption in his
wife's paycheck would. She is thought to earn nearly three times
the $175,000 that he receives as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   She is fiercely protective of her family, and last month she
took out an injunction against The Mail on Sunday and sued a former
nanny to prevent publication of an account of her home routine,
even though it was flattering.
</P>
<P>
   She has not publicly talked about life at 10 Downing St. but
shortly before the election, she gave the women's magazine Prima a
brief assessment of her husband's household skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good at polishing shoes and has been known to cook a
meal,'' she said. ``I wouldn't say he is intimate with our washing
machine,'' she added. ``But he does know where it is.''

   RUGAZI, Uganda _ In one room the concrete floor looked a little
new, and on a hunch, the police began to dig Tuesday. First they
found a human foot, sole upturned, poking up from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few hours, 28 bodies were hauled out of a pit _
carefully sealed with cement, maybe months ago _ inside the house
owned by a leader of a cult in western Uganda. By dark the pit was
only half emptied.
</P>
<P>
   It was, on one level, another horrifying discovery in the 11
days since more than 300 people were found burned to death at a
church not far from here. The death toll, from three different
sites, has now risen to at least 593, including 74 bodies found
buried in the backyard of this same house Monday. There are at
least two more suspected grave sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery of the pit may also indicate just how well
organized, and perhaps longstanding, this march to mass murder in
Uganda was.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan police pathologist, Dr. Thaddeus Barungi, said
Tuesday that the corpses buried inside the house were ``much
older'' than the ones in the back yard, which he estimated had been
killed less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the care taken in constructing and sealing the pit may
suggest that the leaders thought they could get away with some
murders early on. There was even an explanation why they needed a
hole in the middle of their house: They had told a local politician
that they planned to install an ``underground'' refrigerator,
police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As each day passes, the police say it becomes clearer that most
_ maybe even all _ the people were slain and were not the victims
of mass suicide, as was originally suspected when the bodies at the
church in the village of Kanungu were discovered March 17.
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators say they cannot rule out suicide for some
people in the church. After all, the cult _ called the Movement for
the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God _ professed to
believe that the world would end on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the other victims found since then show signs of
strangulation: One woman, for example, found in the back yard of
the house here had a banana leaf tied around her neck. The skull of
another corpse was crushed.
</P>
<P>
   The police say their investigation has also begun to turn to
exactly how so many people could have been killed _ seemingly
without any neighbors hearing the first of it. There has been much
speculation that many victims were poisoned, particularly because
many corpses show no sign of violence at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't kill all these human beings alone,'' said Godfrey
Bangirana, an assistant police commissioner, on Tuesday as he stood
aside a row of several dozen corpses in the back yard here. ``This
was an organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``And an organized crime cannot be committed by one person,'' he
added. ``It must be a group.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The police have not ruled out the possibility that the leaders,
and particularly the overall leader, Joseph Kibwetere, are still
alive, perhaps having escaped to the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, not far away.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies found Tuesday were in the home of Dominic Kataribabo,
62, an excommunicated priest reported to hold a doctorate in
theology. He lived in a well-constructed stone house of 10 rooms at
the top of a hill in the village here, surrounded by a small banana
plantation, in shouting range of the children who play at the
Rugazi Central Primary School.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and police said the house was apparently a place where
cult members came to study. Both neighbors and the police also say
that cars and small trucks often came to the house at night.
</P>
<P>
   What strains belief is that no one interviewed by reporters
Tuesday at the site _ or by the police _ admitted to having any
idea what was happening there. Even Kataribabo's brother, Arsen
Oworynawe, 78, who lives in a house maybe 20 yards from where the
74 bodies were buried, said he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know such a thing could happen,'' said Oworynawe, a
carpenter who said he helped build his brother's house. The back
yard, he said, had been shielded off by huge reed mats and he could
see nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He had little to say about his brother, except that he did not
seem crazy to him and that he last saw him on March 12, when
Kataribabo said he was going to Kampala, the capital of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was normal,'' his brother said. ``I have a son in Kampala
and I asked him to send greetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Owarynawe said he himself belonged to the cult for about three
months several years ago. ``I didn't like the way they were
preaching,'' he said. ``They never wanted anyone to drink or smoke.
And eating, you know, was a problem. They would eat only once a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, his family sat with cloths covering their noses because
the stench from the bodies was so strong. Owarynawe had his own way
of combating the horror: ``I need a drink,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the local police dug up 74 bodies from one large hole
in the back yard, then reburied them in two other holes the cult
members had already dug. But the local police were supposed to have
waited until Tuesday, when senior investigators arrived to perform
more detailed forensic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a breakdown in communications,'' said Mugenyi
Assuman, a Uganda police spokesman at the site. ``We had told them
to wait but somehow somebody misinformed them yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday a pack of prisoners and laborers in bare feet _ some
with their hands wrapped in garbage bags _ unearthed the bodies
again. Quick autopsies were performed out in the open on some of
the corpses and tissue samples were taken for analysis.
Investigators counted 46 females, 26 males and two of uncertain
sex, including a baby less then three months old.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 28 bodies pulled so far from the pit, 15 were female and
13 were male. Several were young children.

GASOLINE PRICES MAY NOT EASE IN U.S. UNTIL AUTUMN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Gulf Coast)   (sidebar with OPEC)  
(bl) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Regardless of how quickly oil-exporting nations can
increase production, motorists in the United States may not get
relief from high gasoline prices until this autumn at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   While the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
negotiated a new production agreement Tuesday, petroleum industry
analysts said pump prices could remain at current levels for most
of the summer, or even rise, because domestic supplies of gasoline
and crude oil were severely depleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing now is inventories that look closer to what
we'd expect after the summer driving season, rather than heading
into it,'' said Jonathan Cogan, a spokesman for the U.S. Energy
Information Administration, part of the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-March, motor gasoline stocks were at 199.3 million
barrels, compared with 221.6 million barrels at the same time last
year, according to the agency. Similarly, crude-oil inventories had
292.6 million barrels at mid-March, compared with 330.9 million
barrels last year.
</P>
<P>
   It takes two months or so for Middle East oil to travel to the
United States, be refined into gasoline, and make it to the
gasoline pumps. But some analysts say an OPEC production increase
might not have a noticeable effect on gasoline prices even after
that time. Not only are domestic supplies already very low, but
American consumers, feeling prosperous from the strong economy, are
expected to take a lot of driving vacations this summer, regardless
of the price. That will keep demand for fuel high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost any action taken now is an action that will have its
greatest effect next fall or next winter,'' said Philip K.
Verleger, a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, an economic
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Government forecasters have predicted that average retail
gasoline prices could peak at $1.75 to $1.80 this summer. Prices
could rise even more in some parts of the country, particularly
California, which has requirements for cleaner-burning fuel.
California is ``vulnerable to any supply problems,'' said Cogan.
``Any sort of refinery problem gets reflected in the prices
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the run-up in gasoline prices, refiners have not been
refining as much fuel as they can. The reason is that the price
they have paid for crude oil, until recently, had risen faster than
the prices for the refined products they sell, giving them less
reason to produce more gasoline. In a report earlier this month,
the International Energy Agency, which monitors petroleum
consumption in developed countries, said this was an important
reason why gasoline supplies in the United States were low.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Verleger said, some lenders have grown more
cautious with the credit lines that refiners use to buy crude oil
because of the uncertainty over prices _ another reason why
refiners have not been increasing production.
</P>
<P>
   Verleger said any major refinery disruptions this summer _
including fires, maintenance and damage from Gulf Coast hurricanes
_ could help drive up prices more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction of gas prices this summer will be determined
primarily by the success of the refining industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Political pressure has been building to release oil from the
United States' Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Were that to happen, it
could have a quicker impact on gasoline prices, he added, because
it would take only a few weeks for that oil, which is in Louisiana,
to flow to the market.

&HT;     JUDGE DELAYS RULING IN MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge on Tuesday delayed delivering his
ruling in the antitrust case against software giant Microsoft Corp.
to give the company and Justice Department officials time to reach
a settlement, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said last week
that he would be willing to postpone his decision _ which had been
expected Tuesday _ if he saw progress toward an out-of-court deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Jackson will delay his ruling until April 7 to give
both sides a chance to reach an agreement _ something the judge has
publicly stated he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, U.S. officials rejected a Microsoft proposal,
saying it didn't meet enough of the government's demands. But the
two sides have continued to negotiate through Judge Richard Posner,
chief judge of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago,
who has been mediating the case since last November when Jackson
asked him to help both sides reach a settlement. On Tuesday neither
Microsoft nor representatives of the Justice Department and the 19
states that brought the suit in 1998 had any official comment on
where things stood.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ronald Cass, an antitrust expert at Boston
University, Jackson's delay provides new hope that a settlement,
which seemed unlikely last week, could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people had more or less figured a settlement wasn't
in the cards, but this move by Jackson shows that Microsoft and the
government are making a real effort to end this case,'' Cass said.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson does issue his ruling, he is expected to deal harshly
with the Redmond, Wash.-based company. On Nov. 5, Jackson issued
``findings of fact'' that said Microsoft had used its monopoly
power to stifle innovation, reduce competition and hurt consumers
by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows
operating system. A computer's operating system is the core program
that allows other programs, such as word processing, to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Because Windows runs 95 percent of all computers, Jackson said,
Microsoft's bundling, or tying together, of its operating system
and its browser means that browser competitors _ such as Netscape _
are at a severe disadvantage when it comes to selling their own
browsers. This Microsoft practice led to less competition and less
innovation, which hurt consumers, he said. Microsoft contends that
the browser, which allows users access to the World Wide Web, is
not a separate product but an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
The November findings represent Jackson's conclusions about which
side presented the most believable case during the year-long
hearing that opened in his court on Oct. 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will use those findings to determine whether Microsoft
actually broke the law. But since his findings of fact were against
the company, many antitrust experts say they expect he will
conclude that it did violate antitrust law. If he does, the case
will move to its final phase: the penalty stage. At that time,
Jackson could order the breakup of the company into separate parts
to end its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's latest proposal to settle the case reportedly would
allow manufacturers of computers or software to modify Windows so
that rival products, such as Internet browsers, could be attached
to the operating system. The company also would offer a version of
Windows that would not include Microsoft's own Internet Explorer
browser.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal, Microsoft also reportedly offered equal pricing
and shipping terms to all computer makers who use its Windows
operating system software. Such a move would end Microsoft's
ability to offer pricing breaks to computer retailers that favor
other types of Microsoft software, such as Microsoft Word, over
competing products.
</P>
<P>
   Government sources said federal and state lawyers reviewed
Microsoft's proposal over the weekend but decided it lacked enough
assurances that the company would not bundle future software
products to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   While backing away from proposals to break up the company, the
Justice Department was expected to demand that Microsoft limit the
number of software products that the firm can add to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft wants to make a deal, experts said, the company
will do it before Jackson's ruling on whether the firm broke the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings of fact showed that he found the government's
case against the company credible and that he rejected as
``specious'' virtually all of Microsoft's arguments.
</P>
<P>
   With a half-dozen private antitrust suits now filed against the
company, Microsoft wants to avoid giving the plaintiffs' lawyers
any negative ruling by Jackson, which they could use as a potent
weapon in their civil suits against the firm. Microsoft stock rose
following news of the delay, climbing as high as 107-7/16 before
settling at 116, up 1-15/16 for the day.

   OPEC (Vienna, Austria) _ Despite a deep split between Saudi
Arabia and Iran, the president of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries said the group had reached agreement on a plan
to increase oil production and should at least halt the recent
surge in prices. ``I believe we have an agreement,'' said Ali
Rodriguez, Venezuela's oil minister and the newly named president
of OPEC. Though oil ministers were still hammering out last-minute
details, officials said the increase in quotas would be very close
to Saudi demands for about 1.7 million barrels a day. By Edmund L.

   SCOTUS-SEARCH (Washington) _ An anonymous tip that a person is
carrying a gun is not enough to justify a stop and frisk by the
police without some further sign that the information is reliable,
the Supreme Court ruled with surprising unanimity Tuesday. While
the decision was an important ruling that placed a constitutional
curb on a particular type of police-citizen encounter, the court
did not address the more controversial and heavily freighted
question of what actions the police can take based not on a tip but
on their own observation and judgment. In the current climate of
increased tension over police tactics, the court's ruling in
January that unprovoked flight at the sight of a police officer can
justify the police in chasing and frisking the person may prove
more significant. By Linda Greenhouse.

   HAITIAN-PARENTS-DEPORT (Miami) _ Esta Pierre built a solid life
on shaky ground in Florida, scrubbing hotel room toilets and
bathing people in nursing homes to earn a living. She married a
Haitian immigrant and made payments on a little house in southwest
Florida. They had two children here, Jean Gardy, now 6, and Gaelle,
21 months. Ms. Pierre has received a deportation order from the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, and barring one last,
thin appeal, said her Miami lawyer, she will be sent back. Her
husband, who also entered the U.S. on fake documents, has also been
ordered home. But their children, born here, are U.S. citizens by
birthright and cannot be deported. So, Ms. Pierre, like thousands
of other Haitian mothers and fathers in the U.S., must someday
choose whether to take her children with her or leave them, to save
them? By Rick Bragg.

   BUSH-EDUC (Somerset, N.J.) _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas

educational initiatives that have long been identified with
Democrats. By Clifford J. Levy.

   FUNDRAISING-LOOPHOLE (Washington) _ The tiny remnant of the
American peace movement had a little money and was looking for a
voice in the political process. The pharmaceutical industry had a
lot of money and was looking for a bullhorn. Both found it in an
obscure corner of the IRS known as Section 527, a provision that
allows groups to raise and spend unlimited sums on political
activities without any disclosure as long as they do not expressly
advocate voting for one candidate or another. Section 527 has
become the loophole of choice this year for groups large and small,
left and right, to spread their messages without revealing the
sources of their income or the targets of their spending. And there
is no prohibition against accepting foreign money. By John M.
Broder and Raymond Bonner.

   CHINA-U.S.-TRADE (Washington) _ The top Democratic vote-counter
in the House for a decisive China trade bill warned Tuesday that
the measure may be postponed until next year unless a vote is

in his own home. Cherie Blair, 45, is seven months' pregnant with

Blair, 46, to take some of the paternity leave that his government

PUTIN WARNS AGAINST MIRACLES AS HE SLOWLY PUTS HIS GOVERNMENT
TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With President-elect Vladimir Putin moving to put his
government in place, Moscow is rife with behind-the-scenes intrigue
as he and his aides try to decide which politicians, economists and
tycoons should be included in his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin has made it clear he will be in no hurry to decide
everything. And in his first major personnel decision Tuesday, he
caught the capital's attention with a change that he did not make:
He decided not to replace Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's move appeared calculated to give the impression that the
Kremlin is satisfied with how the Russian military campaign in
Chechnya was going, despite mounting casualties and an adversary
that has stubbornly refused to quit.
</P>
<P>
   The move also rewards Sergeyev for his loyalty and quiets the
infighting with Russia's defense establishment over his post.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's decision also affirmed the status quo in a military
whose lackluster performance in Chechnya has demonstrated that it
is in urgent need of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Putin has moved cautiously since winning the election
on Sunday. No one doubts that he will make good on his vow to build
a stronger state after he is sworn in as president in early May.
And virtually everyone believes this will translate into new faces
and stronger authority for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin's in-house definition of a strong state is a state where
all the other players are weaker than his administration,'' said
Boris Makarenko, an analyst at the Center for Political
Technologies, a research center based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the nation is still waiting to find out what its new
leader has in mind. Moscow is eager to see which posts might go to
the ``St. Petersburg'' team of economic reformers who began their
career with Putin in that city, like Aleksei Kudrin, the first
deputy finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   And many are betting that the current ``Kremlin group,'' which
is linked to Russia's oligarchs, will be well represented. Mikhail
Kasyanov, the first deputy prime minister, they say, stands the
best chance of becoming prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The new government is also expected to include the ``FSB
Group,'' officials from the internal security service, which Putin
once headed and which is one of the heirs to the Soviet KGB.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Putin met with Boris Yeltsin, the former president,
who had anointed Putin as his heir apparent; presumably, they
discussed plans for the new government. So far, however, Putin has
gone out of his way to lower expectations and perhaps buy a little
time.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has warned the public not to expect miracles. And his
public appearances have been relatively low-key affairs, like
Tuesday's ceremony at which he handed out awards to military
heroes, cultural figures and cosmonauts.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The elections _ parliamentary in December and presidential now
_ gave Vladimir Putin the political capital which was lacking in
Boris Yeltsin,'' the newspaper Noviye Izvestia observed. ``Only
Putin can say how he can now put that capital to good use.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With Putin focusing on the economy and domestic politics,
security policy is one area that may see less of a shake-up. That
was the case Tuesday with the decision to keep the 61-year-old
Sergeyev, who has run the Defense Ministry for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed a meeting between Putin and Sergeyev
about Chechnya and about plans to reform the military.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Kremlin's claims of success, fighting is still
raging near the mountain village of Tsentoroi and even in the
Chechen capital, Grozny, which the Russians claimed to have firmly
under control last month and where a Russian policeman was killed
on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The decision to keep Sergeyev almost certainly does not reflect
satisfaction with the ragged state of Russia's armed forces. Nor
can the Kremlin be happy that the military failed to subdue the
Chechen rebels before the presidential election, as Russia's
generals had publicly vowed.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision has a certain political logic. Changing
ministers might be read as a sign that the Kremlin was worried
about the way the war is proceeding. Russia's generals were loyal
and all called for Putin's election.
</P>
<P>
   The move also allows Putin to concentrate on building his
economic and political team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was plenty of talk about possible contenders,'' the
newspaper Segodnya said of the defense post. ``It is said that
Vladimir Putin got fed up with the generals' tussle for this post
and decided to leave everything as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how long Sergeyev will stay. Segodnya speculated
wryly that he would keep his job as long the fighting in Chechnya
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``But only if it does not turn into a Hundred Years' War,'' the
newspaper said.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Ginger Packs a Punch in Chicken Stir-Fry   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; This is a simple Cantonese-type dish, full of good
flavor and texture.
<P>
   Serve it with steamed, long-grained white rice. Add a good
teaspoon of jasmine tea leaves and a little salt to the rice water
a minute or two before you add the rice. You have no idea how good
this ``jasmine rice'' is with the sweet soy ginger sauce that is
cooked with the chicken.
</P>
<P>
   For this dish, I like to use the dark meat of the chicken _
thighs or legs _ but if you prefer white meat, chicken breasts work
fine, too. They will take a little longer to cook, though.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to make this dish many years ago in the kitchen of a
fine Chinese cooking teacher, Rose Chang, who lived in San
Francisco's Chinatown and taught classes on Saturday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Cantonese cooking is ideally suited for home cooks. The recipes
are uncomplicated, quick to make and very satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Use a skillet, saute pan or wok to make this dish _ preferably
one with a nonstick lining, which will prevent the chicken pieces
from sticking.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; CHICKEN WITH FRESH GINGER
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces fresh ginger (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 scallions (also called green onions)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup peanut oil or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   21/2 pounds chicken drumsticks
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prepare the ginger and scallions: &LR;  You don't need to peel the
ginger. Cut it into 1/4-inch slices (you'll need 1 cup). Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the soy sauce, sherry and sugar in a bowl and stir until
blended. Set aside. Prepare the scallions by cutting off the roots
at the end of the white part. Leave about 2 inches of the green
leaves and cut the white and green leaves into thin slices. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cooking the Chicken:  &LR; Pour the peanut oil into a saute pan or
skillet and place over medium high heat. When the oil feels hot
(put the palm of your hand 1 inch above the oil _ you will feel the
heat), add the chicken and ginger. Spread the chicken and ginger in
a single layer in the pan and, using a fork, move the pieces
occasionally as they cook so they don't stick to the bottom of the
pan. After about 5 minutes, turn the chicken pieces over if they
have browned. Let the chicken cook until well browned on all sides,
turning from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce the heat to medium low, then pour the sauce evenly over
the chicken and ginger. Cover the pan and let the chicken and
ginger cook for about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove cover and test the
chicken for doneness by cutting a slit to the bone. If there is no
pink or redness around the bone, the chicken is done. Transfer the
chicken and ginger to a warmed platter; sprinkle the scallions over
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the jasmine rice on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Silky Caramel Chicken   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Many experts from coast to coast claim the Slanted
Door serves the best Vietnamese food in the United States. That's
quite an accolade for Charles Phan, who was an architect and a
computer graphic artist before he followed his passion to open this
restaurant with his family.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first his idea was to open a small stand and serve street
food, but then he found a space in the Mission and the idea grew
into a full-fledged restaurant. He did much of the design work
himself to come up with the sleek, simple look with an open kitchen
carved out of the back corner.
</P>
<P>
   While still living in Vietnam, his mother picked up many
cross-cultural techniques that she passed along to her son _ such
as mayonnaise in the spring rolls, for example. But Phan also
searched out the great food that's served from stands all over
Vietnam, and used them as inspiration for many of the great dishes
on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is the Chicken in Caramel Sauce, an unlikely blend
of pungent fish sauce, dark brown sugar and dark meat chicken. It
may sound strange but the two radically different flavorings are
balanced by rice wine vinegar, ginger and chiles. It's really a
simple dish to prepare, and the results are wonderful.

 AT THE SOURCE: Spring Bounty: Riverdog Farm shells out sugar snap 
 peas   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 YOLO COUNTY, Calif. _  One of the perks of organic farming, says
Tim Mueller, is ``you eat well.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   And, of course, you also eat seasonally, from broccoli in the
winter to tomatoes and melons in the summer, made sweet by the sun
that sizzles on the Capay Valley (near Woodland, Yolo County).
That's where Mueller and Trini Campbell cultivate 70 acres that
make up Riverdog Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Cassidy completes the household. ``We actually got
married,'' Mueller jokes about himself and Campbell. ``We got
conventional.''
</P>
<P>
   That term may apply to their marital status, but not to their
farming practices.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, both raised as ``city kids,'' met at Grenelle
College in Iowa, where they became fascinated by the concept of
sustainable agriculture. They came west to practice what they
believed in, starting 10 years ago in Napa County and moving to the
tiny farming community of Guinda in Yolo County six years later.
</P>
<P>
   Just as their growing practices hark back to the days before
chemicals, genetic engineering and modern agribusiness invaded
America's farmlands, the couple's selection of crops reflects
traditional ways. Rather than growing one or two vegetables, they
plant as many as 60 crops.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is just coming to market: sugar snap peas. Picking
of over-winter peas (planted in October) usually starts in February
at Riverdog Farm, but this year the heavy rains delayed the start
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller and Campbell grow several varieties of the peas on 21/2
acres, including Cascadia and Super Sugar Mel, both of which have
strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller says they prefer peas with strings to the stringless
variety: Getting the latter to table takes less effort, he admits,
but as with so many produce varieties developed for convenience,
there is a payback: The stringed peas, he asserts, have more
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   While he and Campbell _ ``we both cook, but we are not gourmet
cooks'' _ sometimes lightly steam the peas, he likes them best raw,
either as a snack or in a salad. One of his favorites is potato
salad with uncooked snap peas, spring onions and green garlic _
all, of course, picked at Riverdog Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Mentioning the farm's name inevitably brings up the question,
why Riverdog?
</P>
<P>
   When Mueller and Campbell farmed in Napa, they sold their crops
from a farm stand right by the Napa River and their big black dog
used to love to dive into the water, then shake himself off,
spraying the customers in the process. The couple called their
business Campbell-Mueller Gardens, but market goers took to calling
it the Riverdog stand. So when the couple moved to a new farm, they
decided to make the nickname official.
</P>
<P>
   They still sell from stands, though not by a river, as well as
by subscription and to Berkeley Bowl market. They now limit
themselves to the two Berkeley farmers' markets (Tuesday afternoon
on Derby Street at Martin Luther King Jr. Way, and Saturday morning
on Center Street at Martin Luther King Jr. Way).
</P>
<P>
   Organically grown produce, with generally higher prices, sells
well in some communities and not in others.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley, Mueller says, has the ideal clientele. They gave up on
Sacramento, where they manned a stand for a while. ``Sacramento,''
he says, ``was like pulling teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; For subscription information, call Riverdog Farm, (530) &LR; 
 &LR; 796-3802. &LR;

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After a seven-month investigation, Israeli police on
Tuesday recommended that former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and his wife, Sara, face criminal prosecution on charges of
bribery, fraud and the theft of $100,000 worth of gifts meant for
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, who quit politics when he was defeated as prime
minister by Ehud Barak in May, said the charges were ``baseless''
and inspired by political enemies and an overly zealous police
force. His lawyer, Yaakov Weinroth, said he was ``itching for a
trial'' to demonstrate that there is ``nothing to'' the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being persecuted,'' Netanyahu repeated several times, in a
50-minute interview Tuesday night on Israel's Channel One, which
returned him to the prime-time spot that he dominated during his
three years in office. ``I define this as a hunt. It's a hunt.
They're hunting me and my wife down.''
</P>
<P>
   If justice officials take the police recommendation to put
Netanyahu on trial, it could thwart his ability to make a political
comeback. While he has not publicly expressed interest in doing so,
the right-wing opposition to Barak has been lackluster, and many
here assumed that Netanyahu would eventually be tempted back into
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Israeli legal system, police investigate and either
close a case or make a recommendation to the state prosecutor or
attorney general. But a police recommendation does not always lead
to prosecution, as Netanyahu well knows. In 1997, while he was
prime minister, the police suggested that he stand trial on
corruption charges. But the attorney general, Elyakim Rubenstein,
declined to prosecute, saying there was insufficient evidence.
Rubenstein remains in office.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the police said the Netanyahus ``illegally
removed'' 700 gifts to the state of Israel when they left the prime
minister's residence. The police said some of the objects, which
included candelabra, silverware, carpets and a gold letter opener
from U.S. Vice President Al Gore, had been altered to remove
inscriptions that clearly marked them as gifts to Israel. Some were
found in the Netanyahus' Jerusalem apartment and some in a
warehouse, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Tuesday night, Netanyahu said that Barak had
kicked him out of the prime minister's residence prematurely _
although it was weeks after Barak took office _ and that Netanyahu
did not have time to sort his belongings while packing. He said he
was entitled to take some presents _ perhaps referring to the gifts
of minimal value that he can accept under the law. Holding up a
woman's brooch, he said the police had grilled Mrs. Netanyahu for
four hours about the pin, which an appraisal later showed to be
worth $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   The police also said the Netanyahus had accepted some $50,000
worth of free services from a contractor, Avner Amedi, over many
years. Netanyahu denied that Tuesday night, saying the amount was
wildly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The police described an illegal ``give-and-take relationship,''
which amounted under law to bribery. They said it began when
Netanyahu was a lawmaker and continued through his three-year
tenure as a charismatic prime minister who eventually lost the
confidence of the nation but retained many loyal followers.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not specify Tuesday what the contractor
received in return. They said they discovered ``a number of cases''
in which, they said, ``Netanyahu did, in fact, act on Amedi's
behalf.'' But the police report indicated that the relationship
broke down when Amedi did not get everything he requested _ he was
supposedly seeking a government contract _ and submitted a bill to
Netanyahu. But he did not get paid.
</P>
<P>
   After Netanyahu lost the election, the contractor, with the
knowledge of the Netanyahus, submitted another bill, for $110,000
of moving expenses, to the prime minister's office, the police
said. The ``very high bill raised suspicions about criminal acts,''
and government officials suspected that the Netanyahus were trying
to ``foist'' their private expenses onto the government, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The police investigation began after a newspaper, Yedioth
Ahronoth, reported on the suspicions of government officials.
According to the newspaper, the private work included ``four floor
polishings in a single month,'' a crane used to install bars on the
windows of the Netanyahus' private apartment and the repair of an
exercise machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sara Netanyahu pushed to have the debt paid off by the prime
minister's office while trying to do away with the Netanyahus'
personal debt,'' the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The police also said Netanyahu had summoned Amedi and had asked
him to deny the nature of their relationship, for which they
recommend that the former prime minister be charged with
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor is the state's chief witness, and most of the
case outlined by the police is believed to be based on information
he provided. They questioned 100 other people, too, and noted what
they considered inconsistencies and ``improbabilities'' in the
Netanyahus' account.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said Tuesday night that Amedi was not telling the
truth and that the police were building a case on lies. ``They
penetrated our home, picked through our belongings, called me a
thief, my wife a thief and trampled our dignity with tendentious
leaks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's political allies echoed his assertion that the
police were out to get him. ``The police have been behaving as if
they were on a chase mission to find Netanyahu guilty of
something,'' said Uzi Landau, a legislator from Netanyahu's Likud
Party.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But as Netanyahu's television interviewer pointed out, the
Israeli police have numerous investigations before them, targeting
figures across the political spectrum. President Ezer Weizman is
under investigation for accepting a large cash gift from a French
businessman. The campaign fundraising practices of Barak are under
investigation. And on Monday, the police began an inquiry into
whether a leading rabbi, Ovadia Yosef, should be prosecuted for
incitement after a blistering sermon against the education
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dark day for Israeli politics,'' said Ophir
Pines-Paz, who is the chairman of Barak's governing coalition.
``The whole spate of investigations looks bad and is bad. We all
have to be very careful. We have to understand that we are not
above the law.''

 CHRON  
 COOKS' BOOKS: Rose Pistola Belongs on Kitchen Shelves   By Miriam Morgan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  ``The Rose Pistola Cookbook'' has found a
semi-permanent place on The Chronicle's Top 10 cookbook list ever
since it was published last fall. And for good reason. With this
book the home cook can replicate many of the recipes from
chef-owner Reed Hearon that have made his restaurant one of the
most popular in North Beach.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though Hearon is an award-winning chef _ just last week he
was nominated for a prestigious James Beard Award for best chef in
California _ at Rose Pistola he focuses on traditional home cooking
of the Ligurian region of Italy. That means the dishes themselves
are straightforward and uncomplicated, but Hearon's knowledge and
skills make them far from ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   He and co-author Peggy Knickerbocker make all of that accessible
for the home cook. True, most American homes don't have the sort of
wood-burning oven that is a mainstay of Hearon's restaurant, and
the same dishes cooked even in the hottest conventional oven or
charcoal grill won't have all the smoky characteristics. But
Hearon's direct, confident approach ensures that home versions are
excellent nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one of Hearon's signature restaurant dishes, Roast
Fish with Potatoes and Artichokes, may not taste exactly as it does
in the restaurant, but it's so good that it doesn't matter. And the
home-cooked version is true to the spirit of the original.
</P>
<P>
   The fish _ whole or in fillets _ roasts in a blend of white wine
and its own juices, nestled in a melange of sliced Yellow Finn
potatoes and parboiled baby artichokes, scattered with nicoise
olives and fresh rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   It requires so little preparation that it works well for
mid-week meals, but is special enough for company, particularly if
it's cooked in an attractive oven-to-table gratin dish or copper
baking pan. And by varying the type of fish _ from halibut to rock
cod to salmon, for example _ the dish is versatile, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, Hearon shows how to use high-quality
ingredients simply to create unexpected flavor sensations. In Salad
of Mushrooms, Endive and Parmesan, for example, the mushrooms and
endive bring out each other's earthiness, and the nutty Parmesan
plays off the endive's bite. One caveat, as he warns _ the
ingredients must be sliced paper-thin, which is best done on a
mandoline.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon carefully explains his basic techniques, like how to
perfume an oil before using it, and how Italian sauce-making
differs from the French method. Even without following any of his
recipes, this information alone can help home cooks with their own
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Pistola is named after a legendary North Beach bar owner,
and Hearon and Knickerbocker pay their respects with a tribute in
the book's introduction. They also describe the role that Ligurians
and other Italian immigrants played in establishing North Beach as
a unique, vibrant community.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of San Francisco's heritage _ which is another
reason why ``The Rose Pistola Cookbook'' is a nice addition to the
libraries of Bay Area cooks.

ROAST FISH WITH POTATOES &AMP; ARTICHOKES
</P>
<P>
   Halibut, sea bass, rock cod, salmon, Arctic char or ono will all
work well. You can use individual fillets, one large fillet or a
whole fish. A whole fish will take longer to cook but the flavors
are enhanced because the skin and skeleton are left intact.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   10 baby artichokes
</P>
<P>
   1 pound yellow Finn potatoes, peeled, cut into 1/4-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   1 medium whole fish (approximately 21/2 pounds), cleaned and
scaled, or 11/2 pounds fish fillets with skin
</P>
<P>
   Kosher or sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, bruised
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 24 nicoise olives (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Trim and slice the artichokes and keep them in a bowl of water
(with a squeeze of lemon juice to prevent discoloring) until ready
to use.
</P>
<P>
   Blanch the potatoes in a small pot of salted boiling water until
they are tender; drain.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 550 degrees, or the highest setting. Season
the fish generously with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the potatoes with the remaining ingredients except the fish
and spoon into an oval gratin or baking dish. Nestle the fish in
the mixture, turning it to make sure the top is well coated with
olive oil. If using fillets, leave skin-side up. Roast until the
fish is opaque, the skin is brown and the potatoes have begun to
dry out, about 10 minutes per inch of thickness of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   If using a whole fish, lift the top fillet off the fish with a
spatula or cake server and place on a warm plate. Grab the head,
tail and backbone (it will come out in one piece), remove and
discard. Discard the rosemary. Lift the bottom fillet onto the warm
plate. Divide the fish, potatoes and artichokes (and olives, if
using) among 3 warm plates. Pass additional olive oil for
drizzling.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Evenings Were Meant for French Brandy   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Despite the fact that it's officially spring, Bay
Area evenings still can be chilly. Summer in San Francisco brings
especially cold nights, which means Cognac and Armagnac, the twin
brandies of France, are perfect for after-dinner sipping all year
long.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good grape brandies are distilled in Spain, Italy, the United
States and Germany, but France still is viewed as the leader of
high-quality brandy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COGNAC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Cognac is the best-known brandy in the world, produced in a
region of Western France along the Atlantic coast, just north of
Bordeaux. Cognac is divided into six zones, with Grande Champagne
and Petite Champagne producing the best Cognac. A blend of the two
often is labeled Fine Champagne. The other zones are Borderies,
Fins Bois, Bons Bois and Bois Ordinaires.
</P>
<P>
   Cognac starts with a thin, acid white wine made from Ugni Blanc,
Folle Blanche and Colombard; It is not that great for drinking, but
just right for distilling. The wine is distilled twice in pot
stills, then aged in French oak to tame its fiery spirit and give
it color. Although there is rising interest in vintage-dated and
single-vineyard Cognacs, Cognac usually is a blend of different
vintages and growing zones.
</P>
<P>
   Most Cognac does not carry an age statement, but is known by a
set of terms that generally distinguishes the age of one Cognac
from another. V.S. (Very Superior) usually is aged a minimum of two
years in cask, although four to five years is more likely the
overall standard. V.S.O.P. (Very Superior Old Pale) is aged a
minimum of four years in wood, with the industry average between 10
and 15 years. X.O. (Extra Old) is aged a minimum of six years,
although the average can run to 20 years or older.
</P>
<P>
   Top Cognacs are produced by Delamain, Fussigny, Pierre Frapin,
Hennessy, Hine, Remy Martin, Louis Royer, Courvoisier, Gabriel &AMP;
Andreu, Pierre Ferrand and Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARMAGNAC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This hearty brandy dates back to the 15th century, which makes
it the oldest brandy in France. Armagnac is distilled in Gascony,
in the Southwestern corner of France. The main zones are
Bas-Armagnac, Haut-Armagnac and T &LR; e &LR; nar &LR; e &LR; zecq &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Armagnac distillers use the same three grapes as Cognac, but
distill their brandy in a unique type of column still that produces
a brandy that is more rustic and assertive than Cognac. Another
factor that contributes to the distinct character of Armagnac is
aging in barrels made from the local Monlezun ``black'' oak,
although most distilleries now use Limousin and Troncais oak, the
same used by Cognac distillers.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cognac, Armagnac is designated on the label as V.S.,
V.S.O.P. and X.O., although there are more single-vintage and
single-vineyard bottlings than in Cognac.
</P>
<P>
   Look for these brands: Janneau, Marquis de Cassaude, Samalens,
Larressingle, Cles des Ducs and Marquis de Montesquioucq &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Country News &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter of the year has seen a flurry of activity in
the West Coast wine industry that may impact the kind of wines
consumers will see from many of the large wine companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Perhaps the biggest surprise was the sale of Matanzas Creek
Winery in Sonoma's Bennett Valley to Artisans &AMP; Estates, the
collection of premium wineries owned by wine magnate Jess Jackson.
Matanzas Creek has long been a leader in first-rate Chardonnay,
Merlot and Sauvignon Blanc. Artisans &AMP; Estates' other brands
include Cardinale, Hartford Court and Lokoya.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stimson Lane, the parent company of Washington's Chateau Ste.
Michelle and Columbia Crest, has joined forces with Australia's
Petaluma Vineyards to market a line of premium Australia wines in
North America and Australia. Last year, Stimson Lane joined forces
with Italy's Antinori to create Col Solare, a red wine made from
Washington grapes. The Washington-based wine giant also owns
California wineries, including Villa Mt. Eden and Conn Creek Winery
in the Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chalone Wine Group has strengthened its Napa Valley Cabernet
Sauvignon position with the purchase of Suscol Creek Vineyard. CWG
recently purchased Hewitt Vineyard on the Rutherford Bench, which
will be the source of grapes for a luxury-priced single-vineyard
wine.
</P>
<P>
   _ In an effort to provide U.S. direct marketing and Internet
sales, Australia's Mildara Blass has purchased Windsor Vineyards,
the largest consumer-direct winery in the United States. Robert
Mondavi has purchased a minority stake in Tenuta dell'Ornellaia,
owned by Marchese Lodovico Antinori and also purchased La Capitana
in Tuscany to be developed into vineyards for Lucente, the joint
venture wine with the Marchesi de Frescobaldi family.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Sonoma, Don and Rhonda Carano, owners of Ferrari-Carano
winery, have purchased Vintners Inn and John Ash &AMP; Co. restaurant
in Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Q &AMP; A &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Sasikala Devi of McKinleyville writes to say that she is
``decidedly fond'' of Amer Picon but cannot find it at retail.
That's because Amer Picon, a French bitters, based on brandy, has
not been in the California market for a few years. As an alternate
choice, I suggest the popular Italian bitters, Fernet Branca.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Ammons expressed a concern recently via e-mail about The
Chronicle reviewing wines that he believes are not currently in the
market. While that is understandable, limiting reviews to current
release wines would exclude those in personal wine collections and
on restaurant wine lists. Also, not every winery releases the same
vintages of a wine type at the same time of year or the same year.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle Tasting Panel attempts to cover as many wines as
possible and we realize that not all of the wines we recommend are
available at individual retail stores.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Water May Surpass Vegetable Broths   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  For vegetarians, chicken and beef broth are out of
the question when making soups and stews. But according to The
Chronicle tasting panel, the vegetable broths available aren't a
very good choice, either.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted five vegetable broths, most available in
cans and some in boxes. The panel was surprised how bad some of
them tasted. Some were too salty; others tasted strongly of celery
or had no depth of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The tasters disliked the broths so much that they would not
drink any of them straight as a broth, and most of them would
prefer to use water instead of the broths in most cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pritikin &LR;  (141/2 ounces, $1.79 at Draeger's) ranked the
highest. One panelist detected a bitter edge, but thought it would
smooth out if used as a base for a soup. Another mentioned that it
might be good in risotto or tomato sauce. But one other panelist
thought it had a strange color and tasted strangely of apricots.
One would buy it, one might buy it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hain &LR;  (14 ounces, $1.59 at Whole Foods) came in second.
Panelists detected overly strong notes of celery and herbs. Many
disliked the cloudy appearance. One panelist thought the flavors
were muddy, but the broth might be OK if used in a soup with other
strong flavors. One might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Health Valley &LR;  (32 ounces, 99 cents at Trader Joe's) and
 &UR; Pacific &LR;  (32 ounces, $2.39-$3.19 at many supermarkets) tied for
third place.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists described Health Valley as tasting harsh, bitter and
metallic. One might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists described Pacific as ``the least offensive'' _ watery
and innocuous. One might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Swanson &LR;  (141/2 ounces, 77-99 cents at many supermarkets) came
in fifth. All the panelists thought it was far too salty _ it has
1,000 mg of sodium per cup, as compared with 290-480 mg for the
other products. Three panelists thought the salt made the product
inedible. One commented that he didn't think the product could be
used in any cooking because of the amount of salt. None would buy
it.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Flo Braker, cookbook author and Chronicle Food
columnist; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Kim Severson,
Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San
Francisco. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

 &HT;    `Old School' Wisconsin keeps alive coach's dream
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dick Bennett became head coach at Wisconsin five years ago,
his new players were presented with a theme: ``Start the Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, The Dream was to make Wisconsin competitive in the
rough-and-tumble Big Ten. Once that was accomplished, Bennett
modified the theme to ``Reach for the Dream.'' The Badgers did that
in 1999 when they went 22-10 and earned a spot in the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The theme for this season? ``Touch the Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that the Badgers (22-13) have defied all odds and
reached their first Final Four since 1941?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I was going to be able to say this to a
team,'' Bennett told his squad after they had beaten Purdue 64-60
for the West Regional championship. ``But now you can live the
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin is living that dream and living it large. On Feb. 12,
when it lost to Michigan State 61-44, the Badgers thought the NIT
was a long shot. They were 13-12 and 5-8 in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   But since then Wisconsin has been the model of efficiency. They
are 10-3 in their past 13 games, all three losses to Michigan
State, Saturday's opponent in the RCA Dome in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's players have no question about who gets the credit
for the comeback. In an age of consummate hip, of style over
substance, Bennett is definitely ``Old School.''
</P>
<P>
   He has coached in the same state for 35 years. His role model is
Wisconsin's leading sports icon, the late Vince Lombardi of the
Green Bay Packers. Bennett admits to spending an inordinate amount
of time watching Lombardi's practices and drawing his basic
principles from the Hall of Fame coach.
</P>
<P>
   Principle No. 1: ``Do a few things, and do them well.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of today's players are overly interested in making
the highlight reel for the next ``SportsCenter,'' Bennett demands
that his players adhere to the most basic fundamentals of the game:
Picking and rolling, blocking out, making the safe pass and milking
every possession to get the best possible shot.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise that McDonald's All-Americans are not
flocking to Madison to play in Bennett's system. None of
Wisconsin's starting five even received an honorable mention when
the All-Big Ten team was announced. It is not an overstatement to
say that none of Wisconsin's players could crack the starting
lineup of the other three teams in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   So Bennett recruits players of good athletic ability who are
willing to buy into his system and his belief that, with enough
selflessness, the whole of the team can be better than the sum of
its parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play at Wisconsin, you really have to buy into the whole
team concept,'' junior forward Mark Vershaw said. ``If we had to
play our opponents one on one, we'd probably lose every time. But
we don't have to do that, so we help each other and win as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't think the grandfatherly looking Bennett sells his
system by giving his players the warm-and-fuzzies. Like Lombardi,
Bennett takes pride in pushing his players out of their comfort
zones. It is the only way to make them realize their full
potential. And he makes no apologies for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it hurts some players, and some parents are unhappy
with the way I deal with their sons,'' Bennett said. ``But I
understand the need to confront those who tend to accept too little
of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just relentless. He will not accept anything less than
the best from you,'' junior forward Mike Kelley said. ``If you
can't do that, you are going to hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a system that has served Bennett well at every stop along
the coaching trail. His last three squads at Wisconsin-Stevens
Point were 79-13. At Wisconsin-Green Bay, he won 187 games and had
the team nobody wanted to play in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody has appreciated the purity Bennett attaches to
the game of basketball. After Wisconsin lost to Southwest Missouri
State 43-32 in the first round of the 1999 NCAA Tournament,
athletics director Pat Ritcher started to hear some grumbling. Some
alumns were not bashful in saying that the game had long ago passed
Bennett by and that it was time for Wisconsin to move into the
modern age.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason, those close to the program say, that Bennett
started crying in the moments before Wisconsin's West Regional
championship game with Purdue. After years of ridicule, Bennett's
way had a chance at validation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it finally dawned on him that what he has been
building for 35 years was about to happen,'' assistant coach Brad
Soderberg said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bennett and his style of play might not get a lot of face
time on television, he is much respected in the coaching
fraternity. Last season, Sports Illustrated polled 115 college
coaches and asked them if they could attend only one coaching
clinic, whose would it be? The top vote-getters: Duke's Mike
Krzyzewski, Utah's Rick Majerus and Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   But it is one thing to labor well in relative obscurity. On
Saturday, 19 days short of his 57th birthday, Dick Bennett will put
his system _ his very life _ on college basketball's grandest
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought we were playing the game the way you were
supposed to,'' said Bennett, tongue in cheek. ``It wasn't until
recent years that I learned we were setting the game back.''

PROSPECTS FOR U.N. PEACEKEEPING MISSION IN CONGO QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The chances that a U.N. peacekeeping mission
can actually be deployed in Congo were not looking good Tuesday as
the Security Council heard a briefing from the head of its
peacekeeping department, who recently visited the region.
</P>
<P>
   Council members, meeting in a closed-door session, were told
that factions were rearming, despite promises on all sides to end a
civil war and abide by a peace agreement reached last July.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary-General Sir Ketumile Masire of Botswana, the head
of the peacekeeping department, briefed council members Tuesday; he
left Congo last week after being blocked from traveling within the
country.
</P>
<P>
   He reported that he was told by the Congo government of Laurent
Kabila that the United Nations would have to sign an accord
covering its activities that would impose unacceptable restrictions
on the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has encountered similar problems with Kabila
in the past. For more than a year, he blocked investigations into
accusations of massacres of Hutu refugees from Rwanda and of
Congolese reported to have taken place during Kabila's rise to
power in 1996-1997. More recently, he prevented U.N. liaison
officers from moving around the country to begin preparing for a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Security Council decided to authorize a force
of about 1,000 soldiers and a 4,000-member support staff to back up
500 military observers who were assigned last fall to help put the
cease-fire into effect.
</P>
<P>
   But the council stated at the time that the force would not be
deployed until there was peace on the ground and adequate
assurances that all international personnel would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said Tuesday it did not appear that the situation was
even close to meeting those requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen African nations and several rebel groups are
involved in the Congo war. Miyet met with most of the protagonists
on his trip, among them Kabila and President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe, who strongly supports Kabila. Miyet also held talks with
leaders in Namibia, Rwanda and Uganda. The latter two nations, once
allies of Kabila, are now his enemies. He accuses them of invading
Congo and creating a rebellion that would otherwise barely exist.
</P>
<P>
   Miyet suggested that the Security Council send a delegation to
the region to see the conditions on the ground for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In January, nearly all the national leaders engaged in the Congo
war came to New York for a series of council meetings arranged by
Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
who was council president for the month. The leaders, while
revealing deep splits and distrusts, nevertheless pledged to
support the peace accord. Diplomats and officials almost
immediately began to question those assurances.

 &HT;    Martin's ability to walk, career on shaky ground
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Great instability remains in his life. Casey Martin's
PGA Tour status teeters year to year on a judge's ruling or an
appeal. His withered right leg, which suffers from a rare
circulatory disease, survives day to day, searching for even
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the road is filled with potholes to affect both
systems _ legal and circulatory. Earlier this month, the courts
denied the PGA Tour's appeal, extending Martin's ability to use a
cart. In February for a few perilous seconds, Martin feared his leg
might snap. Walking along at the Nissan Open in Los Angeles, he
stepped in a hole surrounding a sprinkler and spent a chilling few
seconds wondering whether his golf career was about to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely the worst day of my life, physically,'' said
the 27-year-old Martin. ``I kind of stepped down about an extra 2
inches than I was expecting. It jarred my leg, and that came
totally unexpected. I am realizing that my leg is more and more
fragile. I don't think you'll see me jumping too many creeks.
Hopefully, I'm hitting it better, so I won't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a cart, perhaps he could attempt flat Florida courses,
but a place such as the hilly, massive TPC at Sugarloaf _ this
week's venue for the BellSouth Classic _ he could not even ponder.
Surely, some fellow players this week must be jealous that Martin
has wheels, while they trudge Sugarloaf's expanse.
</P>
<P>
   People forget that Martin never enjoys the luxury of getting to
know a golf course through the feel of his feet. Or walking from
teebox to fairway, slowly organizing his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   People don't realize that just moving from the cart path to his
ball, Martin will walk a few painful miles. For those days more
painful than others, Martin just pops a few more Advils and hopes
that eventually the road flattens out. He also has been bothered by
neck and shoulder problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just kind of gut it out,'' he said. ``I do take a lot of
Advil, which tends to help quite a bit. But even that doesn't
always get it. There is not a lot you can say, nothing I can really
do. I am not going to go pout most of the time, so you just suck it
up and get through it. . . . I'm not better (than two years ago),
but I don't think I'm a lot worse. . . . I just play the best I can
and leave the rest in God's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how long Martin will be able to survive, even with
the cart ruling, granted in his favor in 1998 and then retained
through an appeal won last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the future at all,'' Martin said, ``but looking
back, I know that if I didn't have (the cart), I wouldn't be
playing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed since the controversy exploded into the
lawsuit against the PGA Tour and a trial in Eugene, Ore. Two years
ago, many critics still thought that the PGA Tour was correct in
enforcing its rules about walking as an integral part of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The tour still thinks that other players with back or knee
injuries, for example, would attempt to piggy-back off the Martin
ruling, through the Americans with Disabilities Act, and seek the
same cart assistance. But it is getting more difficult these days
to find anyone in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Even Arnold Palmer, who testified on behalf of the tour, said,
``I've been opposed to golf carts on the regular and Senior tours
since the beginning, (but) it has nothing to do with Casey Martin.
If it works that Casey can play and use a golf cart, what's to
prevent anybody with a physical problem or any other ailment to
petition to use a cart? If I could use a cart, I might still be
able to play the regular tour. That might be a stretch, but I can
see a lot of things like that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin seems to understand that opinion better now and knows
it's not a personal attack against the kid from Stanford with the
graceful swing. Although most people think that the tour would be
better off, after such a public-relations disaster, to drop its
suit, commissioner Tim Finchem says the tour must protect from a
potential avalanche of others also seeking a cart. Reportedly, Ed
Fiori already has requested a cart because of a back ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that has been a big crux of the issue,'' Martin said.
``I think that's why they've been hesitant to grant an exception,
because there are other exceptions out there with guys that are
hurting who aren't, quote, unquote, disabled like I am. I
acknowledge that, because I am protected under the law, what about
a guy with a really bad back? So, I recognize it as a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of players today who will tell you that if they
could play with a cart, they could compete better,'' Finchem said.
``And those players, based on the 9th circuit decision, could ask
for relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The cart controversy clouds any close examination of Martin's
wonderful game. At a recent press conference at the Honda Classic,
an insensitive photographer asked Martin ``to walk for him'' after
an interview. When he gets over the ball, the weakness in his right
leg is barely discernible. His length is as impressive as his
courage. He stands second in driving distance _ ironic for a man
behind a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Without a cart at Sugarloaf, Martin could not get from the
parking lot to the first tee. He hasn't walked 18 holes in
competition since a Hooters Tour event in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time,'' he said. ``I don't know if I could go
72 holes (anywhere), and I hope I don't have to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Martins says he doesn't fear collapsing on a swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fear of failing,'' Martin said. ``I don't want to let
people down.''

 &HT;    Business schools' obsolescence predicted
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a harsh message, but they took it well. Gary Hamel, a
Harvard business strategist and high-tech guru, told leaders of
Emory's Goizueta Business School that the days are numbered for
``old business'' approaches and traditional business colleges on
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The ``branding'' of business training by schools like Emory and
Harvard will wane, he said, and give way to new interactive online
education taught by the best minds of the day, not fixed faculties.
And business schools had better brace for it.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel gave his thoughts last week in an hour-long video
conference between his office in California and a Goizueta
classroom filled with deans, faculty and an advisory panel of
business people.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel also said traditional businesses depending on incremental
growth had better come up with something new, including innovative
ways to let entrepreneurs within their walls receive money to put
new ideas to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long we have lived in a time when profits were the
result of cost cutting ... mergers for efficiency,'' Hamel said.
``Well corporate liposuction (shedding fat to be profitable) can
get you only so far _ we're down to the heart and the lungs in some
industries.''
</P>
<P>
   The age of creating wealth from marketing, in the style of star
performers like Coca-Cola, has waned, Hamel said, and the new route
to wealth will be dominated by innovation and brand-new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Smart business students already perceive this, he said, and that
is why ``the top 40 percent of Harvard graduates now go to
companies with 50 employees or less, and the second tier of
students go to the big names like Goldman Sachs and McKinsey &AMP;
Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Much to the frustration of strategic thinkers like Hamel, the
potential capital for big new enterprises is often locked up by big
companies that mostly work to defend the economic ground they
occupy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many spend their time as incumbents, defending themselves,
instead of spending on radical innovation,'' Hamel said.
</P>
<P>
   In his research and consultant work with Strategos, a Bay Area
firm, Hamel said he had encountered a few forward looking companies
that devised ways to reward ``game changing'' ideas with capital.
</P>
<P>
   Enron, the Texas energy company, is such a company, he said,
where a lower level employee was allowed to come up with a highly
profitable Internet business, the kind of enterprise that normally
senior executives would not embrace. Dell Computer, another Texas
firm, is another innovative exception.
</P>
<P>
   As for business schools, Hamel said the traditional system makes
feeble use of the top talent, and in the bargain fails to
disseminate the best ideas, best thinking and best strategies out
into the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than put the best business teachers in front of 150
students in a lecture hall, he said, the most brilliant minds
should be on the Internet or at the service of other technologies
that reach millions, not hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, education would be enhanced, and leading educators
could be paid in keeping with their value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon students will boast not about a degree from Harvard, but
that they spent two years with the best business minds in the
world,'' Hamel said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Thomas S. Robertson of Goizueta was an attentive listener
to Hamel. He said there was a lot of merit to Hamel's observations
but insisted that strong business schools like Emory's are making
accommodations to the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hamel, who is a Harvard faculty member and an international
consultant with many streams of income, some scholars at Goizueta
and other schools do much the same.
</P>
<P>
   Goizueta, which ranks 21 among the hundreds of business schools
around the nation, according to U.S. News &AMP; World Report, has
beefed up courses about electronic commerce and arranges video
conferences for students similar to the Hamel encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he was especially proud of a split-screen video
conference some months ago that brought together students and
teachers from Goizueta and schools in London and Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have alliances with other schools to expose our
students to information beyond their own classrooms,'' Robertson
said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the marketplace will likely make electronic
learning and distance learning even more of a force in graduate
training, especially for busy executives in training for the
master's degree in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel and Robertson both said the competition for the business
education market, to put the best teachers together with students,
will likely cause a shakeout in academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream,'' said Hamel, ``is to be to innovation what (W.
Edwards) Deming was to quality standards in industry, to redefine
it in very basic ways...''

 &HT;    Consultant is can-do man for well-to-do
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Adams wheels his white Jeep Cherokee into the driveway of a
client's massive Buckhead mansion. ``That's not a house,'' he
exults. ``It's a castle!''
</P>
<P>
   And it could darn sure use a vacuuming, or the grass mowed, or
the pool cleaned, or a billionaire's socks washed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to make these people feel like they live in a
five-star hotel,'' says Adams, an exuberant, tireless 24-year-old
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   If you're rich, especially if you're very rich, and live in
Buckhead in a house large enough to double as an airplane hangar,
there's a good chance you know Mike Adams. You may have called him
today. Maybe twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I manage my clients' lives so they can live the kind of
lifestyle their income allows,'' says Adams, headed up Tuxedo Road.
Another errand. Another client. Another crisis: leak in a pool
heating unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people have heated pools up here,'' Adams says. ``I
had a client call me the other day and ask me if she knew who could
install a heated driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who grew up in a middle-class Cobb County neighborhood,
introduced himself to the inner circle of Buckhead's super-rich six
years ago with a landscape design and at-home car detailing
business. Now he has become the major-domo of much of the
neighborhood's major dough.
</P>
<P>
   His company, MBA Management _ which is really just Adams and a
resource file of ``exclusive'' subcontractors _ provides domestic
staff for homes, lawn maintenance, chefs, wine stewards, even
helicopter pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can't get for my clients with a phone
call,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Adams himself is no pauper. He's paid a monthly retainer by 24
full-time clients, and charges an hourly fee to work for another
100 or so Buckhead residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I make enough to own one of these homes?'' he asks. ``I
couldn't say. I'm as discreet about how much I make as I am about
how much my clients make.''
</P>
<P>
   He never leaves Buckhead, but he's almost constantly on the
move. ``This Jeep is only 4 months old,'' he says, ``and it's got
16,000 miles on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Greenberg hired him after being impressed with his car
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must talk to him several times a week,'' Greenberg said.
``He makes my life so much easier. Just last week I called him
because I had lost some help. He had a new woman for me the next
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The maid, a Russian immigrant, didn't speak English. So Adams
hired a Russian translator to work with the maid.
</P>
<P>
   Today Adams has dealt with several crises. A client's car was in
the shop, so he picked it up for her.
</P>
<P>
   Another client called, worried about the barbecue being served
at an upcoming dinner for 15 guests. Would Adams be there to help
serve dinner?
</P>
<P>
   Sure. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   His cell phone rings. A client is worried about a pair of
$10,000 mahogany doors he's having installed. Can Adams check on
that?
</P>
<P>
   He makes two phone calls. The doors are on schedule. The phone
rings again. A client wonders if he can have some antiques picked
up in Fort Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He hangs up.
</P>
<P>
   ``YBYJ,'' he says. ```You Bet Your Job' every single decision
you make.''
</P>
<P>
   He picks up the phone, chats awhile with his delivery guy. ``I
want you to pick up some antiques for this lady,'' he says. ``I'll
pay top dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   The lady will get her antiques.

COMMENTARY: PURSUING HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big winner at the Oscars was ``American Beauty,'' a film
based on the daring and original premise that material possessions
don't bring happiness. Oh, well. Anyway, not all trite ideas are
wrong. In fact, there is quite a lot of evidence indicating that,
sure enough, money doesn't buy happiness _ or at least not so you'd
notice.
</P>
<P>
   At this point I could cite the accumulated wisdom of the ages _
but hey, it's the modern world, so let's talk about the polls.
Since World War II, random samples of people in the United States
and elsewhere have repeatedly been asked how happy they are. When
the economic historian Richard Easterlin surveyed these surveys in
a classic 1974 paper, he formulated what has come to be known as
the ``Easterlin paradox'': Basically, above a very low level
economic growth does not seem to improve human welfare. Later
evidence confirms his observation. Americans were no more likely to
describe themselves as happy in the 1990s than they had been in the
1940s. Even the Japanese, who went from near-third-world conditions
to widespread affluence between the 1950s and the 1980s, did not
become happier.
</P>
<P>
   Easterlin argued that the reason economic growth doesn't make us
happier is that people judge themselves largely by their position
relative to other people. Someone with an income of $32,000 in a
society where the median is $40,000 feels as socially disadvantaged
as someone with an income of $8,000 in a society where the median
is $10,000; so even quadrupling people's real income may not make
much difference in how they feel. Other evidence suggests that even
relative income makes less difference than most of us imagine: the
rich are happier than you and me, but not very much so.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald estimated
``happiness equations'' from American and British survey data. They
found that when you carefully control for other things, more money
actually does make people a bit happier _ but its influence is
swamped by non-pecuniary factors. Being married is far more
important than being rich; having a job is much more important than
how much the job pays.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the implications? Anti-growth types tend to like the
Easterlin paradox; they see it as yet another reason to favor the
simple, ecologically sound life. Milder sorts like Robert Frank,
author of the book ``Luxury Fever,'' argue that if people care
about their relative position _ as they clearly do _ then
conspicuous consumption is not just in bad taste but a sort of
psychological pollution, as real in its adverse impact as acid
rain. The answer? A highly progressive tax system, which Frank
supports for the same reason The Wall Street Journal opposes it _
that it reduces the incentive to make more money.
</P>
<P>
   But before you denounce (or applaud) happiness research as
leftist propaganda, be aware that it also cuts the other way. For
example, how do you feel about the ``living wage'' movement, which
in effect wants a large increase in the minimum wage? That would
certainly increase the incomes of the lowest-paid workers; but it
would also surely have at least some adverse effect on the number
of jobs available. You may think that a price worth paying _ but
the equations say that the extra unemployment would be a very bad
thing for those who lose their jobs, while a higher wage would make
only a small difference to the happiness of those who remain
employed.
</P>
<P>
   Or think of it this way. If you don't want a society in which
everyone is desperately trying to get ahead in a zero-sum status
game, you might advocate government policies that slow down the rat
race: high tax rates, generous health and unemployment benefits,
long mandatory paid vacations, maybe even a limit on individual
working hours. In other words, you might want to turn America into
France. But France has an unemployment rate more than twice as high
as America's, largely because of those same government policies.
And unemployment _ even comfortable European-style unemployment _
makes people very unhappy, because it is demoralizing.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any way out of the dilemma? Well, East Germany had full
employment without a rat race _ but it fell a bit short in the life
and liberty departments. I'd say that given the alternatives, the
American system, though not beautiful, still takes the prize.

TURKEY'S PRESIDENT WANTS ANOTHER TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ After months of intense political
maneuvering, the Turkish Parliament is about to begin the delicate
work of deciding whether to re-elect President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
   Demirel, 75, has been in public office for nearly all of his
adult life. He served a record seven terms as prime minister before
rising to the presidency in 1993. Most Turks cannot remember a time
when he was not a power broker.
</P>
<P>
   That longevity is both Demirel's greatest strength and his
greatest weakness. His supporters say he is a guarantee of
stability as Turkey enters a decade that is likely to bring
wrenching domestic and international challenges.
</P>
<P>
   But critics view him as a symbol of Turkey's political
immobility. They say that a country of 65 million people must have
more than one person qualified to be president.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish presidency has little formal authority, but in the
last decade, as one government after another has succumbed to
political paralysis, it has become a key power center.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution stipulates that presidents be chosen by
Parliament and serve only a single seven-year term, so Demirel is
currently ineligible for re-election. He has been maneuvering to
arrange a constitutional amendment that would allow him to serve
for another five years.
</P>
<P>
   To win passage of the amendment, Demirel needs the votes of
two-thirds of the 550 members of Parliament. He and his backers are
using a combination of incentives and threats to win them. Intense
political horse trading is expected before the first vote
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Demirel wins approval of his amendment, he will almost
certainly be re-elected. If he fails, a host of candidates will
probably emerge.
</P>
<P>
   This could threaten the stability of Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit's government, which is based on an uneasy coalition between
his left-oriented party and another that is far-rightist. If the
presidency suddenly comes up for grabs, the two parties would
almost certainly offer opposing candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview what he would do if he is not re-elected,
Demirel replied: ``I've never been interested in taking care of
flowers or feeding chickens. I'll find something to do. Nobody
should worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment was widely interpreted as a declaration that
Demirel is ready to re-enter party politics, a move that could
transform the political landscape and threaten the careers of some
current party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians have urged that Turkish voters, rather than
Parliament, be given the power to choose their president, but a
proposal to do that failed to win approval in a parliamentary
committee earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has clearly opted for Demirel's re-election,''
wrote a news commentator, Etyen Mahcupyan, in a recent analysis.
``This is because it has been Demirel's function to ensure that
civilian politics stays within the boundaries drawn up by the
military, and to make that seem like a normal state of affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahcupyan said Western powers favor Demirel because they see him
as ``the ideal solution to keep Turkey on the right track while
bridling any process of change,'' and that business groups, labor
unions and private citizens ``are not really demanding
democratization and principled politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the circumstances, is there a better candidate than
Demirel?'' he asked. ``We are him, and he is us. He personifies
certain aspects of Turkish society.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, commenting publicly for the
first time on the failure of his talks with the Syrian leader,
Hafez Assad, said Tuesday that it is up to Assad to make the next
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball's in his court now, and I'm going to look forward to
hearing from him,'' Clinton said at the White House before meeting
with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Switzerland to meet President Assad to clarify to
him what I thought the options were and to hear from him what his
needs are,'' Clinton added, ``and I asked him to come back to me
with what he thought ought to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials continued to express
disappointment Tuesday at the outcome of the meeting with Assad,
during which he stuck to his long-held view that Israel should
return land seized from Syria during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said during a conference
call with leaders of Jewish organizations Tuesday that she hoped
that Assad would reconsider his stand in Geneva so that an
Israeli-Syrian deal can be completed.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Syrian track of the Middle East peace efforts at a
halt, attention turned to the Palestinian track. There also
appeared to be little movement in that effort, but administration
officials said at the end of a week of talks between Israelis and
Palestinians at Bolling Air Force Base in southeastern Washington
that incremental progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Delegations of Palestinian and Israeli officials have been
talking behind closed doors at the air base about ``final status''
issues, including the future of Jerusalem, the shape of borders
between Israel and a Palestinian entity, and the fate of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman, James Foley, said Tuesday that the
two delegations would return to Washington on April 6. ``The issues
on the table are difficult and gaps remain, but the discussions at
Bolling have been serious and intensive,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian track of the Middle East peace negotiations also
got a lift from Mubarak, who was in Washington on an official
visit.
</P>
<P>
   He has long advocated focusing on getting an agreement between
the Palestinians and the Israelis, and he made this case again with
Clinton, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak and Clinton met for several hours in the White House
Tuesday and talked about intensifying the efforts around the
Palestinian and Israeli negotiations. Mubarak also met with Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, have said their goal is to reach a final
agreement by mid-September. If such an agreement is not reached,
Arafat has said, he will unilaterally declare a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will continue to see progress, at least on the
Palestinian track,'' Clinton said. ``And of course I hope that
we'll have some progress on the Syrian one as well _ as well as in
Lebanon.''

IPO FOR AT&AMP;T  ` TRACKING STOCK ' MAY SET U.S. RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
 (hm) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most things about AT&AMP;T are big, so perhaps it is fitting that
the upcoming initial public offering of shares meant to track
AT&AMP;T's wireless communications unit is set to be the biggest U.S.
IPO yet.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the AT&AMP;T Corp. said it intended to raise up to $13.2
billion in the offering. That would be more than double the record
$5.5 billion raised by United Parcel Service Inc. when it first
offered shares to the public last November. At a minimum, AT&AMP;T
intends to raise $9.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Chagrined that investors were not giving AT&AMP;T full financial
credit for the value of the company's fast-growing wireless unit,
AT&AMP;T said last year that it would issue a separately traded
``tracking stock'' meant to represent its wireless operation.
Tracking stocks are newly popular financial instruments that are
meant to represent, or track, a particular line of business within
a corporation. Unlike common shares, however, tracking stocks do
not represent actual ownership of a piece of that company.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T declined to say when the initial stock offering wwould be
held. But next week, the wireless unit's senior management, led by
John D. Zeglis, AT&AMP;T's president, is set to begin a ``road show''
to present the offering to institutional investors. Since people
close to the company said the road show is to last about three
weeks, the offering will probably take place in late April.
</P>
<P>
   In the SEC filing, AT&AMP;T estimated that the tracking shares would
be offered at between $26 and $32 each. The company intends to sell
360 million shares, representing 15.6 percent of the wireless
operation, but the company said that figure could increase to 414
million shares, representing 17.5 percent of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   If the shares are sold at $32 each, the wireless unit will have
an initial market value of about $74 billion. That would be the
largest value for a newly public U.S. company, beating UPS' $60.2
billion initial valuation, according to Comm-Scan, a financial
research firm. At $26 per share, the offering would give the
wireless unit a market value of $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Of the billions of dollars to be raised, most will go to the
wireless unit, presumably to underwrite the building of new
communications networks and the expansion of old ones. Some of the
money, however, will go to AT&AMP;T, the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   After the offering, AT&AMP;T will retain between 82.5 percent and
84.4 percent of the wireless tracking stock. AT&AMP;T said yesterday
that some of that stake would be distributed to owners of AT&AMP;T's
common shares, but would not say how much. The company said it was
considering allowing holders of AT&AMP;T's common stock to exchange
those shares outright for wireless tracking shares, and said it may
also sell more of the tracking stock to the public in a later
offering.

<P>
   TOKYO _ The thought of two hours on the team bus sent shivers up
the backbones of many of the Mets. They had endured enough of that
particular torture in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   So they did what any sensible person would do: they took public
transportation. John Rocker, the avowed enemy of New York's No. 7
elevated line, might hate the concept, but that's what at least 10
wise Mets did Monday evening. They rode with the people.
</P>
<P>
   After their victory over the Seibu Lions in the distant suburb
of Tokorozawa, one cluster of Mets, along with a few family
members, followed the crowd to the station of the Seibu Ikebukuro
Line, heading back toward Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran into a guy in a Mets jacket that Benny had met before
the game,'' Rick Reed said. ``He took us right to our hotel. We'd
still be on the train if he hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they would have done just fine on their own, since this
trip is bringing out the adventurous world traveler in a number of
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Benny Agbayani, Kurt Abbott, Darryl Hamilton and
Turk Wendell all rode the train, switched to the subway at
Ikebukuro, and lived to tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were recounting their adventures in Tokyo leading up to
the opening of the regular season on Wednesday night in Tokyo,
which corresponded to 5:05 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's 9-5 loss to the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants did not
dampen the Mets' spirits. They are having a great time in Tokyo,
which they find far more hospitable and far less daunting than they
might have anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   On their train ride, for example, they had a number of friendly
fans keeping an eye on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of stood out,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza had more of a horde following him. He and four
teammates _ John Franco, Melvin Mora, Edgardo Alfonzo and Todd
Pratt _ all declined a return bus ride through the narrow two-lane
roads of the region. They, too, opted for the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge crowd in our car,'' said Piazza, modestly
skipping over the fact that the fans are fascinated by his long
hair, large frame and sizzling line drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fascination with Americans,'' Piazza said, ``but we
moved to another car, and it was almost empty. It was easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Mets have ventured out of the team hotel, a
luxurious hilltop fortress that could encourage them to stay
inside. Instead, they have been out and about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thoroughly enjoying my time here,'' said Hamilton, who is
also cool in his own country.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton came to the Mets in a trade last season and decided he
would live in the belly of the beast, Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking this afternoon that I probably would never
have a chance to visit Tokyo except for baseball,'' Hamilton said.
``Sure, the flight is long _ but so what?''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is willing to play ambassador, on the theory that
``baseball is an international sport, we can show the world what we
do. This is no offense to the Japanese, but Major League Baseball
is the standard. It's a treat to play games that are more than a
goodwill tour.''
</P>
<P>
   And he particularly likes being an ambassador if it takes him to
a world of shops and sights sprawling below him. His wife,
Ursaline, is enjoying it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we finally had sushi,'' he said. ``Been here three days
and finally got to it. It was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed has been eating in the hotel, but he did get to a Buddhist
temple and went on a shopping expedition on Tuesday. He said:
``Thirty million people in the area as opposed to 8 million in New
York. It's amazing how clean it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani, who came here with a Hawaiian high school all-star
team in 1989, is seeing Tokyo on a major league salary and an
adult's curiosity this time: ``Kobe steak and sushi and lots of
rice. We have the same Japanese rice in Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballplayers love to shop on their free afternoons in the States,
and many of them found their way to the sprawling electronics
district _ blocks and blocks of stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bought a bunch of CD's and a new Diskman,'' Piazza said with a
smile that indicated he just might have cut a swath through a few
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips and Omar Minaya, the general manager and
assistant general manager, visited a pearl shop recommended by
Bobby Valentine, who managed the Chiba Lotte team here in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a wall of fame of some of the people who've been in
there,'' Phillips said. ``Henry Kissinger. Brooke Shields.''
</P>
<P>
   Together? Phillips hated to ruin a good story, but no.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Mets had their own little tales of expeditions
outside the hotel. The ones who were grumping have kept it to
themselves, once they saw how hospitable the hosts have been, and
by extension, the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many people speak English, and how helpful
they are,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the trains and subways and stations all have
English marking as well as Japanese. But the players wouldn't have
known that if they hadn't had the courage _ or the desperation _ to
stay out of the team bus. Even major leaguers are allowed to get
enthusiastic about a new experience, once in a great while.

GOLDMAN, SACHS RECOMMENDATION PUSHES BONDS HIGHER
</HEADLINE>
  (mg) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices were mostly higher on Tuesday amid a drop
in the main stock market gauges, which caused some investors to
seek shelter in fixed-income securities.
</P>
<P>
   The shift out of stocks came after Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief
investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., recommended that her
firm's clients reduce their allocation of stocks to 65 percent from
70 percent, with the 5 percent going into cash. She also
recommended switching from a 5 percent allocation in long-term
bonds to 5 percent in short-term Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, shorter-maturity paper led the market higher. The
price of the two-year note rose 2/32, to 99 27/32, while its yield,
which moves in the opposite direction of the price, dropped to 6.58
percent from 6.62 percent on Monday. The 30-year bond lagged
behind, gaining only 1/32, to 103 25/32. Its yield was unchanged at
5.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond also was held back by OPEC's failure to agree
on increases in oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries took some strength from Monday's consumer confidence
data from the Conference Board, whose index fell for the second
consecutive month after reaching a record in January. The index
that measures consumer expectations for the next six months also
dropped, to its lowest level since October, after the most recent
increase by the Federal Reserve Board in short-term interest rates,
the fifth since June.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at Banc One
Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio, said, ``Going into this
confidence report, credit market investors painfully realized that
the Fed is facing an economy that just doesn't seem to want to slow
down despite the cumulative increase of 125 basis points in the
federal funds rate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, in this environment, there is no doubt that many
investors have begun questioning whether the Fed is falling behind
in its fight against potential inflationary forces,'' Chan said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he disagrees with that assessment, Chan said, it cannot
be fully erased from investors' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' he said, ``the dip in the confidence,
especially in the more important expectations component, had to
offer great relief to those that have spent countless hours
worrying about the growth pace last quarter and what they can
expect to learn in the first quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan said Cohen's announcement was a breath of fresh air for the
credit market, where most investors took the news as an indication
that the bond market might face less competition from the equity
market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the longer maturities did not celebrate initially
because they viewed Cohen's comments as being more supportive of
the shorter maturities. However, they did embrace her statements as
the day wore on.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the
fixed-income department at the J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca
Raton, Fla., said all the markets were skittish, making hedging
ineffective and forcing many investors to sit on positions longer
because of the lack of liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Treasury supply is back in force this week, and
the market is not expected to have much trouble digesting
everything. The government sold $35 billion in 21-day
cash-management bills yesterday and will offer $30 billion in
19-day bills today along with $12 billion of two-year notes. Cash
management bills are used to meet the government's short-term cash
needs outside the regular schedule of bills notes and bonds.

AFTER 17 YEARS, NATHAN LEVENTHAL PLANS TO LEAVE IN DECEMBER
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Lincoln Center's third summer arts festival
ended in July 1998, Nathan Leventhal, the center's president, made
no secret of his profound relief.
</P>
<P>
   He announced that the performances, ranging from a multimedia
``Faust'' to a production of ``Twelfth Night'' featuring Helen
Hunt, had exceeded box office projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one happy guy,'' he said. ``I lost 10 years off my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The personal toll exacted by such ventures and myriad other
tensions seem to be part of the reason that Leventhal announced on
Monday that he would step down in December after nearly 17 years of
running the center's daily operations. He said he was looking
forward to a more relaxed life.
</P>
<P>
   Although Leventhal can't take complete credit for all of the
innovations over the last 17 years, arts professionals say that he
was instrumental in expanding Lincoln Center's fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made Lincoln Center function 365 days a year,'' said Paul
B. Guenther, chairman of the New York Philharmonic. ``Under his
presidency Lincoln Center has become an even more vital part of the
arts community in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts were not always appreciated by the center's 11
constituent groups, which include not only the Philharmonic but the
Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Ballet. Each is
represented on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did some resist Leventhal's introduction of
non-traditional programming, but some of the constituent groups
resented that Lincoln Center played an expanding role as a producer
rather than remaining merely a landlord.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lincoln Center continues to emphasize classical
programming, during Leventhal's tenure it has branched out to
include jazz, American popular song and ballroom dancing on the
plaza. These innovations, which contribute to more than 350
performances a year, have caused growing pains as constituents
watched the additions pilfer some of their fund-raising sources,
talent pools and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now not only is Lincoln Center Inc. a parent and guardian of
its constituents, but also a competitor,'' said Martin J.
Oppenheimer, the board chairman of the City Center of Music and
Drama, the parent organization that oversees the City Opera and
City Ballet. ``The constituents view Lincoln Center as a sponsor,
as a supporter. Nat has been vigorous in promoting Lincoln Center
as a producer.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clashes have occurred between the president and constituents _
mainly Joseph Volpe, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera _
but generally Leventhal seems to have earned respect, however
grudging, from his colleagues. Even Volpe had only diplomatic words
about Leventhal: ``He's going to miss me. Who else is going to be
around to heckle him?''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging these tensions, board members said that
broadening the definition of Lincoln Center productions was a
matter of financial survival, given that dark theaters drain
coffers. ``Don't forget, the health of Lincoln Center is very
important to all the constituents,'' Guenther said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Sills, the center's chair, said the role of Lincoln
Center Inc. is not what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this place was originally conceived it was as a parental
umbrella,'' she said. ``Until we realized we couldn't fill the
theaters for 52 weeks a year. It took Lincoln Center to help fill
those houses.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leventhal arrived in March 1984 from his post as deputy
mayor for operations under Edward I. Koch, the auditoriums of what
are now Avery Fisher Hall, the New York State Theater and the
Metropolitan Opera were dark in the summer. Now during July and
August, Lincoln Center is hopping with outdoor dancing _ from swing
to reggae _ and indoor programs. ``On any given night, you can see
10,000 people on the plaza,'' Sills said.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal said he was most proud of ``the evolution of Lincoln
Center into an innovative, creative force.'' That emphasis, he
said, grew from sitting on grant panels of the National Endowment
for the Arts, where he was derided by fellow panelists for not
having more venturesome programming.
</P>
<P>
   This was particularly troubling because Lincoln Center is looked
to as one of the world's premier arts institutions. Leventhal
noted, for example, that since making jazz part of the regular
Lincoln Center repertory, other arts organizations have followed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus while preserving Lincoln Center's core classical repertory,
Leventhal has made program development a top priority. Jazz at
Lincoln Center and the new American Songbook series of concerts
featuring great American composers have expanded the center's
reach. The Lincoln Center Festival showcases the global
avant-garde. Even the 34-year-old Great Performers series, which
presents internationally renowned classical artists and orchestras,
now offers unorthodox events under the title ``New Visions.''
</P>
<P>
   The PBS broadcast ``Live From Lincoln Center'' has also begun to
include more experimental works. Last March the broadcasts included
the New York City Opera's ``Lizzie Borden,'' a departure from the
galas that dominated the program's previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Leventhal has had to walk a fine line between taking
artistic risks to attract younger, more diverse audiences and
continuing to satisfy core supporters. In March 1999, Lincoln
Center seemed to go out on an artistic limb in deciding to present
a 20-hour production of the classic Chinese opera ``Peony
Pavilion'' similar to the one canceled the previous summer after
officials in Shanghai refused to allow the performers to leave
China.``The forces that tend to prevent freedom of expression can't
win,'' Mr. Leventhal said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet seven months later Lincoln Center declined to sign a letter
from some of New York's most prestigious cultural institutions
criticizing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for threatening to evict the
Brooklyn Museum of Art from a city-owned facility for mounting the
cutting-edge ``Sensation'' exhibition, which the mayor had
lambasted.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum incident may have been an example of
Leventhal's political sensitivities, which his admirers say are
important to the president's position and which were honed during
years in government. In addition to serving as a deputy mayor under
Koch, he was chief of staff to Mayor John V. Lindsay and served as
chief counsel to the United States Senate Subcommittee on
Administrative Practice and Procedure, led by Senator Edward M.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Leventhal endorsed Giuliani for mayor against Ruth W.
Messinger, which was a surprise given his work in Democratic
administrations and his former position as the leader of mayoral
transition team of David N. Dinkins in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has proven to be a friend of Lincoln Center. In 1997
the mayor said he would veto the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority's plan to name a developer for Columbus Circle unless a
theater tied to Lincoln Center was included as part of the
high-rise tower planned for the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal noted that he had fostered more collaboration between
Lincoln Center constituents, for example, during the Mozart
Bicentennial when from January 1991 to August 1992, the center
gradually performed all of the composer's work. ``We've seen more
and more cross-fertilization,'' Leventhal said. ``There's the sense
that this is much more of a campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross-fertilization has had its casualties, however. Mostly
Mozart, for example, which is approaching its 34th season, has been
scaled back to make way for the Lincoln Center Festival. Some
reviewers criticized the Mozart Bicentennial as an unsuccessful
attempt to spread the composer's wealth among the Lincoln Center
constituents and visiting performers.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal and Sills suggested that Lincoln Center's planned $1.5
billion renovation, which is expected to take about 10 years,
wouldfurther unite the constituents in that upgrading the buildings
benefits everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal's departure just as Lincoln Center is about to embark
on major reconstruction makes some board members nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough filling his shoes,'' said Oppenheimer,
the board member. ``We have an extraordinarily difficult
fund-raising operation ahead of us.''

IPO FOR AT&AMP;T  ` TRACKING STOCK ' MAY SET U.S. RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS to fix time elements  from `yesterday` to `Tuesday')(hm/mp) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most things about AT&AMP;T are big, so perhaps it is fitting that
the upcoming initial public offering of shares meant to track
AT&AMP;T's wireless communications unit is set to be the biggest U.S.
IPO yet.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the AT&AMP;T Corp. said it intended to raise up to $13.2 billion in the
offering. That would be more than double the record $5.5 billion
raised by United Parcel Service Inc. when it first offered shares
to the public last November. At a minimum, AT&AMP;T intends to raise
$9.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Chagrined that investors were not giving AT&AMP;T full financial
credit for the value of the company's fast-growing wireless unit,
AT&AMP;T said last year that it would issue a separately traded
``tracking stock'' meant to represent its wireless operation.
Tracking stocks are newly popular financial instruments that are
meant to represent, or track, a particular line of business within
a corporation. Unlike common shares, however, tracking stocks do
not represent actual ownership of a piece of that company.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T declined to say when the initial stock offering wwould be
held. But next week, the wireless unit's senior management, led by
John D. Zeglis, AT&AMP;T's president, is set to begin a ``road show''
to present the offering to institutional investors. Since people
close to the company said the road show is to last about three
weeks, the offering will probably take place in late April.
</P>
<P>
   In the SEC filing, AT&AMP;T estimated that the tracking shares would
be offered at between $26 and $32 each. The company intends to sell
360 million shares, representing 15.6 percent of the wireless
operation, but the company said that figure could increase to 414
million shares, representing 17.5 percent of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   If the shares are sold at $32 each, the wireless unit will have
an initial market value of about $74 billion. That would be the
largest value for a newly public U.S. company, beating UPS' $60.2
billion initial valuation, according to Comm-Scan, a financial
research firm. At $26 per share, the offering would give the
wireless unit a market value of $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Of the billions of dollars to be raised, most will go to the
wireless unit, presumably to underwrite the building of new
communications networks and the expansion of old ones. Some of the
money, however, will go to AT&AMP;T, the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   After the offering, AT&AMP;T will retain between 82.5 percent and
84.4 percent of the wireless tracking stock. AT&AMP;T said Tuesday that
some of that stake would be distributed to owners of AT&AMP;T's common
shares, but would not say how much. The company said it was
considering allowing holders of AT&AMP;T's common stock to exchange
those shares outright for wireless tracking shares, and said it may
also sell more of the tracking stock to the public in a later
offering.

A DETROIT MUSEUM ON THE REBOUND WITH VAN GOGH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Great museums acquire their reputations not just
through the size and quality of their collections but through the
special exhibitions they organize, borrowing works from around the
world. Even fairly small museums have won fame by wheedling prized
artworks from scattered institutions and bringing them together
briefly for the world to see.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the fifth-largest
art museum in the nation in terms of floor space and the largest
west of the Appalachians, has drifted into obscurity because
financial troubles prevented it from initiating any major
exhibitions for the last 14 years. But a new management structure
and a big infusion of cash from private donors have brought the
museum back from the brink of closing, allowing it to organize a
major exhibition of paintings and drawings by van Gogh that opened
on March 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Gogh: Face to Face'' has been an instant hit. More than a
third of the tickets have been sold for the show, which runs
through June 4 before moving to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and
then the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The institute has temporarily stopped closing on Mondays and
Tuesdays, as visitors from southeastern Michigan and a sprinkling
of people from elsewhere cause traffic jams and parking shortages
in the once-desolate cultural quarter of the city.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with its status as a privately managed but city-owned
institution in the largest American city with a black majority, the
museum has tried to attract a racially diverse audience. It has
advertised heavily in publications catering to African-Americans
and has advertised mostly on billboards in the city rather than the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   William Daniels, a retired teacher and Detroit resident, was
surprised and pleased by the heavy turnout on a recent day. ``I
haven't seen it this crowded, the lines were terrific,'' he said,
sitting on a bench after seeing the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face to Face'' is being praised by scholars too. Though there
have been many van Gogh exhibitions in the last 20 years, the
Detroit show is the first to focus on the painter's development as
a portrait artist.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh's portraits have been analyzed in books, but the
current exhibition brings them together for ready comparison, a
first, according to Bogomila Welsh-Ovcharov, a professor of fine
art at the University of Toronto who has written six books on van
Gogh and was not involved in organizing the exhibition. ``What is
more contributory and interesting for scholars and connoisseurs is
to see them in a new context,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With 31 drawings and 36 paintings, the exhibition traces van
Gogh's rapid development in capturing faces on canvas. The earliest
drawings demonstrate how van Gogh, a disillusioned theology student
literally studying how-to books on becoming an artist, produced
works of a style and vision that went far beyond the instructions
in the manuals. The later paintings show his evolution from
realistic representations of the faces of the poor to
interpretations of his face and those of friends in his final
years, in France.
</P>
<P>
   So strict were the curators of the Detroit, Boston and
Philadelphia museums about keeping the emphasis on portraiture that
they did not ask to borrow one of van Gogh's ``The Potato Eaters,''
because it depicts five peasants instead of just one and because it
presents an entire scene.
</P>
<P>
   George S. Keyes, the Elizabeth and Allan Shelden Curator of
European Painting at the museum, said that the inspiration for the
exhibition had come after Josephine Ford, a granddaughter of Henry
Ford, donated a famous van Gogh portrait of a postman, Joseph
Roulin, to the museum in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997 the museum began organizing an exhibition of van
Gogh's paintings of the Roulin family, then broadened its scope to
the gamut of the artist's portraiture after discussions with the
Philadelphia and Boston museums, Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute only recently emerged from near financial
disaster. The museum has long had an excellent collection and a
sprawling building because of big donations by the Ford family and
other auto barons, but it never had much of an endowment or
received many donations for operations and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   It struggled through the hard times of Detroit and American
automakers in the 1970s and '80s. Its last major exhibition, in
1986, featured the work of Diego Rivera, a Mexican muralist who
painted one of his finest works in the huge marble central court of
the museum in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   The institution's management spent the late '80s planning an
ambitious renovation and expansion of the buildings, only to be
devastated in 1991 when Gov. John Engler, a Republican trying to
balance Michigan's budget, cut almost all state aid to the museum.
A third of the museum's $25 million annual budget disappeared,
forcing a reduction in museum hours to 12{ a week from 48, and the
elimination of many educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were exhibitions planned that had to go right into the
trash can because staying alive became the first order of
business,'' said Samuel Sachs II, the museum's director from 1985
to 1997 and now the director of the Frick Collection in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The museum had trouble attracting donations for its operating
budget partly because it was city-owned and staffed mainly by civil
servants. After a nasty two-year political battle that ended in
early 1998, daily management of the museum was transferred to its
private donors, who live mostly in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The donors have given lavishly since then: a fund-raising
campaign that began 11 months ago has brought in $93 million. The
state government, flush again from the strong economy, has offered
another $40 million if further matching contributions can be
raised. An ambitious five-year renovation of the museum's main
building and its two annexes will begin after the van Gogh
exhibition closes, although the museum will remain open during
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The rejuvenation of the auto industry has also helped the museum
raise money. DaimlerChrysler, for instance, is sponsoring the van
Gogh exhibition. Eager to allay local worries about foreign control
and to please the many German managers assigned to what some of
them perceive as a Midwestern cultural backwater, DaimlerChrysler
says it has increased by 20 percent the already substantial
donations that Chrysler had been making to the arts in southeastern
Michigan before it was purchased by Daimler-Benz in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh-Ovcharov, the van Gogh expert, said that the Detroit
museum's choice of van Gogh for its return to presenting
world-class exhibitions showed the strength of its financial
revival. Impressionist paintings and Post Impressionist works like
those by van Gogh have become so valuable that the insurance and
other costs of exhibiting them exceed the resources of most
institutions, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major coup from their point of view,'' she said. ``Van
Goghs are very difficult because of the financial budget
required.''

IN HISTORICAL TERMS, MARGIN DEBT IS NOT OUT OF LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Alan Greenspan is worried about a stock market bubble, say
those looking for easy answers, the Federal Reserve chairman should
push for tighter margin requirements instead of higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   This view has emerged as a form of conventional wisdom in the
wake of reports that the use of credit to finance stock purchases
has been rising substantially over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about borrowing to speculate in the stock market traces
its history to the 1929 crash, which was followed by numerous bank
failures and a Great Depression that lasted on and off for a
decade. Folklore holds that many banks failed because they had lent
excessively to finance market speculators. Subsequent research
showed this wasn't true, but the myth already had become embedded
in the national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when headlines recently heralded dramatic increases in
margin debt, many on Main Street figured the Fed could let the air
out of Wall Street's bubble by further restricting the amount of
debt allowed to finance stock purchases. Generally speaking,
regulations currently limit borrowing to 50 percent of the market
value of the assets in the account.
</P>
<P>
   This way, the thinking goes, speculation can be discouraged
without risking a recession. The problem with such thinking,
however, is that margin debt isn't excessive in the historical
context, and certainly nowhere near its level preceding the 1929
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Reserve study done in the mid-1980s estimates that
margin debt in 1929 was about 10 percent of the market value of all
stocks. Back then this form of debt was referred to as ``broker's
loans'' or ``securities credit.'' The study, which dealt with the
New York Stock Exchange because that pretty much was the market in
those days, showed margin debt fairly steady in the 8 percent to 9
percent range throughout the 1920s. Some old-timers claimed it
spiked at 15 percent before the crash, but Fed researchers couldn't
confirm these memories.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, margin debt collapsed from 10 percent to about
1 percent of market value and has since fluctuated mostly between 1
percent and 2 percent of total stock market value.
</P>
<P>
   So, you ask, how big a factor is margin debt now? The most
recent numbers show it to be 1.5 percent of the total value of the
entire U.S. stock market. Gerald D. Cohen, senior economist with
Merrill Lynch, recently ran some numbers showing that during the
'90s, margin debt has ranged from about 1 percent to 1.5 percent,
or precisely in keeping with post-crash historical norms.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say the stock market isn't frothy. Nor is it
to defend the Fed's relentless tightening of the monetary screws to
slow the economy, fight inflation or discourage ``irrational
exuberance'' in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it's to point out that margin debt doesn't seem a
problem. This form of debt may be rising proportionately faster
than the value of the market. It also may be historically high as a
percentage of U.S. household income. Even so, it remains well
within the post-1929 range, and thus indicates nothing untoward, in
any direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is catching a lot of flak, some of it deserved. Its
disinclination to fiddle with margin requirements, however, isn't a
valid concern.

 &HT;    Bush unveils $5 billion education proposal
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESTON, VA. _ Gov. George W. Bush declared illiteracy a
``national emergency'' Tuesday and unveiled a $5 billion plan to
combat it.
</P>
<P>
   He also won the endorsement of former GOP rival and millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also telephoned vanquished presidential rival John McCain
from his car in Virginia. An aide to McCain, who declined to be
identified by name, said the two talked briefly about the ``reform
agenda'' that helped fuel the Arizona senator's brief rise in the
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   They also talked about getting together, but set no date.
</P>
<P>
   Before an audience at Sallie Mae, a national provider of
federally guaranteed student loans based in suburban Washington,
Bush rolled out his new proposal, called ``Reading First.'' The
reading initiative is the latest salvo in Bush's battle with Vice
President Al Gore over how to improve the nation's schools _ an
issue Democrats have long dominated and Republicans want to own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is different,'' Bush said. ``It's different from my
opponent. It's different from the administration. And it's
different from those who would say there is no federal role for
education, different from those who would throw money into schools
without reforming them, from those who would argue against any
federal money or responsibility at all. ... I won't close down the
Department of Education, but I will transform it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called for expanding Head Start, spending $50 billion
over a decade to provide universal preschool, and spending more
than $400 million annually to train elementary school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign also touted a $260 million administration grant
program designed to improve reading and took aim at Bush's
proposed, five-year $483 billion tax cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is playing follow the leader,'' said Gore campaign
spokesman Doug Hattaway. ``This goal was set by the administration
back in 1996. Bush's real agenda is an enormous tax cut for the
rich that won't leave any money to invest in education unless he
dips into the Social Security surplus or goes back to deficit
spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal is based on the Texas Reading Initiative, now
being implemented, that calls for students to read at or better
than grade level by third grade.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan announced Tuesday, $5 million annually would go
to assess reading skills in children from kindergarten to first
grade. Another $90 million would be used to train teachers of
kindergarten and first grade. The largest amount _ $900 million
annually _ would pay for tutoring, after-school and summer school
programs for the approximately 900,000 children Bush advisors
estimate would need reading help.
</P>
<P>
   States and school districts would have to apply for the money
and demonstrate that they had used, ``certain standards based on
scientific research,'' to assess reading skills and fix problems.
</P>
<P>
   So eager is Bush to capture the education mantle that he invoked
the spirit of Albert Shanker, former leader of the American
Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The late Albert Shanker used to tell the story of visiting a
class of disadvantaged students stuck in the rut of easy work and
low expectations,'' Bush said. ``He asked them, `What should we ask
you students to read?' After a pause one student raised his hand,
and said, `Mr. Shanker, what do the smart kids read?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeated his call to consolidate some 60 federal education
programs into block grants, annual testing of students in grades 3
through 8 and allowing low-income parents with children in
consistently underperforming schools to use public money to pay for
private education.

 &HT;    Witness says Lewis was active in fight
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _What sparked the street fight remains unclear, but it
appears that both sides _ the occupants of Ray Lewis' limousine and
the two men stabbed to death _ were active and willing participants
in a fracas that escalated into death, according to statements
witnesses gave authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-pound Lewis helped escalate the fight by taking his gold
chain from his neck, an unmistakable action that said he was ready
to fight, according to a statement from Jeff Gwen, an Akron, Ohio,
resident and friend of the two men stabbed to death in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are expected to use that statement to challenge
defense contentions that Lewis, the All-Pro linebacker charged with
murder, tried to be a peacemaker. Gwen told police he then saw
Lewis fighting with one of the victims shortly before the victim
was stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen's statements _ and those of Lewis' limousine driver _ were
used by prosecutors to obtain the Feb. 11 murder indictment against
Lewis and co-defendants Reginald Oakley, 31, of Baltimore and
Joseph Sweeting, 34, of Miami. The statements are a key element
behind the prosecution's contention that Lewis is guilty of murder
because he participated in a crime _ aggravated assault _ that led
to the death of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen did not see Lewis holding a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth Baker, 21, Akron natives who
lived in Decatur, both were fatally stabbed three times in the
heart and the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen's testimony is certain to be attacked by Lewis' defense
team. Lewis, 24, and his co-defendants have pleaded not guilty.
According to statements given by witnesses who were members of
Lewis' party, Lollar, Baker and their friends were the instigators
of the fight. Gwen told police that Lollar yelled a vulgarity and
racial slur before jumping into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Robertson, who was with Lewis that night, has told
prosecutors that members of her group believed they were fending
off a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robertson's statement, she heard one of the
limousine occupants say, ``He has a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, who turned over to investigators nine garment bags of
Lewis's clothing and has been given immunity from prosecutors, said
a passenger in the limousine warned the other occupants to ``get
down'' because someone on the street had a gun. Someone at the
scene fired at the fleeing Lincoln Navigator limo, striking it five
times and flattening a tire.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses have said that it was Baker who smashed a
champagne bottle over Oakley's head.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen said he came to Atlanta for the Super Bowl parties and that
he met his friends, Lollar and Baker, at the Cobalt lounge in
Buckhead. In a previous interview with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Gwen, 26, said he was on the sidewalk at East
Paces Ferry Road when the fight with Lewis' entourage erupted.
Gwen, who is 6-feet-2 and weighs 160 pounds, said he jumped in to
protect his friends, who were smaller and outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   But Gwen fled the scene when he saw an opponent brandish a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Gwen said he saw his friends lying bleeding
on the street. He said he ran back and cradled Lollar, crying,
``Wake up! Wake up!''
</P>
<P>
   Gwen, a flegling rapper known as Chino Nino, is certain to be
aggressively cross-examined at trial as defense lawyers question
his criminal record, his violence-filled rap lyrics and why he left
the scene in Buckhead before police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen gave his first statement to police on Feb. 9, more than a
week after the slayings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   A day before he gave that statement, he pleaded guilty in Akron
to violating probation on felony drug charges. Gwen had been
convicted in Akron in January 1999 of preparing marijuana for sale.
He was placed on two years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio authorities returned Gwen to court Feb. 8 and sentenced him
to stricter probation with intensive oversight and and ordered to
serve time in an Akron half-way house.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen's rap lyrics are filled with lines about drug money, pimps
and gangsters. He portrays himself as a wealthy, tough street thug.
He lives with his grandmother in Akron.

 &HT;    RENO SAID TO TESTIFY THAT AGENTS EXCEEDED AUTHORITY AT WACO
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno testified Tuesday that
</P>
<P>
   she had not authorized some actions taken by FBI agents during
the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas,
an attorney for the sect said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno acknowledged in two hours of questioning that federal
agents had used military-issue incendiary tear gas canisters and
``flash-bang'' grenades without her approval, said Michael Caddell,
the leading lawyer in a wrongful-death lawsuit against the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also said she had not authorized the FBI to demolish the
compound, and held to her past position that agents sent in tanks
only to inject tear gas, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   The private questioning of the attorney general all but wraps up
the pre-trial interviewing by the plaintiffs, who are charging that
FBI officials on the scene overstepped their authority during the
assault on the compound on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 Davidian adults and children were found dead after the
wooden structure caught fire and was quickly consumed by the
flames. The government says that sect members set the fire after
the assault began.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said in an interview late Tuesday that the assault was
carried on under two separate and contradictory assumptions, one
held by senior authorities in Washington and another by the
on-scene commanders, Jeffrey Jamar and Richard Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamar and Rogers testified that they believed they had implied
authority to demolish the building that morning if they chose to do
so, implied authority to use military tear gas rounds that morning
if they thought it was appropriate, that they had implied authority
to use flash-bangs,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the top FBI leadership and Reno said that, absent
an emergency, ``there was no authority or approval'' for any of
these actions during the assault of the Davidian compound, the
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he had learned little in questioning Reno. ``I
didn't expect to learn anything from her,'' he said. ``Frankly, in
her position she doesn't know very much and I think she's
politically adept at dodging questions, at not giving a straight
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at a news conference outside the Justice Department
where he appeared in blue jeans, a shirt without tie, a jacket and
cowboy boots, Caddell criticized Reno for a lack of candor,
especially on the demolition of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin disputed that
characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was forthcoming,'' he said. ``She was candid, and her
comments were consistent with her past testimony. Obviously we
would disagree with what her plaintiff's attorneys say.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said that he would release a transcript and videotape of
the Reno deposition at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   One area where the Reno testimony could make a difference to his
case was on the lack of a plan to fight a potential fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``She acknowledged that no one ever told her'' that the FBI
operations included a written plan excluding the use of
firefighters, Caddell said. ``And she was never told that if the
local fire departments came out at the scene that they would be
held at the gate'' of the complex, known as Mount Carmel, out of
concern that the Davidians might shoot at the fire fighters, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said that the attorney general acknowledged that she had
not been aware of any discussions about fire fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have had armored fire-fighting equipment there,''
Caddell said. ``They spent $6 million on the operations at Mount
Carmel on tanks and helicopters and tear gas and grenade launchers
and machine guns. And they didn't spend a penny on fire fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have said most of the victims died either in
the fire and or from shots fired by fellow cult members. The trial
is set for mid May in federal district court in Waco.

JAPANESE SUCCESSES RAISE HOPES FOR EVENTUAL TRUE WORLD SERIES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ After the New York Mets lost to the Tokyo Yomiuri
Giants, 9-5, on Tuesday night, Manager Bobby Valentine walked to
home plate and bowed deeply toward the Giants' dugout. Valentine,
who managed the Chiba Lotte Marines in 1995, knows the importance
of a respectful gesture in the Japanese culture.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants wound up winning both exhibition games against the
so-called major leaguers, having beaten the Chicago Cubs, 6-0, on
Monday night. Valentine felt this unofficial little series was just
a start toward a competition that would produce ``a true world
champion, not just an American champion.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, that is, 5:05 Wednesday morning in New York,
two major league teams will play official league games outside
North America. The Mets and the Cubs will play here again Thursday
night before heading home.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants whacked 12 hits off four pitchers who will be going
to the Mets' farm team in Norfolk as soon as the club returns to
the United States on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pulsipher, who was officially optioned to Norfolk earlier
in the day, was whacked for five runs in four innings, including a
two-run homer by Domingo Martinez, a 32-year-old first baseman from
the Dominican Republic, who played with Toronto in 1992 and '93.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning, Yoshinobu Takahashi belted a two-run
homer off Bobby M. Jones, the left-hander who was along for the
ride so the Mets would not chew up their pitching staff before the
official season opens. The Mets, however, did not make excuses
about losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's kind of anxious to go,'' Mike Piazza said. ``Every
year brings a curiosity. You want to find the intangibles, find the
`wa,''' he added with a smile, referring to the Japanese word for
``spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who open their Central League season against the
Hiroshima Carp at home Friday night, did not claim to be world
champions, based on the two exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this series, I felt the major leaguers were more
powerful and speedy,'' said Masahiro Kawai, the 35-year-old
shortstop. ``I have the same impression now. To keep up with them,
we have to improve.''  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 1,000 American Legion members swarmed
Capitol Hill Tuesday hoping to persuade a few wavering senators to
support a proposed constitutional amendment that would make
desecrating the U.S. flag illegal. A Senate vote is expected
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans, here for their annual Washington conference of the
American Legion, buttonholed lawmakers in their offices or in
hallways. Several Legion members escorted Miss America, Heather
Renee French, whose father is a disabled Vietnam veteran, to
senators' offices.
</P>
<P>
   But many Legionnaires conceded that Wednesday's vote is likely
to fall two or three votes short of the two-thirds majority needed
for the Senate to join the House in passing the amendment and
sending it to the states for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   American Legion National Commander Alan G. Lance indicated that
his organization would target senators who fail to support the
measure at the ballot box this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the ability to protect Old Glory,'' Lance said at a
news conference where he stood with seven Medal of Honor winners
before dispatching his troops to the Senate. ``If we win, we in the
states will ratify. If we lose, we in the states will rectify,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine state legislatures _ all except Vermont's _ have
enacted resolutions asking Congress to send the amendment to them
for ratification. If Congress passes the flag amendment, three
fourths of the states must approve it before it can become part of
the Constitution. The House passed the flag amendment with
two-thirds majorities in 1995, 1997 and last year. The measure
failed by three votes in the Senate in 1995 and was not taken up in
1997 or 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., a supporter of the flag amendment, said
Wednesday that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., is
bringing up the measure again even though he knows it will fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent Lott just brought it up because he wants to put a lot of
Democrats on the record,'' Cleland said. Senate sources said he was
referring particularly to Sens. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia,
Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Charles S. Robb of Virginia, who have
been considered swing votes and who are up for reelection. ``Lott
is just waiting to run 30-second spots against them,'' Cleland
added.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, sponsor of the flag amendment, said at
the Legion's news conference that ``burning the flag, defecating on
it or urinating on it is not free speech. Standing up for the flag
will send a strong message that there are some common values and
ideals in America _ ideals worth protecting, fighting for and, when
warranted, dying for,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that incidences of flag burning are rare and
don't warrant altering the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Patrick Brady of the American Legion said flag burners are
not the problem. ``It's those that call flag burning speech that
are the problem.'' Brady referred to Supreme Court decisions in
1989 and 1990 that rejected state and federal statutes against flag
desecration as violations of free speech rights in the First
Amendment to the Constitution. He said the rulings ``destroyed our
Constitution, and we should not stand still for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said later he is fighting an uphill battle, but he added,
``Win or lose, we're going to keep fighting for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's amendment says: ``Congress shall have the power to
prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., another flag amendment sponsor,
said she agrees that amending the Constitution is ``serious
business, and we need to tread carefully.'' But Feinstein said the
flag that flies in front of her home in San Francisco is ``an
important symbol of unity'' and ``a revered object as well as a
national symbol'' that deserves protection. She conceded later that
the amendment is likely to fail and also predicted it will become
an issue in the November elections.

 &HT;    Correct election date to 1999 in graf 6 and spelling of Sara in

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As defiant as ever, former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday said he was the victim of a ``hunt'' and
denied police allegations of corruption while in office.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, in an interview on Israeli television, came after
Israeli police recommended that prosecutors file several corruption
charges against he and his wife, Sara.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, they are accused of trying to keep up to 700 gifts
they received while Netanyahu was in office _ including a gold
letter opener from Vice President Al Gore _ and accepting work from
a contractor who expected political favors. Police have been
investigating the couple, including long questioning sessions with
each, for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't define this as though they are after me, I would
define it as a hunt,'' Netanyahu said during the 50-minute
interview in which he often appeared sarcastic and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these allegations have no basis at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he lost a bid for re-election in 1999 and then dropped
out of politics, Netanyahu has been courted recently to make a
comeback, either for his Likud Party or a new party. His three
years in office were marked by a combative style, and reluctance to
carry out peace agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV interview, Netanyahu said the police investigation
could preclude another political bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They, in essence, are neutralizing me politically,'' he said,
apparently referring to the police.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on whether to charge Netanyahu lies with Attorney
General Elyakim Rubinstein, who has in the past refused to charge
Netanyahu on other police allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Police recommend that Netanyahu be charged with accepting a
bribe, breach of trust by a public official, obstruction of justice
and attempted fraud. Police said Sara Netanyahu should be charged
with theft and attempted fraud. They also recommended charges
against two Netanyahu aides.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli law professor Ze'ev Segal said that Netanyahu, if
convicted of all his charges, could face three to seven years in
jail. He could also be barred from again seeking office.
</P>
<P>
   For now, that is a long way off. But, the recommendation is the
latest in a wave of scandals rippling through Israel's public
elite.
</P>
<P>
   Current Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his aides face a police
probe into his campaign fundraising. President Ezer Weizman is
being investigated for accepting more than $400,000 in gifts over
his political career from a French millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Rubinstein opened an investigation of the spiritual
leader of the large Shas political party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef,
because he compared a political opponent to ``Satan'' and a
biblical figure who set out to eliminate the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Such language can be considered incitement to violence and has
been closely scrutinized since the assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption scandals, especially, are seen as a sign of
growing influence of Israeli prosecutors in a still young country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standards have risen. The things that were possible in the
past and would have gone unnoticed are not possible now,'' said Uri
Dromi, publications director for the Israel Democracy Institute.
``The public is not tolerating it as it did before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netanyahu inquiry began shortly after the elections, when a
contractor submitted a bill to his office for work done for the
Netanyahus. It appears police believe the contractor did $50,000
worth of work with the understanding that Netanyahu would repay him
with political favors.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor has since become a witness for the prosecution.
Police accuse Netanyahu of trying to get the contractor to lie in
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The police searched the Netanyahus' home and properties, and
reportedly found gifts with the inscriptions removed and that had
been re-packaged. Israel Radio reported that the gifts were worth
more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he was allowed to take gifts for the office he is
provided by the government as former prime minister.

ANONYMOUS TIP NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY GUN SEARCH, JUSTICES RULE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.)   (See also SCOTUS-HATE-CRIME) 
(nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An anonymous tip that a person is carrying a gun is
not enough to justify a stop and frisk by the police without some
further sign that the information is reliable, the Supreme Court
ruled with surprising unanimity Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected the argument put forward by Florida, the
Clinton administration and a broad coalition of state attorneys
general that because guns are so inherently dangerous, the police
can act on a tip involving a gun on the basis of less evidence than
the Constitution would otherwise require.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firearms are dangerous, and extraordinary dangers sometimes
justify unusual precautions,'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in
her opinion for the court. However, she added: ``An automatic
firearm exception to our established reliability analysis would
rove too far. Such an exception would enable any person seeking to
harass another to set in motion an intrusive, embarrassing police
search of the targeted person simply by placing an anonymous call
falsely reporting the target's unlawful carriage of a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a rule, Ginsburg said, would not be easily confined to guns
but would logically extend to ``bare-boned tips about narcotics,''
on the ground that guns are often associated with drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg said that for an anonymous tip to be reliable enough to
justify police action, it must do more than simply describe a
suspect's appearance and location _ in this case, that a black
teen-ager dressed in a plaid shirt was standing with two companions
at a Miami bus stop and was carrying a concealed handgun. Two Miami
police officers, responding to a telephone tip, went to the scene,
found it as described and pulled a gun from the young man's pants
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg noted that the tip offered nothing beyond mere
description and, in contrast to an anonymous tip the court found
adequate in a decision 10 years ago, gave the police no way to test
its accuracy. In the earlier case, a person left a building as
predicted, and drove to another address before the police moved in.
Recalling that the court had described the earlier case as
``close,'' Ginsburg said: ``This one surely falls on the other side
of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current climate of frequent and tense encounters between
the police and citizens, this case, Florida vs. J.L., No. 98-1993,
drew wide attention from a variety of civil-liberties and
law-enforcement groups.
</P>
<P>
   James Tomkovicz, a law professor at the University of Iowa who
filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers and other groups against searches based on anonymous tips,
said Tuesday that the decision had broad implications as a
demonstration that ``crime control is a concern of a free society,
but not the only concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's unanimity can be explained, he said, by the fact
that ``this was an extreme claim; that when someone says the magic
words `firearm,' the protection of the Fourth Amendment
disappears.'' The Fourth Amendment bans unreasonable police
searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing solely with anonymous tips, the court did not address
the more controversial and heavily freighted question of what
actions the police can take based not on a tip but on their own
observation and judgment. The justices found law-enforcement
arguments to be much more persuasive in ruling in January that a
person's unprovoked flight at the mere sight of a police officer
can justify the officer's chasing and frisking the person.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, of 11 criminal law cases the justices have decided so
far this term, the decision Tuesday was the first in which the
defendant prevailed. It is perhaps a measure of the Clinton
administration's conservatism on criminal law issues that its
arguments tilted too far toward the police even for this Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The decision affirmed a 1998 ruling by the Florida Supreme
Court, which suppressed the gun the police had found in the pocket
of the 15-year-old subject of the tip, identified only as J.L.,
because, the court said, the search violated his Fourth Amendment
rights. The charge against him was never brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Supreme Court was actually in a minority of courts
to refuse to give special weight to the purported presence of a gun
in an anonymous tip; most other state and federal courts to have
considered the question had treated the gun as a highly relevant
factor in judging whether a tip provided the requisite ``reasonable
suspicion'' for the police to act.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The concept of reasonable suspicion as justification for a stop
and frisk, as opposed to the probable cause police need for a
formal search, comes from a 1968 Supreme Court decision, Terry vs.
Ohio, which permitted police officers who observe suspicious
behavior to conduct a limited pat-down search for weapons for their
own protection. In the context of a tip rather than observed
behavior, Ginsburg said Tuesday, reasonable suspicion ``requires
that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just in
its tendency to identify a determinate person.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested the need for reliability might be relaxed in other
contexts where great danger was alleged, such as a report that
someone was carrying a bomb, or in places such as schools or
airports ``where the reasonable expectation of Fourth Amendment
privacy is diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   In a concurring opinion, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist said that while ``the court says all
that is necessary to resolve this case,'' there would be more to
say in future cases about the ways in which anonymous tips might be
tested for reliability.

 HIGH COURT HEARS CASE ON WHETHER JUDGES OR JURIES SHOULD RULE ON
BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During a Supreme Court argument on the
constitutionality of New Jersey's unusual sentencing procedure for
hate crimes, the justices Tuesday appeared troubled by the state's
law but also troubled by the broader implications of overturning
it.
</P>
<P>
   While most states have laws that treat crimes committed because
of bias as warranting special or more severe punishment, only New
Jersey and North Carolina authorize judges, rather than juries, to
make the finding that bias was the motive. The two state laws
specify that the finding need not be ``beyond a reasonable doubt,''
the usual standard in criminal law, but only by a ``preponderance
of the evidence,'' a low evidentiary standard that means
essentially ``more likely than not.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Ethnic Intimidation Act, enacted in 1990, is being
challenged in an appeal by a Vineland man who confessed to having
fired several rounds from a .22-caliber rifle into the house of the
black family living next door and who pleaded guilty to unlawful
possession of a firearm. The sentence for that crime ranged from 5
to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The judge then concluded that the state had shown by a
preponderance of the evidence that the shooting was racially
motivated, an accusation that the defendant, Charles C. Apprendi
Jr., vigorously disputed. Apprendi, who is white, said he suffered
from an obsessive-compulsive disorder and, under the influence of
drugs and alcohol, felt an urge to shoot at the glass pane of the
home's brightly painted door.
</P>
<P>
   Under the New Jersey hate crime law, the judge's finding that
bias was the motive doubled the possible sentence, and Apprendi
received a sentence of 12 years instead of the maximum of 10 he
could otherwise have received.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about the erosion of the jury by the New Jersey
Legislature,'' Apprendi's lawyer, Joseph D. O'Neill, told the court
Tuesday. ``If a person is to be stigmatized as a racist, that
should be found by the broadest cross section of the community, and
that is the jury,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant's argument got a sympathetic response from
justices across the court's ideological spectrum, from Clarence
Thomas and Antonin Scalia among the conservatives to John Paul
Stevens and David H. Souter among the court's more liberal members.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said that under the Sixth Amendment's right to trial by
jury, there was an ``unbroken tradition'' that it was the jury that
had to find the facts that could increase the possible sentence.
Scalia grew so animated in picking up the slack in O'Neill's
somewhat halting argument that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
teased him at one point for arguing the defendant's case.
</P>
<P>
   Other justices, however, appeared troubled by the potential
implications of finding the New Jersey system unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do with capital sentencing schemes?'' Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor asked O'Neill, noting that in some states it is
the judge who decides, after a jury's finding of guilt, whether a
convicted murderer will receive a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   And Justice Stephen G. Breyer, an author of the federal
sentencing guidelines when he worked in the Senate in the 1970s,
told O'Neill: ``If I agree with you, I guess I'm holding the
Sentencing Commission unconstitutional'' because judges, not
juries, apply the various factors that determine a convicted
defendant's sentence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The court has struggled in several recent cases over where to
draw the constitutional line between the respective roles of judge
and jury in laws that provide for longer sentences when, for
example, the defendant has used a gun in the commission of a crime
or has a criminal record. In its decision last June upholding
Apprendi's sentence, the New Jersey Supreme Court acknowledged the
ferment in this area of criminal law and said that ``the final word
on this subject will have to come from the United States Supreme
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa S. Gochman, a deputy attorney general from New Jersey who
argued in defense of the law, emphasized the difference between
``intent'' and ``motive'' in criminal law. Whether a defendant had
the requisite intent to commit the crime, essential to the finding
of guilt, remained as it always has been, a question for the jury
under New Jersey's approach, she said. But the question of motive,
or why the defendant committed the crime, was traditionally treated
as a sentencing factor, she said. For example, Gochman said, it had
never been considered the prosecution's duty to prove why someone
committed a burglary, whether to feed a drug habit or feed a
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``But motive has never had the significance it has under the New
Jersey statute,'' Souter told the state's lawyer. ``New Jersey has
chosen to give it a very different role,'' so the traditional
treatment did not necessarily apply, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the federal hate crime sentencing law, under which the
jury makes the finding of biased purpose, nor the laws of most
states will be affected by the decision in this case, Apprendi vs.
New Jersey, No. 99-478. But the Justice Department entered the case
on the state's side because of a variety of federal laws that
provide for enhanced sentences in other contexts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who rarely speaks during the court's argument sessions,
offered a pointed response to the argument that an assistant
solicitor general, Edward C. DuMont, made on behalf of the law.
``You argue that if it's an element of the offense it goes to the
jury and if it's a sentence enhancement it goes to the judge,''
Thomas said. ``The difficulty I have is that you nowhere define
what the distinction is.''
</P>
<P>
   When DuMont said that legislatures should be given wide
discretion to decide where the decision should be made, Scalia told
him, ``You have to give me some way to protect the citizens from a
legislature that doesn't like juries.''

TV NOTES: ELIAN INTERVIEW; OSCAR RATING 
</HEADLINE>
  (hm) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' seemed to score the newsmaker
interview of the week with Diane Sawyer's exclusive chat with Elian
Gonzalez, which ran Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the interview has been heavily criticized by President Fidel
Castro, network competitors at NBC and, ABC says, the U.S. Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's installment, taped Thursday and Friday in the
presence of a psychoanalyst, the 6-year-old boy recounted how he
was saved by dolphins when the boat that had been carrying him, his
mother and 11 other people from Cuba to Florida sank. The boy told
Sawyer that he had thought his mother, who drowned, had survived
the disaster but had not found him because she lost her memory.
</P>
<P>
   But Sawyer broke what appeared to be the real news on Tuesday.
``The relatives in Miami say Elian repeatedly insists he does not
want to go back to Cuba,'' she said. ``He told us that, too, but in
this inflamed climate, on this inflamed subject, we thought it best
not to broadcast the exact words of a 6-year-old child.''
</P>
<P>
   While this was important news in the debate over whether the
child should be returned to his father in Cuba or remain with
relatives in Miami, for many people, her statement begged a
question: Then why broadcast the exact words of a 6-year-old child
in the first place? And why leave out the child's opinion, an
integral part of the story?
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zucker, executive producer of NBC's ``Today,'' said the boy
did not appear on his program because it did not consider such an
interview proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been interested in this interview,'' he said. ``We
thought it was inappropriate to interview a 6-year-old boy,
especially this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker acknowledged that a ``Today'' show booker responded
positively to the Gonzalez family when asked if the producers were
interested in interviewing the child. But, he said, the booker
acted without his approval.
</P>
<P>
   Castro called the interview ``monstrous and sickening,'' The
Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives said the Justice Department had expressed
displeasure with the segments. It has threatened to take custody of
the boy as early as tomorrow unless his family agrees that it will
surrender him if it loses its legal battle to keep him in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Journalistic opinion was divided over whether ``Good Morning
America'' had acted appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Saltzman, associate dean at the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Southern California, told The
Miami Herald he didn't have a problem with the interview. But
Robert M. Steele, director of the ethics program at the Poytner
Institute, a journalism education center in St. Petersburg, Fla.,
called the interview unethical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian is 6 years old and is clearly very vulnerable for a
variety of emotional and psychological reasons and has undergone a
great deal of trauma,'' Steele said. ``What we have to do is
balance the potential value of the interview, in terms of the
subject matter,'' he said, ``and what the child could meaningfully
offer against what the level of intrusion would be on a 6-year-old
when asked such hard questions _ particularly when they have
undergone such emotional trauma as Elian has.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of ABC News, David Westin, defended the interview.
He said that it had been carefully considered before it was taped
and that ABC had gone out of its way to make sure the interview was
appropriate and tasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that it was a very legitimate and important news
story,'' he said. ``The one point of view we hadn't heard anything
about was the little boy whose life is really involved here.'' He
said the network decided not to show the scenes in which Elian said
he wanted to remain in Miami because it feared they would be taken
out of context and used for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Morning America,'' incidentally, received higher than
usual ratings Monday morning: It was viewed in an average of 5.2
million homes, compared with its usual 4.3 million. But the show
tends to do better than usual after the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The last installment of Sawyer's interview with the boy is to be
shown tonight on ``20/20.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar Rating
</P>
<P>
   ABC was more than pleased with the results from this year's
Academy Awards broadcast, pointing to ratings up about 2 percent
from last year's.
</P>
<P>
   But the show lagged far behind the rating of two years ago, when
``Titanic'' won many awards. This year's show also had the
advantage of Billy Crystal as host.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second year the show has been on a Sunday. ABC moved
the show from Monday with much fanfare two years ago, hoping for a
significant ratings increase, because Sunday is usually the
most-watched television night of the week.
</P>
<P>
   This year's show had a higher rating than the 1997 show, when
``The English Patient'' was chosen as best film. And it was also
behind the 1996 broadcast, when ``Braveheart'' was the year's big
winner. Both of those shows were broadcast on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   ABC did miss badly on one goal that the network emphasized after
last year's show: making the elephantine broadcast shorter. It ran
more than 10 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   One big reason the overrun didn't hurt the ratings, however, was
that by that point, at ABC's request, counting for the ratings had
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show ended at 12:41 a.m. EST, the rating went only
until 12:17 a.m., when the last commercial ran. ABC asked Nielsen
Media Research to consider the rest of the show, which included all
the biggest awards, as what is known as ``sustaining.''
</P>
<P>
   That usually means programming that is not sponsored. Surely
this is the only programming anywhere in television that gets
almost a 30 rating and is not considered sponsored. But ABC chose
to do it this way because the rating falls off sharply at that
hour. ``We moved the last commercial up this year to try to keep
the rating up,'' said Andrea Wong, vice president for specials at
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   That also had the advantage of grouping most of the truly big
awards _ all except leading actress this year _ at the end without
a commercial interruption. This year's show went from best director
to best actor to best picture without a commercial. &QL;

TAX PLAN TOUCHES FEMINIST NERVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ As a rule, Australians are neither coy nor squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Topless sunbathing and euphemism-free condom advertisements are
common here, and unremarkable. Humor tends to the scatological.
``The Sopranos'' and ``Sex and the City,'' two decidedly
adult-oriented staples of HBO programming in the United States, are
shown on Australian network television, in prime time, without
deleted expletives. These people are not easily shocked.
</P>
<P>
   But even Australia has its limits. And women dressing up as
giant replicas of feminine hygiene products, and pelting the prime
minister with said products in public, is pushing them.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, of course, is taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, the conservative government of Prime Minister John
Howard will impose a 10 percent Goods and Services Tax on almost
everything Australians buy. Exceptions will be made for such items
as sunscreen, personal lubricants for men and women, incontinence
pads, and condoms. But not for tampons and sanitary napkins, which
will jump in price like lumber, towels, and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   That has angered women enormously, igniting the kind of feminist
uprising Australia hasn't seen since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax on tampons is unfair, because there will not be a tax
on medical products like bandages, for instance,'' said activist
Rhonda Ellis. ``Only women bleed, so this is discriminatory.
Condoms, for instance, will not have a GST. So sex is a necessity,
and periods a luxury?''
</P>
<P>
   When the controversy over the Goods and Services Tax erupted
late last year, Health Minister Michael Wooldridge made matters
worse by arguing that the tax on tampons was not discriminatory,
and that tampons did not qualify for a health exemption because
menstruation is not an illness. He compared the tax on tampons to
that on shaving cream, which affects men more than women, and
concluded the government's position was perfectly just.
</P>
<P>
   That incensed Ellis, a 54-year-old veteran of the women's
movement, who took drastic action. She morphed into Tanya Tampon
and helped to make the tax on feminine hygiene products a national
issue. After all, she argues, men can do without shaving cream. It
is far more difficult for women to find substitutes for tampons and
sanitary napkins.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis created Tanya Tampon by wrapping herself in a cylinder of
cardboard, putting a planter on her head, and covering the whole
structure with a gauzy white sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long piece of white cord that comes up from
underneath, and I tend to swing that for effect,'' she said. Long
white gloves complete the look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to walk in, I can't sit down in it, and on a hot
day, it's really warm in there, but I can talk from it,'' Ellis
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Prime Minister Howard appeared at Murwillumbah, a town far
north of Sydney, in early February, Tanya Tampon and her comrades
were there to greet him, carrying banners saying ``We're bleeding
voters too. Stick your GST!''
</P>
<P>
   Protesting environmentalists were hurling slogans at the prime
minister that day too, but while police pushed the
environmentalists back behind barricades, they kept their distance
from Tanya Tampon and her friends, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's because the police were reluctant to approach
the tampon,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said Howard didn't seem to notice her that day, but the
press certainly did, and a round of television and radio
appearances followed.
</P>
<P>
   Radio interviewers asked her if she didn't think it ``a bit over
the top'' to dress up as a giant tampon: ``I said, `I think it's a
bit over the top to have a tax on tampons, and I think this is an
appropriate response to the tax.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Howard was unaware of Tanya Tampon at his appearance in
Murwillumbah, he has had difficulty avoiding her fellow protesters
since. Australians, who call their heads of state by their first
names and harbor a strong skepticism about elected officials, are
rarely shy about making their displeasure felt.
</P>
<P>
   In late February, riot police were dispatched to break up a
rally in Perth, as women protesting the tax showered Howard and his
aides with tampons dipped in red dye. The women stood side by side
with angry builders' labor union members protesting the use of
non-union workers.
</P>
<P>
   At another protest, in Nowra, north of Sydney, laid-off meat
workers _ males _ held up protest banners on behalf of the women.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, 100 red-caped women called The Menstrual Avengers
marched on the offices of media magnate Kerry Packer, and on the
headquarters of Howard's Liberal Party. They, too, tossed tampons.
One some college campuses, women have taken to wearing tampons as
earrings, in silent protest. In Canberra, 60 women in red marched
on the city center chanting, ``I bleed and I vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How very tasteless,'' said Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander
Downer after he and the rest of Howard's Cabinet were pelted by the
Menstrual Avengers in one town.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has done anything to budge the Howard government on
the tax, however. If an exception were made for tampons on the
grounds that they are a necessity, their argument goes, then the
floodgates would be open to exemptions for such items as children's
clothing, diapers, and funerals, and the whole system would come
crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Labor Party has seized on the tampon tax,
capitalizing on the clear outrage of so many women, and has been
trying use it to pummel Howard's government and its entire tax plan
for months. As a result, women's concerns have been placed near the
top of Australia's agenda lately, a still-rare state of affairs for
a culture many still consider to be quite macho.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words `tampon,' `menstruation,' and `period' have now been
used in federal parliament,'' Ellis said, pleased. ``It's
interesting that periods are possibly the last bastion of taboo.''
</P>
<P>
   That taboo is on its way out, she promised. But until that
liberation, or a tax exception, arrives, Ellis is happy to throw on
the Tanya Tampon costume as often as needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unafraid of bulldozers, trains, and press cameras,'' she
said. ``If not me, then maybe nobody else would do it. Besides,
unless you volunteer your name, nobody knows who you are.''

TRAINING PROGRAMS OFTEN MISS THE POINT
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nanette Solow remembers the day she stood in a row
with 10 co-workers, tucked an orange under her chin and transferred
it to the space beneath a colleague's chin.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to move the orange down the entire line in less
than five minutes. But there was a deeper purpose: to build
teamwork, enhance communication and promote problem solving.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes: to have fun in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team got so good we did it in 4 minutes and 30 seconds,''
said Solow, a travel-industry marketing executive in Manhattan.
``It was childlike and fun and fairly inoffensive.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked, too _ for about a day. But after the fun ended,
employees returned to their desks, submerged themselves in daily
chores and forgot about the great fruit exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because they knew management played by a different set of
rules than those the seminar organizers had preached, Solow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were still not getting raises, and they felt
underappreciated,'' she said. ``It didn't matter how fast we
transferred oranges. It was demoralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Solow's sentiments are being echoed by a lot of employees these
days, especially in a climate in which more and more corporations _
at least 70 percent, according to some estimates _ are relying on
external training programs to build leadership skills and
companywide bonding.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society for Training and Development
in Alexandria, Va., companies spend about $55 billion a year on
formal training. Often, they use elaborate and eccentric methods to
make their point, like paintball wars, fighter-pilot simulations or
a course at the BMW Performance Center in Spartanburg, S.C., that
features driving a car while blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, many of these programs have no practical value.
</P>
<P>
   ``With corporate training, it's often: `Let's spend the money
and hope for the best,''' said Cary Cherniss, a psychology
professor at Rutgers University and co-chairman of the Consortium
for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations, a
coalition of researchers and practitioners from business schools,
government, consulting firms and corporations. Unfortunately, he
added, ``It takes a lot of time and effort to unlearn old ways of
thinking and acting and develop new neural circuits; it's unlikely
these programs have a lasting impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoters say seminars can do some good by fostering teamwork.
``So many companies are looking at ways to bring in new energy,
they want to know how to take it to the next level,'' said Anthony
Bourke, vice president of Afterburner Seminars, a half-day seminar
in which management teams experience training and combat techniques
used by fighter pilots. Both Bourke and the company's founder,
James Murphy, author of the newly released ``Business Is Combat''
(HarperCollins), are pilots in the Air National Guard and have a
combined 30 years of sales-training experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here they're at an off-site meeting, and we set a tone that's
different from anything they've ever done before,'' Bourke said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be precisely the problem. While many programs bolster
self-esteem and promote good cheer _ it can be fun, to pelt the
boss with paint _ most occur away from the office and all the
frustrations and power struggles that go with it. As a result,
critics say, they tend to create an artificial, almost
vacation-like atmosphere that has little relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Like all recruits at Deloitte Consulting in Manhattan, Lou
DiLorenzo had to take a weeklong training program. While he had a
good time, he says, he didn't really learn much. ``What I found is
that you went to these classes to learn how to do research, say,
but there was no link to the office. It was just like being at
college and taking a class,'' he recalled. He is now on a task
force to overhaul the training program.
</P>
<P>
   Hard times can quickly expose the limitations of training
programs. In 1998, the Vandor Corp., a diversified manufacturer in
Richmond, Ind., with 100 employees, sent employees and managers to
a paintball war cum leadership training program with Leading
Concepts, a company in Louisville, Ky. Everyone raved about the
experience, but when the company found itself in a sales-and-profit
squeeze a few months later, it laid off several people.
</P>
<P>
   ``As employees witnessed team members being axed to their left
and right, they ultimately lost trust and rapport with management,
and they undermined their entire investment with us,'' said Dean
Hohl, the president of Leading Concepts.
</P>
<P>
   A Vandor spokesman, Bruce Richardson, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that lack of trust is a natural reaction to a
downsizing,'' Richardson said. But, he added, the paintball war
probably helped employees cope with the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Providers of management-training seminars acknowledge that some
programs lack substance, though they generally argue that theirs
fit into the useful category.
</P>
<P>
   ``When programs work, they pay for themselves, most within the
first five years or so,'' said Daniel Goleman, co-chairman of the
Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations
and author of ``Working with Emotional Intelligence,'' (Bantam,
1998). But, he added, ``When programs fail, they waste time and
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Lewin and Birute Regine, co-founders of Harvest
Associates, a business consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., believe
most training programs do not work because they perpetuate an
us-vs.-them mentality. Managers, they argue, are not really
interested in establishing genuine team structures, nor are they
interested in overhauling their power base. And since training
programs are imposed from the outside in, many employees resent
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organizations are dynamic, interconnected human systems, not
machines,'' said Regine, who with Lewin is the author of ``The Soul
at Work (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 2000). ``If you want an organization
that's adaptable, robust and flexible, the nexus of change is
relationships. People need a sense of community. When people feel
they're part of something they're more willing to change.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is the answer? Regine urges managers to skip the
lovefests at resorts and sit down with employees for serious
heart-to-heart talks about what makes them tick _ what they care
about, what their goals are and what their fears are. Then they
should try to motivate them the old-fashioned way _ with raises,
promotions and other positive reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are people interacting? Are managers providing
opportunities for people to connect on all levels?'' she asked.
``It's incredible the impact that has on people. You need to gauge
what is essentially human _ people's desire to participate,
contribute and be part of something greater than themselves.''

DICKSON IMPRESSIVE IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- Jason Dickson all but wrapped up a spot in the
starting rotation with his performance in the Angels' 3-2 victory
over the Oakland A's Tuesday afternoon at Tempe Diablo Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson gave up one run and six hits in six innings. His spring
ERA is 4.87, but more importantly, Dickson gave up only two runs in
11 2/3 innings in his final two starts in Arizona. He'll probably
pitch in a camp game Sunday, then make his season debut on Friday,
April 7 against the Red Sox at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say timing is everything,'' Dickson said. ``I've pitched
pretty well in my last couple of starts, and that's a pretty good
time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson, though, is not counting on anything just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Dickson said when asked if he thinks he'll
be in the rotation. ``I've done everything I wanted to do. I've
thrown the ball the way I wanted to in spring training. That's all
I can control. ... I wouldn't want to be in their (coaches') shoes
making the decisions. It can be an unbelievably tough job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson's command of his pitches Tuesday was not as good as he'd
like it to be -- he walked four -- but he showed manager Mike
Scioscia how he could pitch on a day he didn't have his good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he was quite as sharp as his last time,''
Scioscia said. ``But obviously the results were good, he did a
great job of battling. If you give up one run in six innings you
did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Dickson, Ken Hill, Kent Bottenfield and Ramon Ortiz
(barring a setback with his shoulder) are in the rotation. The
remaining spot will be either Kent Mercker or Scott Schoeneweis.
However, both could make the club if Mercker is sent to the
bullpen. Scioscia said he expects to have the rotation set today or
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels made five cuts Tuesday, reducing their roster to 27
players. Among those sent down was Brian Cooper (Glendora High,
Citrus College, USC). Cooper went into camp among those competing
for a spot in the starting rotation, but his inconsistency showed
the Angels he needs a little more ``fine tuning,'' acording to
Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to work on the consistency of his stuff,'' Scioscia
said. ``We saw sporadic parts where he was effective. But to become
a major league pitcher he needs to take it out there a little more
often than he has this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before being sent down, Cooper had a feeling it would
happen after his start Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I get sent down today, I wanted to go on a good
note,'' Cooper said Monday after giving up one run and four hits in
five innings. ``Then I'll go to triple-A coming off a good one. I
know I can pitch up here.''
</P>
<P>
   The other cuts were infielders Larry Barnes and Trent Durrington
(optioned to triple-A Edmonton) and catcher Steve Decker and
pitcher Eric Weaver (reassigned to minor league camp).
</P>
<P>
   Jarrod Washburn (strained muscle in right side) threw 30 pitches
in two innings of a simulated game Tuesday and felt good. He'll
pitch Sunday at Edison Field against Cal State Fullerton and could
be ready to join the rotation in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything's healed and I'm throwing well, I go down (to
the minors) and earn my way back,'' Washburn said. ``I'm taking
nothing for granted.''

 &HT;    Owner of Variety magazine to buy CMD Group
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The rapidly growing owner of Variety and other trade
magazines has agreed to buy CMD Group Inc. for $299.5 million, the
companies said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   CMD, formerly called Construction Market Data Group, operates
construction trade publications. It also provides national and
regional directories and other data on the industry in print and on
its Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Cahners Business Information said it will pay
cash for the privately held company, which has about 300 employees
at its headquarters in Norcross, Ga., and 1,400 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Cahners, which owns 140 Web sites and more than 100 trade
publications such as Variety, Publishers Weekly and Design News,
hopes to integrate CMD's building and construction information on
its online construction Web sites, Buildingteam.com and
HousingZone.com.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said they had already been working together
prior to the deal to produce Buildingteam.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, we see our operations out here growing,'' said
CMD spokeswoman Piritta Luoto, because the combination will help
CMD shift its products more quickly onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most of its products have some online connections,
but are mostly print, she said.
</P>
<P>
   CMD's flagship Construction Market Data product line, for
instance, consists of weekly regional print editions listing new
construction projects in various states and metropolitan markets,
with daily updates available online.
</P>
<P>
   CMD recorded $126 million in revenue last year from its print,
CD-ROM and online products. Luoto said the firm's main competitors
are a number of publications owned by McGraw-Hill Inc., which
publishes Business Week, and several small regional publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an Internet play for us,'' said Cahners spokesman Tom
Nutile. He added that Cahners has ``no immediate plans ... to move
anything out of Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the acquisition is expected to be completed in a month
to 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Cahners, with $860 million in revenues last year and 3,900
employees, has acquired nine other companies during the past year
and launched three Web sites and two magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is owned by Reed Elsevier Plc, a joint venture of
London-based Reed International Plc and Amsterdam-based Elsevier
NV.

JUSTICES CONSIDER CONSTITUTIONALITY OF HATE-CRIME STATUTES

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday grappled with the
constitutionality of a state ``hate crime'' law that allows judges
to increase prison sentences for violent offenders who acted out of
hatred for their victims' race.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices, considering a case from New Jersey, pressed
the lawyer for Charles Apprendi Jr. on why it violated the man's
constitutional rights for a judge to double his sentence under the
state law. The judge, after all, had sufficient evidence to
conclude that Apprendi fired shots into the home of black neighbors
because he didn't want people of their race to live in his
neighborhood, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court was just as inquisitive of the New Jersey
prosecutor, asking her how the state could justify allowing a judge
to add 10 years to a prison sentence even though a jury had not
decided that Apprendi acted out of racial hatred. Several justices
said that perhaps the Constitution required that a jury, not a
judge, decide whether a crime was committed due to bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong argument before the court marked the first time the
justices have considered the constitutionality of hate-crime
statutes. Many states enacted these laws following the high-profile
killings two years ago of James Byrd Jr., a black man in Jasper,
Texas, and of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in
Laramie, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas has no law calling for enhanced penalties for people who
kill out of racial hatred. Gov. George W. Bush vetoed a hate-crime
bill last year, despite intense lobbying from Byrd's family, whose
relative was beaten, tied to the back of a pickup and dragged to
his death June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Three men were convicted last year of killing Byrd. Two of them,
John William ``Bill'' King and Russell Brewer, have been sentenced
to death and the third, Shawn Berry, was sentenced to life in
prison. Bush has cited these convictions and sentences as evidence
that Texas does not need a special hate-crime law.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the case before the justices, Apprendi pleaded guilty to
possessing a firearm for an unlawful purpose in connection with the
firing of several rounds into the home of Michael and Mattie
Fowlkes and their three children. The crime carries a penalty of
between five and 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But Cumberland County, N.J., Judge Rushton Ridgway, citing the
state's hate-crime statute, raised the punishment to up to 20 years
in prison after concluding that Apprendi fired his weapon out of
racial bigotry. The Fowlkes were the only black family in
Apprendi's white neighborhood of Vineland, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi appealed the sentence, arguing that the issue of
whether he acted out of racial hatred is a factual question that a
jury must decide beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge, by making
that factual finding based only on a preponderance of evidence,
denied Apprendi his constitutional 6th Amendment right to a fair
trial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the New Jersey Supreme Court rejected that argument, he
appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

   OPEC-COSTS (Dallas) _ Though surging fuel prices and rising
costs for chemicals, plastics, resins and other products have
driven up expenses for many businesses, not all industries or
companies have been affected equally. And those that have suffered
have not, by and large, passed along the higher costs, in part
because global competition and a relatively strong dollar have made
it unwise to raise prices. Even inflation hawks, including Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, have noted that consumers
have generally been spared, outside of direct expenses for gasoline
and home heating oil. By Richard A. Oppel Jr.

 &HT;    Former Israeli leader denies allegations of corruption
 &HT;    By Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerusalem _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
defiantly said Tuesday he was the victim of a ``hunt'' and denied
police allegations of corruption while in office.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, in an interview on Israeli Television, came after
Israeli police recommended that prosecutors file corruption charges
against him and his wife, Sara.
</P>
<P>
   They are accused of trying to keep up to 700 gifts they received
while Netanyahu was in office _ including a gold letter opener from
Vice President Al Gore _ and accepting work from a contractor who
expected political favors. Police have been investigating the
couple _ and have held long questioning sessions with each _ for
seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't define this as though they are after me, I would
define it as a hunt,'' Netanyahu said during the 50-minute
interview, in which he often sounded sarcastic and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these allegations have no basis at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he lost a bid for re-election last year and then dropped
out of politics, Netanyahu has been urged recently to attempt a
comeback, either for his Likud Party or a new party. His three
years in office were marked by a combative style and reluctance to
carry out peace agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV interview, Netanyahu said the police investigation
could preclude another political bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They, in essence, are neutralizing me politically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on whether to charge Netanyahu lies with Attorney
General Elyakim Rubinstein, who in the past declined to charge
Netanyahu after police allegations of preferential hiring for a
Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   Police recommend that Netanyahu be charged with accepting a
bribe, breach of trust by a public official, obstruction of justice
and attempted fraud. Police said Sara Netanyahu should be charged
with theft and attempted fraud. Police also recommended charges
against two Netanyahu aides.
</P>
<P>
   The police recommendation against Netanyahu is the latest in a
wave of scandals involving Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his aides are facing a police
probe into his campaign fund-raising. President Ezer Weizman is
being investigated to see whether he accepted more than $400,000 in
gifts from a French millionaire since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Rubinstein opened an investigation of the spiritual
leader of the large Shas Party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, because he
compared a political opponent to ``Satan'' and a biblical figure
who set out to eliminate the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Such language can be considered incitement to violence and has
been closely scrutinized since the assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption scandals, especially, are seen as a sign of the
growing influence of Israeli prosecutors in a still young country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standards have risen. The things that were possible in the
past and would have gone unnoticed are not possible now,'' said Uri
Dromi, publications director for the Israel Democracy Institute.
``The public is not tolerating it as it did before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netanyahu inquiry began shortly after the elections, when a
contractor submitted a bill to the prime minister's office. Police
believe the contractor performed $50,000 worth of work with the
understanding that Netanyahu would repay him with political favors.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor has since become a witness for the prosecution.
Police accuse Netanyahu of trying to get the contractor to lie in
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Police searched the Netanyahus' home and properties, and
reportedly found gifts with the inscriptions removed and gifts that
had been re-packaged. Israel Radio reported that the gifts were
worth more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he was allowed to take gifts for the office he is
provided by the government as a former prime minister.

<P>
   When I was 10, my sister Sally died in a car crash. She was 16.
She was the third in line of us five kids; I was the fourth. She
had taught me to read when I was 4.
</P>
<P>
   After this happened, I had this notion that I had to fill up my
life with as many experiences as possible because every day is a
gift that can be snatched away from you at any point. I've done
rock climbing, mountaineering, climbed glaciers. I've biked from
one end of Britain to the other. I graduated from MIT, and I've
always worked.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 9, I was doing yard work for my neighbors. I made up
little 3-by-5 cards that said ``The Handy Kid'' and handed them
out. I worked in a gas station on Saturdays from the time I was 14.
I teamed up with one of the guys I worked with at the station and
started a cleaning service, doing parking lots and doctors' offices
at night.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 22, I spent a summer in the south of France working
as a bartender for $4 an hour in a town called St. Paul de Vence. I
worked at the Cafe de la Place, which was owned by Yves Montand and
Simone Signoret. I had had a French girlfriend, so I was fluent _
at least fluent enough to be a bartender.
</P>
<P>
   In the mornings, I'd show up for work and squeeze about three
cases of oranges. They were Israeli oranges. Then, one day, I
noticed the oranges were from South Africa. There was a boycott of
South African products going on to protest apartheid. I went to the
boss and asked if someone else could do the oranges. ``These are
oranges,'' she said. ``Who cares where they're from? Either squeeze
them or leave.'' So I quit.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the writer James Baldwin was one of the
patrons of the bar, and when he heard what happened, he invited me
out to his 17th-century farmhouse. I got to be buddies with him. We
spent many whiskey-soaked evenings talking about politics.
</P>
<P>
   I started my first business, a Web design company called I/O
360, at age 36. I had been a manager at Reuters, and people who
reported to me there thought they had to laugh at my jokes.
Managing a bunch of 20-somethings in a start-up was completely
different.
</P>
<P>
   Our first ``office'' was a summer sublet near N.Y.U. that we
rented from a Buddhist nun who left to do a film on the Dalai Lama
for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   We would work in the front room, and my three partners,
including two of my wife's cousins, Nam and Gong, would sleep in
the back rooms. I had this romantic notion of what it would be like
to be my own boss. I didn't know it meant all this work and no pay.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months later, we hit rock bottom. We were constantly
trying to find new customers. Fortunately, my wife, Wonda, was
supporting our family on her income as an immigration lawyer. But
the others were living like students, and realizing their peers who
were employees of big companies were making more. They were losing
the will to go on.
</P>
<P>
   Without telling me, my wife talked to her parents, who moved
here from China. Her mother called her sister, Aunt Grace, who is
Nam and Gong's mother. Aunt Grace called her sons up and read them
the riot act: ``Do what Bob says and work harder.'' These guys have
shaved heads and tattoos. But they really do respect their parents.
After that, things went fine.
</P>
<P>
   We sold the company in August 1998, and all became
multimillionaires. &QL;

PHILLIPS DOES SOME DEFENDING   ON FLUTIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bills coach Wade Phillips does not expect any problems from
quarterback Doug Flutie when the two next meet.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie has been critical of Phillips and the Buffalo
organization for benching him before the playoffs, and for
releasing some veteran stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read what Doug said, but I'm not worried about it,'' said
Phillips. ``Doug is a competitor. He wants to do well. He wants to
win. I don't have problems with guys like that. I know he said some
things and sometimes something else he said might have been left
out or changed around a little. I know when Doug comes back to the
team he's going to play hard like he always does.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said Rob Johnson has the slight edge at QB entering
training camp, ``but I'm not naming him the starter,'' the coach
said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips surprised the football world when he benched Flutie for
the Bills' playoff game against the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob played the best game of the year we had (from a QB)
against Indianapolis in the final game of the season. After seeing
that performance, I felt he was the better man at that time, and
could do more for us in the playoffs. Doug had been doing a good
job for us, but teams were starting to figure him out and were
making it hard for us to move the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it was the right decision, even if we lost. We
outplayed Tennessee and should have won. We just got some bad
breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips hinted he might use both Johnson and Flutie at various
times. ``With Doug's unique ability to do some things that Rob
can't do, there might be games, or times in games, when we can use
that ability to our advantage. That's something we are talking
about right now.''

   Colts have horses
</P>
<P>
   In a poll of the AFC East coaches, the Indianapolis Colts were
the overwhelming favorite to win the division. Bill Belichick of
the Patriots, Dave Wannstedt of the Dolphins, Al Groh of the Jets,
and Phillips made Colts the team to beat. Indianapolis coach Jim
Mora said Buffalo was the team he thought would win. ``At the end
of the regular season, when we played them in Buffalo, I thought
they were the best team in the AFC,'' said Mora. ``But I didn't
realize how good Tennessee was until they beat us in the playoffs.
Buffalo, to me, will be as strong as any team in the AFC.''
Belichick on Indianapolis: ``They've got the same team they had a
year ago, and just through experience they should be better.You
really can't stop them. You just try to slow them down and make
them work for everything they get.'' . . . Groh on Indy: ``To start
with, they've got the quarterback (Peyton Manning). After winning
it last year, they are going to be even more mature as a team this
year. This could be the start of a little bit of a run for them.
The pieces are in place.'' . . . Wannstedt on the Colts: ``They won
it last year, and they should be even better this year. But we are
going to be the surprise team. We've got all our players back
except the quarterback (Dan Marino). I still think our defense can
be outstanding, and that should keep us in every game.'' . . .
Phillips said of the Colts: ``Indianapolis is the team to beat, and
I think we have as good a chance as anyone. We felt like if we beat
Tennessee in that playoff game we could have taken it all the way
last year. We're going to be just as good this year.''

   Replay with twist
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote on instant replay could have an interesting
twist. The last proposal the owners were discussing is one that
would bring replay back for one more year. If it is voted in for
the 2000 season, a year from now, at the annual league meeting, a
vote would be held to install it permanently. Since replay first
came to the league, it always has been voted on one year at a time.
Replay is expected to pass easily Wednesday, but next year will be
the real test.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coaches cornered
</P>
<P>
   The owners might vote on a proposal Wednesday that is sure to
drive the assistant coaches in the league crazy. ``If they go ahead
and do this, it will be horrible,'' said Larry Kennan, head of the
NFL Coaches Association. ``It's (an attempt) at keeping us in
bondage, and trying to keep the coaches' salaries down.'' What is
being discussed is a motion that would eliminate all coaching
titles, and prevent any assistant from going to another team unless
it is to be a head coach. In other words, an assistant who coached
only a position could not leave to be an offensive coordinator.
``This is an attempt,'' said one GM at the meetings, ``to keep the
coaches on the clubs who don't want to spend money from jumping to
the clubs who will spend.''

HOW A WRITER KEPT SECRET OF DIANA BOOK

(DW) 
 By MEG McCONAHEY   The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. _ A week after the sole survivor of the crash that
killed Princess Diana met with the world press in New York to
promote his new book, ``The Bodyguard's Story,'' Moira Johnston sat
in her living room overlooking a finger of the Napa River,
marveling at the secret she skillfully kept for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   The prize-winning investigative journalist whose exhaustive
reporting has explored repressed memory and taken on powerful
corporations, was the writer to whom Trevor Rees-Jones broke his 2
1/2-year silence about the events leading up to the fatal crackup
in a Paris tunnel. Reporters around the world had salivated for the
journalistic coup and tabloids had offered seven figures to buy the
exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of reporting and writing Jones' story, Johnston
found herself a central player in a dramatic, and finely crafted
plan to protect the book from Internet hackers and pre-emptive
legal attacks by Mohammed Fayed. The Egyptian business tycoon's
son, Dodi, died in the Paris crash that also killed driver Henri
Paul and crushed Jones' face beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Since the tragedy, Fayed has waged a fierce public relations
campaign to convince the world that Dodi and Diana were engaged and
that the crash was arranged to keep the mother of a future British
King from marrying an Arab. He accused Rees-Jones of being part of
the cover-up. Fayed failed earlier this month to win a count
injunction to stop a London newspaper from serializing the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so fearful of leaks,'' said Johnson, who was answering
a raft of lawyers and editors' questions up until three weeks
before publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fearful now. But I'm fearful for Trevor and for the
publishing house that lawsuits could still come. It doesn't matter
that that's what you're insured for. You can be terribly disrupted
and hurt by lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bodyguard's Story,'' Johnston believes, undermines many of
Fayed's claims, chief among them that Fayed had heard Diana's last
words and that Diana and Dodi had picked out an engagement ring
while cruising the Mediterranean. Rees-Jones says the couple did
not visit the jewelry store when they were reported to have picked
out a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also relates how Dodi had engaged in a pattern of erratic
disregard for security, often impatiently ordering drivers to step
on it in heavy traffic, repeatedly failing to tell his bodyguards
of his plans and insisting that Paul _ later found to be legally
drunk _ act as substitute driver for the couple. Rees-Jones
overrode Dodi's insistence that he and Diana drive in the Mercedes
alone while the bodyguards took off separately in a decoy car.
</P>
<P>
   Rees-Jones said Fayed repeatedly turned down his pleas for more
security during the weeks of the short summer romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted the world to know the lovers were out there,''
Johnston said. However, Rees-Jones still can't remember anything
directly before or after the accident, leaving critical questions
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Fayed has called the book ``rubbish'' and threatened to sue his
son's former bodyguard, who has steel plates in his head and is
only now digging out of debt with book proceeds and a new security
job.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the book is out and poised to debut Sunday on the
New York Times best-seller list, Johnston is free to spill her own
secret. She had longtime friends and neighbors guessing for months
about the cloaked project that took her to England and kept her
holed up in a downtown Napa office for 12 hours a day as she
frantically tried to meet the most demanding deadline of a long
career, all the while nervously looking over her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is that those who didn't want the book published would
find me in Napa, break in and steal it, and I would wake up one
morning and find it gone,'' the British Columbia-born Johnston said
in a lyrical Canadian accent. She used two tape recorders for every
interview and made back-up files that she kept at home and the
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think my best cover was this quiet rural town where I'm
trusted and liked. I was living such a normal life going off for my
little latte every morning, such a simple, humble ritual, it
certainly wouldn't occur to anyone here to betray me and call
anybody. This was probably as secure a cover as I could find.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the good-natured speculation that she was
working with everyone from controversial British author Salman
Rushdie to British au pair Louise Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston was an unlikely recruit to do a book that smacked of
celebrity journalism. She was the author of six respected
investigatory books, including the ``The Last Nine Minutes'' about
a 1974 Paris plane crash and most recently ``Spectral Evidence,''
exploring truth and repressed memory.
</P>
<P>
   Her longtime agent Michael Carlisle, who arranged the
assignment, thought Johnston would be ideal for the book, with her
expertise in memory issues and in sorting out complex legal cases.
She also had a British background. Her father, like Rees-Jones, had
served in the British military and was raised not far from the
bodyguard's small town of Oswestry.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone associated with the book, Johnston had to sign a
confidentiality agreement even before Carlisle would disclose the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   She worried at first about how others would perceive her latest
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do tabloid. I don't do celebrity. I don't do,
as-told-to. I'm my own author. And I don't do Diana books. What
could draw me to this?''
</P>
<P>
   But after meeting with Trevor and his mother and stepfather,
Jill and Ernie Rees-Jones, a month later, she was convinced there
was a more important, human story to be told.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really two books. The one I was drawn to is this
extraordinary story of this ordinary family under extraordinary
pressures surviving and holding on to their souls,'' she said.
``There's no book in the world I would write unless I felt it was
worth telling, and that it would contribute some insight into the
human condition and history's record.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Rees-Jones' had resisted offers to sell their
story. During the final push to polish the manuscript, the stoic,
32-year-old former paratrooper ruefully observed how he could have
accepted $1 million _ more than he'll likely make in book royalties
_ from the National Enquirer for only a half day's work. But the
former bodyguard eventually decided he needed to regain his
credibility after Fayed publicly blamed him for the crash.

NAPA, Calif.: the crash.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnston decided to write in the third person, going beyond
Rees-Jones to gain perspective of his story while he was
incapacitated in the hospital. To reduce the risk of leaks, she and
Carlisle kept her sources to only six beyond Trevor: his parents,
his fellow bodyguard Kez Wingfield and three lawyers through whom
she gained information from the official crash investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston devised an elaborate story to throw off townsfolk in
Oswestry during the month she spent toiling in a small rental
cottage. She and her sister, Sheilagh Simpson of Vancouver, British
Columbia, who assisted in transcribing 100 hours of tape, posed as
ordinary American tourists doing genealogical research.
</P>
<P>
   She took cabs to town, taking different routes and asking to be
dropped off several blocks from Trevor's alley. She kept a map and
guidebooks at hand to throw over her work whenever the cleaning
lady or repairmen dropped by. During the writing of the book, the
sisters kept e-mail cryptic.

 &HT;    Young owner of ISS gives $15 million to would-be alma mater
Georgia Tech
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Young tech entrepreneur Christopher Klaus has given
$15 million to a university where he has yet to earn a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The donation, the fifth-largest ever to Georgia Tech, will be
used _ pending approval by the Board of Regents _ to help build an
advanced computing complex that will be named for Klaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a big believer in education as a driver in
helping the economy and helping society as a whole,'' Klaus said,
interviewed a few hours before teaching a class in the Georgia Tech
College of Computing. ``The point of living isn't to see how much
money you can make. The point is to do something to improve
peoples' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Klaus said the natural beneficiary for his charity is Georgia
Tech, the school that taught him how to be an engineer, the place
where he teaches part-time _ for free _ despite having no degree.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Georgia Tech wouldn't have been willing to pass him the
parchment. It's just that in the mid-1990s, Klaus departed academia
to give more attention to the startup company he had founded in his
dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Internet Security Systems stock is worth $5.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which develops and sells software aimed at
protecting networks from intruders, had revenues last year of $116
million and lists among its customers 21 of the 25 largest U.S.
commercial banks, many of the largest telecommunications companies
and several dozen government agencies, including the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus hired Tom Noonan as chief executive to handle daily
operations and made himself his company's chief technology officer,
symbolically serving as guru, a back-lab whiz and grand old man of
a new industry.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus is 26 years old.
</P>
<P>
   While ISS has become a leading Internet security company,
success is not the work of one person _ or even one company, he
said. ``We have been fortunate to live in this time and age, and we
should do something to give back.''
</P>
<P>
   And what young Klaus has given is one of the largest donations
in Georgia Tech's history. Previous top-tier donations _ more than
$25 million from Lettie Pate Evans and similar amounts from George
W. and Irene K. Woodruff and Mrs. Lee Candler _ came largely in
deferred gifts from their estates, said Georgia Tech spokeswoman
Elizabeth Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Thomas E. DuPree Jr. has pledged more than $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Klaus' donation, ``the largest single outright
gift while living that Georgia Tech has ever received,'' Campbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   His beneficence will not leave Klaus broke.
</P>
<P>
   He has sold thousands of shares in ISS, presumably to diversify
his portfolio. But his remaining stake in the company he started is
presently worth about $700 million _ even after the stock took a
nasty tumble Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find him to be thoughtful, responsible and very
respectful,'' said Peter Freeman, Georgia Tech dean of computing.
``Typically, people who don't get degrees carry a chip on their
shoulder. Chris is not like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Klaus' contribution pushes the university past the $500 million
mark in its current campaign to raise cash for improvements.
Included in that campaign is a new complex for the college of
computing, which currently serves 1,300 undergraduates, 275
graduate students and more than 50 members of the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative plans call for a $50 million building, with design to
start later this year and construction beginning in 2001, said
Freeman, whose own position is endowed by John P. Imlay, an
entrepreneur of an earlier tech generation.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech alumni _ with or without degrees _ have been
especially generous, Freeman said: The university has received 75
gifts of $1 million or more in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Klaus has broken new ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sets a very interesting mark, and my hope is that it will
trigger some additional contributions,'' Freeman said. ``I hope it
sets an example to other entrepreneurs, not just in Georgia, to
show that they can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the surge of technology at the tail end of the 20th
century has meant the minting of many new millionaires _ and
billionaires. However, only a relative few have shifted into
heavy-duty philanthropy _ at least partly because the new wealth is
so fresh that many of them are still immersed in working the long
hours associated with amassing their fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Some have retired early, others have found the free-time urge to
write big checks.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Philipp, president of the Community Foundation for
Greater Atlanta, said the typical donor used to be a man older than
65, someone thinking about a legacy to be left behind. Klaus
represents a new wave, she said. ``I really believe that
entrepreneurs in high-tech are going to dominate philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who count their money in seven, eight and nine
figures, giving it away has become news _ maybe even trendy.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner, CNN founder and Time Warner vice chairman, pledged
$1 billion to the United Nations and has begun writing $100 million
checks annually.
</P>
<P>
   James Clark, founder of Netscape and Healtheon, gave $150
million last year to Stanford University to build a biomedical
engineering center.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan Sahin, founder of Kenan Systems, gave $100 million to MIT
after he sold his company to Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, last year
gave away an estimated $2.4 billion _ still a fraction of their
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta endeavors to link
causes to contributors, who _ unlike Klaus _ might not have a
specific beneficiary in mind. For instance, she has worked with
Bert Ellis, founder of IXL Corp., and his wife, who have said they
want to give away 90 percent of their wealth in their lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis last year gave Georgia Tech's DuPree School of Management
an initial endowment of $1 million to fund a center for e-commerce
and promised to raise an additional $4 million for the school over
five years. In 1996, Parker H. Petit, founder of the Healthdyne
companies, donated $5 million to Georgia Tech to found a center for
bioengineering and bioscience.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ellis, many donors come from the new-monied class of
technology entrepreneurs, many of them far younger than previous
generations of wealthy donors. The money-come-latelys commonly look
for nontraditional routes of contribution, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Klaus has chosen a conservative means of giving, the kind of
name-on-the-building project that Andrew Carnegie might have
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is really unlike the guys I have been running into,''
Philipp said. ``It will be interesting to see how much goes to
traditional charities and how much goes to completely new ideas.''

BUSH PROPOSES $5 BILLION PLAN TO FIGHT CHILD ILLITERACY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSET, N.J. _ Once again mooring traditionally Democratic
issues to his agenda, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas proposed a $5
billion program on Tuesday to address what he termed a national
literacy crisis among children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the 5-year program would provide grants to states to
test reading in kindergarten and first grade, train teachers and
provide tutoring. He soberly contrasted the nation's economic
success with its educational failings, and declared that he would
bring the same improvements in reading on the national level that
he said he had achieved in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He said every child should know how to read by third grade,
vowing that states that failed to increase student performance
would lose federal money. ``There is nothing more fundamental than
teaching our children how to read,'' Bush said in a speech Tuesday
afternoon in Reston, Va., the first in a series of events this week
intended to spotlight his commitment to improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ``America must confront a national emergency,'' he said. ``Too
many of our children cannot read. In the highest poverty schools _
I want you to hear this statistic _ in the highest poverty schools
in America, 68 percent of fourth-graders could not read at a basic
level in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan was quickly dismissed by aides to the Democratic
contender, Vice President Al Gore. They sought to shift attention
to Bush's tax cut proposal, saying that it would leave no money for
new education initiatives. Gore has called for $115 billion in new
federal financing for education over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush unveiled his plan as the Republican Party continued to
close ranks around him, with Steve Forbes endorsing him at a local
Republican event Tuesday night here in New Jersey, Forbes' home
state. In the primaries, Forbes, a millionaire publisher, had
pounded away at Bush as a weak-kneed conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief rival in the primary, Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
has resisted an endorsement, but Bush called McCain on Tuesday in
an apparent bid to salve some of the lingering wounds. Bush said he
hoped that the two would meet soon, and described the conversation
as amiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I both understand that the past is the past and it's
time to move forward,'' Bush told reporters aboard his campaign
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech offered striking evidence of how he is returning
to what was his original strategy _ positioning himself as a
soft-edged, centrist Republican _ after veering to the right in the
primary to fend off McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a coalition of Asian-American groups at the
headquarters of the Student Loan Marketing Association, the
federally sponsored provider of student loans, he proclaimed that
the federal government had to redouble its efforts to confront the
educational plight of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not tolerate illiteracy amongst the disadvantaged
students in the great country called America,'' he said. ``I know
this is something a little new. Others have proposed throwing money
at the problem. But they have proposed resources without reform.
That approach has no history of results, and really no prospect of
success. Under my plan new resources will be an instrument of
reform, not another investment in failure.''
</P>
<P>
   In an allusion to the Kerner Commission's description of racial
division, Bush said: ``More and more we are divided into two
nations: one that reads and one that can't. And therefore one that
dreams and one that doesn't. Reading is the basis for all learning,
and it must be the foundations for all other education.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush is not abandoning his belief that the federal
government should not meddle in what is rightly a state and local
issue. Tuesday evening, appearing at a fund-raiser in Parsippany
with Gov. Christie Whitman, he spiritedly declared, as he often did
during the primaries, that he did not want to be the ``federal
superintendent of schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are looking at the wrong man if you want me to be the
national principal,'' he said. ``I believe in local control of
schools. The best education policy is that which bubbles up from
the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech in Virginia, Bush hewed a middle path, criticizing
Gore for seeking to spend large sums without demanding
accountability, and chiding some congressional Republicans for
saying that the federal Department of Education should be
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He praised governors and mayors for their education reforms,
pointedly citing Democrats before Republicans. He even approvingly
referred to an anecdote about the importance of high standards told
by Albert Shanker, the late president of the American Federation of
Teachers, a bete noire of many Republican politicians, who say the
teachers unions are obstacles to change.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Bush sought a conciliatory tone, barely mentioning Gore in
the speech, the Gore campaign showed no such reticence. Douglas
Hattaway, a campaign spokesman, said the Bush plan would be
ineffective, and contended that the Clinton administration had
already established a successful national program to improve
reading.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway also renewed the Gore campaign's criticism of Bush's
tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't have the money to pay for a new initiative like this
without dipping into the Social Security surplus or going back to
deficit spending,'' Hattaway said. ``He has to make a choice and he
hasn't said how he is going to pay. That is a very substantive
issue.''

PROSPECTS FOR U.N. PEACEKEEPING MISSION IN CONGO QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (corrects earlier misidentifications of Masire and Miyet)  
 (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The chances that a U.N. peacekeeping mission
can actually be deployed in Congo were not looking good Tuesday as
the Security Council heard a briefing from the head of its
peacekeeping department, who recently visited the region.
</P>
<P>
   Council members, meeting in a closed-door session, were told
that factions were rearming, despite promises on all sides to end a
civil war and abide by a peace agreement reached last July.
</P>
<P>
   An African mediator, Sir Ketumile Masire of Botswana, briefed
council members Tuesday; he left Congo last week after being
blocked from traveling within the country.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary-General Bernard Miyet, the head of the
peacekeeping department, also informed the council that the Congo
government of Laurent Kabila had told him that the United Nations
would have to sign an accord covering its activities that would
impose unacceptable restrictions on the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has encountered similar problems with Kabila
in the past. For more than a year, he blocked investigations into
accusations of massacres of Hutu refugees from Rwanda and of
Congolese reported to have taken place during Kabila's rise to
power in 1996-1997. More recently, he prevented U.N. liaison
officers from moving around the country to begin preparing for a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Security Council decided to authorize a force
of about 1,000 soldiers and a 4,000-member support staff to back up
500 military observers who were assigned last fall to help put the
cease-fire into effect.
</P>
<P>
   But the council stated at the time that the force would not be
deployed until there was peace on the ground and adequate
assurances that all international personnel would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said Tuesday it did not appear that the situation was
even close to meeting those requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen African nations and several rebel groups are
involved in the Congo war. Miyet met with most of the protagonists
on his trip, among them Kabila and President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe, who strongly supports Kabila. Miyet also held talks with
leaders in Namibia, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda, once allies of Kabila, are now his enemies.
He accuses them of invading Congo and creating a rebellion that
would otherwise barely exist.
</P>
<P>
   In January, nearly all the national leaders engaged in the Congo
war came to New York for council meetings arranged by Richard C.
Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who was
council president for the month. The leaders, while revealing deep
splits and distrusts, nevertheless pledged to support the peace
accord. Diplomats and officials almost immediately began to
question those assurances.

   TALLAHASSEE _ Florida's cruise industry got a lesson in
Tallahassee hardball Tuesday as a six-figure publicity campaign to
defeat a baseball stadium tax was struck out by a single lobbyist's
phone call.
</P>
<P>
   The industry seemed on the verge of taking an early lead by
seeing the $4-per-day passenger tax stall in its first committee
for yet another week. Then Aventura lobbyist Ron Book got to work.
</P>
<P>
   Strike one: Book told his aide to call a powerful ally, Senate
Majority Leader Jack Latvala.
</P>
<P>
   Strike two: Latvala returned to the committee room and pulled
aside chairman Sen. Lisa Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   Strike three: Carlton, just minutes after announcing she would
postpone a vote on the idea until next week, told the packed room
that the committee would in fact vote before meeting's end.
</P>
<P>
   A one-week delay could have been a fatal blow to Florida Marlins
owner John Henry's attempt to make cruise ship passengers from the
Port of Miami pay for most of a new $400 million stadium. The
proposal must clear three committees in the Senate and an unknown
number in the House before the chambers can vote.
</P>
<P>
   So when Carlton, R-Sarasota, told the assembled lobbyists and
750 cruise ship workers flown in for the day that she intended only
to hear public testimony on the matter Tuesday and take the vote
next week, the cruise industry seemed to have won a minor victory _
only to see it evaporate minutes later when she reversed herself
and cut off public comments to hold the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The measure to allow Miami-Dade voters to decide on the tax in a
referendum cleared the committee 7-1. Cruise industry lobbyists
felt stung that their leader _ Celebrity Cruise President Richard
Sasso _ wasn't given time to address committee members before the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a $4 pina colada. It's a $40 million tax on
tourism,'' Sasso said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Book acknowledged having an aide call Latvala _ who was not on
the committee and therefore couldn't vote _ but only to let him
know that the bill was being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Latvala denied Book had called him and denied telling Carlton to
push ahead with the vote. Carlton also denied that Latvala had
anything to do with her decision, which she said was based on her
assessment that controversy on the issue had been resolved _ at
least within her committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins donated $111,795 to the state Republican Party
between May 27 and Dec. 10 last year. On the national level, Henry
has been active in Democratic fund-raising. Last year, he hosted
Bill Clinton at his Boca Raton home for an event that was expected
to raise $500,000 for the Democratic Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins officials called the questions about political
maneuvering a distraction from their primary message _ that voters
deserve the opportunity to decide whether to use tax money for a
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little concerned after 22 years (in public office) when
people are afraid to let the voters decide on an issue,'' said Sen.
Ron Silver, D-North Miami Beach, the bill's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise industry lobbyist Curt Kiser, himself a former senator,
said the proposal might have a constitutional problem: taxing a
ship based on how long it stays out of port, even though most of
that time is spent in international waters.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials from five cruise lines chartered three planes
and filled them with 750 employees who got the day off to carry
placards around the Capitol. A calypso band played Ray Parker Jr.'s
hit Ghostbusters. The employees said they believed jobs were on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise tax opponents _ who include all Miami-Dade commissioners
_ lost the effort of a key ally when senators added an amendment to
the bill that would exclude Broward County from potentially being
included in the tax. The bill had been worded to allow a similar
tax in Broward in the next three years if cruise traffic there
reaches 1.8 million passengers a year, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   That cleared the way for committee member Steve Geller,
D-Hallendale, to add his tentative support. Geller said with
Broward out, he was considering the tax a Miami-Dade issue and
would vote according to a poll he took of the seven Dade senators.
Most observers, however, see the cruise tax as somewhat of a
longshot.
</P>
<P>
   Should it pass and become law, generally anti-tax Republican
leaders will have to explain this sentiment, contained in the text
of the Senate bill: ``Every passenger embarking on a multi-day
cruise initiating its voyage from a major cruise ship port ... is
exercising a taxable privilege under this act.''
</P>
<P>
   Latvala, R-Palm Harbor, said he had no problem with that
language, nor with the idea of taxing cruise ship passengers _
rather than baseball ticket buyers _ to build a baseball stadium.
He said cruise ships generally do not pay federal income tax,
social security tax, state sales tax, or any number of other taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're overburdened with taxes,'' Latvala said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they ought to contribute to the community.''

 &HT;    Florida's Lotto at $80 million
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday night Jamie Orlowitz's dinner guests inexplicably threw
away their fortune cookie slips, somehow missing the winning
lottery numbers printed plainly on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight Orlowitz figures they will be sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning Orlowitz fished those slips out of the trash,
drove from Boca Raton to the Delray News and Tobacco Center on East
Atlantic Avenue and ordered up tickets for tonight's $80 million
Florida Lotto drawing _ tickets bearing those numbers hidden under
the noodles from the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will win,'' she said, noting that she often buys tickets at
the newsstand because of a positive ``energy'' in the small room
packed with newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the stars,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not. But one thing is clear: Orlowitz isn't the
only one seeing stars over tonight's 11 p.m. lottery drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery jackpot has now rolled over eight times. Sales of
tickets prior to Saturday's failed drawing peaked at 7 p.m. that
day when frenzied purchasers statewide bought tickets at a rate of
27,000 per minute, according to Florida Lottery calculations.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sixth highest jackpot in the 12-year history of the
state lottery. It is the highest jackpot currently on the table
among 40 state or multi-state games, lottery spokesman Roger
Sockman said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the line for tickets formed early Tuesday at a
Publix in Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say it's an investment,'' said accountant
Charles Dunagin, who stood there in his business suit buying $25
worth of tickets. ``And a pretty good return if it pays off. But
I'm really here because it reached my threshold of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's drawing apparently holds enough drama to capture the
attention of the very well-heeled. Richard Block of Palm Beach
Gardens picked up a slew of lottery tickets for a friend at the
Publix on Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't give you his name, but he's worth many millions,''
Block said.

EDITORIAL: OPENING THE OIL SPIGOT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 29:
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to increase its oil production by 1.5 million barrels a
day is welcome and may, over time, lead to lower American gasoline
prices. But the action, which restores just over a third of
production cut by the OPEC cartel over the past two years, should
not be seen as a definitive answer to the recent sharp rise in oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Those prices reached a peak of $34 a barrel in early March, more
than three times what they had been a year earlier. But those 1999
prices were artificially depressed _ lower, once inflation is
accounted for, than at any time since the 1970s. A rebound to more
realistic levels was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's power is not what it once was. Its 11 member countries
now account for less than 40 percent of world oil production, down
from more than 50 percent in 1974. Internal discipline is weak,
with many countries cheating on their production quotas to earn
extra revenue. Even before the OPEC meeting, prices had dropped by
almost 20 percent, to about $28 a barrel. Raising production should
bring further price declines.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's OPEC decision came in response to strong American
pressure. The decision was not unanimous, with Iran declining to go
along. But most other OPEC countries preferred not to risk being
cast as villains in American political debate if oil prices remain
high. Many of these countries also recognize that their own
self-interest calls for moderation to protect the economies of
major oil-consuming nations.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had sought a larger production boost, of at least two
million barrels a day. But the Vienna decision is constructive and
will take considerable pressure off world oil prices, which may now
stabilize around $25 a barrel. Gasoline prices, which reflect low
inventories as well as expensive oil, will probably stay high for a
few more months. But their inflationary impact on the American
economy is likely to be relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   After the oil shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s, the United
States and other industrial countries undertook significant energy
conservation measures, like raising automobile fuel economy
standards. They also intensified efforts to discover and exploit
new energy sources, including non-OPEC oil. With oil prices as low
as they have been in recent years, conservation measures have
lagged and the search for new supplies has slowed. By reviving
these efforts, America can gain some protection against future oil
price increases. &QL;

ROBA, CHEBET TO DEFEND BOSTON MARATHON TITLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Defending champions Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia and Joseph Chebet of
Kenya will return to defend their titles in Boston Marathon 2000,
leading a list of 34 elite athletes announced Tuesday by sponsor
John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 18,000 others are expected for the 104th running of
the event. The field is the second largest in Boston history,
trailing only the race's 100th anniversary in 1996. That year
featured almost 38,000 runners.
</P>
<P>
   For Roba, the trek from Hopkinton to Boylston Street will be a
race toward history, as the 26-year-old from Addis Ababa will seek
to do what no runner _ not Bill Rodgers, Clarence DeMar, Cosmas
Ndeti nor Uta Pippig _ has been able to do: win the Boston Marathon
four consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wetmore, whose Boston-based Global Athletics &AMP; Marketing
represents Roba, spoke with her at the Kyoto City Half Marathon
earlier this month (which she won handily, in 1 hour 10 minutes 16
seconds) and said she understands that 2000 could be a very big
year for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives her the chance to do two things no one has ever done
before,'' said Wetmore, ``win four straight Boston Marathons and
two Olympic gold medals.'' Roba, then a virtual unknown, won the
1996 Olympic marathon before coming to Boston the next spring to
begin her string of victories here.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, DeMar, Ndeti, and Pippig all failed in their attempts
to win four straight in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Chebet was named the No. 1 marathon runner in the world last
year by Track &AMP; Field News after winning Boston and New York, only
the third man after Rodgers and Alberto Salazar to win both
classics in the same year. In his seven career marathons since he
debuted at the distance in 1996, the remarkably consistent
29-year-old never has finished lower than second, winning four.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back to challenge Chebet will be Moses Tanui, the
two-time Boston winner (1996 and 1998) and third-fastest marathoner
in history thanks to the 2:06:16 he ran last fall in Chicago, when
he was passed by Khalid Khannouchi in the final miles on the way to
his 2:05:42 world record. Chebet and Tanui, who train in different
Kenyan camps, are no Boston strangers: in 1998, Tanui sprinted
ahead of Chebet in the final 200 meters for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Also strong on the men's side should be Kenyan Ondoro Osoro,
whose personal-best time of 2:06:54 in winning Chicago two years
ago was the fastest debut of all time and makes him the
10th-fastest man in history. This will be the 32-year-old's debut
in Boston, coming in off a 1:01:50 win in the Kyoto half.
</P>
<P>
   Also here for the first time will be countryman Elijah Lagat,
whose 2:07:41 in winning Berlin in 1997 is the fourth-fastest time
of the field. He is followed by the up-and-coming Gezahenge Abera,
a 22-year-old Ethiopian who shattered his personal best by six
minutes when he ran 2:07:54 to win the Fukuoka International
Marathon in December.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the elite men's field will be John Kagwe of Kenya
(two-time winner of New York in 1997 and 1998) and Silvio Guerra,
the Ecuadoran who led here last year from Mile 16 to 22 before
Chebet caught him and surged ahead. Guerra finished second.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, South African Elana Meyer returns from a
two-year absence for her fourth try at Boston, after finishing
third in 1994 and second in 1995 and 1997. The 33-year-old, a
silver medalist at 10,000 meters at the 1992 Olympics, still has
her formidable speed as one of the world's best half marathoners,
winning the Tokyo Half Marathon earlier this year in 1:07:33, but
still is looking for her first marathon win.
</P>
<P>
   Also in contention to deny Roba her fourth straight win are
25-year-old Kenyan Lornah Kiplagat, who last year posted personal
bests from 5 kilometers to the marathon; and countrywoman Catherine
Ndereba, who made her debut at 26.2 miles here last year and was
the only woman to stay with Roba into the Newton Hills before
dropping back to finish sixth. Ndereba, 27, finished up another
stellar year on the roads in 1999 by finishing second at the New
York Marathon.

million barrels a day rather than by 1.7 million barrels if Iran

   FUNDRAISING-LOOPHOLE (Washington) _ The tiny remnant of the
American peace movement had a little money and was looking for a
voice in the political process. The pharmaceutical industry had a
lot of money and was looking for a bullhorn. Both found it in an
obscure corner of the IRS known as Section 527, a provision that
allows groups to raise and spend unlimited sums on political
activities without any disclosure as long as they do not expressly
advocate voting for one candidate or another. Section 527 has
become the loophole of choice this year for groups large and small,
left and right, to spread their messages without revealing the

Florida. They had two children here, Jean Gardy, now 6, and Gaelle,
21 months. Ms. Pierre has received a deportation order from the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, and barring one last,
thin appeal, said her Miami lawyer, she will be sent back. Her
husband, who also entered the U.S. on fake documents, has also been
ordered home. But their children, born here, are U.S. citizens by
birthright and cannot be deported. So, Ms. Pierre, like thousands
of other Haitian mothers and fathers in the U.S., must someday
choose whether to take her children with her or leave them, to save
them? By Rick Bragg. (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in ``a'' news

   UGANDA-CULT (Rugazi, Uganda) _ In one room, the concrete floor
looked a little newer and, on a hunch, the police began to dig.
First they found a human foot, sole upturned, poking up from the
rubble. Within a few hours Tuesday, 28 corpses were hauled out of a
pit _ carefully sealed over with cement, maybe months ago _ inside
the house owned by a leader of a cult in western Uganda. By dark,
the pit was only half emptied. It was, on one level, another
horrifying discovery in the two weeks since more than 300 people
were found burnt to death at a church not far from here. The death
toll, from three different sites, has now risen to at least 593.
There are at least two more suspected grave sites. But the
discovery of the pit may also indicate just how well-organized and,
perhaps longstanding, this march to mass murder in Uganda was. By

   SCOTUS-SEARCH (Washington) _ An anonymous tip that a person is
carrying a gun is not enough to justify a stop and frisk by the
police without some further sign that the information is reliable,
the Supreme Court ruled with surprising unanimity Tuesday. While
the decision was an important ruling that placed a constitutional
curb on a particular type of police-citizen encounter, the court
did not address the more controversial and heavily freighted
question of what actions the police can take based not on a tip but
on their own observation and judgment. In the current climate of
increased tension over police tactics, the court's ruling in
January that unprovoked flight at the sight of a police officer can
justify the police in chasing and frisking the person may prove
more significant. By Linda Greenhouse. (The story has moved in `w''

   IRAN: U.S FLAG BREAKS TABOO
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 20 years, the U.S. flag appeared on the
front page of an Iranian paper when Hammihan, a Tehran daily, used
a color photograph of the flag with an editorial about
American-Iranian relations. In breaking an unwritten taboo, the
paper opposed years of effort by the hard-line clergy to depict the
Stars and Stripes as an object of hatred. Since the revolution in
1979, U.S. flags have been routinely burned at anti-American
protests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ: U.N. AIDE PICKED
</P>
<P>
   A Burmese official of the United Nations World Food Program, Tun
Myat, has been appointed to succeed Hans von Sponeck as the
coordinator in Iraq of the ``oil for food'' program. Von Sponeck, a
development expert, resigned to protest the continuation of
sanctions on Iraq. Tun Myat, a lawyer, has been primarily a
logistics expert for the food program, based in Rome. &QL;

   BRITAIN: IT'S M.I.6's TURN
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in a week, officials have revealed the loss
of a laptop computer with classified information. In the latest
case, a machine was left in a taxi by an officer of M.I.6, the
overseas intelligence agency. It was recovered, and a Foreign
Office spokesman said disclosure of any material would not have
been ``hugely damaging.'' Last week, a computer with secret
information about Ulster was stolen from an officer of M.I.5, the
counterintelligence agency, and is still missing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: DRUG ADVICE REJECTED
</P>
<P>
   The government rejected the recommendation of a panel of drug
experts, police officials and lawyers to reduce prison sentences
for the use of heroin and cocaine and to end jail terms for
marijuana, LSD and Ecstasy users. ``There's no evidence that we
have been able to find that our extremely severe penalties against
the possession of drugs have conferred any advantage on this
country,'' said Lady Ruth Runciman, the head of the two-year
study. &QL;

<P>
   TURKEY: ACTIVIST BACK IN JAIL
</P>
<P>
   The country's most prominent human rights figure, Akin Birdal,
returned to jail to serve the final six months of his sentence for
``inciting hatred'' by advocating a negotiated end to the war
against Kurdish rebels. Birdal had asked to remain free as long as
he needed treatment for the effects of a 1998 assassination
attempt. &QL;

   POLAND: ANTI-PORNOGRAPHY VETO
</P>
<P>
   President Aleksander Kwasniewski has vetoed an anti-pornography
bill. A spokeswoman said it did not define pornography well and
would reimpose censorship. The bill would have mandated five-year
terms for pornography involving children, animals or violence, and
two-year sentences for ``soft pornography.'' &QL;

   ROMANIA: NEW POLLUTION
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after a major heavy-metal spill, a new breach in an
earthen wall under repair let small amounts of lead-laden water
flow down the Tisza River. The environment ministry, in a report,
blamed both rainy weather and shoddy work at the Baia Borsa mine.

   Quebec has reacted with outrage to an Air France decision to

PROFIT-TAKING AND COHEN ANNOUNCEMENT LEAVE STOCKS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices declined Tuesday, as investors took
profits in a number of companies that have been big winners so far
this year and Abby Joseph Cohen, the influential stock market
strategist at Goldman, Sachs, announced that she had pared the
exposure to stocks in her model portfolio to 65 percent, a
reduction of 5 percent. It is the first time that Cohen has reduced
the recommended stock allocation in the portfolio since January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which has risen sharply since Jan. 1 and had a good run
on Monday, was a big drag on major market indexes. The chipmaker's
stock price fell 7 Tuesday, to 135 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   The decline helped to pull the Dow Jones industrial average down
89.74 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,936.11. Hewlett-Packard and IBM
were also major contributors to the Dow's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems were big losers among
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which slumped 16.13 points,
or 1.1 percent, to 1,507.73.
</P>
<P>
   Those same stocks and other technology companies that trade on
the Nasdaq stock market combined to generate a big slide in the
Nasdaq composite index. The index fell 124.67, or 2.5 percent, to
4,833.89.
</P>
<P>
   And widespread selling of smaller technology issues was
instrumental in a 2.5 percent decline in the Russell 2000 index,
which closed at 559.04, down 14.61.
</P>
<P>
   With the quarter winding down and no substantive economic
reports expected until April 7, when March employment data will be
released, traders said there was no fundamental catalyst that
triggered the selloff.
</P>
<P>
   Before the markets opened, however, Cohen announced she had
pared the exposure to stocks in her model portfolio to 65 percent,
a reduction of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she reduced her equity weighting, Cohen maintained her
recently increased end-of-the-year estimate on the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index at 1,575. And she did not cut her forecast for
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and analysts said the change in Cohen's position hardly
qualified as a major shift in sentiment. Still, it probably served
as a catalyst for profit taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the nice rally the market had last week, we were cruising
for a bruising,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at
Prudential Securities. ``And as we wait for a decision on oil
production out of OPEC, a possible settlement in the Microsoft case
and first-quarter earnings numbers, we are in a bit of a news
vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading activity picked up a bit from Monday, but was quite
subdued compared with the recent hectic pace. On the New York Stock
Exchange, 959.1 million shares changed hands. Volume on the Nasdaq
stock market was 1.5 billion shares. ``The markets feel quieter in
all areas, from the Big Board to Nasdaq to flows in international
stocks,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``Normally, you would expect to see more
quarter-end dynamics. It is almost as if investors have their
portfolios in order and are letting the quarter go out on its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which for the most part took a hit on Monday,
bounced back a bit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, American Express rose 2, to 152; J.P. Morgan
gained 1 7/8, to 133; and Citigroup closed at 61, up 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in oil prices led to a healthy gain in airline stocks.
</P>

DICKSON IMPRESSIVE IN VICTORY

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- Jason Dickson all but wrapped up a spot in the
starting rotation with his performance in the Angels' 3-2 victory
over the Oakland A's Tuesday afternoon at Tempe Diablo Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson gave up one run and six hits in six innings. His spring
ERA is 4.87, but more importantly, Dickson gave up only two runs in
11 2/3 innings in his final two starts in Arizona. He'll probably
pitch in a camp game Sunday, then make his season debut on Friday,
April 7 against the Red Sox at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say timing is everything,'' Dickson said. ``I've pitched
pretty well in my last couple of starts, and that's a pretty good
time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson, though, is not counting on anything just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Dickson said when asked if he thinks he'll
be in the rotation. ``I've done everything I wanted to do. I've
thrown the ball the way I wanted to in spring training. That's all
I can control. ... I wouldn't want to be in their (coaches') shoes
making the decisions. It can be an unbelievably tough job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson's command of his pitches Tuesday was not as good as he'd
like it to be -- he walked four -- but he showed manager Mike
Scioscia how he could pitch on a day he didn't have his good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he was quite as sharp as his last time,''
Scioscia said. ``But obviously the results were good, he did a
great job of battling. If you give up one run in six innings you
did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Dickson, Ken Hill, Kent Bottenfield and Ramon Ortiz
(barring a setback with his shoulder) are in the rotation. The
remaining spot will be either Kent Mercker or Scott Schoeneweis.
However, both will make the club because whichever one is not in
the rotation will pitch in the bullpen. Scioscia said he expects to
have the rotation set today or tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels made five cuts Tuesday, reducing their roster to 27
players. Among those sent down was Brian Cooper (Glendora High,
Citrus College, USC). Cooper went into camp among those competing
for a spot in the starting rotation, but his inconsistency showed
the Angels he needs a little more ``fine tuning,'' acording to
Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to work on the consistency of his stuff,'' Scioscia
said. ``We saw sporadic parts where he was effective. But to become
a major league pitcher he needs to take it out there a little more
often than he has this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before being sent down, Cooper had a feeling it would
happen after his start Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I get sent down today, I wanted to go on a good
note,'' Cooper said Monday after giving up one run and four hits in
five innings. ``Then I'll go to triple-A coming off a good one. I
know I can pitch up here.''
</P>
<P>
   The other cuts were infielders Larry Barnes and Trent Durrington
(optioned to triple-A Edmonton) and catcher Steve Decker and
pitcher Eric Weaver (reassigned to minor league camp).
</P>
<P>
   Jarrod Washburn (strained muscle in right side) threw 30 pitches
in two innings of a simulated game Tuesday and felt good. He'll
pitch Sunday at Edison Field against Cal State Fullerton and could
be ready to join the rotation in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything's healed and I'm throwing well, I go down (to
the minors) and earn my way back,'' Washburn said. ``I'm taking
nothing for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival earned his first save of the spring Tuesday, but
gave up a run in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like a kid getting his first save opportunity,''
Percival said. ``I was trying to do too much. I've done everything
I needed to do (to recover from shoulder surgery). Now I just have
to be mentally prepared to save games.''
</P>
<P>

   TUESDAY'S RESULTS -- Jason Dickson gave up one run and six hits

 &HT;    First woman to head ABC tapped for Healtheon/WebMD top slot
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Patricia Fili-Krushel, the first woman to run one of
the major networks, was named head of Healtheon/WebMD's consumer
division Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel, who had been president of ABC Television, will
oversee WebMD Health as its president and chief executive officer.
That unit includes WebMD TV, a joint effort by WebMD and Fox
Television. The channel is expected to be launched this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD, based in Atlanta, hired Fili-Krushel with the
hope that her experience will allow her to find ways to help draw
visitors to its consumer site, www.webmd.com. Fili-Krushel begins
her new job April 10 and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The online company is relying on research that shows women make
most of the health care choices in families, said Reggie Bradford,
chief marketing officer. Fili-Krushel, 46, brings a strong
background in developing programming aimed at women.
</P>
<P>
   Before being named head of ABC in 1998, she was in charge of
daytime television for the network. Fili-Krushel is largely
credited with launching ``The View,'' a daytime talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, she was an executive with Lifetime, a cable
channel that describes itself as ``television for women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a proven ability to attract a female audience,''
Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel will work out of WebMD-TV's New York headquarters,
said Jeff Arnold, Healtheon/WebMD's chief executive.
Healtheon/WebMD's consumer division employs more than 200 people,
Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon /WebMD is something of an online health care
conglomerate, if such a thing is possible for a nascent company
with no profits. Besides its consumer division, the company also is
trying to move health care transactions _ insurance verification,
doctor billing, laboratory results _ to the Internet. The goal is
to link doctors, insurance companies and patients through the
Internet and make money, in part, off the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   It is also trying to make its consumer-oriented site the place
patients turn to for health information, discussion and
health-related purchases.
</P>
<P>
   When its February acquisition of OnHealth Network closes later
this year, WebMD.com will be one of the 50 most frequently visited
Web sites, Bradford said. It is already one of the top
health-related sites.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel joined ABC in 1975 as a secretary in the sports
department. She was named president of the network in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She was named one of 18 ``Women Who Will Rule for the Coming
Era'' by iVillage, a Web site geared toward women.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel ``is not just one of the most powerful women in the
world of television, she is one of the most powerful people in the
business,'' iVillage wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which owns ABC, was asking ABC executives to move to
Burbank, Calif., where Disney is based. Fili-Krushel has been based
in Manhattan and, according to Tuesday's Wall Street Journal, was
reluctant to move.

SENATE REPUBLICANS PUSH TAX, SPENDING PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans on Tuesday moved ahead on
several fronts with their tax-and-spending proposals, calling for a
tax reduction for married couples, setting out a budget plan that
seeks to restrain government growth and laying the groundwork for a
vote on reducing gasoline taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Budget Committee took up a budget outline written by
Sen. Pete Domenici, the Republican from New Mexico who is the
panel's chairman, that called for an increase in spending next year
on education and the military, cutting or freezing many other
domestic programs and reducing taxes by at least $150 billion over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats attacked the plan even before Domenici had
released details, saying it required unrealistic and damaging cuts
in domestic spending and put the nation's fiscal health at risk in
a headlong rush to pass an election-year tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici's proposal closely tracked the Republican budget plan
passed last week by the House. Unlike the House bill, however, the
Senate version specifically calls for repeal of the 4.3 cents a
gallon tax on gasoline passed by Congress in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers have been seeking ways to offset rising
gasoline prices and to criticize President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, who had pushed hard for the 1993 tax increase,
for failing to pursue an effective energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate might hold a procedural vote later this week on a
Republican plan that would repeal the 4.3 cents a gallon tax for
the rest of this year and suspend the entire 18.4 cents a gallon
gasoline tax whenever average prices at the pump exceed $2 a
gallon. Although they vary by region, prices have so far remained
well below $2.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici offered his budget plan only after several weeks of
negotiations with conservatives within his own party who wanted
less spending. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, whose vote Domenici needed
to hold the Republican ranks together and pass the plan in the
committee, agreed to go along only after receiving assurances from
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, that the
Senate would not take up a supplemental spending bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   The House is moving toward consideration of a bill that would
spend up to $9 billion this year on several programs and projects,
a amount that fiscal conservatives like Gramm consider excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he would try not to allow consideration of a catchall
supplemental bill in the Senate. He said he would seek instead to
have roughly $5 billion for the most pressing needs, including
money for the peacekeeping effort in Kosovo, antidrug efforts in
Colombia and aid for victims of hurricanes, be considered as part
of the regular appropriations process.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering over the budget came as Republicans pressed
their plans to force a showdown with Clinton over tax cuts. Sen.
William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, proposed a package of tax cuts for married couples that
totals $240 billion over 10 years, $58 billion more than contained
in a similar measure passed last month by the House.
</P>
<P>
   As they did in the House, Republicans portrayed the proposal as
a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty tax suffered by many
two-income couples. But its benefits, including an increase in the
standard deduction and an expansion of the 15 percent tax bracket
for married couples filing jointly, would also go to couples who do
not suffer any marriage penalty.

JUDGE IN MICROSOFT CASE DELAYS VERDICT AS MEDIATION INTENSIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (rewrites and updates, with emphasis on mediation effort and
states' involvement)  
(bl) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal mediator in the Microsoft antitrust
case has told officials that he may be able to broker a settlement,
prompting the trial judge to delay his verdict, which had been due
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The court-appointed mediator, Richard A. Posner, chief judge of
the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, has laid out an aggressive
weeklong schedule of proposals and counterproposals between
Microsoft and the Department of Justice. It stipulates that if
there is no agreement by next Wednesday, the mediation will end.
</P>
<P>
   But Posner's schedule order immediately caused some state
attorneys general to bristle. After reading it, some concluded that
they were being left out of the process until the very end.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general
are partners in the suit, Posner's schedule appears to leave the
states out of the discussions over the next week. According to an
official who has seen the document, it says that if the federal
government and Microsoft agree on a settlement proposal by next
Wednesday, the state attorneys general will have two days to ratify
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the states are not going to stand for that,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another official noted: ``All it takes is for one attorney
general to say no, and there's no settlement, and Judge Jackson
issues his ruling.'' Several officials said some hard-line state
attorney generals would in fact prefer that, because no one doubts
that Thomas Penfield Jackson, the trial judge, will find Microsoft
in wide violation of federal and state antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   But another official said that while the wording of Posner's
scheduling order seemed to leave the states out, that was probably
not the judge's intent, and the states could be involved if they
chose.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By the end of the day it was not clear whether the dispute would
be resolved, or how important it ultimately would become. But it
did serve as a clear illustration of the divide between these
uneasy partners in the case, one that will have to be crossed if a
settlement is to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The issuing of the schedule does not necessarily indicate that
real progress has been made. As late as Monday night, as the
judge's document was being distributed, some government officials
were saying they thought Microsoft's offer was simply inadequate,
though one official suggested that some of the tough talk might
simply be a negotiating tactic.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the written scheduling order is a new strategy for
Posner in this case, and one that makes some of the litigants
uneasy. They were not expecting such a strong-willed mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Jackson called the litigants into his office and
told them that they had a week to settle or he would issue his
verdict. Settlement talks have been under way since Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Microsoft offered its settlement proposal. Among
other ideas, the company offered to provide computer makers a
version of Windows that did not include access to Internet
Explorer, Microsoft's Web browser. The proposal would apply to
present and future versions of the operating system. The company
also agreed to charge common prices for Windows so Microsoft could
not use pricing to penalize or reward computer makers for their
level of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials concluded that the offers were riddled
with potential loopholes and that they included no mechanisms for
enforcement. The Department of Justice asked Microsoft for
clarification on these and other issues, and Microsoft promised to
respond. With that, Judge Posner apparently decided he had enough
to keep the process going.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock has risen and fallen sharply since late last
week with the ebb and flow of settlement prospects. Tuesday, with
Jackson's verdict apparently put off for at least a week, the stock
closed at $104.3125, up 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorneys general hold a wide range of views about the
Microsoft proposal. Several have said they do not believe conduct
remedies of the sort Microsoft is proposing _ even if they are
clearly delineated and easily enforceable _ are adequate to solve
the problem. Some are holding out for a break up of the company,
some officials said without being specific.
</P>
<P>
   State government officials held discussions through the day on
numerous issues related to the settlement negotiations, including
the way the states are treated in Posner's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Some attorneys general are worried that they might be perceived
to be second-class players in the case. The Justice Department
largely led the prosecution during the trial, through the work of
David Boies, the lead trial lawyer. He was so effective in court
that the states made no effort to right the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the courtroom stage ended, several state
officials said they would insist on playing an equal role in
settlement discussions or, if the case goes to a verdict, in
proposing court-ordered remedies. So the wording of Posner's
document, even if it was inadvertent, struck a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the states have the ability to end the partnership
with the Justice Department and pursue the final stages of the case
on their own. The states filed their own suit when the Justice
Department filed the federal suit in May 1998. The two suits were
merged for trial. But Jackson, in meetings with the lawyers, has
made it clear he wants to deal with only one plaintiff. So the
states will almost certainly try to keep the partnership with
Washington intact.
</P>
<P>
   But ``if this is going to fly, the states are going to want to
add some things'' to the Microsoft offer, said one official with
knowledge of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Another said Posner's schedule might not matter in the end,
``there can be no settlement'' without the states.

 &HT;    Jackson to meet with group organizing Coca-Cola bus `ride for
justice'
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson is scheduled to meet in Atlanta
today with former and current Coca-Cola employees who have been
trying to pressure the company to quickly settle a racial
discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between Jackson, president of the Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition, and the group organizing a ``ride for justice'' to
Coca-Cola's annual shareholders meeting next month is another
signal that the case is gaining national attention.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Jackson may announce his support for the
protest ride, which will hold rallies in Greensboro, N.C.,
Richmond, Va., and Washington, D.C., before arriving at the annual
meeting in Wilmington, Del., on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment Tuesday on Jackson's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say more than 50 people already have signed up for
the three-bus convoy, which will transport about 150 former and
current employees to the shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will hold talks with Larry Jones, a former Coca-Cola
manager and chief organizer of the bus trip, as well as a small
group of former and current employees, said Joe Beasley, regional
director of Rainbow/PUSH.
</P>
<P>
   The 9 a.m. meeting will be held at Rainbow/PUSH's Atlanta office
in the Atlanta Life Insurance building. Jackson will hold a press
conference at 9:30 a.m., Beasley said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit and bus trip have gained considerable media
attention lately.
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit, filed by eight current and former employees,
alleges that Coca-Cola has discriminated against African-Americans
in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status so they can
represent about 2,000 current and former black salaried employees
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the suit's allegations and opposed the
plaintiffs' efforts to make it a class-action case.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement talks, facilitated by a court-ordered mediator, are
currently scheduled to take place on April 17 and 18 _ in the
middle of the bus trip and right before the shareholders meeting.

 &HT;    Flag boycott taking toll on some S.C. blacks
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ President Clinton's visit today to the last
state capital to fly the Confederate flag would seem a natural
rally for opponents of the controversial banner. But one of the
flag's leading foes, the NAACP, expects few of its representatives
to attend the state Democratic Party fund-raiser at predominantly
black Allen University.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit illustrates how the NAACP's national economic
boycott of South Carolina is exacting a cost on black organizations
that support it.
</P>
<P>
   The $500-per-person dinner will honor U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn,
chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. The Columbia Democrat
said he'll look for an opportunity to criticize the flag and that
he expects Clinton to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But Dwight James, executive director of the NAACP's South
Carolina Conference, said, ``We are not encouraging any people to
attend. We are hopeful that any visitors coming in for the dinner
will not stay in hotels or frequent other tourist venues in
Columbia.''
</P>
<P>
   James, who does not plan to attend, said he is concerned that
``the call for sanctions not be violated. I would commend
(organizations) for bearing the inconvenience, despite the
short-term pain that it might cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
vows to continue the boycott until South Carolina's Legislature
votes to remove the flag from the Statehouse. It has flown atop the
dome since 1962, when legislators raised it as part of a Civil War
centennial, a gesture critics say was actually a slap at
integration.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Sunday, Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley will lead a
five-day march from Charleston to Columbia. He hopes the march will
pressure legislators to remove the flag, which Riley said portrays
the state as clinging to the past, when, in fact, polls show a
majority of South Carolinians want it taken down.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Confederate symbols has become a racial divide
touching other states. In Alabama this week, black lawmakers
angered that Gov. Don Siegelman declared April ``Confederate
History and Heritage Month'' asked him to amend the proclamation to
include a condemnation of slavery. A Siegelman spokeswoman said the
governor ``certainly condemns slavery'' but the proclamation has
been issued and cannot be amended.
</P>
<P>
   In Columbia, opposing sides in the flag fight say they're
willing to consider one of the latest legislative proposals _ a
plan to display on the Statehouse grounds two authentic flags of
the Confederacy as well as a flag carried by black Union soldiers
from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But David Swinton, president of predominantly black Benedict
College in Columbia, is worried that legislators will fail to agree
on a plan before the Legislature adjourns in June, extending the
controversy and the NAACP's boycott. It already has been an
inconvenience, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Benedict men's basketball team traveled to
Charlotte for its conference tournament. It had been relocated from
Orangeburg, about 40 miles south of Columbia, to comply with the
NAACP's boycott. ``We are willing to make the sacrifice,'' said
Swinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some big names are, too, or are thinking about it:
</P>
<P>
   _ Black tennis star Serena Williams, the reigning U.S. Open
champ, said she may skip April's tournament at Hilton Head Island
because of the flag. ``Maybe I won't play. ... I'm not going to
support anything that's putting down my race,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   _ State Sen. Darrell Jackson (D-Columbia), who opposes the flag,
has called for Tiger Woods to skip next month's MCI Classic golf
tournament at Hilton Head.
</P>
<P>
   _ The New York Knicks decided to stop holding their NBA playoff
training camp in Charleston until the flag is removed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hip-hop performer Wyclef Jean canceled a recent concert in
Charleston. _ Internationally known dancer/choreographer Bill T.
Jones withdrew from Charleston's Spoleto arts festival in May.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other performers, including the O'Jays and Patti LaBelle,
canceled plans for South Carolina performances. Attendance at the
National Black Family Summit at Myrtle Beach two weeks ago was only
about half that of previous years because of the boycott, officials
said. In the small, majority-black town of Atlantic Beach, along
South Carolina's Grand Strand, the Town Council urged the
Legislature to put the flag in a museum. But town officials refused
to cancel the economically important black bikers' festival over
Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   By its own admittedly ``unscientific estimate,'' the NAACP's
boycott has cost South Carolina more than $100 million in tourism
and related businesses, the state NAACP's James said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted some ``major cancellations'' soon that will bolster
growing support for the flag's removal. Confederate heritage groups
disagree. ``They've had a few rock stars who did not come, but the
boycott has not worked,'' said Elijah Coleman, a Mableton, Ga.,
member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. His group and several
similar heritage groups are urging supporters to vacation in South
Carolina to counteract the boycott. If, in fact, the NAACP boycott
has resulted in a loss of $100 million, flag supporters said, that
would represent around 1 percent of the state's economic activity,
bolstered by last year's record $6.4 billion in capital
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boycott is a burp in a whirlwind,'' said state Sen. Glenn
McConnell (R-Charleston), a leading flag supporter. ``It has
strengthened the resolve for a presence of the flag.''

COUNTY OFFICIALS CREATE PARTNERSHIP TO ATTRACT SPACEPORT TO EAST
TEXAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGLETON, Texas _ Brazoria County Commissioners Court on Tuesday
created a spaceport authority that can acquire property and issue
revenue bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf Coast Regional Spaceport Development Corp., approved
unanimously by the court, is designed to attract the budding
commercial space market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the region's and the county's commitment,'' Fred
Welch, executive director of Brazoria County Partnership Inc., said
after the vote. The partnership is the county economic development
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The spaceport authority is competing with Kenedy County in South
Texas and sites in Florida for a commercial spaceport where
reusable rockets would deliver commercial satellites into space to
orbit Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Brazoria County officials are focusing their efforts on a
California-based company, Space Access, which plans to use a space
vehicle that takes off from a runway like an airplane, Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium headed by Lockheed Martin also is planning a
commercial spaceport, but its efforts have been slowed by technical
problems with the design of its vertical-launch rocket, Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazoria County officials have held talks with Dow Chemical Co.
about buying a 4,000-acre site near the town of Oyster Creek for
the spaceport.
</P>
<P>
   Oyster Creek, a city of 1,100 people in Brazoria County, is
about 50 miles south of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After the spaceport authority's board of directors is named and
articles of incorporation are approved in two weeks, the agency can
issue a letter of commitment to buy the Dow property and begin the
engineering and environmental studies needed to win a license from
the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Up to $300 million in revenue bonds may be needed to build a
spaceport, but that figure could be reduced to $60 million to $80
million if Congress approves legislation to provide federal loan
guarantees for communications satellites, Welch said. He noted that
such guarantees would attract private investors.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the spaceport call for a 12,000-foot runway and about
900,000 square feet of manufacturing and administrative space. The
project would create several thousands jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by Space Access, headquartered in Palmdale, Calif.,
on the location of its spaceport is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be as early as July and as late as December,'' Welch
said.

<P>
   Did modern humans wipe out the Neanderthal people who inhabited
Europe until 28,000 years ago, or did the two populations merge
through interbreeding? New DNA evidence, extracted from the ribs of
a Neanderthal infant, one of the last of its kind, supports the
thesis that these hardy, beetle-browed people left little or no
genetic legacy in today's populations.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Neanderthals perished long ago, the surprising
retrieval of intact DNA, the second such sample to be recovered,
has set biologists speculating that with further finds the genetics
of this extinct human species could become quite well understood.
</P>
<P>
   The two DNA retrievals, both suggesting that Neanderthals were a
separate human species, come before and after a startlingly
contradictory finding made last June. After studying the remains of
a thick-set boy recovered from a cliff-side grave in Portugal,
considered a final hold-out of the Neanderthals,
paleoanthroplogists said the human child had strong Neanderthal
features, suggesting, they said, that modern humans had interbred
with Neanderthals. Neanderthals and their forebears occupied modern
Europe from around 300,000 years ago. They were adapted to the cold
conditions of the ice age and had stocky bodies, thick bones and
enormous strength. Though their stone tools seem similar to those
of modern humans who started to enter Europe from Asia around
35,000 years ago, they ceased to flourish and abruptly disappeared
throughout their home range around 28,000 years ago, leaving no
clues in the archaeological record as to the reason for their
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Neanderthal DNA was first isolated three years ago, from the
original bones first found in the Feldhofer cave in the Neander
Valley near Dusseldorf in 1856. The finding was startling because
no human DNA of such antiquity _ at least 30,000 years old _ had
been recovered and because it showed a pattern of DNA that was
quite different from that of modern humans.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Feldhofer DNA was extracted with elaborate
precautions, the finding was greeted with some reservation because
it was a single result. Confirmation has now come from a second
Neanderthal.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were recovered by a Russian expedition from the
Moscow Institute of Archaeology to the Mezmaiskaya cave in the
Caucasus, to the northeast of the Black Sea. They belonged to a
Neanderthal infant less than 2 months old, too young for the sex to
be determined from the bones. The bones were dated by the carbon
isotope method to 29,000 years ago, making the infant among the
last generations of the Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the infant's ribs was made available by the Russian
researchers to Dr. William Goodwin of the Human Identification
Centre at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. Goodwin works on
paternity cases and plane-crash victim identification and studies
ancient DNA as a sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin and Russian and Swedish colleagues report in this week's
issue of Nature that the DNA sequence from the Mezmaiskaya Cave is
3.5 percent different from that of the Feldhofer Cave Neanderthal,
suggesting a considerable genetic diversity within the Neanderthal
population.
</P>
<P>
   But the two Neanderthal DNA sequences are very different from
those of modern humans, Goodwin and his colleagues say.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the rate at which DNA changes over time in living
organisms, Goodwin calculated that the two Neanderthals last shared
a common ancestor at least 150,000 years ago, a date that matches
the first fully Neanderthal remains, and that the Neanderthal and
modern human lineages split some 600,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two paleoanthropologists who favor the Neanderthal-human
assimilation theory, Dr. Fred Smith of Northern Illinois University
and Dr. Erik Trinkaus of Washington University in St. Louis, said
they did not dispute the new DNA analysis but noted that it did not
completely rule out the possibility of some interbreeding. Smith
said the new DNA data was ``incredibly important and significant''
and ``certainly strengthens the fact that there is quite a gap
between Neanderthals and recent humans in terms of mitochondrial
DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitochondrial DNA, inherited from the egg cell alone and thus
through the maternal line, is far more plentiful and likely to
survive than the DNA of the nucleus; both Neanderthal samples were
of this type.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith and Trinkaus, who are experts on the Neanderthals,
continue to believe that there was some interbreeding on the
evidence of the Portuguese boy with Neanderthal affinities. Other
anthropologists think the boy was just a ``chunky'' human lad who
in any case lived far too many generations after the last
Neanderthal had died for any evident influences to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got one feature that is arguably Neanderthal _ the
shortness of length between the knee and ankle _ and even that is
not striking,'' said Dr. Richard Klein, an archaeologist at
Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Trinkaus say that even though Neanderthal DNA differs
from that of modern people, it might be more similar to that of
their human contemporaries, the Cro-Magnons. Curiously, no DNA has
yet been recovered from very ancient Homo sapiens fossils. Klein
agreed that new efforts should be made to retrieve Cro-Magnon DNA,
though he said he expected it would prove similar to that of modern
humans, sewing up the case that the Neanderthals were replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The factors that allow DNA to be preserved for thousands of
years are not well understood. ``Even with two bodies in the same
grave, the level of preservation can vary considerably,'' Goodwin
said. He thinks that something about the limestone cave may have
favored the durability of the Caucasus Neanderthal DNA.
</P>
<P>
   If the reasons for preservation were better understood, DNA
experts would know which precious museum specimens were worth
sampling and which to leave alone.

RACE FOR BUSH'S POLITICAL SOUL IS UNDER WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every day last week, George W. Bush's congressional
liaison, Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia, was tracked down by
several of his colleagues with urgent requests. They pushed policy
ideas, asked where Bush stood on an array of issues, and offered to
work on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fairly constant run, I'd have to say,'' Coverdell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The race for the nomination is over, but behind the scenes, the
race for Bush's political soul is in full throttle. With more than
seven months before Election Day, a significant part of the Bush
agenda remains unclear. He has no broad-based health care plan, his
education policy is still forming, and he is being squeezed on both
sides of the abortion debate, which now focuses on Bush's vice
presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as Bush and his aides sift through advice coming from
everyone from senators to lobbyists to voters, it appears
inevitable the campaign itself will be reshaped. While Bush's inner
circle of loyal Texans has remained intact, the campaign is
expected to hire some high-profile party stalwarts as well as some
aides who worked for Bush's top challenger during the primaries,
Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bush campaign officials said, there is no reason to
think there will be a repeat of what happened in his father's 1992
campaign, when James A. Baker III swooped in to usurp some top
campaign duties for the general election. There is plenty of
carping from McCain supporters about the way the Bush campaign was
run, as well as criticism about the way the campaign so quickly
spent its $70 million war chest. But campaign aides note that by
Super Tuesday, March 7, the strategy worked.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's top strategist, Karl Rove, acknowledged: ``There
will be an effort to broaden the team, deepen the experience.'' A
number of top Republicans who earlier were unwilling to commit two
years to the campaign now are angling for a top spot, perhaps with
an eye on landing a job in a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republcan observers worry the Bush campaign may have
drawn the wrong lesson from the victory over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sense of panic nor even of worry in the Bush
camp,'' said William Kristol, who was chief of staff to former Vice
President Dan Quayle and now edits the Weekly Standard and was
supportive of McCain. ``They think they are in decent shape. But if
they play the hand they have now, (Vice President Al) Gore wins.
Bush needs to look like a different candidate in October than he
looks now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides, while defending their primary effort, insisted they
are not complacent. They said new speechwriters will be among
Bush's first hires, noting that Bush plans a series of policy
addresses in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to placate the many people seeking to influence
Bush on various issues, the campaign is setting up advisory boards
and inviting people to visit the campaign in Austin. But for now,
Bush's inner circle is notable for its absence of advisers who
worked for his father and the inclusion of longtime loyalists from
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The top troika consists of communications director Karen Hughes,
campaign manager Joseph Allbaugh, and strategist Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the campaign has been running so fast on a primary
schedule that it is only now beginning to sort out the general
election strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have been on this treadmill, I had a really good
pace and suddenly I hit the emergency stop button,'' Hughes said,
referring to the abrupt way Bush wrapped up the nomination. ``Then
I realize there is another treadmill already going,'' she said
about the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have met and we are going to meet more. The governor is
thinking, I am thinking,'' she said. ``I set down what are the
broad things we want to accomplish in communications. Karl is
looking at what states we want to concentrate on. The process
started last week. It goes from being a campaign to win the
Republican nomination to win the general, and there are just big
differences in that. We have been in a family feud. Now we are in a
transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the feud is not over. It is just being conducted at a
quieter level. For example, within the GOP moderate bloc there is
building pressure over whom the Texas governor picks as a running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine is among those who believe Bush
moved too far to the right during the primaries and now must move
to the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is running a huge risk if he doesn't do that,'' Snowe said.
``I can't imagine him not doing that.'' Picking a running mate who
favors abortion rights would be an enormous step in that direction,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, just as moderates are pushing for a greater voice,
some conservatives are concerned they will lose their clout as the
campaign looks ahead to the general election. But a former top aide
to President Bush's campaign advised the governor not to be
distracted by such concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The internal pressure is unbelievable,'' said David Carney,
the national field director for President Bush's 1992 campaign,
recalling what happens in the transition between the primaries and
the general election. ``It is more than the political carping from
the graybeards who say `they need us.' The campaign has to try to
go from micro-targeting voters in primary states to having a
broader message.''
</P>
<P>
   Carney said the 1992 Bush campaign failed to make that crucial
transition smoothly and spent months trying to appeal to the
conservative wing of the Republican Party. The mission of Bush's
son should be to avoid repeating that mistake, Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's people have done an excellent job of
excommunicating all the people from the 1992 Bush campaign,'' said
Carney, who was not affiliated with any campaign during the
primaries. But Carney finds no reason for bitterness, hoping
instead that Bush understands what went wrong in 1992. ``They have
taken a page from our playbook, put it on the wall, and said,
`Don't do this,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, the former Christian Coalition executive director
who helped plot Bush's strategy for winning primaries with the
support of religious conservatives, acknowledged there is concern
that the media will focus on whether Bush's potential running mate
supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm painfully aware of that,'' Reed said. But Reed said he
shares Bush's belief that there shouldn't be a ``litmus test'' for
a running mate, even if the issue is abortion. Reed stressed he is
still ardently against abortion, saying he is confident he will
like Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reed, clearly has switched to a general election mode,
agreeing that Bush must appeal to the middle to win in the fall.
But Reed said the governor doesn't need to reinvent himself to win
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Governor Bush needs to appeal to centrist and
ticket-splitting voters is to be himself,'' Reed said. ``He is a
new and different kind of Republican. He can build bridges.''

 &HT;    Al-Amin indicted; selection of lead defense attorney surprises
some
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The indictment Tuesday of Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin in
the murder of a sheriff's deputy may have come as no surprise, but
the selection of his lead defense attorney did.
</P>
<P>
   After rumblings from celebrity attorneys from Atlanta to
California and talk of a ``dream team,'' Al-Amin, the 1960s black
militant once known as H. Rap Brown, selected Michael Mears, who
defends indigent suspects in murder cases across Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin met with Mears on Friday at the Montgomery, Ala., jail
where he has been confined since his capture March 20.
</P>
<P>
   Mears is the most experienced death penalty defender practicing
in Georgia, with more than 30 such cases handled, but he wants
nothing to do with any publicity-seeking ``dream team.''
</P>
<P>
   Several more lawyers will be selected for the defense team, he
said, ``but none of them are going to be holding press conferences
and making pontifical statements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been far too many lawyers making too many
statements about what is or isn't going to happen,'' Mears said. To
make his point, he declined comment on the indictment issued by the
Fulton County Grand Jury.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard announced the indictment at a
mid-afternoon news conference. It accuses Al-Amin, 56, with 13
offenses, including five counts of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Deputies Ricky Kinchen, 35, and Aldranon English,
28, were trying to serve a Cobb County warrant on Al-Amin the night
of March 16 when a man standing beside a black Mercedes outside
Al-Amin's storefront abruptly opened fire on them with a rifle and
a handgun, according to English.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen was killed; English was seriously wounded. The next day,
English picked Al-Amin out of a photo lineup as the man who shot
him.
</P>
<P>
   The warrants they were trying to serve stemmed from Al-Amin's
failure to appear in court on relatively minor charges _ theft by
receiving a stolen car, impersonating an officer and no proof of
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Tuesday, Howard confirmed tests showed
the .223 caliber Ruger Mini-14 carbine and Browning Hi-Power pistol
recovered when Al-Amin was arrested in Alabama were the same
weapons that fired ``the cases left at the scene and the
projectiles recovered from the body of Deputy Kinchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes signed the extradition papers Tuesday
afternoon and Howard said he expects Barnes will send the papers to
Alabama today. But if Al-Amin's Alabama attorneys fight the
extradition as promised, it could take ``30 to 60 days to get him
back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Extradition papers for Al-Amin must be physically presented to
the Alabama governor's legal staff, so it will be today or Thursday
before Alabama gets them, according to Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said he would consult with Kinchen's family before
deciding to ask for the death penalty, but it is virtually
automatic in the case of a peace officer killed in the line of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Mears said if the district attorney decides not to seek the
death penalty, he would withdraw from the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Jackie Barrett said the indictment ``really begins to
breathe life back into the department.''
</P>
<P>
   She said English ``wants to come back to work, and we want him
back, but it will be a long recovery.'' The deputy is at home under
constant guard, and while neither Barrett nor Howard would go into
specifics, Barrett said, ``We're not going to expose him
unnecessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   No motive has been officially ascribed to the killing, but some
law enforcement authorities believe it had to do with Al-Amin's old
Mercedes. Atlanta police said the tag to the car had been found in
Alabama, but the car had not been located as of late Tuesday.
Howard said he had no comment on the role the auto played, or a
motive.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said Al-Amin's suggestion at an Alabama court appearance
that his arrest was part of a government conspiracy is
``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Mears declined to comment directly on the conspiracy suggestion.
``The lawyers that will be representing him will focus on the
issues,'' he said. ``I haven't seen anything that would lead me to
believe that we have any need to focus on anything but the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues, he said, are simply whether Al-Amin is guilty or
innocent of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Mears said Al-Amin's wife Karima, an attorney who handles
immigration cases, and his brother, Ed Brown, who works for an
Atlanta engineering firm, ``are in contact with several attorneys
to assist us.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mears nor Brown would reveal any names, but Mears said
``certainly I have input'' as to who is chosen to be part of the
defense team.
</P>
<P>
   Mears, 56, is director of the Multi-County Public Defender
Office, a statewide agency devoted to defending penniless murder
defendants. He filed a motion Tuesday to have Al-Amin declared
indigent, although it won't be heard unless someone challenges it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant has no funds himself with which to pay an
attorney,'' Mears said.

EX-BANKER PLEADS GUILTY IN MONEY LAUNDERING

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former Bank of New York employee pleaded guilty on
Tuesday to charges stemming from a $7 billion Russian
money-laundering case in a plea agreement that called for several
months of home confinement.
</P>
<P>
   The former employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, 50, of Brooklyn,
entered the plea in federal district court in Manhattan before
Judge Jed S. Rakoff. Sentencing has been scheduled for July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Charles D. Adler, called Kudryavtsev's role ``minor
and peripheral'' after she had admitted accepting $500 a month to
monitor accounts that were used to launder money. She pleaded
guilty to accepting illegal payments as a bank employee and of
lying to investigators under a plea deal that recommended six to 12
months of home detention.
</P>
<P>
   Kudryavtsev, who is from Russia, was identified as a part of the
laundering scheme by Lucy Edwards, former vice president in the
Eastern European division of the bank. Edwards and her husband,
Peter Berlin, pleaded guilty last month to involvement in the
scheme. Edwards said the couple had paid Kudryavtsev $500 a month
after they had moved from New York to London in 1996 so that she
could protect the accounts used for the laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said Kudryavtsev had been a contact at the bank in the
event of problems with transfers. She also sent account statements
to Berlin so that he could calculate the couple's commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Kudryavtsev was an associate in the Eastern European division in
August when she was questioned by the FBI, which was investigating.

WILLIAMS GETS CONTRACT EXTENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ In what has become an annual end-of-spring
exercise, Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette strolled into the
press room at City of Palms Park on Tuesday and announced the club
had extended manager Jimy Williams's contract through the 2001
season, which would take Williams to his 58th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is in his fourth season as Boston manager; if he
finishes the year, he will have held the job longer than any Sox
manager since Mike ``Pinky'' Higgins, back when Ike was President.
Higgins was hired in '55, fired on the 4th of July, 1959, then came
back the following June when his successor, Billy Jurges was fired,
and managed two more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If he manages through the extension year, Williams will have the
longest unbroken term of any Sox manager since Hall of Famer Joe
Cronin, who managed the club for 12 seasons, 1935-47. Jimmy
Collins, the team's original manager (1901-05), is the only other
Sox skipper who has managed as many as five consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, typically, was disinclined to discuss his deal, which
he said was reached Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's more important to think about this roster and
figure this out,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Told of his standing among Sox managers, Williams chuckled. ``I
don't know anything about that,'' he said. ``I'm going to do my
best tomorrow. That's all I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 teams in the American League, only five have managers
who have been with the same team longer than Williams has been with
the Sox: the Twins' Tom Kelly (14th season), the Mariners' Lou
Piniella (eighth season), the Rangers' Johnny Oates (sixth season),
the Yankees' Joe Torre (fifth season), and the A's Art Howe (fifth
season).
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not announced, but CEO John Harrington
has said that Williams would be paid more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy's well-compensated,'' Duquette said. ``His contract
reflects his contribution. His results on the field speak for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the third extension Williams has received as Sox manager
after signing a two-year deal to manage the club on Nov. 19, 1996.
Previously, he managed the Toronto Blue Jays for three seasons,
averaging 90 wins a season, before being fired with a 12-24 record
two months into the 1989 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox stuck with their policy of giving Williams just a
one-year extension, even though he has taken the team to the
postseason in each of the last two seasons. ``That's worked well
for us,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it has, but other managers have been awarded longer,
more lucrative deals. Torre last year was given a two-year contract
extension and will be paid $3 million by the Yankees this season.
Phil Garner, fired by the Brewers last fall, was given a four-year
deal for close to $6 million by the Tigers. Tony La Russa of the
Cardinals reportedly is being paid $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's contract, meanwhile, probably comes closer to the
$1.4 million Felipe Alou reportedly is being paid by the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   You'll never find that out from talking with Williams, though.
Asked if negotiations were protracted, he feigned ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that mean?'' he asked. ``I'm fine.''

 Mervyn Rothstein, an editor in the Real Estate section of The New
York Times, frequently writes about theater.  
 By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Stewart's first ``Ride Down Mount Morgan,''
at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in 1998, brought him mixed
reviews and a mild concussion. So why has he decided to star again
in the Arthur Miller play _ this time on Broadway?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some roles that gnaw at you,'' the Royal Shakespeare
Company veteran and ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' captain said
recently; he was taking a lunch break during rehearsals. ``Leontes
in `The Winter's Tale' is one, and Lyman Felt in `The Ride Down
Mount Morgan' is another. There's this impulse that I must do it
again, that I almost got it right, but not quite.''
</P>
<P>
   In the play, Stewart, 59, plays a bigamist who has led a
self-indulgent life; the character is in part Miller's comment on
the Reagan era. After a near-fatal automobile accident, Lyman is
visited by both his wives. And as he drifts in and out of
consciousness in a hospital bed, he slowly realizes that his
duplicity is about to be exposed and his double life is ending.
</P>
<P>
   The play's director at the Public Theater, David Esbjornson, has
returned for the Broadway production, as has Frances Conroy, who
portrays Theo, Lyman's Manhattan wife of 36 years, with whom he has
a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   New to the cast are Katy Selverstone as Leah, whom Lyman married
nine years earlier without divorcing Theo and with whom he lives on
an upstate farm, and Shannon Burkett as the daughter. The play
opens next Sunday at the Ambassador Theater for a limited run
through July 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Public, we had only three weeks of rehearsals, four
counting the technical rehearsals, and we could only run for about
four weeks,'' Stewart said. ``So there wasn't much time.'' In all,
there were 29 performances.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the last three seconds of the 29th performance,
Stewart said, that ``something happened that somehow led me to
realize I couldn't let Lyman rest.'' The lights were dimming that
Sunday afternoon as Lyman lay in the hospital bed, with ``the face
of a man in agony, left alone, trying to face the future,'' Stewart
said. ``Suddenly, a tiny pin spotlight snapped. And as it snapped,
something fell from the grid and hit me on the head. I knew it was
metal because I heard it clang on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned. I got out of the bed and went into the wings to
get ready for the curtain call. Somebody flashed a torch in my face
and screamed, because blood was pouring down. I went onstage for
the curtain call, and the audience gasped because blood was running
down my shirt. It turned out I had a mild concussion. I spent
Sunday evening in an emergency ward undergoing CAT scans and being
stitched up.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he flew to Los Angeles. ``On Wednesday or Thursday
I felt myself coming out of the mild shock I was in,'' he said.
``And somehow what I was left with was the absolute conviction that
`The Ride Down Mount Morgan' was unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   So what has Stewart learned about his character? ``In the old
days of the Royal Shakespeare Company, when we used to transfer
plays from Stratford to the Aldwych in the West End, there would
often be a three- or four-month gap,'' the actor said. ``That gap
was critical in fermenting the experience of the play. With `Mount
Morgan,' I've had more than a year.'' At the Public, Stewart added,
he explored Lyman's passion and energy. This time, the question is
what drives him.
</P>
<P>
   And the answer? ``Arthur Miller has helped us a great deal with
this,'' Stewart said. ``We've found that Lyman is running away from
death every single day of his life. That is the underpinning of
everything he attempts. So the next bit of action has got to be
even more intense and extreme and outrageous. In pushing these
extremes we've found that the play is funnier than we thought.
We've found much more comedy and much more passion.''

SUIT AIMS TO ESTABLISH NEW STANDARD OF CARE FOR FOSTER KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH TEICHROEB  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Washington state has failed to provide stable homes
for thousands of foster children, instead subjecting them to
repeated moves, neglect and even abuse, an unprecedented
class-action lawsuit claims.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the first class-action suit in the country to target
the emotional damage inflicted when children are moved from home to
home, the goal is to force an overhaul of Washington's frayed
foster-care system, said attorney Tim Farris.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which began as a case filed on behalf of 13 current
and former foster children, was recently expanded to class-action
litigation after a national child-advocacy group agreed to join
Farris as co-counsel.
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals of the lawsuit is to set a new standard of care
that can be followed in other states, Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse for the number of times children are being
moved,'' said Farris, who filed the original lawsuit in November
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a biological parent abandoned a child in 29 different
homes, we'd call that neglect. That's exactly what the state does
when it brings these children into care and then abandons them with
strangers again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the 13 children named in the lawsuit was moved 29 times
during her 14 years in foster care. As a result of those moves, the
girl, who is now 18, attended 20 different schools, had 19
different therapists and seven caseworkers. She suffers from
depression, doesn't trust anyone and has had two psychiatric
hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want a family,'' the girl told her foster-care
caseworker, according to notes subpoenaed from the Department of
Social and Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   After the Post-Intelligencer published a story last October
about Farris' original lawsuit, the case caught the interest of the
San Francisco-based National Center For Youth Law.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Grimm, an attorney with the youth law center, said they see
the case as an opportunity to tackle a problem that has plagued
child-welfare systems nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to stop,'' said Grimm.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst ways the system treats children is moving
them around. ... We want DSHS to learn a lesson _ that it is not
free or cheap to move these children around.''
</P>
<P>
   On the national scene, Washington's record on foster care is
somewhere in the middle of the list of best and worst states, Grimm
said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two weeks ago, a judge in the Whatcom Superior Court
granted a motion which allowed the original lawsuit to be amended
to a class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   Farris and Grimm plan to file a motion within the next month to
ask the court to certify the case as a class-action suit and hope
to get a trial date later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But assistant attorney general Jeff Freimund said the state will
oppose certification of the class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   He said the case assumes all foster children are treated the
same way, and unfairly blames the state for psychological problems
which existed before they came into care.
</P>
<P>
   ``By definition, these children are victims of severely
dysfunctional upbringings,'' Freimund said. ``That seems to be a
more likely explanation (for their problems).''
</P>
<P>
   But Grimm said the state has known for years that foster
children were repeatedly being moved, and even commissioned an
in-house study of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state knows this is a serious problem but their actions
have belied their words,'' Grimm said. ``We want them to make this
a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The state study published in 1996 found that 44 percent of
children who stay in care for one year or longer are moved three or
more times, while 15 percent of children in care more than a year
end up in five or more homes.
</P>
<P>
   About 28 percent of the state's 11,000 foster children are in
care longer than one year. Fifty percent of foster children go home
within two months, while the rest go home after two to 12 months in
care.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are some children moved frequently, the state often
fails to provide the mental-health and medical treatment they need
to recover from the abuse and neglect they've suffered, said
Farris.
</P>
<P>
   Foster parents are expected to cope with disturbed children
without being given background histories or the training and
support they need. As a result, the placement breaks down and
children are moved again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the solution is providing intensive help to foster
parents and carefully assessing children's needs when they first
come into care so that they can be returned home, or adopted, as
soon as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, leaving children in their homes would be less
traumatic than shuttling them between the homes of strangers, said
Grimm.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Hosford joined the original lawsuit on behalf of her
former foster son who has been in the state's care since he was an
infant. His birth mother was a 15-year-old foster child, while his
father, a convicted felon, also spent years in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband took the boy into their Seattle home more
than four years ago when he was 7 years old, intending to adopt
him.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he arrived in their home, the boy had been moved
more than 10 times, had been sexually and physically abused and had
a multitude of behavior problems.
</P>
<P>
   After two agonizing years, the Hosfords were forced to halt the
adoption because the boy's sexual aggressiveness put their own
daughter at risk and the state had refused to pay for intensive
residential treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited about this lawsuit,'' said Hosford, who is the
boy's court-appointed guardian for the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it can reform the system, it's wonderful. ... I'm going to
tell him I'm fighting for him, and that this will make his life
better down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit will also seek financial compensation for the 13
current and former foster children named in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important goal is pressuring DSHS and state
legislators to provide the kind of care foster children deserve,
said Grimm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it means the state and the governor have to find more
resources, then, by God, they should,'' said Grimm.

   &UR; By DANNY ROBBINS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
In 30 years as a college basketball coach at various levels, Joedy
Gardner heard his share of unusual stories. But one he recounted
recently will always stand out.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was coaching at Mesa (Ariz.) Community College last
spring when he learned his 7-foot center, Ernest Brown, had decided
to transfer after just one season to another junior college, Indian
Hills Community College in Ottumwa, Iowa. A New York City native
who signed with St. John's out of high school but failed to meet
NCAA freshman eligibility standards, Brown had just completed a
season in which he led the nation's junior-college players in
rebounding and field-goal percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ernest came in and told me he was going to transfer, my
first question was, `Why?''' Gardner said. ``He couldn't give me an
answer. Didn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a young coach, I would have been bouncing all over
the place, but I didn't do that. I gave him about six or seven
reasons to stay. I said, `Give me one reason to go. If it's in your
best interests to leave, I'll help you.' He said, `I'll think about
it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of days later, he came back and said, `Personal
reasons.' I said, `Ernest, if I told the press you were leaving
because of personal reasons, they could believe anything.'
</P>
<P>
   ``About three days later, he and his girlfriend finally came up
with a reason. He said, `Well, we'll be closer to New York.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner believes Brown's decision to relocate to the Midwest
after only one season in Arizona was based on a different kind of
geography _ putting him on the doorstep of current Big 12
Conference powerhouse Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's move to Indian Hills coincided with Iowa State's hiring
last spring of an obscure Mesa Community College employee named
Tres Chapman for an administrative position in the university's
athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   An academic adviser and assistant basketball coach at Mesa,
Chapman had been instrumental in recruiting Brown to the Arizona
junior college and helping him become eligible at the school.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Chapman was hired by Iowa State as the university's
athletic camp coordinator. Shortly thereafter, Brown transferred to
Indian Hills, 120 miles from the Iowa State campus in Ames, and
announced he would play college basketball at Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, for one, sees Iowa State's hiring of Chapman as little
more than a cheap recruiting maneuver and isn't shy about saying
so, raising questions about the methods of the Cyclones'
second-year coach, Larry Eustachy, at a time when his program has
gained national prominence. Winners of the Big 12 regular-season
and tournament titles, the Cyclones made an impressive NCAA
Tournament run that ended with a loss to Michigan State in the
Midwest Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently what would have qualified Chapman to be hired as
Iowa State's athletic camp coordinator, Gardner laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had control of a 7-footer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some college basketball programs, ``package deals''
involving recruits and those close to them, usually high school or
junior-college coaches, are an almost regular occurrence, a legal,
if occasionally awkward, recruiting tool.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation of Kansas' 1988 national championship was laid
when then-Jayhawks coach Larry Brown found a spot on his staff for
Ed Manning, a former professional basketball player working as a
truck driver in North Carolina. Enhancing Manning's resume was the
fact his son, Danny, was rated the top high school player in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important move Tom Penders made when he was
coaching at Texas was to hire Vic Trilli, the coach at Lon Morris
College in Jacksonville, thereby ensuring that several of Trilli's
players, including star forward Dexter Cambridge, would join the
Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Even by those standards, the Brown-Chapman scenario invites more
than the usual skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, 33, had worked as an academic adviser for athletes and
assistant basketball coach at Mesa Community College for four years
when he was hired last spring as Iowa State's athletic camp
coordinator, a position that made him responsible for all
university-sponsored sports camps and clinics except those
involving football.
</P>
<P>
   Before working at Mesa, Chapman had been an assistant basketball
coach at a Phoenix high school.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his background, Chapman was an odd fit for the camp
coordinator's job as it was described by Iowa State in an ad
seeking applicants for the position last March in the NCAA News,
the NCAA's official publication. The qualifications outlined in the
ad included ``one to three years of experience as director of
multiple camps/clinics; experience in athletics administration or
closely related work experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad directed those interested in the position to send a
letter of application, a resume and the names, positions and phone
numbers of three references to J. Elaine Hieber, the university's
senior associate athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts by the Chronicle to contact Hieber over the last 10
days were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   After four months in the camp coordinator's job, Chapman was
shifted to the position of administrative assistant on the Iowa
State basketball staff, a move that followed Cyclones assistant
coach Steve Barnes' being named head coach at San Jose State in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chapman's salary as camp coordinator, $28,200, was
slightly less than the $30,167 he had earned in his final year at
Mesa Community College, his salary increased 74 percent, to
$49,075, when he moved to the Iowa State basketball staff.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman declined to respond to questions regarding his job and
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I have no comment on those issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A hugely talented player with a spotty academic record at St.
Raymond's High School in the Bronx, Brown came to Mesa in 1998 as
something of a windfall, Gardner said, the result of recruiting
contacts Chapman had made in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tres told me we had a shot at Ernest Brown, I said,
`You've got to be kidding. That guy is big-time,''' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gardner, Brown did not graduate with his class at
St. Raymond's but was able to complete requirements for his diploma
by taking summer classes in Arizona at Mesa High School, an
arrangement worked out by Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   Proving to be worth the effort, Brown averaged 22.7 points and
15.3 rebounds in leading Mesa Community College to a 27-5 record in
1998-99, the program's third-best record in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said Chapman made it known at the end of the season he
was going to be hired at Iowa State as an assistant basketball
coach but never said anything about a job directing the
university's sports camps.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said he received a memo from Chapman last April 1 in
which Chapman said Eustachy had offered him a coaching position for
the 1999-2000 season. Chapman stated in the memo he would take the
job as soon as he received an official offer in writing from Iowa
State athletic director Gene Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said he received another memo from Chapman on May 3 in
which Chapman said he had officially been offered a coaching
position at Iowa State and had accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when he realized Chapman had actually been given an
administrative position at Iowa State, Gardner said: ``I don't know
that I ever did until somebody told me much later.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's move to Iowa occurred during roughly the same time
period. He left Mesa without taking his final exams, which were
scheduled for May 10-13, and subsequently enrolled in summer school
at Indian Hills.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, six weeks after Chapman had begun working at Iowa
State, the Des Moines Register reported that Brown had made an oral
commitment to sign with Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the father of three children, told the newspaper he
transferred to Indian Hills primarily because he would be able to
receive a full scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm going to do a year here, then go to Iowa State
and see how everything turns out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (According to Gardner, Brown did not qualify for a scholarship
in his first year at Mesa because he was not an Arizona resident
but would have been able to receive one in 1999-2000.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown signed a letter of intent with the Cyclones in November
but has since dropped out of Indian Hills and has indicated he
plans to make himself eligible for the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said he initially saw no reason to question Iowa State's
decision to hire Chapman because he knew Chapman had built a
relationship with Steve Barnes, then Eustachy's top assistant.
</P>
<P>
   But when Brown left for Indian Hills, apparently without a
compelling reason to do so, Gardner saw the matter in a different
light. No longer willing to play the good soldier, he contacted the
NCAA and the National Junior College Athletic Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The connection is they hire Tres to bring Ernest _ period,''
he said. ``Everybody in the (college basketball) business knows
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the NCAA, the issue is whether Chapman or others from Iowa
State had improper contact with Brown last spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   As a player in the middle of his junior-college career, Brown
was off-limits to college recruiters except under certain
circumstances. Because Chapman was not hired as a coach at Iowa
State, he could not have been involved in off-campus recruiting for
the university under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 21 news release, Iowa State announced the NCAA had
looked into the university's recruitment of Brown and had been
``satisfied with the process.'' The two-paragraph release provided
no details.
</P>
<P>
   The university had previously confirmed it had received
correspondence from the NCAA regarding its men's basketball program
but had refused to make the documents public or discuss their
contents, contending the information was exempt from disclosure
under Iowa public records law because it related to a specific
prospective student-athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Although Iowa State mentioned Brown by name in its own news
release March 21, the university continued to take the position
that the correspondence relating to the matter was not subject to
public disclosure when the Chronicle requested it last week.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Iowa State's announcement indicating the NCAA had
found no irregularities in Brown's recruitment, Eustachy told the
Des Moines Register: ``I have said all along that we will run a
clean program here, and that is what we are doing. I hope that will
be the clear perception of this program now.''
</P>
<P>
   Eustachy, previously a head coach at Idaho and Utah State,
received a ringing _ and lucrative _ endorsement from Iowa State on
March 14 in the form of a new 10-year contract worth $900,000 per
year.
</P>
<P>
   While Brown's move to Iowa may indeed prove to be a footnote in
a dream season for Iowa State and Eustachy, it will be remembered
in a different light by Gardner and others at Mesa Community
College.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of losing Brown and several other key players, Mesa
went 9-21 in 1999-2000, a complete reversal from 1998-99. Gardner's
roster was so thin that at times he had only six available players.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, a player who had left the team following an
argument with Gardner, Raheem Oliver, went public with a claim that
the coach had sought to prevent Brown's transfer by trying to
persuade Mesa instructors to lower the player's grades.
</P>
<P>
   On March 13, Mesa announced that Gardner's contract would not be
renewed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mesa's athletic director, Allen Benedict, the
school found no evidence to support the grade-manipulation charge
but still believed a change in the direction of the basketball
program was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   A plain-spoken ex-Marine fighter pilot who has been an NCAA
Division I head coach (at West Virginia and Northern Arizona) as
well as an assistant (Iowa), Gardner makes no bones about the fact
he notified the NCAA of the Brown-Chapman matter _ via an exchange
of e-mails with NCAA vice president for enforcement David Price
last summer _ but says he did so only because his superiors at Mesa
requested it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the culprit who supposedly snitched on Iowa State,''
Gardner said. ``Well, I didn't snitch on them. I was directed by
the athletic director and the administration here to submit the
information on Ernest Brown to the NJCAA and to contact the NCAA
and ask if we had any alternatives with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said it is his understanding that Eustachy threatened to
sue him for slander as a result of his actions, a notion he
considers laughable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't know Larry Eustachy if he walked in the room,'' he
said. ``I might recognize him, but I don't know the guy. Never had
a conversation with him. The only thing I know is he threatened me
with a lawsuit once, in July, and I didn't even know what the hell
he was talking about. He called our dean of students.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa's dean of students, Brian Johnson, did not respond to phone
messages from the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said Mesa officials initially believed the Brown-Chapman
situation warranted investigation but subsequently downplayed the
idea. He said he was kept out of the loop when an NCAA enforcement
representative visited Mesa to collect information regarding the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration here told me to just be quiet and they'd
handle it,'' he said. ``So I sat in a meeting (with the NCAA
investigator), but I didn't say much.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he kept a detailed chronology of the events surrounding
the departures of Brown and Chapman but did not share it with the
NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   According to one entry in the chronology, Gardner reported that
Chapman had been ``in and out'' of his office at Mesa after
resigning to go to Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word I received is he's getting ready to move to Iowa,''
Gardner wrote, ``and Ernest is taking some of his stuff over to
Tres' house to move his gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's documentation also reveals that Brown was being
advised at the time by a California sports agent. Gardner told the
Chronicle he was introduced to the agent, Gerald Duncan, by Chapman
at a Mesa game during the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict, the Mesa athletic director, said the fact Brown left
for Indian Hills at the same time Chapman became an administrator
at Iowa State may cause some to wonder but is not proof that
anything improper occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you can wonder,'' Benedict said. ``But you've also got
to understand the kid (Brown). He's got a girlfriend and children.
We have no scholarships to pay room and board. He was on financial
aid, but that doesn't pay for everything. To be offered an
opportunity to play basketball in a good program and get things he
wasn't getting here, from a kid's perspective, that's something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you can wonder whether it's coincidence Tres is at Iowa
State and Ernest moves to Indian Hills. But in order to get from
Indian Hills to Iowa State, the kid had to accomplish a hell of a
lot academically. I'm not going to speculate that Iowa State's
hiring Tres was because of Ernest Brown. I have nothing to document
that. Tres and I had a pretty good relationship. If that was the
case, I would hope he would have come and told me, and that didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gardner, the most troubling aspect of the matter is not so
much what may or may not have transpired between Iowa State and
Chapman but what has happened to Brown, who had a subpar season at
Indian Hills and will be challenged to prove he is ready for the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Brown averaged 11.9 points and 7.0 rebounds at Indian Hills and
suffered the ignominy of being pulled from the Warriors' final
playoff game after playing only six first-half minutes, during
which he scored two points and failed to get a rebound. Despite a
lineup that included Brown and another player planning to go
straight to the NBA, 6-8 guard Cory Hightower, Indian Hills failed
to reach the NJCAA national tournament for the first time in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rummaging through his office recently, Gardner found a reminder
of Brown's time in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have his All-America plaque here,'' Gardner said. ``I'm just
trying to figure out where to send it.''

FOUNDATIONS SET RECORD IN GIVING AWAY $22.8 BILLION IN GRANTS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Flush with ballooning endowments and new money from
wealthy individuals and corporations, the nation's foundations set
a record by giving away an estimated $22.8 billion in grants in
1999, according to a study to be released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Forced by law to give away larger and larger sums, many
foundations are increasing the size of their donations, sometimes
giving away tens of millions of dollars to a single charity. With
greater resources, many are financing sweeping, ambitious programs
in areas like education and health care rather than making what
were often scattered and short-term grants in those fields.
</P>
<P>
   Giving by every type of foundation has increased, according to
the Foundation Center, the New York group that tracks foundation
giving and conducted the study. The $22.8 billion in grants to
nonprofit groups in 1999 compares with $19.5 billion in 1998. A
decade ago, foundation giving was $8.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in assets provides an incredible opportunity for
the whole field,'' said Sara Engelhardt, president of the
Foundation Center. The largest foundations may be able to
accomplish goals on a scale not seen since the Carnegies and
Rockefellers created their foundations earlier in the last century,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, is tackling
disease in developing countries by providing $750 million over five
years to vaccinate children. ``Scale is helpful when you can cause
a bigger system change,'' said Patty Stonesifer, the co-chairwoman
and president of the Gates Foundation, which is expected to give
away about $1 billion in grants this year.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is also able to take a long view, supporting
projects for as long as 20 years, in the case of its $1 billion
scholarship program. By making a long-term commitment, the
foundation can relieve the burden of many nonprofit groups, which
``are always scrambling for resources,'' said Stonesifer.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the number of grants of $5 million or more is climbing
sharply, according to a sample taken by the Foundation Center.
While the number of such grants was under 50 for much of the early
1990s, it reached 147 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, among the largest in
the nation, spent $50 million over the last two years toward the
purchase of 271,000 acres in California _ the rough equivalent of
all of Los Angeles _ as part of its conservation efforts. The
foundation hopes to preserve another 500,000 acres in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even much smaller community foundations are benefiting from a
significant increase in resources, the result of the surging stock
market and the largess of individual donors. ``Every foundation
that has invested in the equity market has had 10 years of
galloping growth, especially in recent years,'' said Jack Shakely,
president of the California Community Foundation, which has $525
million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, based in Los Angeles, now finances projects over
several years instead of committing a single year at a time.
Excited about the prospect of a new project to give books to
children as a way to encourage reading, for example, the foundation
was able to pledge $1.5 million over three years.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, foundations including the Cleveland Foundation, whose
assets have climbed by more than 50 percent over the last five
years, have committed $10 million toward a $40 million initiative
by Cuyahoga County to provide health care and child care for very
young children.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rise in giving nationwide is a result of the soaring
value of foundation endowments, which reached $385 billion at the
end of 1998, the latest figure available, according to the center.
By law, most foundations are required to give away at least 5
percent of their assets each year or run afoul of the Internal
Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   But large donations to foundations, as was the case in recent
years at both the Gates and the Packard foundations, and the
formation of new foundations is also fueling the increase,
according to the center. The number of foundations has more than
doubled since 1980 to nearly 47,000, and newly active foundations
were responsible for one-fifth of the rise in foundation giving
from 1997 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate foundations increased the amount they made in grants
by a record 22 percent to an estimated $3 billion last year,
according to the center. Many of them are also making larger gifts.
The Bank of America Foundation, for example, is giving $50 million
over five years to United Way of America to help children learn to
read and get vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the margarine approach,'' said Caroline Boitano,
executive director for the Bank of America Foundation, referring to
giving that is spread out thinly among numerous causes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The surge in the amount of money available for giving causes
some concerns for foundations. The Packard foundation, for example,
gave away about $400 million in grants in 1999, more than double
the amount it gave away just two years ago. ``It is a challenge for
any organization to go through the kind of growth we have,''
acknowledged Richard Schlosberg III, president of the foundation,
which increased its staff last year by about 25 percent to 150
people and expects a similar increase this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lilly Endowment also saw its giving climb steeply, by about
two- thirds from the previous year to $425 million in 1998. The
foundation now routinely gives away amounts like $50 million to the
Hispanic Scholarship Fund and $30 million to the American Indian
College Fund, compared with five years ago when its largest grant
was about $6 million. Lilly has also significantly increased its
giving to community foundations in Indiana, where it is based.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to give larger grants, often to large charities
with national agendas, gives some cause for concern. ``It can be
counter to what people see as strategic grant making,'' said
Engelhardt of the Foundation Center. Foundations may ``look for
more of the sure bets,'' established charities, rather than
fostering experiments or creativity by financing small nonprofit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in assets has also caused some individuals to call on
foundations to give away more than the minimum required by law. The
California Community Foundation, for example, gives away what it
calls a ``community dividend'' with some of the money its
investments have generated in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think foundations have a responsibility to get that money
out and get it percolated,'' Shakely said.

HIP-HOP, HOW THEY LOVE YA  
 FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Midway through ``Dogma,'' Kevin Smith's unlikely stew of
millennial theology and turn-of-the-century pop culture, Loki, the
voluble, sociopathic angel of death played by Matt Damon, muses on
his shortcomings as a prophet of mass taste.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he still can't believe that ``E.T.'' was the
Hollywood blockbuster of the 1980s, instead of ``Krush Groove,''
Michael Schultz's rags-to-riches showbiz parable featuring the rap
group Run-D.M.C.
</P>
<P>
   But Loki sorely underestimates his powers of cultural
divination. Hip-hop, to the discomfort of artistic purists and
cultural puritans alike, has become the lingua franca of global
youth culture. Nowhere is this more evident than at the movies,
where hip-hop increasingly provides not only a source of subsidiary
revenue (thanks to soundtrack sales), but a repertory of styles,
references and attitudes now showing at theaters everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krush Groove'' may not have broken box office records or made
Reese's Pieces a popular snack, but a case for its belated
influence can be found in the listings and advertisements on the
entertainment pages. How many lovable aliens do you see? Garry
Shandling doesn't count.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at some of the hip-hop inflected movies released since
Christmas reveals both the music's ubiquity and its mutability. Its
idioms and its beats permeate, among other releases, a big-budget
pro football opera (``Any Given Sunday''), a blood-soaked art-house
samurai epic (``Ghost Dog''), a martial arts romance (``Romeo Must
Die''), a pair of raucous ghetto comedies (``Next Friday'' and ``3
Strikes'') and an amoral morality tale about outlaw stockbrokers
(``The Boiler Room.'')
</P>
<P>
   The transracial appeal of a genre that started out as homemade
party music in Queensbridge and the South Bronx is, in different
ways, the subtext of ``Ghost Dog'' and ``The Boiler Room'' as well
as an integral part of the marketing strategy behind ``Next
Friday'' and ``Romeo Must Die.'' It's also the subject of James
Toback's ``Black and White,'' which opens Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Toback's film stars the rapper Raekwon and the producer Oli
``Power'' Grant of the Wu-Tang Clan, along with the New York Knicks
guard Allan Houston (playing a basketball player), the supermodel
Claudia Schiffer (playing a doctoral candidate in cultural
anthropology) and Mike Tyson (playing Mike Tyson).
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Shields shows up as Sam Doneger, a documentary filmmaker
intrigued by a band of affluent white New York teen-agers who talk,
dress and ambulate as though they were auditioning for a Puff Daddy
video directed by Whit Stillman. ``I'm doing a film on a phenomenon
I've actually observed across America,'' Doneger explains to her
initially skeptical subjects, who are themselves the phenomenon in
question.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, not a new phenomenon. It happens that one of
the producers of ``Black and White'' is Michael Mailer, whose
father, Norman, anticipated many of the movie's themes in his
notorious 1957 essay ``The White Negro.'' The elder Mailer
identified, and identified with, the figure of the hipster, a white
man who was able, by imitating the sexual bravado and criminal
cunning supposedly characteristic of black men, to flout the
repressive conformity of postwar American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White Negro'' gave credence to a pernicious mythology of
black manhood, but if the elder Mailer was naive in subscribing to
such mythology, he was also prescient in describing its power.
</P>
<P>
   If a movie like ``The Boiler Room'' updates Mailer's hypothesis
by presenting stock trading as the ultimate existential outlaw kick
(according to its hero, selling stock is ``the white-boy way of
slinging crack rock''), hip-hop itself brings Mailer's argument
full circle. The aggressive masculine personae of many rappers
appropriate cinematic archetypes, including not only blaxploitation
and Bruce Lee, but ``Goodfellas,'' ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid'' and a grab bag of science fiction, horror and action movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' turns on the racial and generational divide
across which an aging white football coach (Al Pacino) and his
brilliant, undisciplined black quarterback (Jamie Foxx) confront
each other. But viewed from another angle, the relationship is not
so simple. If Foxx is a child of hip-hop, Pacino is _ along with
Oliver Stone, the director of ``Any Given Sunday'' _ one of its
godfathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scarface'' (1983), directed by Brian De Palma from Stone's
screenplay, in which Pacino played the profane, ultraviolent Cuban
refugee turned cocaine kingpin Tony Montana, has inspired too many
rap lyrics and videos to count. A climactic scene in Hype Williams'
rap-driven high-fashion shoot'em-up ``Belly'' _ one of the most
visually mesmerizing and narratively stupefying films of the last
few years _ is so closely patterned on the climactic shootout in
``Scarface'' that the victim mutters ``I'm Tony Montana'' as he
opens fire on his attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Like the music that drives them, ``Ghost Dog,'' ``Black and
White'' and ``The Boiler Room'' sample and recycle familiar story
lines and images to uncover something new. In the latter two movies
a young man _ explicitly Jewish in ``The Boiler Room,'' implicitly
so in ``Black and White'' _ is alienated from a powerful,
disapproving father, and discovers his own identity, his own voice,
by donning a kind of cultural blackface.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? It's the plot of ``The Jazz Singer,'' a
masterpiece of racial ambiguity that inaugurated the 20th century's
exemplary form of storytelling, the talking picture. And according
to the Wu-Tang Clan's Power, hip-hop, revitalizing the culture that
has sometimes grudgingly sustained it, will be ``the narrative
voice of the 21st century.'' You ain't heard nothing yet.

OPTIMISM AS BASEBALL GOES INTERNATIONAL

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Near the end of a long day of interviews last Friday,
almost everybody seemed to have grown weary of questions about the
first regular-season major league baseball games outside North
America. New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine had answered a final
question when a thought popped into his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the games here are a progressive move,'' he said about
the Mets and Chicago Cubs facing Japanese teams and then starting
the National League season with games Wednesday and Thursday (5
a.m. EST each day). ``Another step for the players of the future
and for baseball. But remember, we're not here to export. We're
here to influence. There should be an exchange, not a raid.''
</P>
<P>
   High-minded thoughts from a man who had traveled with his team
more than 6,000 miles in one day just to play baseball. The Mets
came all the way from Florida, and Sammy Sosa and the Cubs took an
8 a.m. flight from Phoenix. Some of them undoubtedly weren't happy
about the journey, but they realize these days their sport is a
business.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of baseball deciding to test the feasibility of
being truly international. The Mets and Cubs got into the swing and
battled the Tokyo Giants and Seibu Lions of the Japan League, and
now they are set to start the season. If this is the future, so be
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to rock and roll,'' said the Cubs' Mark Grace at
the interview session. ``It was a long trip, but our attitude is
that if we've come over here, then we'd better win a couple of
games. The Japanese have got some guys who are good enough to be in
the big leagues. It's a different type of baseball, but there is
talent here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Tokyo Giants defeated the Mets and Cubs, although
the major league teams both defeated the Seibu Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a game whose global potential is untapped,'' said
commissioner Bud Selig, who made the trip. ``We needed to do this.
We've been criticized in the past because the NBA and the NHL have
been more aggressive and already booked regular-season games here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact here is you have two nations where baseball is the
national pastime. There is a chance to do so much more than pure
baseball by establishing this kind of relationship. You don't worry
about economics. The economics will take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Until about 10 years ago, it wasn't thought the Japanese would
be major players in the economics of the game, including marketing
and merchandising. Major league owners saw the Japan League as only
Triple A ball, a closed shop whose ownership was tied up in
railroads, newspapers, and department stores. Clubs worked with a
basic agreement in which players had practically no chance of
escape. But that was then. Now players can become free agents after
nine years. That's not as good as the major leagues, where the
jumping-off point is six years. But it's good enough to enable a
handful of strong-armed pitchers to make the major leagues. Hideo
Nomo broke a 29-year drought when he signed with the Los Angeles
Dodgers. Approximately two dozen have followed. Finding everyday
players is the next goal of every major league club, and what's
happening with these games will help.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the increased consideration of Japanese players is
partly the result of a rare US loss in the series between the
countries in 1990. The major leaguers took winning for granted that
year and didn't have enough healthy players. So when they lost the
series, 4-3-1, there was an uproar among baseball officials. A
better team was sent over in 1992 and it prevailed, 6-1-1. But the
'90 result made some owners wonder whether the Japanese had
improved enough to rise above the minor leagues. Except for
pitchers, the answer was no, but it's getting closer.
</P>
<P>
   In '90, the US team didn't sell out a stadium. Veterans Chuck
Finley, Randy Johnson, Ken Griffey, and Barry Bonds received little
or no media attention. There wasn't much merchandising. Since then,
owners in both the US and Japan have worked to develop a marketing
strategy. It's coming along, and in two short years Sosa has become
the most popular major leaguer in Japan since Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pride thing,'' says Cubs manager Don Baylor, who was a
coach on the '90 team. ``I've warned my players to be alert. This
week we're (seeing) a whole new and interesting approach to the
game. But we're also here to face the Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the Japanese established rules to discourage raids
or runaway free agents. Three years ago, the movement of players
between countries became easier. Major league teams like the Red
Sox can get good money for players such as Lou Merloni (Yokohama
Baystars) and Reggie Jefferson (Seibu Lions). Creating a worldwide
market for players' services long has been a goal of Donald Fehr
and the Players Association, and he's getting his way.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is finally getting the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about regular-season games for years,'' said
organizer Peter Miller, son of former Players Association chief,
Marvin Miller. ``The fans wanted it. Baseball wanted it. There have
been administrative hurdles. But the sport has been so popular. I
think Nomo's coming to the major leagues has something to do with
it. It increased international consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a global economy,'' he said. ``It's so much
different than the world of even 10 years ago. Baseball has to
learn to live in that world. I said a few years ago that we were
going to change the way we thought and the way we did business. We
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had come up with the idea of this series 10 years ago,
you'd have been turned down. We're here. And the game will be more
popular if there is a worldwide dimension to it. I've told the
clubs that we're in an international phase. This is just a
modification. There will be more.''
</P>
<P>
   Those modifications might include a true world series with teams
from the US, Japan, Canada, Latin America, and perhaps eventually
Australia. There is plenty of talent out there, but the quality is
not consistent. Baseball has to be aggressive in spending its money
and yet keep salaries within a workable budget. In recent years,
baseball has lost fans and revenues to soccer and the NFL. Going
international could help stop that slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were short-term economics you were doing it for, then
you wouldn't do it,'' said Selig. ``It isn't worth importing teams
and other things for the short term. This might help baseball
economically in the long term. That's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Cubs are serious, but are continuing at a spring
training pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to pitch and play good defense,'' said Baylor. ``We're
not going to be able to hit too many home runs due to the makeup of
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is ready, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about my job,'' said Valentine, who once managed
the Chiba Lotte Lions. ``We're on a schedule, and people have to
get ready for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came away from Japan with a real good feeling about myself
and about baseball,'' he said. ``I came away feeling my ability to
deal with change and baseball players regardless of language and
culture had improved. I'm going to have a lot of fun.''

<P>
   DALLAS _ Donald Patman, a Texas farmer, is paying 40 cents a
gallon more this year to fuel his diesel tractors, adding as much
as $240 a day to his costs during cotton-picking season. Soon he
expects increases in the costs of pesticides and fertilizers to
dent his budget even more. Pass the increases on to his customers?
Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at H.B. Fuller Co., the St. Paul, Minn.-based
adhesives maker that sells mainly to other businesses, however, see
some relief where Patman does not: They are raising prices 5
percent or more on many of their products to offset raw materials
costs that have grown mainly because of higher petroleum prices.
</P>
<P>
   And while Centex Corp., the Dallas builder, has watched
suppliers raise prices as much as 5 percent for some
petroleum-derived products, including carpets, Centex is not
feeling the pain. It has purchase contracts that locked in lower
prices for six to 12 months. After that, however, if oil prices
remain high, the contract prices will probably rise also.
</P>
<P>
   Though surging fuel prices and rising costs for chemicals,
plastics, resins and other products have driven up expenses for
many businesses, not all industries or companies have been affected
equally. And those that have suffered have not, by and large,
passed along the higher costs, in part because global competition
and a relatively strong dollar have made it unwise to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   Even inflation hawks, including Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, have noted that consumers have generally been
spared, outside of direct expenses for gasoline and home heating
oil. On Monday, Greenspan told a Senate panel that, so far, there
was no significant evidence that higher energy costs were ``in the
process of embedding themselves in other areas of the economy and
inflating the general price structure.'' And that is unlikely to
occur, he added, if oil stays around the mid-$20-a-barrel level.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a majority of the members of OPEC agreed to reverse
production cuts they made last year. Oil prices fell sharply
earlier in the day, to about $27 a barrel, as traders anticipated
that the cartel would boost output. Still, oil is nearly twice as
expensive as a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses have been able to cut other costs or increase
productivity to offset the higher materials prices. But most others
are swallowing the difference, at least for now: Higher prices have
already contributed to earnings disappointments at several
companies, including Fuller and the consumer-goods giant Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Within industries, too, oil prices have hit companies in sharply
different ways. It is no surprise, for example, that the rise in
fuel prices has stung the airlines, so that many, in response, have
raised their ticket prices by about $20.
</P>
<P>
   But some carriers are hurting more than others: US Airways
Group, which had no hedges in place at year-end to protect against
high fuel costs, experienced a 52 percent spike in the average
price it paid for a gallon of fuel from a year earlier. That
contributed to a fourth-quarter loss.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Delta Air Lines stunned analysts in January by
reporting earnings per share that were 12 cents higher than
expected, largely because of fuel hedging. For the fourth quarter,
Delta's average cost per gallon rose just 6 percent and the airline
reported a gain of $99 million on fuel-hedging contracts. Delta has
three-quarters of its fuel requirements hedged for the rest of this
fiscal year, which ends June 30, and 55 percent for next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   Another industry hard hit by rising oil costs is freight
transportation. Federal Express and others have responded by
tacking on fuel surcharges to prices to consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But even that tactic does not guarantee earnings' protection. At
J.B. Hunt Transport Services, a big trucking firm based in Lowell,
Ark., fourth-quarter earnings per share fell 14 cents below what
they otherwise would have been, the company said, despite fuel
surcharges it added to customers' bills.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Fed's most recent ``beige book'' report on the
economy, some truckers indicate that they are hurt more than might
be expected because competition from rail carriers hampers their
ability to pass on higher costs. Various groups of truckers have
protested in Washington, snarling traffic while seeking relief.
</P>
<P>
   The beige book also noted that in the Southwest, some refiners
have been pinched because prices for oil, their raw material, have
risen faster than prices they charge for the fuels they produce.
And oil services concerns continue to be frustrated by the
surprisingly tepid pace of new exploration and development, as
producers use cash flow to pay down debt instead of increasing
their efforts to find more oil.
</P>
<P>
   The big issue, if petroleum prices stay high, is whether
manufacturers can continue to hold back prices, said David M.
Jones, chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., the New York
bond dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses are having extreme difficulty in this world of
intense global competition making price increases stick, and it's
pretty much across the board, so they have to suffer with higher
costs,'' Jones said. Oil plays a far smaller role today in the
overall economy than it did the last time prices soared, in the
late 1970s. But if high prices persist, many businesses will face a
profit squeeze or ``will try once again to make prices stick'' _
spurring a reaction from the Fed if they succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Greenspan cautioned on Monday that crude oil ``is still
quite formidable.'' He added: ``And there is no doubt in my mind
that energy, which tends to cut across all aspects of this economy,
if it gets sufficiently costly, could have materially negative
effects on the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though that has not happened, many manufacturers are feeling
squeezed. The National Association of Purchasing Management's price
index rose again last month, to its highest reading in five years.
That indicated that cost increases were still accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   Other industries paying higher prices include clothing,
electronic components and equipment, and rubber and plastic.
</P>
<P>
   But manufacturers are mostly not charging more, because they
feel they cannot. The Labor Department reported that, excluding
energy, food and cigarettes, prices paid to manufacturers and other
producers for finished goods and services stayed about the same in
February.

KARROS HURT, SHOULD BE OK FOR OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. - When Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros didn't
pop right up after fouling a ball off his left ankle, everyone knew
it was serious.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the Dodgers, though, it turned out to be only a
bruise that will keep Karros out for the next three or four games.
General manager Kevin Malone said Karros would be ready for
Monday's season opener at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swelling has already gone down and just talking with him,
he said he already feels better,'' Malone said a few hours
afterward. ``I had a stomach ache because usually he gets up. I'm
pretty sure we won't see him until Friday or Saturday (in Toronto).
I'd doubt if (manager Davey Johnson) would overextend Eric,
especially on the carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning of Tuesday's game against Montreal, Karros
fouled a Felipe Lira pitch off his ankle and immediately fell. He
remained on his knees for a few minutes before being helped off the
field. He was taken to the clubhouse on a golf cart, and he left
the complex on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays taken at St. Mary's Professional Building by Dr. Frank
Cook were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy it was just a bruise. I should be back in a few
days,'' said Karros, who signed a three-year contract extension
that guarantees him $24 million days before spring training began.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the better ones I've had. Let's put it this
way, it's the only time I've come off the field (after doing it).''
</P>
<P>
   It's the second potential disaster the Dodgers narrowly averted
this spring, and one that could have been a terrible setback.
Karros has hit at least 30 homers and driven in 100 runs in four of
the last five seasons, and his presence in the order behind cleanup
hit Shawn Green is irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month left fielder Gary Sheffield needed three
stitches to close a cut on his left pinkie, which he cut diving
into third. He missed eight spring training games with the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson eyes 12 hurlers: There is concern that since the Dodgers
begin the season with seven games in seven days, and since Orel
Hershiser and Carlos Perez are in the middle of the rotation and
neither averaged more than six innings a start last season, that
opening the season with 11 pitchers wouldn't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, manager Davey Johnson said beginning the season with
12 pitchers is a strong possibility. The likely candidate is
right-hander Matt Herges, who can eat up innings in a long relief
role. Herges pitched a shutout inning against the Expos, and will
make the trip to play Atlanta today.
</P>
<P>
   With Hershiser in the starting rotation, the Dodgers don't have
any long relievers in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``With playing the first seven days and getting the first start
under everyone's belt, you want to make sure you have enough
innings in the `pen,'' Johnson said. ``If I did carry another guy,
it would be because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Dodgers go with 12 pitchers, it means beginning the
season with six outfielders is impossible and could mean the end
for Geronimo Berroa unless the Dodgers can come up with a creative
way to make it possible to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter catches on: Veteran Chad Kreuter, a Pepperdine product,
won a spot on the Dodgers' roster long ago, and the club finally
made it official by purchasing his contract. Kreuter, signed as a
non-roster invitee, will back up Todd Hundley. He has a $450,000
base salary.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely Kreuter will make most of his starts against
left-handers. A natural righty, the switch-hitting Kreuter batted
.279 against lefties last season. Hundley, meanwhile, had four hits
in 40 at-bats from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that signing here was going to be a role backing up
Todd, and I plan on doing that well,'' Kreuter said. ``It's going
in when heneeds days off, going in late in games and possibly
playing defensively, and maybe some pinch-hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   It also means catcher Paul Lo Duca, the Dodgers' backup much of
last season, is expected to be sent to Triple-A Albuquerque today.
To make room for Kreuter on the 40-man roster, pitcher Kris Foster
put on the 60-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Speculation is Montreal closer Ugueth Urbina is
close to being dealt to Atlanta for the world's most hated
ballplayer, John Rocker. But it's clear how the Expos players feel
about bringing Rocker into their clubhouse. Before the game with
the Dodgers, one of the Expos clipped a newspaper story about the
deal and drew a circle with a diagonal slash through it over
Rocker's face. Copies of it where everywhere in the Expos'
clubhouse ... Lefty Onan Masaoka pitched three innings and allowed
one run in a Triple-A game. Masaoka is the Dodgers' situational
lefty in the bullpen, but he was sent to a minor league game to
stretch out his arm, which he did in throwing 51 pitches.

   Today's game: Both clubs set up their rotation to start the
season, which means Kevin Brown against Greg Maddux in the Dodgers'
last road game of the Grapefruit League. Brown leads Dodger
starters with a 1.23 ERA.Wednesday's result: Shawn Green hit a pair
of homers as the Dodgers beat the Montreal Expos 4-3 in 10 innings.
It was the Dodgers' fifth straight win. Darren Dreifort was sharp
in pitching six innings. He allowed two runs.

 DALLAS: in February. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Save for some notable exceptions, cost pressures have not
torpedoed earnings yet. Edward M. Kerschner, PaineWebber's chief
investment strategist, predicted Monday that first-quarter earnings
for companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index would rise
15 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several recent surveys have found that manufacturing
executives expect higher energy and related raw materials costs to
crimp profits later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the rise in oil prices began a year ago,
the increases are only now beginning to work their way down to some
companies. Others have felt little yet because of hedging and
long-term contracts that locked in lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some costs may not be felt soon for yet other reasons. For
example, while the Labor Department reported that prices for
electric power rose only slightly in the last year, the prices that
electric utilities pay for natural gas rose by almost one third.
Natural-gas-fired plants are the largest source of generation at
many utilities, but increases in their rates often take months to
wind their way through public rate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Goss, an economics professor at Creighton University in
Omaha, Neb., said his monthly survey of 1,100 companies in nine
Midwestern states found that only in the past month have many
manufacturers begun to feel rising petroleum prices. ``There were
an unusually high number of manufacturers reporting that oil prices
were really squeezing them,'' he said. ``It was odd. We didn't see
these comments till February.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see some higher prices, and I think the impact
on profits is yet to come,'' Goss added.
</P>
<P>
   A Dun &AMP; Bradstreet survey found that manufacturing executives
believe that over the next three months rising materials costs will
force either slimmer profits or higher prices for finished goods.
David Kresge, Dun &AMP; Bradstreet's chief economist, said that
manufacturers reported only recently that they hope to raise prices
to offset higher costs. ``Whether they are able to do that in the
face of competition remains an open issue,'' Kresge said.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary price increases can be swallowed by manufacturers,
said Richard Edwards, director of investor relations at H.B.
Fuller, whose stock dropped almost 20 percent earlier this month
when it disclosed that first-quarter profits were likely to fall
short of expectations. But, he added, ``there's only so much that
suppliers and manufacturers can absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Patman, who farms about 6,000 acres near Waxahachie, Texas,
about 30 miles south of Dallas, says the higher fuel prices have
helped change his view of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, as you made less net profit per acre, you leased
more land to maintain a certain income,'' he said. ``But now,
bigger is not better _ you have too much at stake out there,''
because one bad year can wipe out a farmer's equity in his
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a lot better if farmers could pass on some of the
higher costs, he said, but they do not have the power to do so.
Between the higher prices and the drought across the South and in
the Midwest, Patman said, ``I'm sure a lot of producers won't be
able to stay in business'' after this year.
</P>
<P>
   Higher petroleum costs will cut $3 billion, or about 6 percent,
from farmers' net cash income this year, if oil prices average $28
a barrel, estimates Terry Francl, a senior economist at the
American Farm Bureau Federation in Chicago. But that's only the
half of it: Once stockpiles of fertilizers and pesticides are
depleted, replacements could cost $800 million more later this
year, and $2 billion to $3 billion more next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a model prepared by the Dallas branch of the
Federal Reserve, it can take about nine months for the economy to
feel a significant effect from higher oil prices, said Mine K.
Yucel, head of the regional group of economists there.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, competition has meant that businesses that cannot
increase productivity or cut costs to offset higher prices ``are
suffering in terms of profits,'' Yucel said. ``They're eating it.''

REFORM CHAIRMAN VOWS TO UNITE PARTY IN TIME FOR ELECTION DAY

<P>
   With a court upholding his chairmanship of the Reform Party, Pat
Choate predicted Tuesday that he would unite the party's bickering
factions before the fall's general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush will have a tougher time getting John McCain's
endorsement than I am pulling this party together,'' Choate said at
a Washington news conference, where he discussed plans for the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Choate, who was Ross Perot's vice-presidential running mate in
1996, won a federal court ruling Monday that he is the legitimate
Reform Party chairman, not Jack Gargan. Gargan was elected by a
party convention last year, but he was ousted earlier this year
during an acrimonious executive committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Choate said the party will establish headquarters in Washington
and will move ahead with plans for three issues conferences, using
the Internet, to reach voters on subjects, including political
reform, trade and China.
</P>
<P>
   He said that although the race for the party's presidential
nominee is still open, the only candidate working to get on state
ballots is conservative commentator Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Democrats and Republicans may be working to deny
the Reform Party candidate a place at the presidential debates next
fall, Choate replied, ``Pat Buchanan is what they fear. He is a
great debater.''
</P>
<P>
   Choate said the Reform Party is already on the ballot in 22
states and organizers are working in all of the other states,
including Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``the Texas clock began to run on March 15 ... the only
person working the clock is Pat Buchanan.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Reform Party Chairman Larry Steele of Corpus Christi
recently sent party members a letter saying there are two petition
drives going on in Texas. One is to get the party ballot status,
and the other is for Buchanan as an independent candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since our secretary of state (Elton Bomer) is a Bush
appointee, they (Buchanan's campaign staff) feel they must make the
extra effort to petition as an independent,'' Steele wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Steele said Buchanan would run as a Reform Party candidate if
the party gains ballot status, otherwise Buchanan wants to be on
the Texas ballot as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 37,380 valid signatures are required on a petition
to get a third party on the ballot in Texas compared with 56,116
needed for an independent candidate, a third party faces additional
legal hurdles that a candidate does not.
</P>
<P>
   Ann McGeehan, director of elections for the secretary of state,
said in addition to the Reform Party there also are ballot-access
petition drives under way for the Constitution Party, Green Party,
Patriot Party and the Natural Law Party. The Democratic, Republican
and Libertarian parties already have ballot access.
</P>
<P>
   Choate said the Reform Party will launch a fund-raising drive,
using the Internet, with the goal of raising $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The party is eligible for $2 million in federal funds for its
national party convention. And the Reform Party presidential
nominee will qualify for another $12 million in public funds for
the general election, Choate said.

   MIAMI _ The choice lies in Esta Pierre's mind like a sliver of
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre used a doctored passport to leave Haiti and enter the
United States on Jan. 8, 1993, after her boyfriend was dragged from
their house in Port-au-Prince by agents of the Haitian
dictatorship. He disappeared, believed to have been one of
thousands killed there in the early 1990s, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, she built a solid life on shaky ground. She scrubbed
hotel room toilets and bathed people in nursing homes to earn a
living. She married a Haitian immigrant and made payments on a
little house in southwest Florida. They had two children, Jean ,
now 6, and Gaelle, 21 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been a problem,'' she said last week in the
office of her immigration lawyer, using the hem of her dress to mop
up the tears that flowed down her face. She has been told she
cannot be an American, like her children. To keep them, she has to
take them to a place she still sees in nightmares. If she were
Cuban or Nicaraguan, though, she could have received amnesty.

   Pierre has received a deportation order from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and could be sent back at any time, her
Miami lawyer said. Her husband, who also entered the country on a
fake passport, has also been ordered back. But their children, born
here, are U.S. citizens by birthright, and cannot be deported. So,
Pierre, like thousands of other Haitian mothers and fathers in this
country, must someday choose.
</P>
<P>
   Does she remove her children from school and doctors and the
clean, safe life she has been able to shape here in Florida, and
take them to the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, a place
of mass graves and open sewage and a blood-stained history of
political repression?
</P>
<P>
   Or does she leave them, to save them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going crazy,'' Pierre said.
</P>
<P>
   As the whole country and much of the world focuses on one Cuban
boy, Elian Gonzalez, and an international custody battle that has
drawn attention from Attorney General Janet Reno and President
Clinton, some 3,000 Haitians in the United States face the prospect
of leaving their children if they are deported, convinced the
children would have a better life here, even as virtual orphans,
than in Haiti, said experts on Caribbean immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are stuck,'' said Elwin Griffith, a law professor
and the director of the Caribbean Law Institute at Florida State
University. ``And they can't do a thing about it.'' Immigration
laws do not recognize children who are U.S. citizens as the
overriding argument against the deportation of their parents, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Congress granted amnesty to Cubans and Nicaraguans who
came to the United States before December 1995, even if they had
entered the country illegally, said Cheryl Little, the executive
director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center. While they, too,
faced political turmoil at home, Haitians were excluded from that
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, when Congress passed a similar law for Haitians,
it included tighter restrictions and failed to include protections
for those who arrived with a fake passport, as if that was more
criminal than crawling over a fence at a border crossing or
floating on a raft, immigration lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami last week, a federal judge gave 12 days of attention to
the question of parental rights in the Elian case, and ultimately
concluded that the boy's father in Cuba had already been separated
from his son for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Justice Department officials introduced a new
set of regulations that relaxed some requirements for applications
for citizenship, but did not alter its stand on people like Pierre,
people who entered on phony passports and have no qualifying
relative _ a spouse or parent _ who already has citizenship or a
residency card.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it obsesses on the plight of one boy, the government is
about to destroy the families of thousands of American boys and
girls,'' said Steve Forester, an immigration lawyer in Miami who
has been agitating for 20 years to change what advocates see as a
double standard for Haitian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``To separate them from their parents destroys their lives,''
Forester said, ``but to send them to Haiti also destroys their
lives. That steals their future.''
</P>

<P>
   Haitians are not the only immigrants who face this dilemma. But
the proximity of the United States to their homeland, and cruelty
of the circumstances there, make their situation more common.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 10,000 Haitians in the United States who,
like Pierre, face deportation. About 3,000 of those have one or
more children who were born here, immigration experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a parent of a United States citizen is not sufficient
for a waiver when the individual has entered the United States with
fraudulent documents,'' said Dan Kane, a spokesman for the
immigration service. ``INS cannot exercise authority that Congress
has not given it.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   David Abraham, a professor of immigration law at the University
of Miami, said the parents and children are placed in an impossible
situation, but warned that giving legal residency to the parents
could set a bad precedent. Any illegal immigrant who wanted a green
card could just have a child, he said. ``It would lead to
backlash'' in public opinion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But immigration experts say that for decades, Haitians have been
met with uneven application of laws that that can benefit
immigrants from countries whose governments have been at odds with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The INS, which has deported more than 900 Haitians in the last
two years, is planning no en masse return of Haitians. In fact,
immigration lawyers said, because of huge backlogs, the agency will
take years to investigate, identify and consider the appeals filed
by people like Pierre. It has taken seven years to process her
case.
</P>
<P>
   But, in one way, that only makes her choice more difficult. Her
two children are not immigrants in a new culture. They are Haitians
by ancestry only. They wear Michael Jordan jerseys and Pooh
pajamas. When she asks Jean a question in Creole, he answers in
English. Jean, who is making good grades in school in Immokalee,
where they now live, has no accent. Her baby daughter is not just
healthy, she is fat.
</P>
<P>
   She has a picture in her mind of children with distended bellies
who stand naked in rainwater ditches tainted with sewage, and she
sees them drink from it _ snapshots of home.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on Sunday, she dresses her children in gleaming white.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do with them in Haiti?'' she said. Pierre
will make her choice only when she absolutely must. A stay that has
prevented her deportation could evaporate at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``How will they live?'' Pierre said. ``Children are always sick
in Haiti.''
</P>
<P>
   The same questions haunt Mary France, a 21-year-old sales clerk
who lives in Fort Lauderdale. She and her husband are under a
deportation order, for the same reason as Pierre. They came here on
an altered passport in 1995. They have a 5-year-old boy, Ronald.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way can I take him with me,'' France said, also speaking in
the office of her Miami lawyer. ``No way can I leave him here. If I
go, I don't have a job, I don't have money. He can't even go to
school.'' She looks across the room at her son, and imagines him in
the place she fled.
</P>
<P>
   She began to shake her head, hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She will decide at the last minute, too. Like Pierre, she does
not have anybody here to look after her child. To leave them means
placing them in state care.
</P>
<P>
   In the anguish of Pierre and France, Cinette Dorias sees her
future. Dorias, who lives in Delray Beach with her husband, Rigaud
Moise, and three children, also faces deportation. But her case,
like her husband's, is not so far along in the process. Only one of
their children, Rickerson, 5, is a U.S. citizen. She has not
decided, but believes she is incapable of splitting up her family
and leaving him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here 10 years,'' Dorias said. ``I work, in a
nursing home and in home care, and I pay my taxes and bills. We
have bought a house _ the back yard is nice _ and save our money.
If I was not Haitian, if I was your sister, would they still send
me home?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Ray, an immigration lawyer and president of the South
Florida chapter of the Immigration Lawyers Association, said the
Haitian mothers face more than poverty, filth and hardship in
Haiti, as will the children if they take them back. One of the
first things immigration lawyers try to prove is that their clients
are political refugees and try to get them asylum, lawyers said,
but that is difficult to prove.
</P>
<P>
   His client, Pierre, is a political refugee, Ray said, but has
not been granted asylum. In Haiti, she and her boyfriend, Samuel
Congas, were once supporters of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the elected
president who was ousted in a bloody coup in October of 1991 and
then returned, after years of bloodshed in Haiti, in a U.S.
occupation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Their home, in Port-au-Prince, had a picture of Aristide painted
on a wall. In August 1992, opponents of Aristide arrived armed with
pistols and machetes and dragged Congas out into the night.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, she said, she searched for him, and even went to
Titanyen, an infamous place north of the city where countless dead,
murdered over decades of despotic rule, are buried. The rain and
the rooting pigs sometimes uncover the dead there, but she did not
find him.
</P>
<P>
   She had fled their house and hid with family and, when she
thought it was safe, used a passport with a new name spliced over
her own to escape the country. As soon as she arrived in Miami, she
told immigration officials her real name, believing they would
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a life or death matter,'' said Ray. If Pierre returns,
he said, she goes back within reach of the people who drove her
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I close my eyes at night,'' she said, ``and the men come into
my house again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorias' husband, Moise, was a soldier who refused to shoot into
a crowd of Aristide supporters at a pro-democracy demonstration in
August 1990. He was arrested and served five months in prison, then
got his family out by plane. ``I was marked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Rickerson, believes violence happens only on
television.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, as Haitian-Americans are bombarded with news of Elian
Gonzalez, they are not sure public opinion has ever been on their
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child should remain with its parents,'' said Micheline
Ducena, the executive director of the Haitian Organization of Women
in Miami, repeating the U.S. government's legal justification for
reuniting Elian and his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if Elian were Haitian,'' she said, ``he would have been
sent back a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre dreads the day when immigration officials order her to
the Miami airport. She is allowed to take with her just one bag of
44 pounds or less. She has not decided if she will have to bring
baby clothes.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tiny remnant of the American peace movement had
a little money and was looking for a voice in the political
process. The pharmaceutical industry had a lot of money and was
looking for a bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
   Both found it in an obscure corner of the Internal Revenue Code
known as Section 527, a provision that provides a means for groups
to raise and spend unlimited sums on political activities without
any disclosure, as long as they do not expressly advocate voting
for a candidate. Section 527 has become the loophole of choice this
year for groups large and small, left and right, to spread their
messages without revealing the sources of their income or the
objects of their spending.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was written into the tax code more than 25 years
ago as a way of protecting most income of political parties from
taxation. But only recently, after court rulings and IRS opinions
broadened its scope, has it been exploited by nonprofit political
organizations trying to avoid the donor disclosure rules and
contribution limits of federal election laws.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans for Clean Air, the group that broadcast
advertisements critical of Sen. John McCain of Arizona in several
states before the Super Tuesday primaries, was established under
Section 527 by Sam Wyly, a Texas businessman and big contributor to
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, which is led by Ben
Cohen, a founder of Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream, has set up a 527
committee to agitate in 10 congressional races for less spending on
weapons and more spending on schools, Duane Peterson, vice
president of the group, said last week. He declined to say which
races the group planned to focus on.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, a Section 527 entity calling itself Shape the
Debate began broadcasting television commercials in California, New
York and Washington that call Vice President Al Gore a political
hypocrite and ridicule his positions on campaign finance reform and
tobacco. The group, which expects to raise $2 million to $3 million
this year, was formed by allies of Pete Wilson, the former
Republican governor of California.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Shape the Debate's officers are $1,000 contributors to
Bush, but the group's founder, George Gorton, said the organization
had no ties to the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Following an IRS ruling last year that essentially endorsed the
practice, conservative lawmakers, liberal interest groups, rich
individuals and large corporations have begun to quietly pour tens
of millions of dollars into the political cauldron. The
organizations say they plan to use the money for advertising,
polling, telephone banks and direct mail appeals _ all the major
functions of a candidate committee or a political party, but
without any requirements for public disclosure or accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no law requiring these groups to report their
existence, neither the Federal Election Commission nor the Internal
Revenue Service can say how many are now in place. But lawyers who
set them up and campaign finance specialists say that scores of
527's exist today and more are being created every week.
</P>
<P>
   Their full impact will probably not be seen until the fall, when
the airwaves will most likely be filled with advertisements from
previously unknown organizations, mirroring the 11th-hour attack on
McCain by Republicans for Clean Air.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Better Medicare, a group created last summer under
Section 527 by major drug makers and allied organizations, expects
to spend as much as $30 million this year to oppose legislation
that the industry thinks will impose government price controls on
medicines, the group's officers say.
</P>
<P>
   The group's plans include a national campaign of political
advertising this fall, said Timothy C. Ryan, its executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Peace Action, the antiwar group once known as SANE/Freeze,
created a 527 operation called the Peace Voter Fund late last year
to try to influence the debate this year in eight congressional
races, including the Senate races in New Jersey and Michigan and
contests for House seats in Michigan, California Illinois and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's $250,000 in seed money came from a handful of wealthy
benefactors who insisted on remaining in the shadows, said Van
Gosse, organizing director of Peace Action.
</P>
<P>
   Gosse speaks rhapsodically of the virtues of Section 527. It
offers freedom from the requirements of Federal Election Commission
reporting, he noted, and relief from the Internal Revenue Service
rules on political activity by charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Gosse said he would not reveal the names of his major donors.
``That's the whole point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike a PAC,'' he added, referring to political action
committees, which are regulated by the election commission because
they work directly on behalf of candidates, ``there's no cap on how
much you can spend or accept. There's no IRS gift tax or reporting.
It's a thing of beauty from an organizing perspective. It gives one
a lot of freedom and fluidity.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as a Section 527 group does not expressly advocate the
election or defeat of individual candidates _ by using the words
``vote for'' or ``vote against'' _ there is no requirement to
report to the Federal Election Commission. These groups are free to
engage in ``issue advocacy,'' which to most voters has become
virtually indistinguishable from pro-candidate electioneering.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new ad by Shape the Debate could easily pass for an
attack ad sponsored by the Bush campaign as it concludes with the
line, ``Al Gore has a lot to answer for.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of campaign finance reform see the 527 loophole as a
pernicious and proliferating vehicle for getting and spending tens
of millions of undisclosed dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new Section 527 organizations are a campaign vehicle now
ready for mass production,'' Frances R. Hill, a professor of law at
the University of Miami, wrote in a recent issue of Tax Notes, a
publication for taxation specialists. The 1996 election was marked
by concerns and scandals over the unregulated contributions known
as soft money, she noted. ``The 2000 federal election may be
equally important in campaign finance history for the flowering of
the new Section 527 organizations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore called for disclosure of the officers and finances of
Section 527 organizations as part of his campaign finance proposal
released this week. He called such groups ``the equivalent of Swiss
bank accounts for campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, is preparing legislation to
regulate Section 527 organizations, requiring, at a minimum,
disclosure of contributors and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, our political system is being polluted with
substantial amounts of secret contributions and secret expenditures
used to attack candidates,'' Doggett said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' bipartisan Joint Taxation Committee has recommended
steps to open 527 organizations to greater public scrutiny by,
among other things, publishing their tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is not likely to act quickly on any proposal to rein in
such groups, Doggett said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Tom DeLay of Texas and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, both
Republicans, have established 527 funds to burnish their party's
image and promote conservative ideas on taxation, the military and
education. Former Rep. Pat Saiki of Hawaii has created Citizens for
the Republican Congress as another safe haven for anonymous big
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's presidential campaign in
1996, has established a 527 group to attract Hispanic voters to the
Republican Party. Newt Gingrich is affiliated with a 527
organization advocating Social Security reform and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Recently, attention has focused on the Section 527 operations of
conservatives. But the Sierra Club was one of the first nonprofit
organizations to set up a 527 subsidiary, in 1996, and the League
of Conservation Voters, which is generally partial to Democrats,
followed a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree it's a loophole,'' said Carl Pope, executive director
of the Sierra Club. He said a handful of wealthy, anonymous donors
had given about $4.5 million to the Sierra Club's 527 committee to
use during this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Pope said that his organization would support legislation to
eliminate the loophole, but that until then the Sierra Club
intended to keep using its 527 political fund.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Gallant, an adviser to DeLay, said conservatives began to
get into the game in a big way after a San Francisco law firm that
represents liberal nonprofit organizations announced last April
that it had been successful in setting up a 527 political
organization for one of its clients. Gallant set up DeLay's 527
group, the Republican Issues Majority Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has begun hiring workers and has been spending
to mobilize conservative voters in two dozen competitive
congressional districts, Gallant said. The group expects to spend
$25 million this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 was added to the tax code in 1974, primarily to
clarify the tax status of purely political, nonprofit
organizations, including the Democratic and Republican national
parties and PACs. Under the provision, they do not pay taxes on
contributions from donors, only on investment income. But the
parties and PACs are required to report donations and expenditures
to the election commission.
</P>
<P>
   While these organizations are exempt from taxation,
contributions to them are not tax deductible.
</P>
<P>
   The pure Section 527 organizations like those proliferating
today operate in a protected niche of the tax code governing
political groups, but because they do not advocate on behalf of an
individual candidate or candidates, they fall short of FEC
disclosure laws. That is what distinguishes them from a political
party or a PAC. Donations are not tax deductible, but the groups'
contributions and expenditures do not have to be disclosed to the
IRS or the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, a convergence of factors caused many nonprofit
organizations to embrace this kind of vehicle to cover their
political activities, said Greg Colvin, a San Francisco lawyer who
set up some of the first 527 organizations, for liberal groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donors were looking for a way to put large, anonymous money
into organizations that would have a political effect,'' he said.
He added that many groups were eager to flex their political muscle
beyond what was permissible under their tax-exempt status without
triggering a requirement to report their activities to the election
commission. And last year the IRS issued an opinion in the case of
one of the groups Colvin represented, endorsing the use of Section
527 by a wide range of political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in prompting the interest in Section 527 was a
ruling last year by the IRS denying tax-exempt status to the
Christian Coalition because of its political activities.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who specialize in campaign and tax law have been
approaching groups of all ideological stripes for the last several
months, selling them on the benefits of Section 527.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Norquist, the executive director of Americans for Tax
Reform, a conservative antitax group, said that a lawyer had
recently offered to set up a 527 arm for him for $500.
</P>
<P>
   Norquist said that at first the new structure did not appear to
offer any advantages over his current nonprofit status. But when
the law was explained to him more fully he said, ``Maybe I should
have two.''

GENOME SCIENTIST URGES COLLEAGUES TO CULTIVATE TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Admitting that the biotech industry bungled its effort
to win popular acceptance of genetically modified foods, a leading
genome scientist Tuesday warned that such episodes will happen
again and again unless companies and researchers begin serious
public discussions about the ethics and safety of their work.
</P>
<P>
   Simply advising, ``We're scientists _ trust us'' is a tactic
``that just doesn't wash,'' said Eric S. Lander, director of the
Whitehead/MIT Center for Genome Research, one of the laboratories
trying to decipher the entire human genetic blueprint. ``The
industry ought to be out in front on the issues instead of behind
them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, ``We ain't done a good job'' on creating
acceptance of (genetically modified) foods, Lander said. ``We don't
have the public trust on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lander's criticisms at the Bio2000 conference in Boston followed
two days of protests against biotechnology, much of it centered on
plants that have been genetically modified to grow faster, resist
pests, or have other desirable traits. Four men were arrested
Monday for allegedly dumping what they said were genetically
modified soybeans in front of the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Some biotech industry officials said they fear that the mounting
attacks on genetically modified food could bring a broader backlash
against biotechnology _ from using genes to treat diseases to
cloning animals and human body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as Lander called for greater candor, others at the
biotechnology conference worried that greater public disclosure
about genetically modified foods could tarnish the industry, rather
than help it.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, food industry leaders fear that labels
identifying products containing genetically modified ingredients
would scare consumers away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the surgeon general's warning on cigarettes,''
said Gene Grabowski, spokesman for Grocery Manufacturers of
America, referring to a square warning label that would be required
on biogenetic foods under a bill introduced in Congress by
Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Lander said the public's ignorance is an important part of the
biotechnology industry's public relations problems.
</P>
<P>
   The public is ``deeply, deeply uneducated,'' Lander said. Unless
some respected agency such as the National Academy of Sciences
clarifies the complex issues for the public, ``We're going to be
constantly fighting over a constant stream of issues _ some of them
crazy, some not _ in an endless series of soundbites,'' Lander
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other current biotech controversy, gene therapy, has been
clouded by the death of a patient last year from an experimental
treatment, as well as the subsequent shut down of several gene
therapy trials by the government. While Lander did not fault the
industry for this public relations disaster, Lander that the field
was unprepared for it.
</P>
<P>
   Also featured at the forum Tuesday, sponsored by the Whitehead
Institute, was Dr. Philip Reilly, a physician and lawyer who
directs the Shriver Center for Mental Retardation in Belmont. Like
Lander, Reilly offered a more nuanced view of public distrust of
biotechnology than has been expressed by officials of the
Biotechnology Industry Organization, who have generally dismissed
the demonstrators' concerns as being based on ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who has consulted with biotechcompanies on ethical and
social issues, called on the industry to become far more involved
in educating young people about their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have every biotechnology (company) in America adopt 10
high school biology teachers'' and update the educators on the
changing field.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically modified foods are only one area with the potential
to alarm the public because of biotech's expanding powers, Reilly
said. He compared the use of biotech-based prenatal testing for
birth defects and other medical problems to the eugenics movements
earlier in the century that tried to ``improve'' the gene pool by
limiting reproduction of those considered sub-par.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prenatal testing goes to the heart of religious beliefs of
people in this country,'' Reilly said.``There is a kind of eugenics
implicit in this, but more insidious than in the past.'' Prenatal
testing, he added, ``is technologically enhanced,
physician-enabled, and consumer driven. What does this mean for how
we conceive of ourselves and those who are less fortunate than
us?''

CHINA TRADE BILL SUPPORTERS PUSHING FOR MAY VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unless the China trade bill comes up for a vote by
May, it could be delayed until next year, putting it at serious
risk, the measure's Democratic vote counter in the House predicted
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The trade advocate, Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif.,, said support
for granting China permanent normal trading privileges was eroding
among House Democrats as labor unions increased their opposition to
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a vote, but it may not be this year,'' Matsui
said in an interview, underscoring his remarks on Monday at a trade
forum.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats and administration officials said Matsui's
comments were intended to pressure Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois to schedule a floor vote before the Memorial Day recess,
when members of Congress return to their districts and could be
subject to more intense lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have sent mixed signals about when the
bill would be brought to a vote, at first agreeing to late May but
then suggesting that June was more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Passage is virtually assured in the trade-friendly Senate,
although some Democrats may want the political cover of a separate
bill that enhances military cooperation between the United States
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, has not scheduled a vote
on the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act in the Senate, saying he
does not want to worsen regional tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the Taiwan security bill last month, with many
Democrats joining in the lopsided vote as a means of showing
support for a robust defense of Taiwan. Some House Democrats are
weighing whether they now may be able to balance that vote with one
for legislation that would reward China with the trade privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's effort to have Congress surrender its
annual vote on China trade faces a much tougher fight in the House.
Many legislators oppose rewarding Beijing at a time when opponents
criticize China's record on human rights, job conditions for
workers and environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters want a vote by Memorial Day for two reasons. First,
they want to avoid politicizing the vote further by distancing it
from the parties' nominating conventions in August. Second, the
regular annual renewal of China's trading status comes up on June
3, meaning that a vote in June would give Congress three choices,
an outright no, annual renewal or permanent privileges.
</P>
<P>
   That would present a confusing array of choices to Congress, and
supporters fear that in such an environment Congress would take the
easy way out, choosing the annual extension.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials sought to play down Matsui's remarks as
nothing new, insisting that the administration had been pressing
Republican leaders for a quick vote for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always believed that if we do not have this in May, it
will be very difficult to pass,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley,
the administration's point man on the measure, said. ``I think just
about everyone involved agrees with this conclusion. Any time after
May, the odds get very small.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and other House Republican leaders have insisted that
House Democrats produce at least 90 to 100 votes before scheduling
the decisive floor vote, both to ensure victory and to spread the
political liability more evenly. As many as 150 Republicans are
expected to vote for the measure, which would give China permanent
low-tariff access to the United States market, the same treatment
that most other trading partners receive.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui said having 90 to 100 Democrats back the measure in an
Election Year was unrealistic. He said 70 to 80 was more likely.
But Matsui and other backers of the bill said they could not pin
down the scores of uncommitted lawmakers until a voting date had
been set. That would dispel any lingering notion that lawmakers
might be spared having to take sides on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the top vote counter for
Democrats opposed to permanent trading status, is widely expected
to release the names of about 15 Democrats who have voted for
trading relations annually but would oppose permanent status.
</P>
<P>
   At least five are freshmen, Shelly Berkley of Nevada, Joseph
Crowley of New York, Joseph Hoeffel of Pennsylvania, Rush Holt of
New Jersey and Ronnie Shows of Mississippi.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ After two days of disputes, OPEC decided on
Wednesday to increase oil production without the participation of
its second-largest producer, Iran. But the announced increase was
not what the United States had pressed for, and was not expected to
bring down gasoline prices anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare break in the solidarity of its ranks, the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that nine of its 11
members would raise production by a total of 1.45 million barrels a
day, despite bitter opposition from Iran to any increase.
</P>
<P>
   With Iran, the total would have been about 1.7 million barrels,
but analysts said the actual increase would end up at the higher
level because other OPEC members were likely to seize the
opportunity to cheat on their quotas to fill the gap left by Iran.
The production of Iraq is governed separately by U.N. resolutions
since the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had pressed for increases of up to 2.5 million
barrels a day to reduce gasoline prices, which have soared to an
average of about $1.60 a gallon in most cities. Iran's irritation
at the American pressures was apparently a major reason behind its
opposition to any increase.
</P>
<P>
   But experts estimated that it would take at least six to eight
weeks before any increase in oil production finds its way to the
gasoline pumps, and with inventories already unusually low in the
United States ahead of the summer driving season, gasoline prices
will not soon decline. In fact, some analysts predicted, they would
rise still more before easing in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who expects to get back to gasoline at $1 or $1.20 a
gallon will be seriously disappointed,'' said Raad Alkadiri, an
analyst at Petroleum Finance Co., an industry research firm based
in Washington. ``Whatever happens, you're going to have a tight
gasoline market this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual break in OPEC ranks came after two days of wrangling
between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the largest producer, which pushed
for an increase in production.
</P>
<P>
   The fissure has major implications for the United States, which
has waged a heavy lobbying campaign to persuade OPEC members on the
need for a substantial increase.
</P>
<P>
   The battle within OPEC was as much political as economic, and
much of the debate was over whether the group would be capitulating
to pressure from the United States for lower oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   It was OPEC's decision to cut production last year, joined in by
several non-OPEC nations like Mexico and Norway, that sent oil and
gasoline prices soaring to their highest levels in years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's fissure could severely damage OPEC's discipline and
credibility, just as the organization seemed to have regained some
of the power it had during the 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, accused the other
OPEC countries of trying to ram through decisions that were not
justified by economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC is not an organization to rubberstamp the decisions
already made,'' Zangeneh said in a short but biting statement about
1 a.m. Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to show our flexibility,'' he continued. ``OPEC needs
a spirit of compromise which unfortunately we didn't trace at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   If OPEC's discipline does come unhinged, the United States could
be a major beneficiary by seeing its bill for imported oil drop
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's split comes after a bitter test of wills between
Iran and Saudi Arabia, which was determined to reverse last year's
price cuts and allow the price of oil settle at about $25 a barrel,
compared to about $27.50 today and its recent high of $34 in early
March.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the battle within OPEC was about whether countries could
or would be seen as capitulating to heavy-handed American demands.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials adamantly wanted to raise prices, in part
because the United States is its biggest market and in part because
of concern about political wrath from Congress, where some
lawmakers have pushed for legislation to block aid and sales of
military equipment to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian leaders, on the other hand, had angrily denounced
American demands and insisted that OPEC should not decide in
response to political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, Iran had nothing to gain from an
increase in total production. Analysts, as well as Saudi leaders,
argued here that Iran is already producing virtually all the oil it
can pump, about 3 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, any increase in production would come from other
countries _Saudi Arabia in particular _ and merely lead to lower
prices for what Iran was already selling.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia with daily output of 7.6 million barrels, has
enough spare capacity to flood world markets in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials, alarmed when prices suddenly surged recently to
around $30 a barrel, adamantly demanded an increase in OPEC output
that would prevent worldwide shortages and stabilize prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been lobbying OPEC leaders
intensively for the last several weeks, arguing that the world
markets needed as much as 2.5 million extra barrels a day to meet
demand and to restore depleted inventories.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear that OPEC would not go that far, but Saudi
Arabia had managed to convinced all other members except Iran to
reverse the cuts that had imposed on themselves last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the agreement on Wednesday, many OPEC leaders were
still fuming about what they view as heavy-handed pressure from
Washington that only made their own political situation more
awkward.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan leaders, taking a cue from their president, Hugo
Chavez, have been particularly sensitive about being portrayed as
puppets of the American government, and went out of their way last
week to criticize lobbying efforts by Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson. Venezuela is one of the top suppliers of crude oil to
the United States.

EXILES SAY THEY WOULD DIE TO KEEP CUBAN BOY IN THE U.S.
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On a day when people vowed to die for Elian Gonzalez and
his relatives said the Virgin Mary had reappeared on his bedroom
mirror, U.S. immigration officials and his Miami relatives remained
in a standoff Tuesday over the government's demand that his
great-uncle promise to turn the 6-year-old boy over to federal
officials if they lose the court fight to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials Tuesday morning continued to press lawyers
for the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to encourage him to
sign a document agreeing to a peaceful, orderly resolution to the
emotionally charged situation if the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals rules against the family in a hearing in May.
</P>
<P>
   The family lashed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `If you don't sign the paper, we remove Elian,'''
said Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the family. ``They are the
ones who put this kid in Lazaro's home and they just want him to
sign a blank statement, which is not the American way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know whether Gonzalez, an automobile
mechanic, would agree to sign the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials were to meet on Wednesday with Gonzalez
and ask him, face to face, to comply. If the family continues to
defy immigration officials, the agency could remove the boy from
the home as early as Thursday at 9 a.m., government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But that could be more difficult than it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   As lawyers continued their war of words behind closed doors and
television microphones, Elian's increasingly dramatic, poignant
saga became increasingly heated and strange.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house, where a group of about 50 Cuban exiles have
kept an around-the-clock vigil, several people warned that, no
matter what papers are signed, they do not intend to allow anyone
to take the boy away, even if that means dying for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid of Clinton, of Janet Reno or of the police,''
said Jose Ramos, an elderly Cuban American retiree who stood guard
outside the house on Northwest Second Street in Little Havana. ``I
will die for Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   He echoed the feelings of many people here who said they would
form human chains, lie down in front of cars and form walls with
their bodies to protect Elian from the Immigration Service, agents
of Cuban President Fidel Castro and anyone else who tries to take
him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a battle between good and evil, and right now America is
evil,'' said Dulce Gonzalez, no relation to Elian, a retired school
teacher who came to Miami from Cuba 30 years ago. ``Today, we are
destroying our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Good Morning America'' on Tuesday, viewers got another look
at Elian and Diane Sawyer coloring and playing games, as ABC
offered the second installment of a three-part series in which
Sawyer and Elian spoke about his ordeal and stood on their heads.
Sawyer said Elian told her he wanted to stay in Miami, but a
network spokesman said ABC did not air that segment because of the
incendiary nature of the confrontation between the government and
the boy's family.
</P>
<P>
   And, in perhaps the most unusual development, relatives
continued to claim that the Virgin Mary had appeared to them in a
mirror in Elian's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore dismissed a
lawsuit requesting a political asylum hearing for Elian, and said
that only Reno could grant him asylum. Reno said he should be
returned, as soon as possible, to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Elian's Miami family have said that, if the father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, came to Miami to get the boy, and if Elian
wanted to go, they would allow it.
</P>
<P>
   But experts on immigration say they doubt the family has any
intention of giving the boy up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a standoff, but this is crunch time for INS,''
said Max Castro, a senior research associate for the Dante B.
Fascell North-South Center of the University of Miami, and an
expert on Cuban issues. ``INS is going to have to execute this in
some way.''
</P>
<P>
   If they waver, the family will just stall and stall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found floating off the coast of Fort Lauderdale on an
inner tube on Thanksgiving Day, after his boat capsized, killing
his mother and 10 others. Two others, both adults, also survived,
but it is Elian who has been the center of attention since.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have said they do not want to traumatize
the boy by forcibly removing him from the home, and nor do they
want to antagonize the city's large Cuban American population.
Cuban Americans make up more than 700,000 of Miami-Dade County's
2.1 million people.
</P>
<P>
   It may be too late for that. Demonstrators outside the boy's
house warned that bad days were coming for the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very angry,'' said Arturo Perez, another retiree who is
spending his days outside the house. ``We are going to stop
Miami.''

ABC PRESIDENT QUITS FOR INTERNET FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patricia Fili-Krushel, the first woman to run a
broadcast television network as president of ABC, is quitting the
network to join the Internet health care company Healtheon/WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel, who was the highest ranking woman executive in the
television business, will become the president and chief executive
of Healtheon's consumer division, WebMDHealth. The move, combined
with the promotion of Robert A. Iger last January from president of
ABC Inc. to president of Walt Disney Co., ABC's corporate parent,
means that both of ABC's top two management positions have opened
up this year.
</P>
<P>
   Iger named Alex Wallau, currently the president of
administration and operations for ABC, to head the network on an
interim basis. Fili-Krushel's appointment at Healtheon is effective
April 10.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD, started four years ago by James H. Clark, the
founder of Netscape, is the biggest company that offers to link
consumers, doctors, hospitals and health plans through Internet
connections, but its own executives say there will be no profits
for at least several years.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 30-year-old chief executive, Jeffrey T. Arnold,
has been a nonstop deal-maker who forged more than 80 deals in the
last 18 months. In the latest, Healtheon bought two competitors,
Medical Manager Corp. and CareInsite Inc., last month for $5.2
billion in Healtheon stock.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said in a telephone interview Tuesday that Fili-Krushel's
experience running ABC ``made her incredibly valuable and the ideal
person to manage the media assets and drive our offline consumers
to our Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the company's media assets are the Health Net cable
channels, weekly programs on the Fox News Channel and the Fox
Sports Channel, and extensive advertising joint venture agreements
with both the Fox network and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel, who is 45, said that a combination of factors led
her to jump from ABC to Healtheon, including the lure of working in
new media and what she called the ``blue chip people'' running the
Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent a lot of time in traditional media and I was
looking at new media,'' she said. ``But there are so many companies
that are risky. These people are big players. This company is the
gorilla of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   But another factor in her decision was the order imposed by
Disney Co. that required virtually all the top management of ABC to
move from New York to Los Angeles, the home city for Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel, who is the mother of two school-age children, said
that ``having to move to L.A. was a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to the ABC management Tuesday, Iger praised
Fili-Krushel's performance at the network, acknowledged that she
was accepting a ``terrific opportunity'' and cited the fact that
she and her family preferred ``to stay in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel had been widely credited with managing the network
well in her 18 months in the position, especially for her handling
of negotiations with the network's affiliated stations, which
resulted in a settlement favorable to ABC last June.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think I've done a great job here,'' Fili-Krushel said.
``This was obviously a tough decision. But when a company is on top
is the time to take a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that the future of broadcast networks is still in
doubt. ``The broadcast model is still in transition,'' she said.
``ABC will make a lot of money this year but it doesn't make the
problems of the high cost of programming and the ever-eroding
audiences go away. There are a lot of issues still to be tackled.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be issues to tackle at Healtheon as well, she
acknowledged. Both she and Arnold said that her primary assignment
will be to manage the company's media assets in a way that will
drive up profits. ``They need people who can help them execute,''
Fili-Krushel said.
</P>
<P>
   That remains the hard part of Healtheon's aggressive strategy:
putting it all together and attracting and retaining customers.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting Wall Street's concerns, Healtheon's stock price has
been on a rollercoaster, zooming to $126.1875 in Nasdaq trading
last May 20 and dropping in less than 90 days to a 12-month low of
$28.25 on Aug. 11. The stock closed at $32.0625 Tuesday, down
$2.125 for the day.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ There is no dispute that a drug-addicted
drifter named Philip Ray Workman robbed a Wendy's restaurant in
Memphis on the night of Aug. 5, 1981. There also is no question
that Workman, armed with a .45-caliber pistol, exchanged fire with
Memphis police officers as he fled and that Lt. Ronald Oliver was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   But 18 years after Workman's conviction for felony murder, there
is now an intriguing dispute over whether the bullet that killed
Oliver was fired by Workman or by one of two other police officers
on the scene. The resolution to that question may determine whether
Workman will become the first man to be executed by the state of
Tennessee in 40 years. He is scheduled to die on April 6 unless the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals grants him a new evidentiary
hearing or Gov. Don Sundquist grants him clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Because the execution would be the first since Tennessee
reinstated the death penalty in 1977, Workman's conviction has
received far more public scrutiny than capital cases in surrounding
states where executions have become commonplace. Among the 38
states that have the death penalty, only four _ New Hampshire,
South Dakota, Connecticut and New Mexico _ have gone longer without
an execution.
</P>
<P>
   The Workman case is set against a national backdrop of growing
attention to wrongful capital convictions. In Illinois, so many
death penalty convictions have been exposed as faulty that Gov.
George Ryan has suspended executions until the process can be
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   As Workman's execution date approaches, his lawyers are working
frantically to convince both the federal judges and Sundquist, a
Republican, that there are problems with his conviction. The only
eyewitness to testify at Workman's trial recanted last year and
prominent ballistic experts have said they doubt that the bullet
could have come from Workman's gun.
</P>
<P>
   The state's attorney general, Paul Summers, a Democrat, is
working just as intensely to keep the execution on track. He said
none of the defense arguments have shaken his conviction that
Workman is guilty. He resents the defense's suggestion that
Tennessee politicians are sacrificing due diligence in their rush
to join the country's other state executioners.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here Tuesday at Riverbend state prison, the
46-year-old Workman said he believed that the political imperative
to execute had overwhelmed any sense of fairness. He gave himself a
1 percent chance of winning legal relief, but said his conversion
to Christianity a decade ago had made him ``as ready as I'm going
to get'' to face death.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are frustrated and that's understandable,'' said
Workman, who was shackled. ``They're frustrated with crime and the
frustration of 40 years since there's been an execution. People
say, `Well if it's on the books it needs to be utilized.' But
unfortunately finality seems to be more important than what the
facts may actually bear out.''
</P>
<P>
   Workman, who is represented by a state-financed office for
indigent capital defense, has accumulated an interesting coalition
of advocates. His lawyers convinced 5 of the 12 jurors in his trial
to sign statements saying they would not have convicted Workman of
first-degree murder had they heard the new evidence. One of the
five state Supreme Court justices who declined in January to block
the execution issued a partial dissent calling for Sundquist to
commute the sentence because of ``extenuating circumstances.'' The
dead policeman's daughter, Paula Dodillet, who was 11 when he was
killed, is pleading for the state to show mercy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Dodillet sat with Workman's daughter, Chrystal
Michelle Workman-Burnham, at a news conference. ``Taking her father
will not bring mine back,'' Dodillet said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that the defense is grandstanding and that
its claims are flimsy. Last fall, Summers suggested that it did not
even matter whether Workman fired the fatal shot. He still could
have been convicted of the capital offense of felony murder _ a
murder that takes place in the commission of another felony _
because he clearly committed the armed robbery that led to Oliver's
death, the attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, Summers acknowledged that the Tennessee
courts have not resolved that question. ``We're not addressing that
argument because that's not what happened,'' he said, referring to
the possibility of friendly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his prosecution, Workman simply assumed that he had
fired the fatal shot. It passed through the officer's torso, but
investigators could never definitively identify the death slug.
</P>
<P>
   Workman says he was trying to surrender when he was hit on the
head and involuntarily fired two shots. ``I pulled the trigger,''
he testified at his trial. ``I had my hand around the gun, and I
guess it was pointed at the officers.'' His defense was focused on
convincing the jury that his judgment was so clouded by cocaine
that he was not responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The other two officers on the scene, Aubrey K. Stoddard and
Stephen C. Parker, maintained at the trial and again in interviews
Tuesday that they never fired their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Both former officers said they were offended by the defense's
implication that they colluded to cover up a death by friendly
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my whole life prosecuting criminals, including
public officials for perjury and abusing their power,'' said
Parker, who is now an assistant U.S. Attorney in Memphis. ``Now
they're accusing me of being a murderer and a perjurer, even though
they know the evidence points the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence that could be most troubling for the state is a
videotaped perjury confession by Harold Davis, a drifter and the
only bystander to testify that he saw Workman shoot Oliver. Found
by defense lawyer Jefferson T. Dorsey in a Phoenix motel last fall,
Davis now says he heard shots from a distance but never saw the
shooting. When he volunteered his help to police on the day after
the shooting, they coached him, he now says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically told me what happened, how it happened, when it
happened,'' Davis says on the videotape. ``I said, `Well, I didn't
see all that.' They said, `Well, this is what you're going to
say.'''
</P>
<P>
   Curry Todd, a former Memphis police officer who is now a state
representative, denied in an interview exerting any such influence
when he took Davis' statement.
</P>
<P>
   Summers dismissed Davis, who has changed his story regularly
over the years, as ``a throwaway witness'' and argued that Workman
would have been convicted without the Davis testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The new theory in the Workman case was first developed when one
of his appellate lawyers noticed that Oliver's autopsy had
concluded that the exit wound was smaller than the entrance wound.
That was curious, the lawyer thought, given that Workman was firing
hollow-point bullets, which typically mushroom upon impact.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, the defense solicited reports from two respected
forensic pathologists, who concluded that Oliver's wounds were
inconsistent with Workman's ammunition. The state has countered
with its own expert, who wrote that hollow-point bullets do not
always expand as intended.
</P>
<P>
   In a previous rejection of Workman's appeal, the 6th Circuit
judges suggested that the death slug may have fragmented, which
would explain the smaller exit wound. But an X-ray of the corpse,
produced by the Shelby County medical examiner only this month
after years of requests by the defense team, showed no
fragmentation.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has accused prosecutors of deliberately hiding the
X-ray. The state blames the mistake on a clerical filing error.

DRUG ENTREPRENEURS MAKE THEIR PITCH FOR CASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Rogers said he was embarrassed to tell the crowd
how little venture money he's managed to raise so far for his
company, AquaGene Inc.: a mere $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to show this in Boston and Silicon Valley,'' said
Rogers, speaking before a group of potential corporate clients and
investors at the Bio 2000 conference. ``What we need today is an
investor or a partner, or both.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything below $1 million is spare change when venture
capitalists are raising billion-dollar funds _ mostly for
Internet-related startups _ and biotechnology is a hot industry.
Many of the drug entrepreneurs have come to Boston this week not
just to show off possible genetic cures for cancer, Alzheimer's,
and AIDS, but to gun for money.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as easy as it would seem.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has been having a hard time drumming up $500,000 to $2
million for his ``designer proteins'' for cancer therapy, despite
claiming a niche he says no one else is exploiting _ farming human
protein from genetically engineered fish. He said his
disease-fighting proteins will be cheaper than those harvested from
goats or cows.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers blames the problem largely on his headquarters location,
in Alachua, Fla. ``We have extraordinarily low costs,'' is the
upside, he said. But, ``We have an extraordinarily hard time
raising money. There's no venture capital in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's mainstream venture capitalists, and even many of those
with an interest in biotechnology, are skipping the conference this
week, saying it's a waste of their time. However, the specialists
are attending, as are legions of big drugmakers, who could enter a
joint venture with a small firm like AquaGene.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have a big company as a customer, then when I call the
Boston venture capitalists, they'll ask me to stop by to see
them,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, biotechnology startups were attracting big
money from venture capitalists. Boston was a hub of such investing,
with important research coming out of Harvard Medical School and
Massachusetts General Hospital in particular. Then came the
Internet craze.
</P>
<P>
   Most venture firms with any high-tech expertise at all shifted
their focus to Internet startups, where the rewards have been huge,
thanks to initial public offerings that flew off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, New England biotech firms were reaping about 12 percent
of the venture money in the market, according to a study by
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm. By
1999, that number had shrunk to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Total dollars being invested in biotechnology have nearly
doubled in that period, to $121.8 million. But total venture
dollars in New England have surged sevenfold, to $4.14 billion,
with large portions of that money going into software, new media,
and Web companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fewer people doing (biotech) today than five years
ago,'' said James Cavanaugh, president of HealthCare Ventures, a
Princeton, N.J., venture firm with a Cambridge office. ``Most of
them dropped health care.''
</P>
<P>
   But not Cavanaugh's firm. He appeared on a panel at the
conference Monday, discussing the economics of biotechnology before
a packed audience. He concludes that there is growing interest in
the next generation of drugs, which tackle cancer as well as
diseases of the central nervous system, particularly Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   As baby boomers live longer, helped by advances in therapies to
combat heart disease and cancer, there will be a growing demand to
treat ailments of the nervous system, Cavanaugh predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The hurdle, as always, will be raising funds to finance the
research and development of such treatments, he said. This is no
overnight effort like a consumer Web site with some banner
advertisements. Bringing a drug to market can take years.
</P>
<P>
   HealthCare Ventures boasts a 90 percent investment return on its
fifth fund. That used to be something to brag about, Cavanaugh
said, before dot-com investments started yielding triple-digit
returns in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit humbling to show your limited partners those
returns when the guys who went in before you had 100 percent
returns or more,'' Cavanaugh said.

 Theodore K. Rabb is a professor of history at Princeton University.
A new due out this year.  
 By THEODORE K. RABB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In a famous letter he addressed to the Roman
historian Livy in 1350, Petrarch expressed a longing that was to
become central to Renaissance culture: ``I would wish either that I
had been born in your age, or you in ours. I should thank you,
though, that you have so often caused me to forget present evils
and have transported me to happier times.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading Livy, the Tuscan man of letters could feel himself join
the company of Scipio, Cato and the other ancient heroes he
regarded as the only models of virtue worthy of imitation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 50 years, Petrarch's advocacy of a return to
antiquity captured the imagination of Florence's intellectual
leadership, and soon reached all the courts of Italy. But the
campaign was not only in the realm of ideas; beginning with a visit
to Rome by Donatello and Brunelleschi around 1409, the buildings
and other relics of the ancient world also inspired a revolution in
the visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   If this tale is familiar, its logistics, in an age of tortuous
communications, are less clear. For until that great accelerator,
printing, appeared in the late 1400s, Petrarch and his disciples
had to rely on personal contact and scarce manuscripts to spread
their ideas, which makes their success all the more astonishing.
And the same is true of their colleagues in the visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the printing press made cheap multiple copies of a
picture available _ in woodcuts, engravings, drypoints, etchings
and aquatints _ could Europe's artists, few of whom could travel to
Rome, see for themselves the masterpieces of antiquity. Thereafter
we hear regularly of prints as the inspiration for particular
images, but it is not often that we focus on the source of the
information that now flooded through Europe. Put simply, what was
it that printmakers chose to show when they depicted the ancient
world?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question the exhibition ``Revivals, Reveries and
Reconstructions: Images of Antiquity in Prints From 1500 to 1800,''
on view at the Philadelphia Museum of Art until April 16, seeks to
answer. Through 93 prints and 16 illustrated books, the show
reveals the role played by great masters and obscure engravers
alike in the dissemination of the ancient prototypes that were
essential to Renaissance and Baroque art.
</P>
<P>
   The show is intended as introduction and background to the
enormous survey of Rome in the 18th century, comprising more than
400 works and titled ``The Splendor of 18th-Century Rome,'' which
is the museum's main attraction this spring; but the prints have
their own fascinating story to tell as they proceed through three
centuries of an intensifying engagement with antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most remarkable feats of imagination came at the very
outset, in the 1480s, when Andrea Mantegna painted nine huge works
that reconstructed in meticulous detail a triumphal procession of
Julius Caesar. Reproduced by contemporary engravers, the paintings
became widely accessible, and they remained in demand 120 years
later, when Andrea Andreani produced a woodcut version that is the
opening exhibit in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   By then, most of the great names of European art had absorbed
Petrarch's message, and the fascination continued into the mid- and
late-18th century, when prints by Tiepolo, Fragonard, Piranesi and
Angelica Kauffmann were still depicting the buildings, the
characters and the stories from Ovid that remained the fundamental
means of representing ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was not only the intellectualized program laid out by
Petrarch and the humanists that directed the interests of the
artists. A repeated stimulus was also the sensational discovery of
ancient artifacts, from the Laocoon in 1506 to Pompeii in 1748. The
Laocoon, uncovered on the Esquiline Hill, was immediately
recognized because it had been described by Pliny, and Pope Julius
II quickly appropriated it for the display of ancient sculpture he
had installed in the Vatican's Belvedere Court.
</P>
<P>
   It was said that artists were drawing the statue even as it was
being taken out of the ground, but the rapid spread of its fame
throughout Europe was the work of the printmakers. Within a few
years it had been caricatured as a group of monkeys by Titian
(possibly to satirize the excessive imitation of antique works),
and by the 1540s that caricature itself had been reproduced in a
woodcut.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because they were often preserved underground, and their
materials enabled them to survive in good condition, sculptures
were a favorite subject for the printmakers. They were also easily
available in the Belvedere Court, now a dismal parking lot but then
the first public museum since antiquity, opened by Julius II soon
after the start of his pontificate in 1503.
</P>
<P>
   The Belvedere's first installation, and its star attraction, was
a recently discovered statue of Apollo, which instantly became a
touchstone of ideal male beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Its impact, accelerated by the drawings and prints that soon
flowed throughout Europe, is indicated by the figure of Adam in
Albrecht Durer's 1504 engraving of Adam and Eve, which, though
Durer never visited Rome, was clearly inspired by the Apollo. Other
residents of the Belvedere whom the printmakers celebrated _ a
powerful torso, a recumbent River God representing the Tiber, a
statue of the comely youth Antinous _ attracted similar attention
from artists as different as Salvator Rosa, Nicolas Poussin and
William Hogarth.

HEALTH INSURERS URGE RIGOROUS DRUG STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY LIZ KOWALCZYK AND RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Even as biotechnology companies spend millions of
dollars developing hundreds of new drugs, health insurers warned
Tuesday that they're often ignoring important steps in getting
their products to patients: Proof that they work better than
existing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And proof that they save money.
</P>
<P>
   Dashing the excitement of the world's largest biotech
conference, health insurance executives said they're not going to
cover the approximately 360 drugs in advanced human trials unless
companies meet rigorous standards.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allan Korn, chief medical officer for the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association, said insurers cannot trust hype when
they're making coverage decisions that have a huge financial
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever comes to market and says, `I have an expensive new
drug and it's a dog,' '' he said. ``So we have to be very careful
in looking at the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Korn and two other panelists spoke at the symposium Managed Care
and Biotechnology _ Partners or Adversaries? during the Bio 2000
gathering in Boston. While the audience of 50 was small by
conference standards, the topic is largely a sore one between the
two industries.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies spend $300 million to $500 million and
take five to 10 years to develop a new drug, and yet, even after
the US Food and Drug Administration approves the medicine for sale
based on successful clinical trials, they often find health
insurance companies won't pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Panel moderator Roger Louis, senior corporate counsel for the
biotechnology company Genzyme in Cambridge, said the process has
been sometimes ``rancorous and adversarial,'' with his industry
colleagues often not understanding why some new drugs are covered
and others are rejected.
</P>
<P>
   With 6,000 drugs in the pipeline _ 40 percent of them for cancer
and 20 percent for muscle and nerve pain _ the debate will only get
more intense, said Dr. Grant Lawless, who spent 10 years as medical
director for Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Pittsburgh and now works
for Amgen Inc. as its director of pharmacoeconomics.
</P>
<P>
   Korn said that Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans depend on a panel of
19 independent experts who evaluate new drugs solely on their
medical effectiveness, and that in 60 percent of the cases, the
plans agree to cover the drug. He said cost does not enter into the
scientific evaluation, but he acknowledged that the panel chooses
to study drugs that are heavily advertised and could be used by a
large number of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not the only ones who want more money,'' he said. ``The
pharmaceutical companies want more money, the doctors want more
money, and the hospitals. At the end of the day, someone has to
make a budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawless predicted that within the next 24 months the criteria
for insurance reimbursement of new drugs will go beyond their
medical effectiveness and safety and may include cost.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of the new drugs will be priced higher than
existing medications. Determining whether the more expensive
biotech medications are signficicantly better compared to currently
available drugs that cost less is becoming a growing issue for
large insurers who are being asked to pay for both of them. ``Some
large health insurers are overwhelmed and they may start to
consider cost effectiveness as as a criteria for reimbursement,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech industry has maintained that if new drugs can
significantly reduce hospitalizations _ the most expensive portion
of health care _ then they should be able to command higher prices
than existing medications that are not as effective.
</P>
<P>
   But Korn said this theory has yet to be proven. He pointed out
that hospital stays have been declining for many patients since the
early 1980s, but said that insurers are still paying more to
hospitals annually than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Korn repeatedly returned to one example of a treatment for
breast cancer _ expensive bone-marrow transplants and high-dose
chemotherapy _ as a warning against anecdotal evidence. Widely used
by doctors for years as a last-resort treatment for advanced
cancer, recent studies show it's no more effective than
conventional therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago we said we have no evidence. Thirty thousand
transplants later and we still have no evidence,'' he said. ``We
have to be careful not to get ahead of the scientific evidence.
Women in this room who get cancer would be offered a 1989
treatment; that's because we got stuck for a decade. Let's not make
that mistake again.''

 PHILADELPHIA: William Hogarth.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not surprising, therefore, that when the Dutch master
engraver Hendrick Goltzius visited Rome in 1590, he became
preoccupied with ancient sculpture, which he made the subject of
more than 50 drawings. He was apparently so engrossed that neither
an outbreak of plague nor its dreadful accompaniment _ the stench
of rotting corpses piled up near the statuary he was copying _ kept
him from his work.
</P>
<P>
   After he returned home, he engraved three of his drawings, and
the two in the exhibition show the artist looking up at the Apollo
and at another recent discovery: a huge statue of Hercules that had
been found in the Baths of Caracalla in 1556. Taken by the powerful
Farnese family to their new palazzo near the Tiber, which had been
designed by Michelangelo, the Hercules became an essential sight
for visitors to Rome. By 1590 it was so familiar that Goltzius
could show it from the rear and know that it would be instantly
recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient buildings were less numerous than sculptures, but they,
too, became common currency throughout Europe. Though he never left
his native land, the Dutchman Jan van de Velde put a recognizable
Temple of the Sybil from Tivoli in one of his landscapes. And
despite the disfigurement of the actual Pantheon by two bell towers
and a new wing, Hubert Robert could show it as it had been in
antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it was the sheer variety of the printmakers'
themes that made their influence so pervasive. Inscriptions and
reliefs were lovingly copied, and a fascinating section of the
exhibition documents their appeal to designers of funerary
monuments, who also had a fondness for antique tombs, notably that
remarkable Roman landmark the pyramid of Gaius Cestius.
</P>
<P>
   The reliefs were sources, too, for pastoral scenes, for battles,
arms and triumphs, and for stories about gods, myths and ancient
heroes. The breadth of the subject matter the engravers derived
from arches, columns and other relics amounted to a cornucopia of
sources for the basic vocabulary of Renaissance and Baroque
painting, architecture and sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 18th century, however, the air of
discovery and excitement seems to wane. Piranesi was no longer
etching Roman remains so as to convey to an international audience
the structures and shapes that might inspire new artistic images.
Like Canaletto in Venice, he was earning a living by supplying a
market eager for views of the places tourists had seen or wanted to
see.
</P>
<P>
   His workshop became a center for the restoration and sale of
antiquities, and the clearest testimony to the change in outlook
was the pair of etchings he produced in 1769 of an elegantly
decorated marble vase that had just been discovered at Hadrian's
villa in Tivoli. Its fruits and putti, lovingly reproduced, were
intended not to enlarge the store of Roman images, but to advertise
the value of the vase to potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   For Mantegna or Poussin, the deterioration of Rome's inspiring
images into mere commercialism might have seemed sacrilegious. Yet
the contribution of the printmakers to the passion for antiquity
that swept Western art had been completed long before. Nothing
found at Pompeii was to be as famous as the Laocoon, the Apollo or
the Hercules.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced by the scientific revolution that they had progressed
beyond their forebears, Europeans no longer looked so urgently to
Greece and Rome to animate the forms and substance of artistic
creativity. Flashes of neoclassical ambition were to recur, notably
during the French Revolution, but now new interests were needed to
stimulate the long-term vigor that for centuries had been aroused
by the ancient world.
</P>
<P>
   The change in European culture is almost palpable, and the
Philadelphia exhibition, though unassuming in scope and intention
(as is often the case with the devotees of the black-and-white,
unglamorous print), demonstrates not only the role of humble
etchers and engravers in the ascendancy of the antique but also
their subtle reflection of the decline and fall of Rome's empire in
the arts.

COMMENTARY: SLOUCHING TOWARD PHILLY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a droll speech to a ballroom full of journalists
and pols at the Gridiron dinner last Saturday night, Al Gore
confided his ``secret'' plan for winning the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He would associate himself with the good stuff that has happened
during the last eight years and disassociate himself from the bad
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``A low unemployment rate and a sound economy? Clinton-Gore,''
he said. ``Grand jury testimony? Clinton . . . Impeachment? Not
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was mocking his own image as an opportunist.
He was also ribbing his Republican rival, whose campaign is based
on the assumption that everyone is fed up with ``the Clinton-Gore
era.''
</P>
<P>
   But America is bursting with contentment. Our only worry is a
new malady that The L.A. Times calls ``sudden wealth syndrome,''
the ennui that comes from making too many millions too fast.
</P>
<P>
   People scorned Bill Clinton's morals. But they love his economy,
and the way he tackles hard things, like the Middle East, Ireland
and guns.
</P>
<P>
   If W. keeps banking on disgust with Clinton-Gore to propel him
to the White House, he'll lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't work to connect Gore to Clinton,'' a Gore adviser
says. ``It didn't even work to connect Clinton to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans tried to run against Bill Clinton's character in
'92, '96 and '98. It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   So it is truly remarkable that W. is repeating the willful
mistakes of '92, given that the loss was so searing.
</P>
<P>
   The father thought: I can't lose to a low-class hick from
Arkansas. Now the son thinks: I can't lose to a &UR;  &LR; cutthroat phony
who did stinky things with a low class-hick from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The contempt of the Bushes blinds them to the need to fight
harder, fight sooner and fight smarter.
</P>
<P>
   After he soared to 90 percent with his victory in the Persian
Gulf, the father coasted, failing to capitalize with any grand
domestic plans.
</P>
<P>
   W. coasts also, on his first national run (compared with four
for Gore). He does not go on the offensive or offer much substance.
He does not communicate in any interesting way, or outline core
principles. He merely waits for the public to realize he is the
better man. His campaign is like the Cheshire cat, fading to a
smirk.
</P>
<P>
   He parrots sound bites about reform, but he doesn't have the
foggiest notion of why John McCain evoked such excitement. The
governor finally deigned to call the senator on Tuesday, after
prodding by Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by The Times about the McCain phenomenon, Bush replied
curtly: ``Well, then how come he didn't win?''
</P>
<P>
   As Lars-Erik Nelson wrote, it was an eerie echo of the comeback
favored by Bush senior when he rejected advice in '92: ``If you're
so smart, why aren't you president?''
</P>
<P>
   W. appealed to Republicans because he was a baby boomer, but he
keeps Reagan hours. You picture Al up all night plotting. (You know
Karenna has already chosen the convention theme song.) You picture
W. hugging his pillow and belittling his rivals for being too
hungry. But voters like to see a little gumption.
</P>
<P>
   W. thinks the vice president will come off as duplicitous for
pouncing on campaign finance reform. He thinks the words ``Buddhist
temple'' will end any argument. But the Republican can't play the
purist. Voters know he shot the moon on campaign money, too. And
Americans believe in redemption. A real crack at a campaign finance
plan from Gore the reformed sinner is still better than W.'s
empty-shell proposal.
</P>
<P>
   His insular Austin team keeps trying to graft a campaign onto a
brand name. Realizing how hard it is to get Bush the Younger
intellectually engaged, his advisers have reshaped his campaign to
be about the one subject _ besides baseball _ in which he seems
fluent: education. But his big speech on Tuesday, reviving his
mother's pet issue, literacy, does not a vision-thing make.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father's, W.'s basic message is: Trust me _ I've been
bred for this job. Like Bill Bradley, W. is counting on Gore's
smarmy, Eddie Haskell personality to rub people the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   But W. is expecting Americans to get riled up about what they
already know. He might take a page from Bill Clinton: Elections are
always about the future, not the past.

 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Alex Comfort, whose graphically illustrated 1972 book ``The
Joy of Sex'' became the coffee-table Kama Sutra of the baby-boom
generation, died March 26 at a nursing home in Banbury, northwest
of London. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort noisily regretted that his hurriedly written book (by
one account it took two weeks), which in its three versions sold
more than 12 million copies, so vastly outshined his other
accomplishments. He was a physician, poet, novelist, scientific
researcher, anarchist and pacifist and the author of 51 books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be known as Dr. Sex,'' he told Publishers
Weekly in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But many people cannot forget the omnipresence of Comfort's
book, whose original title was ``The Joy of Sex: A Cordon Bleu
Guide to Lovemaking,'' which was quickly changed to ``The Joy of
Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking,'' after the owners of the
Cordon Bleu name objected. The first version was published by Simon
&AMP; Schuster and the second by Crown, both in 1972. The publisher of
the ``The Joy of Cooking'' apparently never objected.
</P>
<P>
   The book eventually earned Comfort $3 million, most of which he
gave away. It came out at a time when the birth control pill had
removed some constraints to sex, and before AIDS added new ones.
The not-so-fuzzy sketches in the original edition showed a bearded
man and his inamorata coupled in all sorts of tangled positions
beneath cookbook-like chapter headings like ``Starters,'' ``Main
Courses'' and ``Sauces and Pickles.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, written by a vigorous pacifist, became the virtual
manual for those who wanted to make love, not war. And for all his
annoyance about the public's ignorance about his other
accomplishments, Comfort never left any doubt that he saw sex as
critically important. He suggested that things like the U.S.
involvement in Vietnam might be the result of ``uninteresting
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   The text condemned the prudery of ``squares'' and dispensed
advice on ``how to treat a partner who is hip for `discipline.'''
Advice often seemed as humorous as it was helpful. For example, one
hint was, ``Never fool around sexually with vacuum cleaners.'' The
big toe, readers learned, could be a powerful erotic instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Not much was left out, from G-strings to chastity belts to love
positions that might tax a circus contortionist.
</P>
<P>
   The book's impact was sometimes likened to that of Dr. Benjamin
Spock's groundbreaking manual on babies. In an interview, Dr. Ruth
Westheimer, the sex therapist, called Comfort courageous and said
she consciously followed in his path. ``I stood on the shoulders of
a giant,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Comfort's `Joy of Sex' was a landmark book that made an
important contribution to human development and healthy
sexuality,'' said Joan Malin, chief executive officer of Planned
Parenthood of New York City. ``The groundbreaking publication of
this book took us from an era of silence and shame about sexuality
to one of greater openness and discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The later ``Joy'' books were meant to keep up with the times.
``More Joy of Sex,'' published in 1974 by Crown, tried to keep pace
with the sexual revolution by advocating further license, providing
it was ``non-exploitative.'' Nearly two decades later, in 1991, the
temper of ``The New Joy of Sex'' (Crown) was more sober, adding a
chapter on AIDS. Comfort, with seeming reluctance, warned against
orgies.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Comfort was born on Feb. 10, 1920, in Palmers Green, a
neighborhood in north London. He said he was a little terror as a
child, running away frequently and blowing off the fingers of his
left hand at 14 while making gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
   After he ran away from school, his mother, a former teacher,
educated him at home. He went on to win high honors in the natural
sciences at Cambridge University's Trinity College and then trained
in medicine at London Hospital. At 18, he wrote his first book,
``The Silver River,'' a novel based on a trip he had taken with his
father to Africa and South America; it was published by Chapman &AMP;
Hall in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Comfort became politically active while
studying to become a doctor. He was a conscientious objector and
led a campaign against the indiscriminate bombing of Germany. His
pacifism became anarchism, and he began to write pamphlets and
tracts, some incorporating the findings of psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   The years from 1941 to 1945 were also the most productive period
in his literary career; he wrote three novels, two plays and four
books of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this work reflected the fusion of his political and
humanitarian beliefs. In ``The Powerhouse,'' published in 1944 by
Routledge, he wrote, ``The weak do a great deal _ every woman who
hides a deserter, every clerk who doesn't scrutinize a pass, every
worker who bungles a fuse saves somebody's life for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   He received some rave reviews. In the New York Herald Tribune
Book Review, Ruth Lechlitner said his 1945 novel, ``The Song of
Lazarus'' (Viking), suggested that he was ``one of the most
interesting writers of his generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less kind. Of the same book, Louise Bogan, writing
in The New Yorker, said, ``His emotions, as well as his language,
keep slipping into a haze.''
</P>
<P>
   But nobody could ignore him. George Orwell, who was horrified at
Comfort's refusal to fight the evil of Hitler, nonetheless had
grudging respect for his 1941 novel ``No Such Liberty'' (Chapman &AMP;
Hall). He called it ``a good novel as novels go at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfort kept up his scientific work, too, writing a textbook on
physiology and biology, ``First Year Physiological Technique''
(Staples Press, 1948). In 1947, he received a doctorate in
biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   He continued a steady stream of poetry and fiction and did
important research on aging, working with generations of rats and
other laboratory animals. He also continued to demonstrate for his
beliefs, and in 1961 taught Irish Republican songs to the
philosopher Bertrand Russell while they were in jail for illegally
marching against the bomb. A visit to India in 1964 resulted in his
translating from the Sanskrit ``The Koka Shastra,'' an erotic
classic.
</P>
<P>
   His advocacy of sexual freedom preceded his famous book. In
1962, he caused a minor scandal in England by suggesting that
15-year-old boys carry condoms. ``The Joy of Sex'' was first
intended as a textbook for medical students, many of whom he found
shockingly ignorant of sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   It was often suggested and never denied that ``Joy'' was based
on an affair Comfort had with Jane Henderson, whom he married in
1973, after the dissolution of his 30-year marriage to Ruth Harris.
But Henderson had misgivings about the book, at least according to
a statement Comfort made to The Guardian in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife says you can tell this book is written by a man,'' he
said. ``That's true. Women have to write their own book. I can't be
a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfort, whose only survivor is the son from his first marriage,
Nicholas, insisted he did not know much about sex when he wrote
``Joy.'' He told the Sunday Telegraph in 1996, ``That's the way to
find about anything, to write a book about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he truly knew little before his book, his sudden
emergence as a sexual celebrity did not go to waste. Gay Talese
wrote of encountering him in 1973 at Sandstone, a sex community in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often the nude biologist Dr. Alex Comfort, brandishing a
cigar, traipsed through the room between the prone bodies with the
professional air of a lepidopterist strolling through the fields
with a butterfly net,'' he wrote. ``With the least encouragement _
after he had deposited the cigar in a safe place _ he would join a
friendly clutch of bodies, and contribute to the merriment.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfort insisted that it was all in the interests of research.
``Before my book,'' he wrote, ``writing about sex gave the
impression of being written by nonplaying coaches. Dear old Freud
probably never witnessed an act of sex except in a mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1974 to 1983, Comfort was a lecturer at Stanford
University's psychiatry department, and from 1980 to 1991 he was
professor at the Neuropsychiatric Institute at the University of
California. In 1994, Sinclair Stevenson published his last book of
poems, ``Mikrokosmos.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfort said he wanted to be remembered for his work on aging or
perhaps his poetry. He did not think it likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``That book,'' he told The Independent in 1994, ``has taken off
_ so much so it has become rather an albatross. It's like
Bucolossi, who wrote I think over 200 operas, and the only thing
anyone remembers is his `The Dance of the Grasshopper.'''

POOR MANAGEMENT BY NASA IS BLAMED FOR MARS FAILURE

 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Mars Polar Lander spacecraft probably failed
last year because its descent engine shut down prematurely, but the
mission's loss can ultimately be blamed on inadequate management,
testing and financing, independent experts told NASA on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the findings, NASA officials announced a shakeup in
the management of its Mars programs. They also said they had
canceled plans to launch a new Mars lander next year and would
probably revise or delay other missions to the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In candid reports assessing recent problems with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's programs to explore Mars,
two panels concluded that pressures to conform to the agency's
recent credo of ``faster, cheaper, better'' ended up compromising
ambitious projects.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the new constraints, the reports said, project managers
sacrificed needed testing and realistic assessments of the risks of
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Young, a former NASA official who was chairman of the
team reviewing the agency's Mars program, said the lander and two
small probes it carried that also failed were the victims of
several management mistakes, including inadequate testing before
launching.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were trying to do too much with too little, and not
adequately conveying their concerns to others, particularly upper
management,'' Young, who is also a retired executive vice president
of Lockheed Martin Corp. _ the primary contractor on the lander
project _ said after a news conference at NASA headquarters in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had a sense of how much trouble they were actually
in,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Young's panel, and another team looking into the lander failure
led by John Casani, a former head of flight operations at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which manages the
Mars missions, both concluded that no one would ever know exactly
why the spacecraft failed on Dec. 3. The spacecraft vanished
without a trace after beginning its landing sequence during a
period of radio silence.
</P>
<P>
   But tests conducted on an engineering model of the $165 million
lander suggest that switches on its landing legs that were supposed
to signal touchdown on the planet probably generated false signals
when the legs extended.
</P>
<P>
   These signals probably caused an onboard computer to cut off the
lander's engines too soon, leading it to crash onto the Martian
surface, the review groups said. Instead of being near the ground
for engine cutoff, they said, the craft actually was actually 132
feet in the air and slammed to the surface at 50 miles an hour.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Young said that four tests deploying the lander's three legs
were conducted this year on the engineering model and the false
shut-off signal occurred each time. This problem could have been
easily corrected with a software change in the spacecraft's
computer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The actual lander was tested this way only once before
launching, he said, but the problem did not show up because of a
separate wiring problem. After the wiring trouble was discovered
and corrected, though, the test was not repeated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars projects were underfinanced ``by at least 30 percent,''
Young said, forcing engineers with NASA and Lockheed Martin to cut
corners and take unnecessary risks to save money and meet
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   The assessments joined several other recent reviews assessing
the effect of NASA's ``faster, cheaper, better'' approach to space
missions.
</P>
<P>
   For more than seven years, as the agency faced shrinking annual
budgets, NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin has called for doing
more with less. Instead of planning a few billion-dollar missions
that take a decade or more to execute, the agency's new approach
calls for doing many smaller projects that take only two or three
years to complete for a few hundred million dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent panels have suggested the new approach may have
gone too far by emphasizing cost-cutting and tight schedules at the
price of quality. Goldin has acknowledged the problems as ``growing
pains'' and recently asked Congress for money to add more engineers
and safety experts to ease pressure on existing staff members and
to train new project managers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space
science, said that the faster, cheaper, better philosophy has been
successful, but that recent problems have helped define its limits.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that since 1992, NASA has launched 146 payloads valued
at $18 billion and that only 10 have failed. Those failures,
though, include both the Mars lander and its companion craft, the
$125 million Mars Climate Orbiter, which was lost Sept. 23 because
of navigation errors caused by the failure to convert English
measurements to metric.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found the boundary of what we can do with faster,
cheaper, better and now we've stepping back from the boundary,''
Weiler said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The reports issued Wednesday found failures in communication
between project officials and managers at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, which oversees interplanetary missions, as well as
between these managers and Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   And NASA headquarters in Washington had little idea of the
problems being encountered with the projects in California,
panelists said.
</P>
<P>
   To address these problems, Weiler said, the agency has named a
new Mars program director in Washington to oversee all related
programs. Scott Hubbard, a NASA executive at the Ames Research
Center in Mountain View, Calif., will assume the new post. In
addition, Weiler said, a Mars program director will be appointed at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler also said the entire Mars exploration plan was being
reviewed and revised, an effort that would probably change some
planned missions and extend the time needed to complete them. The
program had called for launches to Mars every two years,
culminating in a 2006 attempt to use robot craft to bring samples
of Mars back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to be a five- or six-year program, that's
going to be a decade-long program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler said that instruments for the canceled 2001 lander
mission would be completed and used on later missions. An orbital
mission around Mars scheduled for 2001 will go ahead as planned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard E. McCurdy of American University, a space historian
who is an expert on NASA management, said that the assessments of
recent failures are telling NASA what it should already know.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either have tight program management with headquarters
involved or you have extensive testing of everything before you
launch a mission to make sure everything works,'' McCurdy said.
``For successful programs, there is no substitute for experienced
program management, independent reviews to see that you're going in
the right direction and testing, testing, testing.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by outside experts on future directions of the Mars
program is due later this spring, Weiler said. And this summer, he
said, NASA would respond to the recent flurry of assessments _
which have looked at subjects from space shuttle operations to
training _ with a report on how it is changing its operations based
on the numerous recommendations.

SPORTS COLUMN: CHECKETTS MUST PURSUE LAMORIELLO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Madison Square Garden impresario who will
search for the Rangers' next general manager, Dave Checketts
quickly and understandably declined to discuss any candidates to
succeed Neil Smith other than that he intended to hire ``the best''
he can find, that he ``won't settle'' for anyone but the best.
</P>
<P>
   That simplifies Checketts' search. Hockey's best general
manager, Lou Lamoriello, will soon be at liberty and other than
getting E-Z Pass for the Lincoln Tunnel, he wouldn't even need
moving expenses.
</P>
<P>
   As the New Jersey Devils' major-domo since the 1987-88 season,
Lamoriello has the track record that Checketts demands and that the
Rangers need _ the 1995 Stanley Cup, 11 playoff teams in 13 years,
a bargain $37.6 million payroll and a solid staff of scouts that
have stocked a productive farm system.
</P>
<P>
   Because Lamoriello's contract will be up as soon as the
YankeeNets combine's $175 million purchase of the Devils from John
McMullen is completed in July, he will be that rarity _ a coveted
front-office free agent.
</P>
<P>
   If Checketts means what he says about wanting to hire ``the
best'' available general manager, the Rangers must pursue
Lamoriello as their first choice. That could take time. Lamoriello
won't talk about it now and, even though he would be at liberty in
July, he might not want to discuss a job offer while the Devils are
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And if George Steinbrenner is as smart as he always thinks he
is, the YankeeNets will surely try to keep Lamoriello as the
Devils' president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello, now 57, might prefer to remain with the Devils under
the YankeeNets combine, but he then would be subject to the tension
of working for the Yankees' principal owner, always a factor in the
``job description'' of any Steinbrenner employee, no matter how
serene Joe Torre has appeared as a baseball manager. Lamoriello
also might decide to count his share of the Devils' sale,
reportedly as much as $25 million, and relax.
</P>
<P>
   But if Lamoriello prefers to go elsewhere in the National Hockey
League next season, the Rangers' job as president and general
manager should be his for the asking.
</P>
<P>
   By hiring Lamoriello, the Rangers would also be weakening the
organizational structure of their rivals on the New Jersey side of
the Lincoln Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts, once the general manager of the Knicks and the Utah
Jazz, is basically a basketball man with no tactical hockey
knowledge. He wants a Rangers general manager he can trust to do
the job, as Smith was trusted to do the job for 11 seasons until
Tuesday's dismissal of both Smith and Coach John Muckler.
</P>
<P>
   For many of those 11 seasons, Smith did a good job. When the
Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1994 for the first time in 54 years,
Smith had assembled the players, notably Mark Messier, and hired
the volatile coach, Mike Keenan.
</P>
<P>
   About a month after the cup celebration, Keenan suddenly
defected to the St. Louis Blues in a contract dispute. Messier
remained for three more seasons and Wayne Gretzky arrived for three
seasons, but the Rangers gradually dissolved into the disaster that
had some Garden loyalists leaving before the third period of Monday
night's 6-0 loss to the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   On top of Sunday's 8-2 strafing in Detroit, the Rangers had been
outscored, 14-2, in two important games. Whatever slim playoff
chances had existed were now doomed.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden mood Monday night resembled the mutinous mood of the
pro football Giants fans in 1978 when some of them hired a small
plane to tow a ``15 Years of Lousy Football. We've Had Enough''
banner above Giants Stadium during a November loss in a long,
dreary season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Garden didn't have a roof, some fans might have been
tempted, considering the Rangers' $61.2 million payroll, to hire a
small plane with a banner saying, ``Three Straight Years of No
Playoffs. We've Had Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the frustrated fans chanted, ``Fire Muckler,'' and
Checketts did. Smith also cleaned out his desk. All the Garden
honchos agreed with what most Ranger fans had come to realize,
that, as Checketts said Tuesday, this Ranger team ``should have had
more scoring, more defense, more accountability, more leadership,
more pride.'' Instead of more and more losses.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Rangers hire Lou Lamoriello, they will be getting
``the best man'' for the job.

<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Sometimes it's hard to remember that
professional baseball players are employees. For some reason,
``employee'' and ``millionaire'' don't seem to be natural dance
partners.
</P>
<P>
   But if you peel away the hype surrounding major leaguers and
their staggering contracts, what you will find is this: Baseball
players are similar to many of us. They draw a paycheck from
someone else. They have a boss. They are not upset when the boss is
a maniac, as long as the mania is not solely directed at them (a
democratic maniac). They also thinks it's funny when the boss is so
quirky that his lack of hipness actually becomes hip.
</P>
<P>
   All of these issues were relevant Tuesday at City of Palms Park.
The Red Sox announced that they were extending the contract of
manager Jimy Williams through 2001. If Williams makes it through
that contract, he will have been a Boston boss for five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If you talk with the men who are supervised by Williams, you
quickly understand why he is able to survive. Simply, he is a boss
who is respected by those who work for him. Tuesday, the employees'
statements about the boss were supported by the decor in his
office.
</P>
<P>
   There was a Franklin batting glove on his desk. Next to it was a
bottle of sunblock. Behind him, on a bookshelf, there was some
serious literature. No, we're not talking about Ellison, Allende,
Hemingway, or Joyce. Instead, there was a library of baseball media
guides.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning was obvious. James Francis Williams had slipped on
the glove, grabbed a bat, protected his skin from the 83-degree
temperature and gone outside to work with any player who wanted to
work with him.
</P>
<P>
   The boss does as the boss preaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does a lot of different things that I've never seen a
manager do,'' said outfielder Darren Lewis. ``He's a hard-working
man. You don't see a lot of managers around the batting cages. You
don't see a lot of managers in the tunnel, throwing batting
practice. He's in the trenches.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there are some nice benefits in Williams's line of
work. The best manager in the business, Joe Torre, makes about $3
million a year. Williams is about $2 million short of that status,
although $1 million a year isn't bad. But being a baseball boss
today is challenging. You know how some businesses talk about being
diverse? If you are going to be a successful manager, you had
better be ready to do more than talk about being diverse; you had
better be diversifying.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has done this daily. At the beginning of spring
training, there were as many as five languages being spoken in the
clubhouse: English, French, Spanish, Korean, and Japanese. There
were teenagers hanging around with players in their mid-20s, 30s
and (hello, Gary Gaetti) early 40s. A manager not only has to make
sure that mix works socially, he is on the hook if it doesn't work
on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The balancing act becomes more tenuous when you add the media
factor. Almost every player claims not to pay attention to the
media when, truth is, almost all of them do. They notice when a
manager protects them and they notice when a manager protects
himself. They also notice when the protection comes with an amusing
one-liner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got plenty of those, doesn't he?'' closer Derek Lowe
said. ``He should write a book. He's got some classic one-liners.''
</P>
<P>
   And that makes the 56-year-old boss even more compelling. He has
a team of young dot-commers, yet his language is the verbal
equivalent of an old Smith-Corona. Globe baseball writer Gordon
Edes has accurately described this Jimy As A Second Language
phenomenon as ``Jimywocky.'' Perfect. The players love Jimywocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get to hear it as much as you guys do,'' Lowe said.
``Jimy's pretty quick. Very quick.''
</P>
<P>
   While speculating about the team Tuesday, Williams tried to make
the point that the 25-man roster would be filled out
systematically. You know, 11 pitchers and 14 position players.
``Fifteen and 11 is 25,'' he said. He paused as the numbers crashed
in his head. ``Ohhh,'' he said. ``No it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed at himself. He was asked about his contract
extension, but he didn't want to talk about it much. He wanted to
talk about ``the kids.'' One of those kids, Brian Daubach, said he
owes his entire career to Williams and general manager Dan
Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many managers would go into the season with a nonroster
invitee and bat him third?'' Daubach said. ``Especially in
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach soon learned that Williams doesn't do brand names. He
has two great players in Nomar Garciaparra and Pedro Martinez. That
seems to be OK with him. He also likes managing the skills of
unknown and little-publicized players.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Lewis fits into that category.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a reason Lewis likes everything about the boss and
the boss likes everything about him. Well, almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis walked out into the sun Tuesday, sporting a pair of
designer, Tommy Hilfiger sunglasses. The boss doesn't do brand
names. A nondescript pair of shades would have been fine with him.

   Strategist Suggests Curb On Stocks, and Prices Fall
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell as investors took profits and Abby Joseph
Cohen, the influential stock market strategist at Goldman, Sachs,
recommended that her firm's clients reduce their allocation of
stocks to 65 percent. It is the first time Cohen has reduced the
recommended stock allocation since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 89.74 points, or 0.8
percent, to 10,936.11. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
slumped 16.13 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,507.73, and the Nasdaq
composite index fell 124.67 points, or 2.5 percent, to 4,833.89.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in stock prices lifted bond prices modestly. The
yield on the benchmark 30-year issue was unchanged at 5.98 percent.

   Koehler Calls for Wider IMF
</P>
<P>
   Role Laying out his vision of the future of the International
Monetary Fund, Horst Koehler, the new managing director, said that
rather than shrinking as some critics have suggested, the fund
should expand its role.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace Web Exchange Formed
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, BAE Systems, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have formed an
Internet trading exchange to buy and auction parts for aircraft and
other aerospace equipment. A sale of shares in the venture could
take place next year, the companies said.

<P>
   Intel Introduces Its Latest Chip
</P>
<P>
   Intel, seeking to one-up its archrival, Advanced Micro Devices,
in the relentless creation of faster chips for low-cost computers,
introduced its latest Celeron processor for computers priced at
less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Stock May Raise $13.2 Billion
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said that it intended to raise up to $13.2 billion in the
coming initial public offering of shares meant to track its
wireless communications unit. That would more than double the
record $5.5 billion raised by United Parcel Service when it first
offered shares to the public last November. At a minimum, AT&AMP;T
intends to raise $9.4 billion. Shares of AT&AMP;T fell 62.5 cents, to
$59.6875.

<P>
   Paintball Lessons Lost on the Job
</P>
<P>
   Companies spend $55 billion a year on training, often using
elaborate and eccentric methods like paintball wars and
fighter-pilot simulations to make their point. The trouble is, many
of these programs have no practical value, so employees return to
their daily chores and forget the training.

   Airport Thieves Focus on Laptops
</P>
<P>
   Thieves who steal laptop computers are having a field day in
places frequented by business travelers. A good many of the laptops
are being stolen at airports, sometimes by organized rings.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Confidence Fell in March
</P>
<P>
   Consumers' confidence in the nation's economy fell for the
second consecutive month in March, and their expectations for later
this year sank to a five-month low, a survey by the Conference
Board showed.
</P>
<P>
   Setback for Japanese Shareholder
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese shareholder advocate, whose failed effort to buy a
company in Japan's first hostile takeover fight attracted
widespread attention, suffered a second defeat when that company,
Shoei, repulsed his requests to raise its dividend and make him a
director.
</P>
<P>
   Websense Shares More Than Double
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Websense, whose products allow companies to monitor
how employees use the Internet at work, more than doubled in value
after the company's initial public stock offering. Websense closed
up $29.75, to $47.75.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
SARASOTA, Fla. _ When Mark Portugal finished up his stint with the
Boston Red Sox last season, he figured his 13-year baseball career
was over.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then the Reds called. They asked him if he would be willing to
return to Cincinnati to compete for the No. 5 spot in the starting
rotation. Portugal was torn and decided he would leave the decision
to those most important to him _ his kids.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the choice was easy. Sure, it meant they would have him
around less. But it meant a chance to meet one of their idols.
</P>
<P>
   ```Yeah, Dad, they're trying to get Ken Griffey Jr. That would
be good,''' Portugal said, relating his conversation with his
7-year-old son, Jacob. ``I think he was paying a lot more attention
to what was going on in the winter than I was. But they're excited
about it, and I was excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to get excited around the Reds this year. This is
a team that won 96 games last year before losing a one-game playoff
for the wild card to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking their chances with the same lineup, the Reds
went out and got better _ possibly much better. They added Griffey,
arguably the best player in baseball. They also brought in Dante
Bichette, a key acquisition that has gone largely unnoticed because
of Griffey's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we said, `We have a chance,''' Reds manager Jack
McKeon said. ``This year you say, `Hey, we can win this thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates have been virtually ignored as attention has been
focused on Griffey this spring, but that's not something opposing
teams can afford to do in the regular season. Consider the rest of
the Reds' lineup:
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Sean Casey batted .332 with 25 home runs and 99
RBIs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman PokeyReese hit .285 and stole 38 bases.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Barry Larkin hit .293, batted in 75 runs and stole 30
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Aaron Boone batted .280 with 14 home runs and 72
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Eddie Taubensee batted .311 with 21 homers and 87 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Dmitri Young batted .300 with 14 homers and 56
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in right fielder Bichette's .298 average, 34 home runs and
133 RBIs last year with the Rockies, and Griffey (.285, 48 homers,
134 RBIs for the Mariners) is far from the only Red who will pose
problems for opposing pitchers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our chances,'' Larkin said. ``We'll be able to go as
far as our pitching takes us.''
</P>
<P>
   With power throughout the lineup, the bigger question mark does
seem to be the pitching. The rotation will include Denny Neagle,
Pete Harnisch, Steve Parris and Ron Villone. Portugal will be the
No. 5 starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, we certainly look better,'' Harnisch said. ``The big
thing is for us to get 135 to 150 starts between our five starters
and not have to use eight, nine, 10 starters this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch was 16-10 last year and is 30-17 over his past two
seasons. Neagle was only 9-5 a year ago, but all nine wins came
after a stay on the disabled list prompted by tendinitis in his
shoulder. Parris and Villone both started the season in Class AAA
and were later recalled. Parris then went 11-4 with a 3.50 ERA.
Villone finished 9-7 with a 4.23 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to win this division, we've got to have
Harnisch and Neagle win 15 games,'' general manager Jim Bowden
said. ``If a healthy Denny Neagle can win 15 to 20, that might make
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' bullpen has one of the best trios of righthanders in
the league. Danny Graves was 8-7 with 27 saves and a 3.08 ERA last
year. NL Rookie of the Year Scott Williamson was impressive with a
12-7 record, 19 saves and a 2.41 ERA. Scott Sullivan went 5-4 with
three saves and a 3.01 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds hope they can improve on last year's numbers, though
they feel pretty confident another 96-win season would earn them a
postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said we won 96 last year (and) we need to win 97 this
year,'' Graves said. ``That's just not the case. It's a strange
year when you win 96 games and don't get into the playoffs. That's
not going to happen again. It's not going to take 97 wins to get to
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year and the year before, we didn't really set goals. Our
goal was really just to get better. Now, our goal is definitely to
get to the playoffs. If we don't make it this year, it would be
considered a bad year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds certainly have the talent. Now it's a matter of proving
they can put it together again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we have as good a chance as anybody,'' Harnisch
said. ``Everyone in this locker room feels like the pieces are in
place.''

   Within a few hours, 28 bodies were hauled out of a pit _
carefully sealed with concrete, maybe months ago _ inside the house
owned by a leader of a cult in western Uganda. By dark the pit was
only half emptied.
</P>
<P>
   It was, on one level, another horrifying discovery in the 11
days since more than 300 people were found burned to death at a
church not far from here. The death toll, from three different
sites, has now risen to at least 591, including 74 bodies found
buried in the backyard of this same house Monday. There are at
least two more suspected grave sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery of the pit may also indicate just how well
organized, and perhaps longstanding, this march to mass murder in
Uganda was.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan police pathologist, Dr. Thaddeus Barungi, said
Tuesday that the corpses buried inside the house were ``much
older'' than the ones in the back yard, which he estimated had been
killed less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the care taken in constructing and sealing the pit may
suggest that the leaders thought they could get away with some
murders early on. There was even an explanation why they needed a
hole in the middle of their house: They had told a local politician
that they planned to install an ``underground'' refrigerator,
police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As each day passes, the police say it becomes clearer that most
_ maybe even all _ the people were slain and were not the victims
of mass suicide, as was originally suspected when the bodies at the
church in the village of Kanungu were discovered March 17.
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators say they cannot rule out suicide for some
people in the church. After all, the cult _ called the Movement for
the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God _ professed to
believe that the world would end on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the other victims found since then show signs of
strangulation: One woman, for example, found in the back yard of
the house here had a banana leaf tied around her neck. The skull of
another corpse was crushed.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday the police unearthed the bodies of 153 people who
had been slashed or strangled from a mass grave at a cult site in
Rutoma, about 30 miles from Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   The police say their investigation has also begun to turn to
exactly how so many people could have been killed _ seemingly
without any neighbors hearing the first of it. There has been much
speculation that many victims were poisoned, particularly because
many corpses show no sign of violence at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't kill all these human beings alone,'' said Godfrey
Bangirana, an assistant police commissioner, on Tuesday as he stood
aside a row of several dozen corpses in the back yard here. ``This
was an organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``And an organized crime cannot be committed by one person,'' he
added. ``It must be a group.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The police have not ruled out the possibility that the leaders,
and particularly the overall leader, Joseph Kibwetere, are still
alive, perhaps having escaped to the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, not far away.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies found Tuesday were in the home of Dominic Kataribabo,
62, an excommunicated priest reported to hold a doctorate in
theology. He lived in a well-constructed stone house of 10 rooms at
the top of a hill in the village here, surrounded by a small banana
plantation, in shouting range of the children who play at the
Rugazi Central Primary School.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and police said the house was apparently a place where
cult members came to study. Both neighbors and the police also say
that cars and small trucks often came to the house at night.
</P>
<P>
   What strains belief is that no one interviewed by reporters
Tuesday at the site _ or by the police _ admitted to having any
idea what was happening there. Even Kataribabo's brother, Arsen
Oworynawe, 78, who lives in a house maybe 20 yards from where the
74 bodies were buried, said he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know such a thing could happen,'' said Oworynawe, a
carpenter who said he helped build his brother's house. The back
yard, he said, had been shielded off by huge reed mats and he could
see nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He had little to say about his brother, except that he did not
seem crazy to him and that he last saw him on March 12, when
Kataribabo said he was going to Kampala, the capital of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was normal,'' his brother said. ``I have a son in Kampala
and I asked him to send greetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Owarynawe said he himself belonged to the cult for about three
months several years ago. ``I didn't like the way they were
preaching,'' he said. ``They never wanted anyone to drink or smoke.
And eating, you know, was a problem. They would eat only once a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, his family sat with cloths covering their noses because
the stench from the bodies was so strong. Owarynawe had his own way
of combating the horror: ``I need a drink,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the local police dug up 74 bodies from one large hole
in the back yard, then reburied them in two other holes the cult
members had already dug. But the local police were supposed to have
waited until Tuesday, when senior investigators arrived to perform
more detailed forensic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a breakdown in communications,'' said Mugenyi
Assuman, a Uganda police spokesman at the site. ``We had told them
to wait but somehow somebody misinformed them yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday a pack of prisoners and laborers in bare feet _ some
with their hands wrapped in garbage bags _ unearthed the bodies
again. Quick autopsies were performed out in the open on some of
the corpses and tissue samples were taken for analysis.
Investigators counted 46 females, 26 males and two of uncertain
sex, including a baby less then three months old.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 28 bodies pulled so far from the pit, 15 were female and
13 were male. Several were young children.

<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade ice cream company became as well known
for its commitment to causes like helping the homeless and saving
the rain forests as for selling pints of Chubby Hubby and Cherry
Garcia. But it has long struggled to balance its social initiatives
with shareholder demands for better profits. On Tuesday, it
appeared that part of the struggle was over.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield in a
Burlington, Vt., gas station in 1978 and taken public in 1984, will
become private in a $38-a-share deal to be announced soon, possibly
as early as Friday, said a shareholder who was briefed on the
agreement. The shareholder said the board approved the deal, which
would be valued at about $260 million, last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As described by the company shareholder, the agreement would
give Cohen, who owns about a million shares of Ben &AMP; Jerry's,
control of 36 percent of the company. Meadowbrook Lane Capital, a
group of investors that describes itself as socially responsible,
would have a similar stake, and the remaining 28 percent would be
held by Unilever, the British-Dutch giant that owns the Breyer's
ice cream brand as well as Good Humor bars. Greenfield would retain
no interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The decision appears to have caused a rift between Cohen and
Greenfield, who was described as unhappy with the involvement of
Unilever. Battling giants like Pillsbury for market share, the
founders gained an unusual public image and a loyal following but
never resolved some important issues, including how to get their
product onto store shelves reliably. For years, Ben &AMP; Jerry's used
a distribution system owned by Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, based in
Oakland, Calif. The agreement was terminated by Ben &AMP; Jerry's in
September, and the company switched to relying on both Dreyer's and
the Haagen-Daz unit of Diageo, the big British food and beverage
holding company. Both companies are among Ben &AMP; Jerry's biggest
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The issues will remain under the new structure, one analyst
said. ``This does nothing to solve Ben &AMP; Jerry's domestic
distribution problems,'' said Jeffrey G. Kanter, a food stocks
analyst for Prudential Securities. ``All it does is create a much
weaker franchise. Five years from now, Ben &AMP; Jerry's may be known
in France, but it will be a fraction of what it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Greenfield said he had no comment. ``There's
nothing I can add,'' said the spokesman, Chris Miller. ``All I can
say is, Jerry is not interested in chatting.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement recombines aspects of several offers Ben &AMP; Jerry's
received in the last several months. Unilever had offered to pay
$40 a share, which was later increased to $43. Dreyer's had offered
$31 a share on Feb. 2, which was topped by an offer two days later
from Meadowbrook Lane, which said it would pay $32.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, money was left on the table to create the new Ben &AMP;
Jerry's, and not every shareholder was pleased. ``This is basically
the board acquiescing and giving Ben Cohen another chance to take
control of the company,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   At $38 a share, most shareholders would recover their
investments, and then some, but perhaps at the cost of the
company's growth. ``The shareholders will finally win, but this
does nothing to solve the competitive issues,'' Kanter said.
</P>
<P>
   Meadowbrook Lane listed Anita Roddick, founder of the Body Shop,
a line of natural cosmetics and skin-care products, and Chartwell
Investments II, a venture capital firm based in New York, among its
investors. It pledged to create a ``social performance plan'' that
would place women and minorities on the board, pay about 7.5
percent of the company's pretax profits into the Ben &AMP; Jerry's
Foundation, and provide venture capital to other ``progressively
minded enterprises,'' among other social efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Chartwell Investments II has since dropped out of the group,
said a person close to the talks leading up to the deal. He added
that Cohen had brought Unilever into the group over Greenfield's
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's said in early December that it had received
``indications of interest'' and would be evaluating them. Owners of
Ben &AMP; Jerry's franchises nationwide have been anxiously watching to
see what the outcome would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything, but I've been watching the stock,
and I know 181,000 shares traded on Friday, when our average volume
is about 30,000,'' said Lori Johnston, who operates two stores in
Washington, D.C. ``Something must be happening.'' Shares of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's fell 28.125 cents, to $29.96875.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said she went to a franchise-owners' advisory council
meeting three weeks ago at which the company handed out lapel pins
that said: ``No implications should be drawn. No decisions have
been made.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the big winners in a sale would be Perry D. Odak, Ben &AMP;
Jerry's chief executive, who joined the company in early 1997.
According to the most recent filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, he was given options to buy 360,000 shares for
$10.88 a share when he joined the company. He received 67,000 more
options last year, priced at $24.625 a share.

PROFESSOR USES ART TO SHOW IMPORTANCE OF LEADERSHIP SYMBOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It's highly unlikely Louis XIV, the ``Sun
King'' of France whose reign prospered in the late 1600s, ever wore
ancient Roman battle gear while riding a horse.
</P>
<P>
   And Benjamin Franklin, inventor, author and a political father
of America, never walked around Philadelphia or Boston in a toga.
</P>
<P>
   So why did sculptors depict them that way?
</P>
<P>
   And why do MBA candidates in Rockhurst University's Executive
Fellows Program study those sculptures at the Nelson-Atkins Museum
of Art?
</P>
<P>
   It's all about the trappings of leadership _ the symbols that a
culture uses to convey authority.
</P>
<P>
   Each semester, Rockhurst economics professor Michael Tansey
leads MBA students on tours of the Nelson's collection. Tansey
points out how leaders throughout time have borrowed or been imbued
with emblems of power. Cultures use these visual keys to incite
awe, loyalty and, sometimes, fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   Tansey helps fast-track executives remember that effective
leadership involves more than financial acumen or inherited
position. It helps to look and act the leader's part too, in order
to get anyone to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout history, leaders often looked to shared symbols and
values to build support among their followers,'' Tansey said. ``It
often was a matter of life or death. They looked to things like
religion, politics, family and nationality to connect.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Tansey noted, those are affiliations that ``modern
corporate America can't touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's business leaders have to connect with employees through
different sets of core values, such as honesty and empathy _
characteristics that are a lot harder to illustrate than religion
or military might.
</P>
<P>
   A sculptor put Louis XIV on a horse to convey speed, height and
a position of honor, Tansey said. The king's right hand is raised
in a languid point ahead, a visual cue for his ability to set a
course for France.
</P>
<P>
   Was the pose unrealistic? Yes. But it was, Tansey argued, more
effective as a motivator of Louis XIV's subjects than plopping the
Versailles-building, power-grabbing king on a painted throne.
</P>
<P>
   So what about Franklin in a toga?
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Tansey said, that those who rocked the cradle of
American democracy revered the quest for knowledge undertaken by
the fine minds of ancient Rome. The sculptor's reverential draping
on the bust was a nod to Franklin's rise to leadership through
brilliant thinking, not divine right, aristocracy or military
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tansey, who came to art appreciation naturally as the son of a
noted art historian, Richard G. Tansey, acknowledged that
photographs, perhaps more than painting or sculpture, conveyed
modern symbols of power in picturing corporate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The trappings of leadership _ a gleaming mahogany desktop, a
sleek laptop or pocket-size computer, a mansion in an upscale
neighborhood or a luxury automobile _ often provide the backdrop
for CEO portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Those symbols of power, when pictured with established leaders,
set standards for others to emulate, Tansey said. (Louis XIV's
frenzied palace-building spurred French noblemen to build their own
monstrous homes, thus bankrupting some of them.)
</P>
<P>
   On the museum tour, Tansey said a knight's armor was perhaps the
most blatant symbol of the power and security that such an honored
position offered. But times have changed, he said; simple symbols
don't always suffice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has changed the way people connect with each
other,'' the professor said. ``We don't have to, at least in
business, be ready to die for our leader or our leader for us. But
we do have to connect values, to figure out what we believe in and
where we fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the signals sent from the top _ the emblems of power _
don't fit our values, we don't belong there.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANVILLE, N.J. _ Once again mooring traditionally Democratic
issues to his agenda of his Republican presidential campaign, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas on Tuesday proposed a $5 billion program to
address what he termed a national literacy crisis among children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the program would provide grants to states to test
reading in kindergarten and first grade, to train teachers and to
make tutoring available. He soberly contrasted the nation's
economic success with its educational failings, and declared that
he would bring the same improvements in reading on the national
level that he said he had achieved in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He said every child should know how to read by third grade,
vowing that states that failed to increase student performance
would lose federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more fundamental than teaching our children
how to read,'' Bush said in a speech Tuesday afternoon in Reston,
Va., the first in a series of events this week intended to
spotlight his commitment to improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ``America must confront a national emergency,'' he said. ``Too
many of our children cannot read. In the highest poverty schools _
I want you to hear this statistic _ in the highest poverty schools
in America, 68 percent of fourth-graders could not read at a basic
level in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush said his plan would help roughly 900,000 children
with poor reading skills, at a cost of $1,000 per child per year
for tutoring and other assistance. Besides that $900 million, an
additional $100 million a year would go to testing and teacher
training.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan was quickly dismissed by aides to the apparent
Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore. They sought to shift
attention to Bush's tax cut proposal, saying that it would leave no
money for new education initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall, Bush has introduced a variety of education
proposals, but none of the others would entail spending anywhere
close to the $5 billion he spoke of Tuesday. That sum in turn is
dwarfed by the $115 billion that Gore would spend for new education
initiatives over 10 years, and the disparity in the size of the two
candidates' approaches highlights the challenge facing Bush:
convincing voters that he can lead the nation to new educational
excellence without devoting huge new sums, which would clash with
his fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush introduced his plan as the Republican Party continued to
close ranks around him. Tuesday night, Steve Forbes, who had
attacked the governor as insufficiently conservative before
withdrawing from his own race for the Republican nomination,
endorsed the governor here at a meeting of the Somerset County
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the American people are learning, and will learn,'' Forbes
said at the meeting, in his home state, ``he is a good man. He has
been tested _ I tried to test him _ and he emerged the stronger for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief rival in the primary, Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
has resisted endorsing him, but Bush called McCain on Tuesday in an
apparent bid to salve some of the lingering wounds. Bush said he
hoped that the two would meet soon, and described the conversation
as amiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I both understand that the past is the past and it's
time to move forward,'' Bush told reporters aboard his campaign
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech offered striking evidence of how he is returning
to what was his original strategy _ positioning himself as a
soft-edged, centrist Republican _ after veering to the right in the
primary to fend off McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a coalition of Asian-American groups at the
headquarters of the Student Loan Marketing Association, the
federally sponsored provider of student loans, he proclaimed that
the federal government had to redouble its efforts to confront the
educational plight of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not tolerate illiteracy amongst the disadvantaged
students in the great country called America,'' he said. ``I know
this is something a little new. Others have proposed throwing money
at the problem. But they have proposed resources without reform.
That approach has no history of results, and really no prospect of
success. Under my plan new resources will be an instrument of
reform, not another investment in failure.''
</P>
<P>
   In an echo of language used by the Kerner Commission to describe
the country's racial chasm, Bush said: ``More and more we are
divided into two nations: one that reads and one that can't. And
therefore one that dreams and one that doesn't. Reading is the
basis for all learning, and it must be the foundations for all
other education reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush is not abandoning his belief that the federal
government should not meddle in what is rightly a state and local
issue. Tuesday evening, appearing at a fund-raiser in Parsippany
with Gov. Christie Whitman, he spiritedly declared, as he often did
during the primaries, that he did not want to be the ``federal
superintendent of schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are looking at the wrong man if you want me to be the
national principal,'' he said. ``I believe in local control of
schools. The best education policy is that which bubbles up from
the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech in Virginia, Bush hewed a middle path, criticizing
Gore for seeking to spend large sums without demanding
accountability, and chiding some congressional Republicans for
urging that the Department of Education be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He praised governors and mayors for their education reforms,
pointedly citing Democrats before Republicans. He even approvingly
referred to an anecdote about the importance of high standards told
by Albert Shanker, the late president of the American Federation of
Teachers, a bete noire of many Republican politicians, who say the
teachers unions are obstacles to change.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Bush sought a conciliatory tone, barely mentioning Gore in
the speech, the Gore campaign showed no such reticence. Douglas
Hattaway, a campaign spokesman, said the Bush plan would be
ineffective, and contended that the Clinton administration had
already established a successful national program to improve
reading.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway also renewed the Gore campaign's criticism of Bush's
tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't have the money to pay for a new initiative like this
without dipping into the Social Security surplus or going back to
deficit spending,'' Hattaway said. ``He has to make a choice and he
hasn't said how he is going to pay.''

PHONE SCAMS HIT RESIDENTS IN KANSAS CITY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Scam artists have been calling area residents
with tales that piles of cash are waiting for them with just one
catch: The lucky winners must send thousands of dollars to Canada
to cover taxes first.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scam, say Mission, Kan., police and the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police. Canadian authorities have been working since
February to track down the criminals behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The scam has been directed only at U.S. residents, beginning
with Texans, said Sgt. Bob Mainwaring of the Canadian police's
commercial crime section in Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Mission police first heard about this revival of an old scam
Thursday, when a man told them a caller had tried to talk him into
sending money to Canada. The man, who did not fall for the ruse,
received the call in Overland Park, Kan. ,so Mission police sent
him to that city. Overland Park detectives had not heard from the
man by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, a woman told Mission Police Officer Krista
Shannon that a man said that she had won $125,000 in a Canadian
class-action lawsuit, but that she had to send $7,840 to cover the
taxes. The woman did not have the money, so she went with her
husband to the police station because she was upset about not being
able to claim the $125,000 immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so bad for them,'' Shannon said. ``They wanted to win
so badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon assured the man and the woman that someone was just
trying to steal from them.
</P>
<P>
   The scam artists work hard to be convincing, said another
Mission man who received a call Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The caller spent about 30 minutes trying to make the man and his
wife believe they could claim $100,000 from Publisher's
Clearinghouse Sweepstakes if they first paid a tax on the prize.
The U.S. government would take $30,000, but the man said the
sweepstakes company could route the prize through Canada, which
would cost only $10,000 in taxes, the Mission man said.
</P>
<P>
   The caller told the wife to get her hair done March 30, because
that's when celebrities would stop by with the prize money and take
them to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Myself and Ed McMahon and Dick Clark are going to be
there on the 30th to give you $100,000, but we want it kept secret
because we're going to be carrying a lot of money,' &UR; '' the Mission
man said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mission man said that he had fun keeping the caller on the
line as long as he could, but that he did not fall for the scam. He
reported it to police Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The scam artist who called about the class-action lawsuit told
the woman she could reach him at a number that rings in southern
Alberta, near the U.S. border in Montana. No one returned a call
left at the number on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The second call recipient in Mission was given an 800 number,
which was busy every time he and police called it.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities said the scam artists had been using a
block of southern Alberta phone numbers that were issued to a
company, but they had been unable to get a warrant to find out to
whom they belonged. The numbers could forward the calls somewhere
else, Mainwaring said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. residents who have sent money to the scam artists have used
Western Union money transfers, which let people with the right
numbers claim the money at any North American Western Union office.
At least some of the money had been claimed in Montreal, Mainwaring
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian police are working with FBI and U.S. Customs agents
to track down the criminals. Those who receive calls asking them to
send money should tell police.

<P>
   RUGAZI, Uganda _ In one room the concrete floor looked a little
new, and on a hunch, the police began to dig Tuesday. First they
found a human foot, sole upturned, poking up from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few hours, 28 bodies were hauled out of a pit _
carefully sealed with concrete, maybe months ago _ inside the house
owned by a leader of a cult in western Uganda. By dark the pit was
only half emptied.
</P>
<P>
   It was, on one level, another horrifying discovery in the 11
days since more than 300 people were found burned to death at a
church not far from here. The death toll, from three different
sites, has now risen to at least 591, including 74 bodies found
buried in the backyard of this same house Monday. There are at
least two more suspected grave sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery of the pit may also indicate just how well
organized, and perhaps longstanding, this march to mass murder in
Uganda was.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan police pathologist, Dr. Thaddeus Barungi, said
Tuesday that the corpses buried inside the house were ``much
older'' than the ones in the back yard, which he estimated had been
killed less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the care taken in constructing and sealing the pit may
suggest that the leaders thought they could get away with some
murders early on. There was even an explanation why they needed a
hole in the middle of their house: They had told a local politician
that they planned to install an ``underground'' refrigerator,
police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As each day passes, the police say it becomes clearer that most
_ maybe even all _ the people were slain and were not the victims
of mass suicide, as was originally suspected when the bodies at the
church in the village of Kanungu were discovered March 17.
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators say they cannot rule out suicide for some
people in the church. After all, the cult _ called the Movement for
the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God _ professed to
believe that the world would end on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the other victims found since then show signs of
strangulation: One woman, for example, found in the back yard of
the house here had a banana leaf tied around her neck. The skull of
another corpse was crushed.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday the police unearthed the bodies of 153 people who
had been slashed or strangled from a mass grave at a cult site in
Rutoma, about 30 miles from Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   The police say their investigation has also begun to turn to
exactly how so many people could have been killed _ seemingly
without any neighbors hearing the first of it. There has been much
speculation that many victims were poisoned, particularly because
many corpses show no sign of violence at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't kill all these human beings alone,'' said Godfrey
Bangirana, an assistant police commissioner, on Tuesday as he stood
aside a row of several dozen corpses in the back yard here. ``This
was an organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``And an organized crime cannot be committed by one person,'' he
added. ``It must be a group.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The police have not ruled out the possibility that the leaders,
and particularly the overall leader, Joseph Kibwetere, are still
alive, perhaps having escaped to the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, not far away.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies found Tuesday were in the home of Dominic Kataribabo,
62, an excommunicated priest reported to hold a doctorate in
theology. He lived in a well-constructed stone house of 10 rooms at
the top of a hill in the village here, surrounded by a small banana
plantation, in shouting range of the children who play at the
Rugazi Central Primary School.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and police said the house was apparently a place where
cult members came to study. Both neighbors and the police also say
that cars and small trucks often came to the house at night.
</P>
<P>
   What strains belief is that no one interviewed by reporters
Tuesday at the site _ or by the police _ admitted to having any
idea what was happening there. Even Kataribabo's brother, Arsen
Oworynawe, 78, who lives in a house maybe 20 yards from where the
74 bodies were buried, said he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know such a thing could happen,'' said Oworynawe, a
carpenter who said he helped build his brother's house. The back
yard, he said, had been shielded off by huge reed mats and he could
see nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He had little to say about his brother, except that he did not
seem crazy to him and that he last saw him on March 12, when
Kataribabo said he was going to Kampala, the capital of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was normal,'' his brother said. ``I have a son in Kampala
and I asked him to send greetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Owarynawe said he himself belonged to the cult for about three
months several years ago. ``I didn't like the way they were
preaching,'' he said. ``They never wanted anyone to drink or smoke.
And eating, you know, was a problem. They would eat only once a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, his family sat with cloths covering their noses because
the stench from the bodies was so strong. Owarynawe had his own way
of combating the horror: ``I need a drink,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the local police dug up 74 bodies from one large hole
in the back yard, then reburied them in two other holes the cult
members had already dug. But the local police were supposed to have
waited until Tuesday, when senior investigators arrived to perform
more detailed forensic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a breakdown in communications,'' said Mugenyi
Assuman, a Uganda police spokesman at the site. ``We had told them
to wait but somehow somebody misinformed them yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday a pack of prisoners and laborers in bare feet _ some
with their hands wrapped in garbage bags _ unearthed the bodies
again. Quick autopsies were performed out in the open on some of
the corpses and tissue samples were taken for analysis.
Investigators counted 46 females, 26 males and two of uncertain
sex, including a baby less then three months old.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 28 bodies pulled so far from the pit, 15 were female and
13 were male. Several were young children.

NASA ADMITS ITS `CHEAPER' TRIPS TO MARS WENT TOO FAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of a critical report on its failed Mars
Polar Lander mission, NASA conceded Tuesday that it has pushed its
``faster, better, cheaper'' revolution too far, unfairly asking its
scientists and engineers to do the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found the boundary, and we're stepping back from it,''
said Edward Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space
science. ``We can do missions faster and cheaper, but the major
emphasis must be on the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiler's comments, and the cancellation of another robotic
landing on Mars planned for 2001, came in response to an
independent report, made public Tuesday, that said the Polar Lander
likely was destroyed when it slammed into the Red Planet at 50 mph
after a software glitch signaled the engine to shut off
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   That glitch, the report said, should have been detected by
NASA's contractor, Lockheed-Martin, or by engineers at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. It was not found because
of inadequate testing, a shortage of experienced staff, poor
communication and a budget that was at least 30 percent less than
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The lander was last heard from Dec. 3, nearly a year after it
left Earth on a mission to search for frozen water on the Martian
south pole, evidence that would support the theory that Mars once
supported life, and could again.
</P>
<P>
   The report also looked at past missions that had succeeded and
others that had failed. In past decades the Mars program worked on
single, large projects with heavy oversight that launched only when
they were ready. That gave way under the faster, cheaper mandate to
smaller, multiple missions with tighter staffing. The report's
author said downsizing at NASA had left the project staffs ``one
person deep'' and forced 80-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler, pledging that NASA would learn from its mistakes, said
the agency remains committed to the long-term goal of exploring
Mars, first with robots, and later with a human mission.
</P>
<P>
   He announced that all of the agency's Mars projects would be put
under one official to improve coordination.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hubbard, associate director for astrobiology and space
programs at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, will move to
the agency's Washington headquarters to serve as Mars program
director, Weiler said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also will change the way it doles out money for Mars
projects, keeping some funds in reserve at headquarters to be used
when problems arise. That process, Weiler said, would encourage
better communication between NASA headquarters and its centers
around the country, which would have to ask for extra funds,
hopefully alerting top officials to serious problems before launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means they will know there is a relief valve in
Washington,'' he said. ``It doesn't mean we're going to be a blank
check, but it means if you have a real serious problem, if you're
on the verge of making the wrong decision based on cost and only
cost, you better get your body to Washington and talk to me. We do
not want our best people at JPL to be afraid to raise issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weiler said he doesn't blame anyone at JPL for the loss of
the Polar Lander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pushed them too far and I will not condemn them because
they failed,'' he said. ``In fact, I salute them for trying to
succeed against these substantial odds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration already has asked Congress for $20
million more for Mars exploration in next year's budget proposal,
and NASA Administrator Dan Goldin said last week that the agency
plans to hire 2,000 more employees and improve its training and
mentoring programs.
</P>
<P>
   A planned orbiter mission to Mars will go forward next year,
Weiler said Tuesday, as will the ``systematic search for evidence
of life on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to that, he said, is to ``follow the water.'' Finding it
on Mars would be the basis for humans one day landing on the planet
and exploring it in person because water would provide not only
sustenance, but also the building blocks for air to breathe and
fuel to explore the planet and to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Space aficionados praised the report and NASA's response to it,
but cautioned the space agency not to let up on Mars exploration,
which has drawn enormous public interest and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster, better, cheaper moved us in the right direction, but
it was too far in the right direction,'' said Robert Zubrin,
president of the Colorado-based Mars Society and author of ``The
Case for Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, there have always been mistakes, but the
difference is that there were other people to help catch the
mistakes,'' he said. ``Now the missions are underfunded, we don't
have enough people with the right expertise working on them. And
there's too much saluting going on, saying, `Yes, we can do it for
this amount of money. Yes, the probes are ready to fly now. So it
is written. So it shall be.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just too much of that,'' he said. ``The missions have
to go when they're ready to go and not because someone has
scheduled them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zubrin also said NASA needs a well-defined goal, supported
by the next U.S. president, of sending humans to Mars, just as the
space program got its original boost from President Kennedy's
famous speech pledging to put a man on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a president in the spring of 2001 who will commit us
to getting to Mars in the next decade,'' he said. ``If we don't do
it, we're admitting we are a nation of people who are much less
than we were before.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Friedman, executive director of the California-based
Planetary Society, also encouraged the space agency and politicians
to embrace the Mars program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it doesn't slow down too much. Everybody wants the
problems fixed, and corrections made, but I hope they don't slip
into less ambitious missions in the future,'' he said. ``The danger
is in overreacting, so we learn from our mistakes and move on.''

BROOKLYN MUSEUM ISN'T GLOATING AFTER FEUD WITH MAYOR ENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert S. Rubin, the chairman of the Brooklyn Museum
of Art, sounded a bit grumpy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he had forced Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a man not
prone to backing down, to do just that. There will be no more
eviction threats, no more budget grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tuesday on the telephone, Rubin was in little mood to gloat,
at least not publicly. He reacted cautiously, like a child tasting
eggplant for the first time, to a softball question about whether
the museum would emerge stronger from its bitter six-month feud
with Giuliani. ``I really thought that it was over,'' he said,
sighing.
</P>
<P>
   In this topsy-turvy case, the winners are worried about what may
have been lost _ in public trust, in long-term government and
corporate support, in the willingness to display art that offends
some people _ just as the losers are hopeful about what may have
been won: Roman Catholic votes in a certain Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was real scary to a lot of us,'' said Alan J. Friedman,
chairman of the Cultural Institutions Group, a consortium of 33
museums and libraries that receive financing from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensation,'' an exhibition of contemporary British art,
angered Giuliani and many Catholics because it included a portrait
of the Virgin Mary with a breast fashioned from elephant dung.
Giuliani threatened to evict the museum and cut off its subsidies
for staging ``Sensation,'' an act that prompted the museum to sue
the city for violating its First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Although that case has now been settled, Rubin, for one, seemed
genuinely uncertain on Tuesday about the long-term consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Rubin said, museum membership is up 20 to 25 percent since
``Sensation.'' But, he said, who knows whether those new members
will remain a year from now? Sure, he said, new donors have ``come
out of the woodwork.'' But that too might be a temporary response,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, meanwhile, has mentioned the controversy in his
campaign literature, and he seized on the issue on Tuesday to make
an appeal to Catholics and cultural conservatives, two vital
constituencies for him in his Senate campaign against Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if I get the opportunity to vote sometime in the United
States Senate,'' he told reporters, ``I would vote very, very
differently than my opponent on the issue of whether public funds
should be used to desecrate people's religion, which I think is an
abominable use of public funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario M. Cuomo, the former governor of New York and a frequent
Giuliani critic, said Giuliani's capitulation was politically
smart. The mayor, Cuomo said, long ago scored his points with
Catholic voters. ``You don't have to bring it up,'' he said. ``They
know what you've done.''
</P>
<P>
   So there was no further gain in prolonging a lost legal cause.
``This was a necessary step,'' Cuomo said, ``and therefore an
intelligent one to take.'' Among museum professionals, Monday's
settlement was more an occasion of relief than of jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the case became an embarrassment, because it laid
open, in a public way, the messy and sometimes ethically uncertain
business of financing and staging a major art exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the museum were forced to give the city thousands of
pages of museum documents related to ``Sensation,'' from
memorandums by museum executives to e-mail messages by
representatives of Charles Saatchi, the advertising magnate who
owns the ``Sensation'' works.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the records revealed the extent to which the
director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Arnold Lehman _ having
failed to secure financial help from traditional corporate sources
_ resorted to raising money from those with a commercial interest
in the ``Sensation'' art.
</P>
<P>
   Although museum officials denied receiving financial support
from Saatchi, the records showed that he was the single largest
contributor, and that Lehman gave him a major role in shaping the
content of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the disclosures, several museum officials said,
Lehman's standing has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is something of a consensus that Arnold erred in
two areas,'' said one New York City museum director. ``First, the
advertising campaign was simply over the top,'' he said, referring
to mock public health advertisements warning that ``Sensation''
might cause vomiting. ``And second, it was obviously foolhardy to
dissemble about Saatchi's financial support.'' But neither is a
serious mistake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman did not respond to messages left at his office seeking
comment.

DEBATE OVER HOW TO PUNISH HATE CRIMES HAS FEW DEFINITE ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
 TWO TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Punch somebody in the nose because you're
angry, or just because you're a jerk, and risk a simple assault
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Slug them because you can't stomach that person's sexuality,
skin color or religion and _ in the 22 states with America's
broadest hate-crime laws _ that smack and the penalties for it
become something more.
</P>
<P>
   Why, wonder critics, is one wallop different from another? As
Shakespeare wrote, ``If you prick us, do we not bleed?'' Whether
gay or straight, white or black, Jew or gentile?
</P>
<P>
   Yet research on gay bashings, at least, suggests that beatings
delivered out of ill will toward a group of people really are
different. University of California-Davis psychologist Gregory
Herek found that anti-homosexual attacks leave victims suffering
deeper and longer-lasting depression and fear than other violent
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do more damage to the victim than the average assault,''
Herek said. ``It makes sense for policy to take that into
account.''
</P>
<P>
   A swastika scratched on a Jew's car is more, the argument
continues, than merely damage to a paint job. A cross burned on a
black family's lawn does more than just singe some grass.
</P>
<P>
   Those crimes terrorize whole communities, say those urging
Congress to expand federal hate-crime jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents respond that hate-crime laws go beyond punishing
actions. By exploring a criminal's prejudices, they say, this level
of political correctness attempts to police thought.
</P>
<P>
   Serious penalties already exist for serious offenses, they say,
and hate-crime laws only feed resentment between groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Libertarian Party, opposed to hate-crime laws on grounds
that they violate standards of equal justice, seized on federal
statistics recently to contend that blacks are twice as likely as
whites to be charged with hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate-crime laws are apparently being used as another legal
weapon to prosecute African-Americans,'' said Steve Dasbach,
national director of the Libertarian Party.
</P>
<P>
   He noted the case of Obie Weathers, a black man accused of
beating two elderly white men and bludgeoning to death an
82-year-old white woman in San Antonio in mid-February. He
allegedly told police, ``I hate all white people.'' The attacks are
being investigated as hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Ronald Taylor was accused of shooting two
persons and critically wounding three others in Wilkinsburg, Pa.,
in a spree that witnesses said spared blacks but not whites. He has
been charged with hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another example of the law of unintended consequences:
Legislation designed to punish white racists has wound up
condemning more blacks to prison to serve longer sentences,''
Dasbach said.
</P>
<P>
   The Libertarians came to their conclusions by comparing federal
tallies of the 2,336 anti-black hate crimes blamed on whites in
1997 to the 718 anti-white crimes blamed on blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adjusting for the fact that blacks make up just 13 percent of
the (U.S.) population, they were statistically twice as likely as
whites to face prosecution for hate crimes,'' a Libertarian news
release concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the same FBI data show anti-black crimes to be more
than three times as common as anti-white crimes.
</P>
<P>
   And those statistics suggest anti-gay crimes are more than 300
times as common as those against people who are targets because of
their heterosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Such comparisons sometimes prompt discussion of the death last
September of Jesse Dirkhising, a 13-year-old boy drugged, bound,
raped and suffocated in Arkansas. Why, wonder some, don't
supporters of hate-crime laws champion this case? Is it, they
suggest, because the accused killers are gay?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions about the Dirkhising case, civil-rights
activists respond, miss the point of hate-crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a white attacks a black, or a gay man attacks a
heterosexual man does not a hate crime make,'' said Mark Potok,
editor of the Intelligence Report, which tracks hate groups. He
said that ``you have to have some evidence that bias motivated the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Potok doubts hate-crime laws work as deterrents, but he supports
them as symbolically important.
</P>
<P>
   The case for more far-reaching hate-crime laws often is argued
in the context of the 1998 death of James Byrd Jr., a black man
dragged to pieces behind a pickup in rural Texas by avowed racists
motivated by prejudice. Likewise, the slaying of Matthew Shepard _
a gay man beaten, burned and tied to a fence in 1998 by two men who
admitted to singling him out because he was homosexual _ is cited
as the kind of case that would benefit from federal law enforcement
help.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University political scientist Donald Green warned against
drawing conclusions from hate-crime statistics or high-profile
stories. The statistics, he said, don't mean much.
</P>
<P>
   States and cities compile and report with wildly varying
precision. Some simply don't collect the numbers. Others keep track
but don't report their figures to the federal government. So the
numbers used to make any case should be viewed, he said, with great
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very critical of people who say it's a growing problem,''
Green said. ``And people who say the laws don't work have no
evidence, either. The truth is we just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   His research found that hate crimes were most common during the
rapid migration of new groups into once-segregated areas. Green
believes hate crimes are more serious than other acts of violence,
but he says hate-crime laws don't necessarily work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're effective because I don't think they're
given a fair chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, public service announcements to make
people aware of hate-crime laws _ ostensibly a deterrent _ are
rare.
</P>
<P>
   Quick: Does Missouri, does Kansas, does the place where you live
have a hate-crime law? Research suggests you probably don't know. A
hate crime can buy you extra jail time in Missouri, but not in
Kansas, where lawmakers are considering legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 42 states and the District of Columbia have hate-crime
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The sole federal hate-crime law rests in a 1968 civil rights act
that calls for added penalties for violence carried out ``because
of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national
origin of any person.'' (MORE)

PATRICK-STEWART-THEATER -- Patrick Stewart in Arthur Miller's play
``The Ride Down Mount Morgan.'' Stewart's first ``Ride,'' at the
Joseph Papp Public Theater in 1998, brought him mixed reviews and a
mild concussion. So why has he decided to star again in the Arthur
Miller play - this time on Broadway? ``There are some roles that
gnaw at you,'' said the Royal Shakespeare Company veteran and
``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' captain. ``There's this impulse
that I must do it again, that I almost got it right, but not
quite.'' (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times)

DEBATE OVER HOW TO PUNISH HATE CRIMES HAS FEW DEFINITE ANSWERS

</P>
<P>
   Pending legislation to change that law would give federal law
enforcement the power to step into more cases, especially when
state and local police lack the resources or desire to pursue hate
crimes. It would also add gender, disability and sexual orientation
to the protected categories.
</P>
<P>
   The existing federal law has not been used to prosecute more
than 10 persons in any year. No case has involved black-on-white
violence. Instead, the cases have been like the conviction of four
men who burned a cross on a woman's lawn in Rushville, Mo., in 1997
because they thought she was involved in interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Although reliable statistics remain elusive, legal experts say
most cases have been prosecuted under various state laws rather
than the federal statute.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri amended its hate-crime law last summer _ with a bill
sponsored by a legislator outraged at the Shepard case _ to include
sexual orientation. So now singling someone out for attack because
that person is gay or lesbian could turn a one-year jail sentence
into a five-year prison term, or a five-year prison term into a
seven-year penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Supreme Court upheld hate-crime penalties in 1994
in a case of a man convicted of burning a cross on the porch of a
West Plains church.
</P>
<P>
   A Wisconsin case involving black men who beat up a white man and
stole his sneakers after they emerged angry from a screening of the
movie ``Mississippi Burning'' gave the clearest court test of
hate-crime laws. It led to a 1993 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that
said racism and other biases can be calculated in setting penalties
for a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of these laws is that you can be a bigot, but if you
act on that attitude you could serve serious time,'' said Michael
Lieberman, who lobbies for the federal bill on behalf of the
Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crime which happens merely because of someone's race or
religion or sexual orientation, that's something as a society we
can say is against our core values,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, though, say hate-crime laws amount to good intentions
gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who are caught up in these things are
teen-agers or poor people who don't follow public affairs,'' said
Tim Lynch, an attorney at the libertarian Cato Institute. ``So how
is it going to stop them if they're not even aware of the laws in
the first place?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the federal legislation advances this year, observers
say, may turn on the emergence of a particularly ugly crime that
echoes the meanness that left Matthew Shepard mortally wounded and
lashed to a fence. So far, there have been hearings in Congress but
no committee votes.
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union weigh in with
conditional support. The ACLU says it will back the bill only if
strict limits are added on how evidence can be used in hate-crime
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate-crime legislation raises difficult questions,'' said
Christopher Anders, an ACLU lobbyist in Washington. ``You need to
make sure you answer them in a way that protects people from a
special kind of violence while still not infringing on what someone
used to read or what someone used to think.''

Miller play - this time on Broadway? ``There are some roles that

Vocational Technical High School in Fall River, Ed Kerr, who heads
the school's culinary program, assisted students in the preparation
of a seafood tortellini flambe. ``They come in here and ask if we

Constitution that could make desecrating the American flag illegal.
Meanwhile, outside the Capitol, representatives of various
veteran's groups from around the United States protested in favor
of the amendment. The pending proposal, sponsored by Sen. Orin
Hatch, R-Utah, is likely to mirror the last flag-desecration vote
in the Senate, in 1995, when supporters fell three short of the
two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution. (Stephen

decide whether such acts can be punished more harshly under
hate-crime laws. New Jersey's lawyer, Lisa S. Gochman, right,
argued that motive is a traditional sentencing factor that properly
was decided by the judge in the case. Judges can sentence people to
death by finding aggravating factors, and they also can increase
sentences under hate-crime laws, she said. Gochman and John Farmer,

Big corporate operators have taken over the bulk of Iowa's pork
production, with dire results not only for the small farmer but
also for those of us who were raised on succulent pork chops and
pork roasts. Fat gives pork some of its flavor, but modern hogs are
bred to minimize fat. Kelly Biensen, a fifth-generation hog farmer,
is determined to do things differently. Biensen and his wife are
retro-pioneers who are producing pork, like this young piglet, the
old-fashioned way; giving them lots of room to move about. They
also refuse to use the drugs and hormones many corporate farms use.

PATRICK-STEWART-THEATER -- Patrick Stewart in Arthur Miller's play
``The Ride Down Mount Morgan.'' Stewart's first ``Ride,'' at the
Joseph Papp Public Theater in 1998, brought him mixed reviews and a
mild concussion. So why has he decided to star again in the Arthur
Miller play - this time on Broadway? ``There are some roles that
gnaw at you,'' said the Royal Shakespeare Company veteran and
``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' captain. ``There's this impulse
that I must do it again, that I almost got it right, but not

PANEL BLAMES TOP NASA OFFICIALS FOR LAPSES IN MARS PROGRAM 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An investigative panel Tuesday blamed a mismanaged Mars program
for the design flaw that most likely caused NASA's Mars Polar
Lander to crash on the surface of the Red Planet in December.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw, triggered by improper electrical wiring and
inadequately tested computer software before its launching, caused
its landing rockets to shut off while the the probe was still
airborne, the panel concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 18-member panel and its half-dozen consultants
identified the flaw as the most likely cause of the Polar Lander
failure, investigators found even more troubling, underlying
reasons for the losses of the Polar Lander and a companion
spacecraft, the Mars Climate Orbiter, in September.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's aggressive efforts to explore Mars with robot
probes is underfunded, understaffed and fails to employ the kinds
of pre-launch testing and critical independent oversight that
should have uncovered and corrected the problems.
</P>
<P>
   The findings will force NASA to slow its efforts to determine
whether Mars, now arrid and frigid, was once warm and wet enough to
harbor some form of life. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``It's important to recognize that in space it's a
`one-strike-and-you-are-out' business,'' said Thomas Young, the
former Martin Marietta Corp. aerospace company executive and space
agency official who chaired the investigative panel. ``Thousands of
functions can be done correctly, but one mistake can cause a
mission failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel blamed NASA's top administrators in Washington, Mars
program officials at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., and the agency's spacecraft contractor, Lockheed Martin
Astronautics of Denver, for the lapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found significant flaws in the formulation and execution of
the Mars program,'' Young told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging its shortcomings, the space agency said it expects
to reshape its Mars exploration strategy by mid-summer after a
critical review and make immediate changes to the way it manages
the effort. However, JPL will continue to develop and control the
probes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight we asked them to do the impossible,'' Ed Weiler,
NASA's associate administrator for space science, said of the JPL
staff. With more funding, the mission could have succeeded, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The retooling will slow the efforts NASA began in 1996 to launch
a pair of spacecraft to the Red Planet every 26 months. One is to
study the planet globally from orbit and the other to land and
explore a confined region. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Weiler said NASA has canceled plans for the 2001 launch of a
probe similar to the Polar Lander.
</P>
<P>
   The Young panel was formed in the aftermath of the Dec. 3 loss
of the Polar Lander, which was launched 11 months previously to
search for frozen water in the subsoil of the Martian south pole.
The space agency had invested $372 million in the Polar Lander and
the Climate Orbiter, which was lost as it reached Mars on Sept. 23.
The Climate Orbiter was to chart the daily migration of water vapor
in the planet's thin atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Flight control teams at JPL lost communications, as expected,
when the Polar Lander separated from the rocket stage that
delivered it from Earth. Communications were not to resume until
the probe had made a successful plunge into the atmosphere and a
controlled final descent by parachute and braking rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Transmissions to Earth were to resume after the probe reached
the Martian surface, deploying power-generating solar arrays and a
communications antenna. They never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Handicapped by the lack of transmissions during the probe's 10
1/2-minute descent, the Young panel was nonetheless able to
pinpoint a flaw in the landing gear system of the spacecraft that
would have caused it to crash even if other complex systems had
worked perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw surfaced in late January as Lockheed Martin was
preparing NASA's 2001 Mars lander for its mission. The flaw led
investigators to re-examine the assembly of the Polar Lander, which
revealed that small sensors on its landing gear had been improperly
wired and that computer software associated with the sensors and
the probe's flight computer had not been adequately tested.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investigators concluded, the three legs of the
landing gear deployed and locked into place as the Polar Lander
reached an altitude of 4,800 feet above the Martian surface.
</P>
<P>
   Each leg was equipped with a small magnetic sensor that was to
send a signal to the flight computer as soon as the first of the
legs made contact with the Martian terrain. The signal was to shut
off the probe's 12 small landing rockets, which began thrusting to
slow the Polar Lander's descent at an altitude of about 4,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   However, the investigators determined that on Polar Lander the
landing sensors could send an erroneous signal of landing as soon
as the legs were deployed. The signal would cause the descent
thrusters to shut off while the probe was still 130 feet above the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Without the braking pulses from the thrusters, the Polar Lander
struck the surface at a speed of 50 miles per hour, causing a
destructive impact.
</P>
<P>
   The panel found that NASA conducted a pre-launch test of the
landing rockets but that the sensors did not generate the touchdown
signals as was intended.
</P>
<P>
   It traced the lack of signal to faulty wiring of the sensors.
After the sensors were re-wired, NASA did not repeat the testing
that would have unmasked the software problem.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the task of the investigators was NASA's
decision not to include a communications device on the lander that
would send ``telemetry,'' or data that would reveal what was
happening to the Polar Lander as it made its way to the surface.
The transponder was determined to be too expensive and too heavy
for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (panel) believes that not having a communications system
was a major mistake,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The wider cause of NASA's Mars probe problems was linked to its
aggressive efforts to launch missions every 26 months at
increasingly lower cost, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the panel pointed out, NASA launched the Mars
Pathfinder, a lander and rover that successfully reached the rocky
terrain of the Martian equator on July 4, 1997. Two months later,
the Mars Global Surveyor, a camera-equipped orbiter, successfully
reached the Red Planet and continues to send images of
unprecedented detail to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   NASA spent $196 million on Pathfinder's development, but capped
combined development expenditures on the failed Polar Lander and
Climate Orbiter at $188 million.
</P>
<P>
   Young's panel concluded a 30 percent underfunding of the Polar
Lander mission prompted NASA to cut back on personnel as well as
the ground testing that would have uncovered the design flaws and
lack of communications gear.
</P>
<P>
   At JPL, only 10 people were assigned to the Polar Lander project
office that was supervising contract personnel at Lockheed Martin.
As a result, Polar Lander project personnel were working 60 and
sometimes 80 hours a week to prepare for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't the right number of people to do the kinds of
things you got to do to get a project off on its proper footing,''
said Young. ``They were trying to do everything humanly possible to
make this program work. There just wasn't enough of them. There
wasn't enough reserves (funding). In the end that all manifested in
them not having enough time.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Tech Alliance Gives State Mixed Grades  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
California got a passing grade in educating its future workforce in
technology, according to a report card to be released by the
American Electronics Association today. But the state is at the
bottom of the class when it comes to infrastructure, such as
transportation and housing.
<P>
   The State Government Affairs Committee, a 35-member group made
up of the AEA's largest California companies, gave the state's
education and workforce training efforts a C-, an improvement from
last year's D+, and the group said that it expected the situation
to continue improving this year. But California still lags behind
other states in turning out qualified high-tech workers, according
to Teresa Casazza, AEA's vice president of California public
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our significant issue is lack of an educated workforce. We
have quite a few jobs that are unfilled right now,'' Casazza said.
About 269,000 high-tech jobs are empty nationwide, according to the
Computing Technology Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   Less promising is the state's infrastructure _ its
transportation, housing and public facilities _ which the AEA says
is stagnating with a grade of D+.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has left our infrastructure in a state of decline
for the last 20 years,'' Casazza said. ``California is behind
almost any state I can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, the state weighed in at a solid average: C+ for
corporate tax environment, C+ for environmental regulation, and C-
for legal environment.
</P>
<P>
   The AEA has been comparing California to other states and
grading it on issues that affect business since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the state's best subject was electronic commerce,
which it aced, mostly on the strength of the Legislature's passing
of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act in 1999. The act allows
electronic contracts and digital signatures to be used in
transactions. Last year, electronic commerce got an A-.
</P>
<P>
   Education's improved grade reflects several bills that passed in
the state Legislature in 1999 which the AEA believes will lead to a
better educated pool of high-tech workers in the future. Casazza
said that a major step forward was the adoption of statewide
academic rankings for public schools, part of Gov. Gray Davis'
education reform package in 1999. The state also made it easier for
people with master's degrees in high technology to get teacher
credentials in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 85 high-tech executives, members of the AEA, are at the
capitol in Sacramento, lobbying for _ among other things _ the
passage of two more education bills: AB1492, which would bring more
technology funds to classrooms with low computer-to-student ratios,
and AB2, which would exempt employees from paying taxes on tuition
reimbursement for graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   The report card rated the area's infrastructure harshly because
of the litany of problems that have accompanied California's
population and economic growth: lack of housing, transportation and
adequate water supply, as well as the deterioration of public
school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The infrastructure problem that poses the biggest threat to
California's economy is transportation, said Mark Nelson, manager
of government affairs for Hewlett-Packard, one of the 35 companies
that voted on the report card.
</P>
<P>
   ``If individuals and goods and services cannot move effectively
around a community, pretty soon people want to move somewhere
else,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   While the group praised the governor for creating a commission
to study infrastructure issues, Casazza said, ``We don't see any
really positive results in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Electronics Association is headquartered in Santa
Clara and in Washington, D.C. In California, about 1,400 technology
companies belong to the organization.

 _ SF CHRON   Microsoft a Safe Date at Tech-Stock Party 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
If you think the tech-stock party has gotten out of hand, but
you're afraid to be a pooper in case it still has a long way to go,
here's a way to have some good safe fun.
<P>
   Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Yea, buying Microsoft is like taking your brother to the prom,
but it is almost a value stock by today's insane standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 months, Microsoft is up 17 percent. Respectable,
but over the same period, the Nasdaq composite index is ahead 100
percent, while Cisco Systems, which overtook Microsoft as the most
valuable company this week, rose 196 percent. Oracle, Microsoft's
nemesis, has gained a stratospheric 530 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Ron Elijah, manager of the RS Value Plus Growth fund
in San Francisco, considers Microsoft ``the cheapest tech stock.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's antitrust case against Microsoft has
overshadowed the start of a powerful new product cycle with Windows
2000, says Christopher Galvin, an analyst with Chase H&AMP;Q in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft could rise 40 percent during over  &LR; the next 12 months
as Windows 2000 starts ``rippling through their numbers,'' Galvin
says. ``The trial has presented a wonderful buying opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors think any resolution of the case _ which could
take a few days or a few years _ will lift the lid on Microsoft
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Microsoft shares surged $8.63, to $111.88, when
it looked as though the Justice Department was backing down on its
demand that the company be broken up, paving the way for a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   When a deal wasn't forthcoming, the stock fell back, closing
yesterday at $104.31.
</P>
<P>
   But even a breakup might not be bad. (Think: Baby Bells.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there would be a 15 to 20 percent near-term increase
in the stock'' if Microsoft were broken up, said Michael Kwatinetz,
an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pulled out the Internet piece, it would be worth $50
billion or so,'' he said. ``Currently, the Internet properties
(including the MSN portal and ISP) are subtracting from the stock
because they're losing money. But a separate Internet company would
be valued on revenues'' instead of earnings, or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Over the longer term, however, Kwatinetz agrees with Microsoft
that shareholders would be better off if the company stays in one
piece, and that's what he expects will happen. ``We think the
resolution won't be structural, it will be behavioral.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Department of Justice seems to have the upper hand
at this point, and is pushing for a court verdict rather than a
settlement, Kwatinetz says that if the DOJ waits too long, it could
end up with a Republican president who might not be as
``pro-antitrust'' as the current one. The DOJ ``would be wise to
grab victory before the balance of power shifts. This is as
favorable as it's going to be for the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwatinetz thinks the stock could reach $150 to $170 in 12
months, assuming the antitrust case is either settled or at a ``low
ebb'' at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Elijah points out that Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) are
growing at about the same rate _ both had an 18 percent gain in
revenues in the latest quarter, although Oracle's earnings per
share had a bigger jump _ 70 percent versus 31 percent for
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   For their latest fiscal years, however, Microsoft posted a 57
percent gain in EPS on a 29 percent increase in revenues. Oracle's
earnings grew 37 percent on a 24 percent gain in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracle stock is trading at 155 times earnings, while
Microsoft is trading at ``only'' 65 times. That's why Elijah
considers Microsoft a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Landis, portfolio manager with the Firsthand Funds in San
Jose, sees it differently. He calls Microsoft ``expensive, but that
doesn't mean overpriced.''
</P>
<P>
   In most corporations, he says, PCs are running Microsoft
operating systems and Oracle databases. This gives both companies a
``foot in the door'' for all kinds of e-commerce opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, he thinks both companies have the same Internet
potential, but Oracle's market value ($244 billion) is smaller than
Microsoft's ($543 billion), making Oracle the better buy.
</P>
<P>
   While they differ on Microsoft's upside potential, most analysts
think the downside risk is modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to envision it going a lot lower than 100,''
Kwatinetz said. ``There's just so much value there. There's more
market risk. If the market goes down, it'll be dragged down, but
not as much as some of these other highfliers.''
</P>
<P>
   Landis believes the downside is simpler. ``It's like the saying,
`Alexander wept for there were no more worlds to conquer.' That is
the risk in buying a big and famously successful company. They've
run out of ways to double and triple themselves. The market pays
you for growth and punishes you for stagnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a top-rated analyst definitely helps investment banks
land initial public offerings, but does it help investors who buy
the IPOs?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, according to a new, unpublished study.
</P>
<P>
   When companies choose an investment bank to take them public,
they always want one with an influential analyst who will give them
a glowing recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   But over the long term, it's the company, not the analyst, that
determines a stock's performance, says Revell Horsey, a managing
director with Bank of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Horsey's people recently looked at all IPOs since 1990 and
tracked their performance for 18 months versus the Nasdaq composite
index. Then they looked at the star quality of the analyst for the
lead investment bank on each IPO.
</P>
<P>
   When the investment bank had an analyst ranked No. 1 by
Institutional Investor magazine (the Wall Street equivalent of an
Oscar), the stock outperformed the Nasdaq by a whole (yawn) 1
percent on average.
</P>
<P>
   When the underwriter's analyst was ranked 2, 3, or 4, the
stock's performance was virtually identical to the index.
</P>
<P>
   When the analyst was not rated, the stock underperformed the
index by an infinitesimal 0.3 percent.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Mars Polar Lander spacecraft probably failed
last year because its descent engine shut down prematurely, but the
mission's loss can ultimately be blamed on inadequate management,
testing and financing, independent experts told NASA on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the findings, NASA officials announced a shakeup in
the management of its Mars programs. They also said they had
canceled plans to launch a new Mars lander next year and would
probably revise or delay other missions to the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In candid reports assessing recent problems with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's programs to explore Mars,
two panels concluded that pressures to conform to the agency's
recent credo of ``faster, cheaper, better'' ended up compromising
ambitious projects.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the new constraints, the reports said, project managers
sacrificed needed testing and realistic assessments of the risks of
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Young, a former NASA official who was chairman of the
team reviewing the agency's Mars program, said the lander and two
small probes it carried that also failed were the victims of
several management mistakes, including inadequate testing before
launching.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were trying to do too much with too little, and not
adequately conveying their concerns to others, particularly upper
management,'' Young, who is also a retired executive vice president
of Lockheed Martin Corp. _ the primary contractor on the lander
project _ said after a news conference at NASA headquarters in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had a sense of how much trouble they were actually
in,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Young's panel, and another team looking into the lander failure
led by John Casani, a former head of flight operations at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which manages the
Mars missions, both concluded that no one would ever know exactly
why the spacecraft failed on Dec. 3. The spacecraft vanished
without a trace after beginning its landing sequence during a
period of radio silence.
</P>
<P>
   But tests conducted on an engineering model of the $165 million
lander suggest that switches on its landing legs that were supposed
to signal touchdown on the planet probably generated false signals
when the legs extended.
</P>
<P>
   These signals probably caused an onboard computer to cut off the
lander's engines too soon, leading it to crash onto the Martian
surface, the review groups said. Instead of being near the ground
for engine cutoff, they said, the craft was actually 132 feet in
the air and slammed to the surface at 50 miles an hour.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Young said that four tests deploying the lander's three legs
were conducted this year on the engineering model and the false
shut-off signal occurred each time. This problem could have been
easily corrected with a software change in the spacecraft's
computer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The actual lander was tested this way only once before
launching, he said, but the problem did not show up because of a
separate wiring problem. After the wiring trouble was discovered
and corrected, though, the test was not repeated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars projects were underfinanced ``by at least 30 percent,''
Young said, forcing engineers with NASA and Lockheed Martin to cut
corners and take unnecessary risks to save money and meet
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   The assessments joined several other recent reviews assessing
the effect of NASA's ``faster, cheaper, better'' approach to space
missions.
</P>
<P>
   For more than seven years, as the agency faced shrinking annual
budgets, NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin has called for doing
more with less. Instead of planning a few billion-dollar missions
that take a decade or more to execute, the agency's new approach
calls for doing many smaller projects that take only two or three
years to complete for a few hundred million dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent panels have suggested the new approach may have
gone too far by emphasizing cost-cutting and tight schedules at the
price of quality. Goldin has acknowledged the problems as ``growing
pains'' and recently asked Congress for money to add more engineers
and safety experts to ease pressure on existing staff members and
to train new project managers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space
science, said that the faster, cheaper, better philosophy has been
successful, but that recent problems have helped define its limits.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that since 1992, NASA has launched 146 payloads valued
at $18 billion and that only 10 have failed. Those failures,
though, include both the Mars lander and its companion craft, the
$125 million Mars Climate Orbiter, which was lost Sept. 23 because
of navigation errors caused by the failure to convert English
measurements to metric.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found the boundary of what we can do with faster,
cheaper, better and now we've stepping back from the boundary,''
Weiler said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The reports issued Wednesday found failures in communication
between project officials and managers at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, which oversees interplanetary missions, as well as
between these managers and Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   And NASA headquarters in Washington had little idea of the
problems being encountered with the projects in California,
panelists said.
</P>
<P>
   To address these problems, Weiler said, the agency has named a
new Mars program director in Washington to oversee all related
programs. Scott Hubbard, a NASA executive at the Ames Research
Center in Mountain View, Calif., will assume the new post. In
addition, Weiler said, a Mars program director will be appointed at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler also said the entire Mars exploration plan was being
reviewed and revised, an effort that would probably change some
planned missions and extend the time needed to complete them. The
program had called for launches to Mars every two years,
culminating in a 2006 attempt to use robot craft to bring samples
of Mars back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to be a five- or six-year program, that's
going to be a decade-long program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler said that instruments for the canceled 2001 lander
mission would be completed and used on later missions. An orbital
mission around Mars scheduled for 2001 will go ahead as planned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard E. McCurdy of American University, a space historian
who is an expert on NASA management, said that the assessments of
recent failures are telling NASA what it should already know.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either have tight program management with headquarters
involved or you have extensive testing of everything before you
launch a mission to make sure everything works,'' McCurdy said.
``For successful programs, there is no substitute for experienced
program management, independent reviews to see that you're going in
the right direction and testing, testing, testing.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by outside experts on future directions of the Mars
program is due later this spring, Weiler said. And this summer, he
said, NASA would respond to the recent flurry of assessments _
which have looked at subjects from space shuttle operations to
training _ with a report on how it is changing its operations based
on the numerous recommendations.

JACKSON WORRIES ABOUT OVERCONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - The Lakers have the best record in the NBA, &UR;  &LR; an
insurmountable lead in the West and are about to reach the 60-win
plateau in near-record speed.
</P>
<P>
   And coach Phil Jackson sees a bit of attitude emanating from his
troops. So much so, that he almost would have welcomed a loss
Sunday in Sacramento, where the Lakers pulled out a dramatic
victory in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, there's always the idea that it may not be such a
bad game to lose, on national TV and maybe get them a little
humbler about themselves,'' Jackson said. ``They're pretty damn
cocky right now. And they found a way to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   That cockiness, Jackson said, is OK -- ``as long as you wear it
on your sleeve, but you don't carry it in your mouth or demean
people, I feel that it's OK to carry that air, because that's
really what it's all about, is having that voice of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely to ebb, with the Lakers riding a six-game
winning streak and heading into Vancouver tonight for what should
be a routine victory. That would give the Lakers a 60-12 record,
making them the second fastest team in franchise history to reach
the 60-win mark. The 1971-72 team got to 60 in 71 games.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran A.C. Green, perhaps the most humble guy in the locker
room, said cockiness is part of being a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have confidence,'' Green said. ``At this time of
the season, we're still shooting for goals in the regular season,
as well as trying to position ourselves for the playoffs and the
right frame of mind, as well as body.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have to have a sense of pride to us. But we have to make
sure that we keep one another in check, that we don't have an
overconfidence position. But I don't think that will be the case.
We've got a lot of veteran guys on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers are certain of one thing -- with a seven-game
lead on Portland as of Tuesday, they've got the No. 1 seed in the
West locked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they believe that they've got it,'' Jackson said, ``and
I think they've believed (since) the night we beat Portland (Feb.
29). I thinkthatUs the time they really started believing, hey we
can go and play anywhere right now in this league and win. And
that's the important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Glen Rice is suffering from flu-like symptoms and
did not travel with the team to Vancouver on Tuesday. Rice said he
might catch a flight today if he feels better this morning.
</P>
<P>
   If Rice is unavailable, Jackson could start either Rick Fox or
rookie Devean George, who is recovering from the flu himself.
</P>
<P>
   When Rice missed a game in December, Jackson went with George,
rather than disrupt the rotation, but Fox played most of the game.
</P>

   LAKERS vs. VANCOUVER
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7 p.m., GM Place
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: KCAL-Channel 9; KLAC-AM (570)
</P>
<P>
   Lakers (59-12) update: They haven't lost to a Western Conference
team since Feb. 1, in San Antonio, and that trend doesn't figure to
change tonight. The Lakers have beaten Vancouver three times
already this season and have lost to them just once since the
Grizzlies' inception in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies (19-50) update: They've been off since Saturday and
should be well-rested if nothing else. The Grizzlies have lost 13
of their last 14 games, the lone victory coming against Golden
State.

AIR FORCE REPORT LINKS AGENT ORANGE TO DIABETES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
(mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In its most clear-cut acknowledgment that there is
evidence linking Agent Orange to illness among Vietnam veterans,
the Air Force said in a new report that there was ``particularly
strong evidence'' tying the defoliant to the onset of diabetes in
veterans who were involved in spraying it over the Vietnamese
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 1,000 Air Force veterans who participated in the
aerial spraying operation, known during the war as Operation Ranch
Hand, found that there were 47 percent more diabetes cases among
those who had the highest level of exposure to the herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The rates of illness among the 1,000 veterans were compared to
those of 1,300 other Air Force veterans who also served in the war
but had no involvement in the spraying of agent orange, a herbicide
that was used to defoliate trees and remove cover for North
Vietnamese soldiers and Communist guerrillas in the south.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter attached to the report, which was sent Tuesday to
Capitol Hill, the Air Force's surgeon general, Lt. Gen. Paul K.
Carlton Jr., said the results offered ``the strongest evidence to
date that Agent Orange is associated with adult-onset diabetes and
some of its known complications.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is expected to be made public by the Pentagon on
Wednesday, and it will doubtless lead to a new effort by veterans
groups and some lawmakers to secure additional disability payments
to veterans who have long complained of health problems they
attribute to Agent Orange exposure.
</P>
<P>
   It will also fuel the longstanding scientific debate over
whether Agent Orange is linked to a variety of other diseases,
including cancer. The Air Force study found that there was ``no
consistent evidence'' that the herbicide causes cancer, a finding
backed by other studies.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the executive summary of the report was made available
to The New York Times by a government official who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The executive summary does not provide the exact numbers of
veterans in the study who were diagnosed with diabetes, and it
cautioned against trying to extrapolate the findings to all 3
million veterans of the Vietnam War. According to the American
Diabetes Association, 15.7 million Americans, or about 6 percent of
the population, have diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results cannot be generalized to other groups, such as all
Vietnam veterans or Vietnamese civilians, who have been exposed in
different ways or to different levels of herbicide,'' Carlton said
in his letter. ``The Air Force cannot determine what effect
herbicides or dioxin have at levels other than those found in the
Ranch Hand group, or from other sources such as contaminated
food.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was welcomed by lawmakers who in the past have accused
the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs of
trying to ignore health problems linked to Agent Orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that Agent Orange has caused many more health
problems than the DOD and the VA have acknowledged in the past,''
said Rep. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent who has been
harshly critical of the Pentagon for its handling of the Agent
Orange issue.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that, to date, only 7,600 Vietnam veterans have been
awarded special compensation payments as a result of health
problems that may be linked to Agent Orange. ``That says to me that
there are hundreds of thousands of veterans who haven't a clue
about what they are entitled to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes is not among the nine diseases, including Hodgkin's
disease and respiratory cancers, that the Department of Veterans
Affairs has listed as being possibly linked to Agent Orange
exposure, based on research studies.
</P>
<P>
   The government also provides special benefits to the children of
Vietnam veterans who suffer from spina bifida, a congenital birth
defect of the spine that has been tentatively linked to the
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   In a program that began in 1962, about 19 million gallons of
Agent Orange, named for the orange-striped barrels in which it was
transported, and other herbicides were sprayed over South Vietnam
to destroy the camouflage the jungle provided Communist supply
routes and base camps. In 1969, studies linked the herbicide to
birth defects, and use of all defoliants was stopped by 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force study began in 1982, comparing the health records
of veterans involved in Operation Ranch Hand with the records of
Air Force personnel of roughly the same age, race and military
occupation whose jobs in the war had nothing to do with the aerial
spraying operation.
</P>
<P>
   Initial findings of the study released in 1992 suggested, but
did not confirm, a link between the herbicide and diabetes, a
disease in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin,
a hormone needed to convert sugar and other food into energy.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Corporate E-Training Getting More Entertaining  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Taking a cue from the movie and video game industries, a San
Francisco startup is attempting to rescript the corporate training
industry.
<P>
   Rather than host pricey management lectures, print
dull-but-important books or put the same tried and trite material
online, the Ninth House Network is using the Internet to create a
personalized, interactive and cinematic alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Through a combination of storytelling, Hollywood-style
role-playing adventures, instant advice and ``virtual mentors'' who
track each user's progress, the company is attempting to
revolutionize the teaching of leadership, communication and other
management skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overarching idea was to create a media network for
corporate learning,'' said Ninth House co-founder and CEO Jeff
Snipes. ``We wanted to make it as engaging as watching
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes and Ninth House Network are not the only ones expecting
big things from corporate e-training. A recent report from WR
Hambrecht &AMP; Co. suggests that corporate training is now a $66
billion industry and the Internet training component is ``poised to
explode.'' (The full report is available online at
www.wrhambrecht.com.)
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco investment bank expects corporate e-learning
to double in size each year from about $1.1 billion in revenue last
year to $11.4 billion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   To build up his firm's corporate-training business, Snipes has
recruited 150 employees from Disney, Electronic Arts, Pixar, Sega
and a host of other entertainment, &LR;   &LR; gaming and Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   The employees work on scripts, edit filmed episodes and sign up
big company clients at Ninth House Network's temporary headquarters
at San Francisco's Showplace Square West, where dot-coms are
replacing interior decorators as the main tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than create materials for top executives who already have
private coaches and are treated to lectures and management
retreats, Snipes is targeting ``the masses inside organizations who
also need critical business skills in the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its start three years ago, Ninth House Network has raised
nearly $50 million in venture capital from such blue-chip investors
as Chase Capital Partners, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The company has signed up such business gurus as Tom Peters and
Ken Blanchard. Their lessons on innovation and leadership are
delivered directly to employees' desktops along with filmed stories
that illustrate their main points and invite the viewer to make
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a video tale about a fish-and-bait shop asks the
viewer to click among several options to help an enthusiastic but
inexperienced employee who wants to establish a Web site for the
business accomplish the mission and become a self-reliant peak
performer.
</P>
<P>
   Another management problem, set in a mid-1800s California gold
mine, allows the viewer help a new manager choose the right
leadership style to help spur a talented but temperamental engineer
into finding more ore.
</P>
<P>
   Another enticing Ninth House Network product is eSeries, where
actors grapple with business problems at fictitious companies. In
one sitcom-style episode titled ``All Work, All Play,'' the learner
makes a series of decisions to help employees at WileyToys.com
overcome a variety of workplace obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Ninth House training is available on an annual subscription
basis of $500 per employee. The company has more than 30 large
customers so far, including First Union National Bank, the U.S.
Department of Justice, Hewlett-Packard and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of strength for Ninth House Network is its ``soft
skills'' training, which is growing far faster than information
technology instruction and will surpass it in three years. (See
chart.)
</P>
<P>
   W. R. Hambrecht senior analyst Trace Urdan calls soft skills
``the sweet spot'' of corporate training. ``And no one is doing
exactly the same thing as Ninth House,'' said Urdan. ``The company
is on the cutting edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Some early clients agree. ``This is totally interactive and
engaging,'' said Lela Rotondo, a consultant with Empire Blue Cross
and Blue Shield in New York. ``I've seen a lot of online training
products but instead of the usual `talking head,' Ninth House
offers Hollywood-style videos.'' Empire Blue Cross has licensed to
train as many as 650 of its 6,500 employees using Ninth House
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is far and away the best content I've seen, and the
delivery method lets people practice concepts,'' added Jennifer
Daake, employee development manager of Insight in Tempe, Ariz. The
direct marketer of computer products and service is using Ninth
House to teach management skills to about 200 of its 1,600
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Some competitors like SmartForce in Redwood City have much
larger libraries of information and deliver it online. But Ninth
House says it is more concerned about quality than quantity.
Currently, it has about 100 hours of programs.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes said the main difference between his company and some
rivals is its delivery of engaging, TV quality video. ``We believe
telling stories is what matters. You don't learn how to be a good
leader by reading bullet points off a page; you learn by
experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes, 33, didn't start out as a techie. He grew up in Tulsa,
Okla.,where his mother is a high school English teacher. He studied
philosophy at Southern Methodist University, before he put in a
stint as an investment banker for Dean Witter in New York and spent
two years teaching English to executives in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   While in Spain it dawned on Snipes that in a class, ``you can
only move as fast as the slowest person.'' But if you tailor
instruction to the way an individual learns best, whether it be by
word exercises, role-playing, TV or other techniques, learning can
be much more effective.
</P>
<P>
   On returning to the United States, Snipes was chief operating
officer at a San Francisco startup called Interactive Media
Solutions, where he and SMU classmate Tom Fischmann worked on
custom corporate multimedia training. When the company was acquired
in 1997, the two co-founded Ninth House Network.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was again to personalize information to meet individual
learning needs. But this time they set their sights on making
entire workforces more productive.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than resorting to a high-tech name, Snipes reached back
to his philosophy classes where he learned about Sumerian culture
about 5,000 years ago and its 12 houses of learning.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth house, he recalls, was devoted to mastering higher
learning and exploring personal limits.

   GORE AND CLINTON TOGETHER

<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton plan to appear
together April 15 at a fund-raiser in Beverly Hills for the
Democratic National Committee. The hosts of the event will be the
DreamWorks trio of Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey
Katzenberg. It will be held at Greystone manor, the fortress-like
Tudor mansion built in 1928 and still the largest home in Beverly
Hills. Gore has kept his distance from Clinton over the last few
months. Their first appearance together this year comes only after
Gore has secured the Democratic presidential nomination. They last
appeared at a fund-raiser together on Dec. 9 in Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE VOTERS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S THE REFORMER?
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll found that voters believe that Gore is more
interested in changing the system than is Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas. Forty-one percent of respondents said Gore was interested in
change and 23 percent said Bush was. Thirty-nine percent said Gore
wanted the status quo and 57 percent said Bush did. Forty-three
percent said Gore had made decisions based on campaign
contributions and 35 percent said Bush had. The survey found Bush
ahead of Gore, 49 percent to 42 percent. It was conducted last week
and had a margin of sampling error of three percentage points.  &QL;

   HINT OF FUTURE IN WISCONSIN?
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, who has remained quiet
about his future political plans, seems to have been upstaged by
his lieutenant governor, Scott McCallum, who is telling voters that
Thompson, a Republican, will not seek re-election in two years.
McCallum, a likely contender for the Republican nomination for
governor if his boss steps aside, earlier this month sent a
fund-raising letter to 30,000 Wisconsin voters saying that the
governor was in his final term. Thompson, who apparently was not
pleased with the letter, has told his staff that, from now on, he
wants to see McCallum's missives to voters before they are sent.
</P>
<P>
   NEW NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY
</P>
<P>
   Republican challengers were expected. But Jeanne Shaheen, the
Democratic governor of New Hampshire, will also be facing a rival
from her own party this campaign season. Mark Fernald, a state
senator, planned to announce the formation of his exploratory
committee Wednesday. . He is running, he said, because the state is
in a 27-month-old crisis over how to finance its schools, and
Shaheen has refused to consider an income tax as the best source of
money. Fernald is proposing an income tax that would be dedicated
solely to paying for public education, and said that polls showed
that residents of New Hampshire, for all their tax-hating habits,
were ready for the idea.

   THE REFORM PARTY  &QL;

<P>
   CHAIRMAN'S PLANS
</P>
<P>
   Pat Choate, the interim chairman of the Reform Party, said Gore
and Bush should make campaign finance reform a priority if they
intended to use the reformer tag. ``Stop taking soft money, stop
taking PAC money, or quit calling yourself a reformer,'' Choate
said at a news conference in Washington. A federal judge in
Virginia ruled Monday that Choate, an ally of Ross Perot and Pat
Buchanan, was the party's chairman, not Jack Gargan, an ally of
Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota. Gargan was ousted last month.
Choate said the party would move its headquarters to Washington and
begin raising $1 million, from individuals only.

DONOVAN INSPIRES FLORIDA WITH FIERY CLIPS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the big screen, Muhammad Ali and Gen. George Patton have
given the Florida basketball team a boost in its run through the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. Fiery words
gleaned from movie clips of Patton and Ali helped the Gators,
seeded a modest fifth in the East Regional, reach the Final Four
for just the second time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Going against top-seeded Duke in the regional semifinals,
Florida Coach Billy Donovan and his staff thought they needed a
whopper of a motivational tactic to keep their players unaffected
by Duke's reputation. ``Here we are a young team trying to break
through,'' Donovan said Tuesday in a national teleconference. ``We
needed something.''
</P>
<P>
   So they searched the movie archives and came up with just the
right inspirational words from the boxing legend and the war hero.
The clip of Ali showed him getting ready for a match against George
Foreman in Zaire in which he was not given much of a chance of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked about how he had to adjust during the fight,''
Donovan said. ``We basically took that fight and said: `OK, we're
in a 10-round battle with Duke and each round is four minutes. And
we've got to go round by round.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Patton clip, Donovan said: ``There was a battle going on.
He mentioned that this was the right moment in time and that an
opportunity like this wouldn't come around for another 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to take his lines and draw a parallel to what we're
doing,'' added the coach, whose team beat Duke, 87-78. ``I think
sometimes you can talk to guys in terms of motivating them, but
sometimes they need to see different things and hear different
things and tie everything in together.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Donovan believes more than ever in the wonders of
motivation, as the Gators prepare for a national semifinal game on
Saturday against North Carolina.

WOEFUL RANGERS FIRE SMITH AND MUCKLER
</HEADLINE>
 (mg 
By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying that the late-season collapse of the New York
Rangers had embarrassed the organization and its fans, Madison
Square Garden President Dave Checketts on Tuesday fired the club's
president and general manager, Neil Smith, and the coach, John
Muckler, with only four games remaining in what has become another
futile season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one makes a decision like this, the sooner the better,''
Checketts said. He said that he had decided it was time for a
change in the aftermath of Monday night's 6-0 drubbing at the hands
of the Detroit Red Wings at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The loss came two days after the same Red Wings team had
humiliated the Rangers, 8-2, in Detroit on national television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any reason to wait,'' Checketts said. ``I did not
want to have the players scatter at the end of the season and leave
unexplained what the issues are, why this group has performed the
way it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts acted as the Rangers awaited elimination from the
playoffs for the third-straight season, a remarkable decline for a
team that had ticker tape rain down on them when they broke a
54-year curse and won the Stanley Cup in 1994, under Smith's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Rangers seemed determined to reverse the
decline and spent lavishly on free agents like Theo Fleury and
Valery Kamensky. The team ended up with a $61 million payroll, the
highest in the league, but had little to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   When Checketts was asked Tuesday why the team had underachieved
so dramatically, he answered: ``I wish I knew and I'm going to find
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts, who is considered far better grounded in basketball
than in hockey, said he planned on Wednesday morning to address the
Rangers, who will close the season with John Tortorella, one of
Muckler's assistants, serving as the interim coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to spend a lot of time with the Rangers'
organization over the next two weeks,'' said Checketts, who since
taking over as the Garden president in 1994 has always had Smith as
his No. 1 hockey man. Now he must hire a person to supervise the
rebuilding of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   This also marked the second-straight season that Checketts
conducted a spring cleaning at the Garden. Last year, Checketts
fired Ernie Grunfeld as the Knicks' president and general manager
after it became apparent that Grunfeld and Coach Jeff Van Gundy
could not work together. The Knicks ultimately rebounded to make to
the National Basketball Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts said that unlike Grunfeld and Van Gundy, Muckler and
Smith were not bitter foes, even though there appeared to be
considerable tension between the two at various times this season.
And it was Smith's hope that after 11 years at the helm, and with a
Stanley Cup to his credit, his fate would not be twinned with that
of Muckler, whom Smith hired to replace Colin Campbell, on Feb. 19,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was, perhaps because Checketts and other
Garden officials had lost faith in Smith and in his contention that
the Rangers would soon prosper from a recently initiated youth
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Smith became the Rangers' general manager on July 17, 1989.
Under his direction, and with the on-ice guidance of Mark Messier,
the Rangers ended all the taunting they heard in other arenas by
finally winning the Stanley Cup in 1994. Under Smith, they also won
the President's Trophy twice, signifying the team with the best
regular-season record in the National Hockey League. But the team
never seemed to recover from the acrimonious departure of Messier
before the 1997-98 season. They have not made the playoffs since he
signed with Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler, meanwhile, has also had his share of successes. He was
an assistant coach on the Edmonton Oilers teams that won the
Stanley Cup in 1984-85, the co-coach of their cup-winning teams in
1987 and 1988 and Edmonton's head coach when they won the cup in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   As general manager of the Buffalo Sabres from 1993-95, Muckler
also helped build the foundation for a team that advanced to the
Stanley Cup finals last season.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Rangers had so little to show for high payroll,
the firings of both Smith and Muckler were not nearly as surprising
as the timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not work out,'' Checketts said during a conference call
yesterday afternoon. ``The bottom line is results here. I certainly
expect a better effort than what I've seen the last couple of
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   What Checketts and his Cablevision bosses, Charles and James
Dolan, have witnessed is a Rangers' team that has disintegrated
over the past two months. Since the All-Star Game break, the
Rangers (29-38-11-3) have a 6-15-4-0 record and are on the verge of
missing the postseason for the third consecutive season for the
first time since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have played poorly over the last 10 games. With
their playoff destiny in their own hands, the Rangers have all but
dropped out of contention with a 1-8-1-0 skid. The Rangers have
been outscored, 18-3, in their last three games and 27-10 during
the five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all expected better and deserve better,'' Checketts said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who might succeed Smith, Checketts, in a radio
interview broadcast over WFAN, ``I want the best guy I can get. I'm
not going to speculate on who that might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts did seem to indicate that Smith's assistant, Don
Maloney, would be considered. Checketts had nothing but praise for
the 41-year-old Maloney, a former standout with the Rangers as a
player. Maloney was also the general manager of the Islanders from
Aug. 17, 1992 to Dec. 2, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports that Edmonton Oilers President Glen
Sather, a friend of both Smith and Muckler, was preparing to take
over as the Rangers' president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible candidates include Devils President and General
Manager Lou Lamoriello, who will be available after the sale of the
Devils to the YankeeNets is complete, and perhaps the Rangers'
long-time television analyst, John Davidson. Davidson, 47, a former
Rangers' goaltender, has long maintained he has no interest in
leaving the broadcast booth for a front-office job. But more
recently, Davidson has indicated to friends that he has shifted his
stance, and that there was a chance that he would accept the job if
it were offered to him.

EXCERPTS FROM BUSH'S ADDRESS ABOUT EDUCATION AND LITERACY
</HEADLINE>
  (With BUSH-EDUC) 
(nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a speech Gov. George W. Bush
delivered Tuesday in Reston, Va., on a plan to improve literacy
among children, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Children know when we expect them to fail. They know when we
have written them off. But they also know when we believe that they
can learn. They love to rise to the occasion. And America must make
our expectations worthy of all children.
</P>
<P>
   The key to make sure that the dream touches every willing heart
is to have strong accountability systems. You see, high standards
without accountability is absolutely meaningless. We need to know _
we need to know if our children are learning, and if they are not.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a results-oriented person. And I'm going to insist upon
results, in exchange for flexibility. In exchange for freedom,
states must set up real accountability systems. School report cards
must be reported on the Internet. There needs to be full
disclosure. We need to praise success. We need to thank the
teachers who care and the schools that are succeeding. But we need
to challenge failure. You see, in order to make sure the American
dream shines brightly, no children should be trapped in a failed
school in America.
</P>
<P>
   As president, I'm committed to giving every child the best
possible start toward achieving the American Dream by teaching
every one of our children how to read. This is a concentrated,
systematic and comprehensive approach.
</P>
<P>
   This plan is different. It's different from my opponent's. It's
different from the administration's, and it's different from those
who say there is no federal role for education _ different from
both who would throw money into schools without reforming them,
from those who would argue against any federal money or
responsibility at all.
</P>
<P>
   I'll spend more on schools, but I will expect more from our
schools. I won't close down the Department of Education, but I will
transform it. You see, the goal here is not to spend the most or
cut the most, but the goal is to improve the most.''

GEPHARDT COURTS THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
   (hm) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the political loyalties of the high-technology
community still up for grabs, Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House
Democratic leader, intensified his courtship of the industry on
Tuesday by embracing pieces of its legislative wish list.
</P>
<P>
   But, in his first major policy address on high-technology
issues, Gephardt, of Missouri, glossed over the issue that industry
executives and lobbyists care most about this year and that could
most hurt Democrats: establishing permanent, normal trade relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Democrats oppose granting China normal trade
relations, despite President Clinton's strong backing, because of
labor union opposition to the agreement and the country's poor
human rights record. Gephardt and other Democratic leaders have
said they would vote against a China bill that did not address
concerns over the environment, workers' rights and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important vote of this decade is going to be China
because it clearly translates into investment, new markets, jobs,''
said Dave McCurdy, a former House Democrat who is the president of
the Electronic Industries Alliance, a major high-technology trade
group. ``The vote on China is going to be a dividing line. For
those who support China, the business community has an obligation
to recognize that vote and support the people who vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders, all of whom support the China deal,
are already trying to gain support among high-technology industry
executives by labeling Democrats as foes of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid he still doesn't get it,'' Rep. Dick Armey of
Texas, the House majority leader, said about Gephardt on Tuesday.
``In his speech today, he was silent on trade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all be watching to see just how tech-friendly this new
Dick Gephardt is,'' Armey said, adding that Gephardt voted with the
industry only 50 percent of the time last year, according to
figures compiled by the Information Technology Industry Council.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Democrats were working to draw up an alternative
China bill that a majority of the party in the House could support
without alienating Republicans. And he pointed out, after his
speech, that the China vote was problematic for both parties, since
several Republicans also oppose the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you've got to stop worrying about the politics and just try
to figure out the issue and do what you think is right,'' Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Gephardt tiptoed around trade in his speech Tuesday, he
put forward an ambitious agenda on a roster of other issues that
high-technology companies hold dear. And he portrayed himself not
as a traditional, old-style Democrat, a label many apply to him,
but as a lawmaker who understood the universal principles of the
technology revolution and could apply them if he were to become the
next speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   In this vein, Gephardt underscored his own decision to
co-sponsor a bill to expand the number of work visas for immigrants
with high-technology skills, legislation that the labor unions
oppose and that Gephardt voted against the last time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sheer hubris to claim that one party or the other in
America is the technology party,'' he told the group of assembled
Northern Virginia high-technology representatives. ``The government
is not the leader, nor should it be. But the government, by
pursuing wise, prudent politics, has the ability to help keep this
technology revolution on track.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader endorsed several initiatives, many of them
originally pushed by Republicans. He called for a three-year sales
tax moratorium on the Internet, until a final solution could be
agreed upon. The Internet industry would like to see no taxes on
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt also endorsed the elimination of certain taxes,
including the telecommunications excise tax and taxes on Internet
access and transmission. And he called for a permanent tax credit
on high-technology research and development.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, Gephardt, prodded by a group of
technology-friendly moderate Democrats who call themselves New
Democrats, has been working to solidify his relationship with
high-technology executives and embrace many of the issues important
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has said he would not lobby House Democrats to vote
against the China bill, which he has done on other trade bills. His
second in command, Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan, has taken on
that task.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is China,'' Rep. James P. Moran, D-Va., said,
``and I think Dick is taking the Democratic caucus in that
direction.''

 &HT;    Venus Williams' father suggest she retire
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ One is 19. The other is 18. Each is ranked
as one of the top 10 women's tennis players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if Venus and Serena Williams listen to their father and
coach, they will do something more stunning than making it from the
courts in the ghetto of Compton, Calif., to venues such as
Wimbledon and Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
   They will quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Venus should consider retiring from tennis,'' Richard
Williams said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams, 19 years old and ranked No. 3 on the WTA Tour,
has been bothered by tendinitis in both wrists and hasn't played in
a tournament since the Chase Championship in New York last
November. She withdrew from the Ericsson Open last week, two days
before she was scheduled to begin her title defense. And if she
heeds her father's advice, she won't be returning to the tour.
Ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just my recommendation,'' he said. ``She doesn't need
tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Williams has made outrageous
statements. It was just a year ago, as Venus and Serena were headed
to a showdown in the final of the event then known as the Lipton
Championships, that he talked about buying Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   Now this. Retirement.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he recommends retirement for Venus, Williams
said: ``Because she has enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   Since turning pro in 1994, Venus has won $4,582,577 and earned
millions more in endorsements. These days she and Serena are busy
planning and overseeing construction of a 6,500-square-foot home in
Ballen Isles, about 10 miles from where they now live in suburban
Palm Beach Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Venus will turn 20 on June 17. The question is whether she would
actually retire before then.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, she didn't like the idea,'' Richard Williams said.
``She didn't like it at all. But when she started thinking about
all the things she could do ... she's looking at it extremely
closely right now. There are a lot more things she can do than play
tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about Venus going to school full-time, expanding her
interest in fashion design and perhaps dabbling in the Internet. He
said she will make a decision by the middle of next month. And he
hinted at the possibility of Serena, who is 15 months younger than
Venus, walking away from the game when her contract with Puma
expires in three years.
</P>
<P>
   He said that their early retirements could serve as a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen too many black athletes come out of the ghetto and
earn all that money, and four or five years later they're broke and
no one cares who they once were,'' he said. ``Because of the
planning we've done with these two girls, they don't need tennis
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena has won $3,165,149 on the court, and her career seems to
be taking off. In 1999, she won six singles titles _ including the
U.S. Open _ en route to earning more than $2 million in prize
money. She entered the Ericsson ranked fourth on the WTA Tour's
2000 money list with $196,906, before losing to Jennifer Capriati
in a fourth-round match Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was available for comment Tuesday. But after her
elimination, Serena said she doubted that Venus was ready to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to see her back and competing soon,'' Serena said.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: CALIFORNIA GROUP ATTACKS GORE
</HEADLINE>
  (With FUNDRAISING-LOOPHOLE) 
(nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In yet another sign that the general election campaign is
already under way, a California group called Shape the Debate began
running commercials this week, entitled ``Hypocrisy,'' attacking
Vice President Al Gore. The group is headed by George Gorton, a
longtime Republican consultant with close ties to former Gov. Pete
Wilson of California. Two of the group's top officials have
contributed $1,000 each to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Shape the Debate.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The advertisement was filmed on a set designed to
look like the television quiz show ``Jeopardy.'' The category for
all the questions is ``political hypocrites.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: The game show host says, ``Welcome to `Hypocrisy.'
Contestants, are you ready?'' The first player chooses ``political
hypocrites'' for $200. The host reads the question, which also
appears on the screen: ``He says he supports campaign finance
reform, but held an illegal fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple.'' The
contestant replies, ``Who is Al Gore?'' Another contestant chooses
``political hypocrites'' for $400. The question: ``He promised
never to cut Medicare expenses, but cast the deciding vote to cut
Medicare by $55 billion.'' The correct answer: ``Who is Al Gore?''
The third question, for $600: ``He crusades against tobacco, but
grew and sold it from his very own farm.'' The answer, once again,
``Who is Al Gore?'' The narrator then concludes, ``Al Gore has a
lot to answer for. That's `Hypocrisy.' Bye-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: Gore's appearance at a fund-raising luncheon at a
Buddhist temple in California in the 1996 campaign is well known,
as is his recent enthusiasm for campaign finance reform. A
long-time Gore fund-raiser, Maria Hsia, was convicted of illegal
fund-raising in connection with Gore's temple visit and other
events. But Attorney General Janet Reno declined to pursue a
criminal investigation of Gore for his role in the event. Gore cast
the tie-breaking vote for the 1993 deficit-reduction package, which
included cuts in Medicare spending that were smaller than those
proposed by some Republican leaders. Gore has boasted in the past
about growing tobacco on his family's farm, but since his sister's
death from lung cancer in 1984, he has been an outspoken foe of
cigarette companies.
</P>
<P>
   SCORE CARD: Advertisements like these from groups not directly
affiliated with campaigns will be a staple of this year's
elections. Such groups have already spent or are committed to
spending $114 million on issue advertisements this year, according
to a study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University
of Pennsylvania. Federal law says independent groups cannot
advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, but advertisements
like this one demonstrate how blurred the line between issue
advocacy and candidate advocacy has become.

TORNADO TEARS THROUGH DOWNTOWN FORT WORTH, KILLING AT LEAST 2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tornado ripped through downtown Fort Worth just after 6:30
p.m. Tuesday, shattering windows in office buildings, overturning
cars and killing at least two people, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful twister caused numerous injuries and sent
pedestrians and motorists scrambling for safety.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado was one of several reported throughout North Texas
as a line of heavy thunderstorms turned the sky dark and brought an
ominous and destructive end to what had been a picture-perfect
spring day.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was accompanied by gale force winds, torrential rain
and hail, some reported to be the size of softballs.
</P>
<P>
   Many motorists who were headed downtown seemed to be unaware of
the approaching danger. Storm sirens had been sounding for several
minutes but it appears that some people ignored them or were slow
to seek cover.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank One building, a glass structure standing 35 stories,
was buffeted so hard by winds and debris that hundreds of windows
blew out. Glass shards tumbled to the street and shattered. Windows
were also blown out of the Renaissance Worthington Hotel four
blocks north.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported trees uprooted and fragments from roofs and
other debris swirling through the city streets in the aftermath of
the tornado. The storm continued tracking south and east, hitting
neighboring cities Arlington and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of scattered power outages and interruptions
in telephone service as many people tried to call into North Texas,
checking on friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a vortex,'' said Joe Garbe, who was on the 28th
floor of an office building in downtown Fort Worth and could see
the tornado weaving between buildings as it blew through.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Cardenas said he was in his apartment on the 16th floor
when he went to the window to look outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the suction of the wind blowing through the apartment
building,'' he said. ``I couldn't hear anything. It was silent. But
the cyclone was immediately there, immediately in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc McDonald was walking out of Angelo's Barbecue restaurant
west of downtown in White Settlement when he looked down the road
and saw the tornado approaching. He ran back into the restaurant
and alerted the patrons and staff. More than 70 people sought cover
in the meat locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laid down on the floor,'' McDonald said. ``Then a woman
said, `Can we start talking? I don't want to hear the stuff
outside.' That kind of lightened the atmosphere for a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said they remained in the meat locker for 20 minutes
before everyone gingerly walked out, some heading back to the bar
for their mugs of beer.
</P>
<P>
   When the rain and wind subsided, many people tried to leave the
city, negotiating past an obstacle course of debris. The flashing
lights and sirens of fire engines and police cars broke the erie
post-storm silence as they responded to the emergency. Police
sealed off the city center and would not allow people to enter.

COTA OFFERS A PERFECT FIT TO CAROLINA'S TRADITION
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ed Cota's game is straight out of Brooklyn, a refined version
now that fits firmly into North Carolina basketball's ``buddy
system.'' Cota began learning his game as a 9-year-old, walking
across the street from his front door on East New York Avenue to
watch older boys play at Hamilton-Metz Park. On some early
mornings, he would practice there alone, tuning his game. At 11, he
played in his first Brooklyn basketball league _ his team was
called Ice Tea _ and by the time he left for North Carolina, he was
ready to dish, shoot, score and shoot some more.
</P>
<P>
   Or so he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started a lot as a freshman at Carolina, and I thought I
could go out and play my game and score at least 14 points in every
game,'' Cota said. ``But Coach Smith pulled me aside halfway
through my freshman year and said that wasn't what he wanted from
me, that my role as point guard was to run the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, four years later, I completely understand that Carolina
plays basketball the way it should be played. Every guy on the
court here has a role. On every play we run, all five guys are
involved and there are two or three options on every play. If one
guy does not know his role or perform it, the whole system breaks
down. It's like a buddy system. I feel me, I feel everybody else on
the court. It seems like I've been in this system forever. The
coaches know what I see, and they know I know basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Smith, the former North Carolina coach, learned to trust
Cota.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Guthridge, the current coach, trusts Cota even more.
Guthridge has said that Cota ``sees things unfolding before other
people even know they're happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that this North Carolina club _ a team that took
the entire regular season to perfect its system and then the
postseason to make it flourish _ enters the Final Four refreshed
and renewed. Carolina (22-13) meets Florida (28-7) in a national
semifinal game on Saturday night in Indianapolis with the direction
of the offense, the play calls on defense and so much in between in
the hands of Ed Cota.
</P>
<P>
   Cota's Carolina career has been striking. This is his third
Final Four in four years. He has played with the brilliant,
including the current pros Vince Carter and Antawn Jamison, and
with the current freshman whiz, Joseph Forte. He has played under
the coaching legend Smith and the mild, knowledgeable Guthridge.
Cota has absorbed it all.
</P>
<P>
   Through the last four years, Cota, 23, has helped to continue
the splendid Carolina basketball tradition.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only player in National Collegiate Athletic
Association history to record more than 1,000 points, more than
1,000 assists and more than 500 rebounds. He is the only player in
Atlantic Coast Conference history to lead the conference in assists
in four consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But it looked as if his senior season would be tainted when,
with his teammate, Terrence Newby, he was charged with assault in
an Oct. 31 brawl near the Chapel Hill campus after a Halloween
celebration. That case, originally scheduled for court next Monday,
has been continued until later this spring. When the Tar Heels
limped into the NCAA tournament with an 18-13 record, they were
expected to be bounced early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out OK in the first three or four games this
season, but then we had some injuries and we lost some chemistry,''
Cota said. ``Some guys were not playing as much and were playing in
different roles. Others were worried about their stats. Guys were
not moving the ball around on offense and weren't getting good
shots. And then our defense suffered after that. Once guys get fed
up on offense, once they don't like the way that it's going or how
they look, you can forget about them playing defense. They aren't
going to guard anybody. And that's where we were sometimes during
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, once the tournament started, guys all of a sudden
accepted their roles. They were able to adjust. It was like they
said, `Hey, I might as well go out and do what I'm supposed to
do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Learn, understand and then accept the buddy system. Cota said he
did that as a freshman, and now with a different coach, with
different players, he does the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got used to not putting up big scoring numbers at Carolina,
but I know I could do that,'' he said. ``People think that a guy
who scores a lot is a great player, but that doesn't mean he is or
that he knows the game. I've hit a lot of big shots here. But I've
learned my role is to be the leader on the floor, not the scorer.''
</P>
<P>
   The scorer is Forte, the smooth shooting guard who made the
coaches and players take notice of his game. Cota sees plenty of
himself in Forte.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely matured as the season went along,'' Cota said.
``He is more relaxed and lets the game come to him. Sometimes
during the season, he would not do the other things _ box out,
rebound, stay with his man. He was in that high school mold. But
Joseph always had confidence. I think that's why we've clicked. He
came in with confidence, not just glad to be here. He wanted to
start, and he took other guys' spots. That is something I admire.
As a freshman, he carries a burden, but he carries it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Cota carries his well, too. All of the Carolina players respect
him, listen to him, watch him. The children back in Hamilton-Metz
Park do, too. They now call the Crown Heights place Eddie Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel like I made it, but I have other goals, starting
with winning this national championship,'' Cota said. &QL;

INFORMER IN MURDER CASE TESTIFIES HE SOLD GUNS TO MOTHER AND SON
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The FBI informer who turned in the mother and son
accused of murdering an Upper East Side woman testified Tuesday
that the two defendants had called him to New York to take over an
apartment building, evict the tenants and change the locks.
</P>
<P>
   The informer, Stanley Patterson, testified during the seventh
week in the trial of Sante and Kenneth Kimes, whom prosecutors have
charged with murdering Irene Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, a Las Vegas maintenance man, said that in the months
before Silverman was last seen, he sold the Kimeses four guns and
taught them how to make a silencer out of a potato. Then on July 1,
Patterson said, Sante Kimes called him and asked him to come to New
York. He arrived on July 5, the day prosecutors have said the
Kimeses murdered Silverman as part of a plot to steal her Upper
East Side mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to New York and manage this apartment building for me,''
Patterson testified Mrs. Kimes had told him. She promised, ``You
will make more money than you ever made in your life,'' he
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson testified that the Kimeses first met with him on Feb.
28, 1998, when they hired him to move them from Las Vegas to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said that he later sold them the four guns.
</P>
<P>
   During a later phone call, on July 1, Mrs. Kimes told Patterson
that she wanted him to manage an apartment building, whose current
owner was acting oddly, Patterson testified.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Patterson testified that he had asked Mrs.
Kimes what to do about the landlady, and she told him to just keep
an eye on Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's testimony is important to prosecutors because it
links the Kimeses to lethal weapons and backs up the prosecution's
contention that the Kimeses planned to take over Silverman's house.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman's body has never been found, forcing prosecutors to
try to build a circumstantial case. Prosecutors have called 67
witnesses during the last seven weeks, moving the case forward in
small, incremental steps.

AGASSI OVERCOMES RAFTER AND CONTROVERSIAL CALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ It was a defining moment, the eighth game
of the second set between Andre Agassi and Patrick Rafter in the
quarterfinals of the Ericsson Open. Agassi was up by a set,
clinging to a 4-3 advantage and trying to hold serve.
</P>
<P>
   The game reached deuce an amazing 10 times on this blustery day,
thanks in part to two disputed line calls that went against Agassi,
one in which the referee overruled a line judge. Then, Agassi
brought the score to deuce for the last time with a strong forehand
and seized the next two points, and the game, as Rafter was long on
consecutive backhand shots.
</P>
<P>
   That proved pivotal as Agassi went on to close out the match,
6-4, 6-4, and reach the semifinals against Tim Henman, a 6-1, 1-6,
7-6 (4) victor over Marcelo Rios.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his opportunity to get back in the match, and it was
my opportunity to kind of put the nail in the coffin,'' Agassi
said. ``It certainly made life a lot easier. We'd still be out
there battling right now, most likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Jennifer Capriati looked tired in a 6-3, 6-4 loss to
Sandrine Testud of France in the women's quarterfinals. Capriati
had little of the energy she showed in a three-set victory over
Serena Williams that shocked the tournament on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' Capriati said. ``When I got out there, I kind
of felt the fatigue. My mind was telling my body, `Come on, move.'
But that just wasn't happening as well as I'd like it to be, how it
was yesterday or in the previous matches I've played.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Capriati broke Testud to make it 3-3 in the second set
and appeared ready to make a match of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt myself maybe coming back there in the second,''
Capriati said, ``but I just couldn't get any breaks there.
Especially with line calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Testud will play the Lindsay Davenport-Nadejda Petrova winner in
the semifinals. Capriati, Testud said, was not the only one who
felt a little sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she was tired, but I was very tired, too,'' Testud
said. ``I didn't start very well, but when I came back, I saw that
I was just more patient than her today. She was trying for too
much. It was important to keep the ball in play, and that's what I
did better than her today.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what Agassi did against Rafter, improving his career
record against the Australian to 7-3. Yet Agassi, the top-seeded
player here, said he saw some of the vintage Rafter. Rafter won the
United States Open in 1997 and 1998, but he is playing just his
third tournament since he underwent rotator cuff surgery on his
right shoulder on Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the most important parts to Pat's game is his
movement,'' Agassi said. ``And to me, I was really pleasantly
surprised to see how well he moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, 27, who recently had been vaguely talking about retiring
from the tennis circuit, sounded like a rejuvenated man after the
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things have definitely changed,'' he said. ``I'm
enjoying the work. I'm enjoying doing the training again, seeing
the results happen. It's still going to be a gradual process for me
to get back into the tournament swing. I still can't train as hard
as I'd like to. But I think in a couple of months I'll be back to
full training and playing good tennis again.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who will represent the United States in a Davis Cup
match against the Czech Republic next weekend in Los Angeles, kept
harking back to that decisive eighth game in the second set. He
thought he played it well, except for a drop shot when he was
facing break point for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should just slap myself for hitting that shot,'' he said,
even knowing that it turned out favorably for him, with Rafter
hitting a wide forehand.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the self-flagellation, Agassi was grateful for a testing
match. ``It's nice to get that challenge and to move on through
it,'' he said, ``because it certainly gives you a lot of
confidence.''

OPEC AGREES TO OIL PRODUCTION INCREASE DESPITE IRANIAN OBJECTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Iran broke ranks with the rest of OPEC early
Wednesday, refusing to go along with an oil production increase it
says was forced on the cartel through political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But by reacting to an intense lobbying campaign from Washington,
Iran has helped create uncertainty in the oil market and may hand
the Clinton administration the thing it was seeking _ a moderate
drop in oil prices, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine members of the 11-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries agreed early Wednesday to reverse cutbacks a
year ago and raise their collective production ceiling by about
1.45 million barrels a day to 21.07 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton hailed the OPEC agreement,
predicting it not only would benefit U.S. consumers but would help
sustain economic growth worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, several weeks are likely to pass
before any price decreases reach the gas pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``While oil prices are projected to fall this year, we will
continue to closely monitor developments in world oil markets in
the coming months,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, refused to sign the
accord, insisting such a substantial production increase was not
warranted. During two days of haggling, Iran tried to persuade
Saudi Arabia to accept a smaller production increase, but OPEC's
largest producer refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   Making thinly veiled references to the United States and Saudi
Arabia, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh insisted OPEC
had been pushed into making a pre-ordained decision that Iran could
not accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our organization is not a political organization,'' Zangeneh
argued. ``OPEC is not an organization to rubber stamp the decisions
already made. ... OPEC needs the spirit of cooperation, which
unfortunately we did not have this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials had been irritated Monday, when U.S. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson's office placed a call to the Qatari
delegation in the middle of a sensitive negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
   Zangeneh refused to say Tuesday how much his country would boost
its own production. But OPEC Secretary Rilwanu Lukman indicated the
OPEC ministers expect these 10 OPEC producers to raise their
production ceiling by about 1.7 million barrels a day or 7 percent,
a figure anticipated prior to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, which remains answerable to the United Nations' Security
Council, has vowed to increase its production by 700,000 barrels a
day over the last few weeks. While few oil analysts take that claim
seriously, many expect Baghdad to eventually ship an additional
300,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC ministers plan to revisit the production issue again June
21, when they plan to meet again in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, while not a member of OPEC, has also vowed to boost its
oil production. Mexican Energy Minister Luis Tellez is expected to
announce Wednesday how much is country will produce.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Richardson hailed the OPEC move, calling it
``good news for American consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is for stable prices,'' Richardson said. ``We
don't want this volatility in the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also said OPEC's decision should eliminate any need
to dip into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the nation's emergency
oil stockpile, to help bring down prices.
</P>
<P>
   In talks with OPEC ministers, Richardson said he has pushed for
a worldwide increase of 2 million barrels a day, not the 2.8
million as some news media have reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've achieved a large part of our objective,'' Richardson
told reporters. ``I think our quiet diplomacy worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The production increases announced by the OPEC countries are not
really as large as the numbers would suggest. The 10 OPEC countries
are already cheating on their production ceilings by anywhere from
1.2 million to more than 1.5 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty and confusion caused by Iran's decision not to
join the agreement could force prices lower, at least temporarily,
a number of analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. consumer can be happy,'' said Raad Alkadiri, a
country analyst with the Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, oil futures for delivery in May closed at $27.09 on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 70 cents per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Iran's refusal to go along with a
general production increase could encourage other members within
the organization to flout their output ceilings, Alkadiri said. The
next few months will be a test of Saudi Arabia's ability to keep
quota cheating in check.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Clinton administration was leaning heavily on OPEC
in large part to appease angry U.S. motorists, oil analysts warned
gasoline prices could still continue to rise through the busy
summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   While the price of crude, typically, is the dominant factor
affecting pump prices, this year the gasoline markets is being
driven by several other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline inventories now are at their lowest levels for this
time of year ever, noted Michael Rothman, director of energy market
research for Merrill Lynch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Inventory statistics released Tuesday may push prices up in
trading Wednesday. The American Petroleum Institute released its
weekly inventory figures late in the day showing crude stockpiles
had declined 1.236 million barrels last week, more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   There was good news, however, for motorists as the trade group
reported gasoline stocks up 299,000 barrels at the end of last
week. Gasoline supplies were expected to drop as vacationers hit
the road for the Spring Break holiday.

RX FOR NATION'S TROUBLED TEACHER COLLEGES IS MEDICINE, NOT POISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone agrees we need better teachers, but there is little
consensus about how to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative advocates like Chester Finn, who was President
Ronald Reagan's assistant education secretary, think schools of
education actually reduce teacher quality. Able candidates, he
says, will shun teaching if they are forced to waste time and money
in methods courses.
</P>
<P>
   Finn argues that schools can improve only by hiring graduates
with degrees in academic subjects. He wants to abolish almost all
certification rules (he would keep criminal background checks). To
improve math and reading scores, he thinks schools should simply
hire teachers who are better at math and English. Summer programs
on classroom management, plus on-the-job training (and a threat of
dismissal if test scores stay low) should suffice to turn bright
college graduates into teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Linda Darling-Hammond of Stanford University
disagrees. Bright graduates may make good teachers, she says, but
not without extensive preparation, especially when we have growing
performance expectations of even the most difficult children to
educate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she suggests, academically proficient young adults who
become teachers without formal training may start with a
disadvantage. Because they never had difficulty learning
themselves, they often cannot figure out why their lessons do not
succeed for children who are less prepared.
</P>
<P>
   So, says r Darling-Hammond, if we want higher student
achievement, teachers need more course work in methods, not less.
Certification should require a master's degree in education after
an academic bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Research does show that teachers who themselves had high test
scores are better able to generate high student scores. But the
least likely explanation is that teachers who know more math and
literature are better able to tell what they know to 10-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible explanation is that bright teachers can more
effectively apply the tools they acquired in methods courses.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching is more than simply telling what you know. If children
are confused, teachers need to understand when to give an answer
and when to design exercises to help pupils discover it themselves.
Teachers need to distinguish students who rise to the challenge
when called upon from those who are intimidated. And teachers must
vary lessons for children of different abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing when to address a whole class, when to organize group
work or when to help individual students is not a skill you pick up
in math or literature classes. Schools are unlikely to improve if
future teachers do not study these strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives do not find these arguments persuasive. Finn cites
a new study showing that where teachers major in math, not
education, student math scores are higher. But the survey covered
12th graders only. Finn is probably right that college-bound
seniors need teachers with stronger academic skills. But he is
wrong about younger children. Even if seniors gain from having
mathematicians as instructors, fifth graders need teachers steeped
in child psychology and learning theory, not calculus.
</P>
<P>
   Contempt for teacher training has merit because some colleges of
education are of such poor quality. But there are also many good
ones. Because quality varies so much, some bright college graduates
without training would make better teachers than many graduates of
inferior education schools. Until the worst education schools
improve, good alternative routes to teaching that supplement an
academic B.A. with high quality teacher training should be opened
wider.
</P>
<P>
   But the most essential reform is to abolish inferior methods
courses and to raise standards for licensing teacher training
institutes. Then, too, teacher pay must rise enough to attract
high-ability college students to good training programs. But it
makes no sense to correct cases of shoddy teacher preparation by
throwing all pedagogical course work overboard.
</P>
<P>
   More can also be done to improve the skills of teachers already
on the job. One way to do this is to eliminate the common practice,
in both union and nonunion school districts, of giving teachers pay
increases for taking additional courses, with no control over
whether these courses contribute to pedagogical skill. Pay
increases for professional training that improves teacher
effectiveness should be one of the easiest reforms to carry out in
public education, but it is inexplicably rare.
</P>
<P>
   We would never think to abolish medical schools, thinking we
could improve the quality of care simply by threatening to fire
doctors whose patients die. Experts know a lot today about how
children learn. We may not understand as much about cognitive
development as we do about physiology, but someone who wants to be
a teacher should still have to study what the best practitioners
have to offer.  &QL;

 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Andre Hutson knows the numbers. He is not the first option in
Michigan State's offense. Point guard Mateen Cleaves ably fills
that role.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the lone No. 1 seed to survive in the NCAA Tournament makes
its second straight Final Four appearance, Hutson also is aware he
is not likely to be the second option, because more often than not,
Morris Peterson has gotten Cleaves' first look. And if not
Peterson, then forward A.J. Granger or shooting guard Charlie Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a special mismatch, Hutson, a 6-8, 245-pound
junior forward, again will be counted on for the performance he
gave in the Spartans' 75-64 Midwest Regional final win over Iowa
State. Hutson spent much of the game defending in the low post
against the Cyclones' Marcus Fizer, who was held to one field goal
for the final 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Hutson's task might be even more difficult. Eighth
seed and fellow Big Ten Conference member Wisconsin, the Spartans'
Saturday opponent in the national semifinals, milks the shot clock
more often than did Iowa State. Its offense is more
controlled-tempo, as the Spartans know from three meetings this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the style they play, and I know what they stand for,''
Peterson said of the Badgers. ``They stand for defense and
rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the latter stages of this season, that also pretty much
described Hutson's contributions. Unlike the Spartans' more
publicized starters, Hutson was on no Big Ten all-conference teams,
not even second, third or honorable mention. He simply took on a
number of the nation's better post players _ Texas' Chris Mihm,
Arizona's Loren Woods, Kentucky's Jamaal Magloire, Kansas' Eric
Chenowith, Ohio State's Ken Johnson, Syracuse's Etan Thomas _
before Hutson even got to Fizer. In each instance, Hutson held his
own or more.
</P>
<P>
   In the 30-7 Spartans' comeback wins over Iowa State, Syracuse
and Utah in their last three Tournament games, Hutson averaged 15.7
points and eight rebounds while shooting 72 percent (18-of-25). He
has taken 10 or more shots in just four games this season,
including a high of 11 twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Andre gets the ball, good things happen,'' Cleaves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre is a very unselfish guy,'' Bell said. ``But the last
couple of weeks, he has been demanding the ball. Everybody
appreciates that. Nobody is going to get mad because he wants the
ball. We're going to get it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hutson is a gunner. He got off just nine field-goal
attempts but produced 17 points and 11 rebounds in the Iowa State
game while helping to hold Fizer to 6-of-15 shooting, 15 points and
four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hutson was voted to the all-tournament team at the Midwest
Regional semifinals and finals last week in Auburn Hills, Mich. The
Spartans downed Syracuse with a 17-0 run and outscored Iowa State
23-5 down the stretch, a combined 40-5 closing blast.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Tom Izzo's five seasons as head coach, two constants
have been rebounding and defense. The Spartans lead the nation in
rebound margin (more than 12 per game) yet were outboarded 19-8 in
the first half and 38-27 overall by a shorter Iowa State. The only
other team to do that this year was Wisconsin, by a 29-26 margin in
the Spartans' 59-54 win at home. Michigan State won their other two
meetings this season by 61-44 at Wisconsin and 55-46 in the Big Ten
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Before the NCAA Tournament, Izzo said: ``Andre Hutson is a
15-point, nine-rebound guy. He's such a good kid. He's a very
intelligent kid. It's just in his demeanor that he doesn't want to
be selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   In high school at Trotwood, Ohio, a Dayton suburb, Hutson was
voted the state's Player of the Year as a senior, then started 26
games as a Spartans freshman when the team shared the first of
three straight Big Ten titles (the last two outright). Last season,
Hutson was a 34-game starter as the Spartans reached the Final Four
for the first time since the 1979 national championship season
before losing to Duke in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hutson is a three-year starter for a Spartans program that
has compiled an 85-20 record in that time, three Big Ten
championships, consecutive Big Ten tournament championships, and
another chance for the biggest college basketball prize.

<P>
   Capping an unlikely bidding war, the New York Power Authority
voted Tuesday to sell its two nuclear plants to a Mississippi
company for $967 million in what would be by far the largest sale
of nuclear reactors in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The winning bid by Entergy Nuclear, of Jackson, Miss., for the
Indian Point 3 plant in Buchanan, 35 miles north of New York City,
and the James A. FitzPatrick plant in Oswego County, broke ground
in myriad ways. It was the largest sale of a public asset in New
York State history. It was the first sale to private industry of a
publicly run nuclear plant in the country. And the $967 million
price tag was at least four times as much as any previous sale of a
nuclear plant, based on dollars per generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been the ultimate sign of the resuscitation of an
industry once thought to be too costly and unsafe to continue
operating that the sale on Tuesday occurred on the 21st anniversary
of the industry's darkest moment in the United States: the Three
Mile Island partial core meltdown in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy's offer topped an unsolicited, last-minute offer from
Dominion Resources of Richmond, Va., valued at $946 million. Both
offers are at levels far below what was invested to build the
plants. In that sense, the offers reflected the depths to which
nuclear power has fallen, as well as its improved safety record
since Three Mile Island and the improved prospects for keeping
aging nuclear plants in operation.
</P>
<P>
   That there were two major companies dueling for two plants with
spotty records illuminated how utility deregulation and rock-bottom
prices helped provide a market for plants that in the past might
not have found a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no market a year and a half ago,'' said Clarence D.
Rappleyea, the chairman and chief executive of the power authority,
at a signing ceremony after the trustees' meeting in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But like any enormous transaction involving real estate _ much
less one with thousands of employees _ this one is fraught with
potential pitfalls. So how the transfer of ownership, expected to
take six months, plays out may affect the structuring of deals for
plants like the two Millstone reactors for sale in Waterford,
Conn., and Consolidated Edison's Indian Point 2 plant in Buchanan,
next to Indian Point 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unique,'' Rappleyea said. ``This is not anything that
there's a road map to. I guess we're cutting new trail here.''
</P>
<P>
   For the power authority, the proposed sale, which is still
subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, would
free resources to pay the remaining debt of $316 million on Indian
Point 3, and to focus more on economic development and energy
efficiency, Rappleyea said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Rappleyea predicted, there will be a ``distinct
possibility'' that the sale will result in lower electric bills.
</P>
<P>
   The sale would put Entergy, a subsidiary of Entergy Corp. in New
Orleans, in a position to dominate the nuclear power industry in
New York State. The company is already bidding to operate two
upstate plants, the Nine Mile Point reactors, which are adjacent to
the Fitzpatrick plant in Scriba, on Lake Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, Entergy offered its bluntest statement about its
interest in the troubled Indian Point 2, which had a radiation leak
last month at its Hudson River site in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would very much like to buy that plant and put these two
plants with some synergies, pull them back together, and operate
them the way they were originally designed to operate, as a single
entity,'' said Jerry W. Yelverton, the chief executive of Entergy
Nuclear, referring to Indian Point 2 and 3. (Indian Point 1 closed
in 1974.)
</P>
<P>
   Some watchdogs of nuclear power, though, were ambivalent about
the sale. For months, many legislators, environmentalists and
professors criticized the bidding process as being less than
competitive and open, since Entergy was the preferred choice all
along. And on Tuesday, some said that while the $967 million figure
sounded impressive, it was almost $200 million more than Entergy's
original bid _ and stoked speculation as to what a thoroughly open
process might have produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would've been better off putting this on eBay in the
beginning, and letting the market drive the price,'' said
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who is
chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky also questioned why the five trustees of the power
authority, all Republicans, did not delay their decision another
month or so to consider the deal's financial ramifications. But
Rappleyea said that the longer the board waited, the less the
likelihood that it would be able to close the deal before a
scheduled refueling at the FitzPatrick plant this fall _ a possible
$30 million expense.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Entergy would pay $636 million for the plants,
$171 for nuclear fuel stockpiles, $92 million for eventual
decommissioning expenses and $68 million in return for the power
authority's commitment to buy more electricity in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy would also guarantee employment, and no contractual
changes, for the 1,700 people _ almost half of whom belong to
unions _ working at the two plants and the power authority's office
in White Plains.

INTEL WINS LATEST BATTLE IN WAR OF PC CHIPS
</HEADLINE>
   (hm) 
 By MATT RICHTEL  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Seeking to one-up its archrival, Advanced Micro
Devices, in the relentless creation of faster chips for low-cost
computers, the Intel Corp. on Wednesday introduced its latest
Celeron processor for personal computers priced under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new processor, which comes in 600- and 566-megahertz
versions, includes advances that should improve low-cost computers'
multimedia capabilities, said Keith Diefendorff, editor in chief of
The Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Diefendorff said the new chip should put pressure on Advanced
Micro to complete its own next-generation low-cost chip, which is
due out in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes life uncomfortable to A.M.D. at the low end,''
Diefendorff said. The cutthroat competition between the companies
has led to a ``pretty substantial boost in the performance of
sub-$1,000 PC's,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel and Advanced Micro remain in a pitched battle to provide
the processors, the primary computing chips in PC's.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, Intel is the clear leader, with about 86 percent of
the PC market in the third quarter of 1999, according to Dataquest.
Advanced Micro's share was 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro plans to answer the latest Celeron introduction
later this year with a chip code-named Spitfire. The company has
said the chip will be a derivative of its high-end Athlon processor
and is meant to be more powerful than the Celeron.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said little publicly, however, about the speed
or architecture of the processor, side-stepping the question of how
its performance will differ from the new Celeron.
</P>
<P>
   Intel created the new Celeron as a derivative of its own
higher-end processor, the Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   Diefendorff said the Celeron will have only half the on-chip
memory of the Pentium III. And it will have a slower bus speed,
which is the rate at which data moves between the processor and the
rest of the computer, including disk drive and memory.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff McCrea, director of marketing for Intel's Desktop Products
Group, said Intel was able to make faster chips less expensive by
improving manufacturing techniques and developing lower costs for
packaging the chips.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Grossberg, an Intel spokesman, said the timing of the
introduction had long been planned and had nothing to do with the
anticipated release of the Advanced Micro chip.
</P>
<P>
   Diefendorff concurred, adding: ``I wouldn't say either company
is in the reactive mode. They both know what the trend is, and they
know what they have to do to stay on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, he said, would continue to be good news for
consumers in the form of ``more performance at lower price.''

 &HT;    Deadly train-school bus collision at Georgia line worst in 25
years
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider and Dan Chapman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENNGA, Ga. _ Two children were dead and three others were
clinging to life after a freight train carrying Chevrolets collided
with a school bus transporting seven children _ the worst accident
of its kind in Georgia in more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-passenger bus from Murray County was early into its
morning run, carrying only seven children, when Rhonda Cloer, 34,
drove it down the slope of Liberty Church Road at 6:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer of the 33-car CSX train heading from Cincinnati to
Tampa told police he blew the train's whistle when approaching the
crossing. Seeing the bus continue across the tracks, he jammed the
locomotive into an emergency stop, said Trooper Ken Uselton of the
Tennesee Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Brown, whose home abuts the railroad, heard a ``boom'' that
sounded like dynamite exploding. One of the first to arrive on the
scene, Brown saw the train had dragged the bus more than 200 feet,
from Tennessee into Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The collision wrenched the bus' upper shell from its chassis and
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, said Brown, ``There were little kids lying everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He went over to one girl lying still on the ground. She was
dead. Other children were injured and crying. He knelt by one and
said, ``You'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   As ambulances arrived, Brown helped lift children onto
stretchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was going crazy,'' he said, standing by the ravaged
hulk of the bus. ``If you could help, you helped.'' Daniel Pack, 9,
of Tennga and 6-year-old Kayla Silvers of Cisco died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin J. Sherrill, 8, and Amber Pritchett, 9, both of Tennga,
were in critical condition Tuesday night. So, too, was Kayli Cloer,
5, whose mother, the bus driver, was listed in fair condition. The
Cloers live in Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany Gaddis, 8, and Jordan Manis, 6, both of Tennga, were
listed in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   All the injured were taken to Erlanger Medical Center in
Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Sluder, Daniel Pack's stepfather, said he heard about the
crash while listening to the radio at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was on the bus, but I didn't know if he was hurt,''
said Sluder. Later, he had to identify the body of the boy, who had
enjoyed horses and bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in shock, I guess,'' he said. ``You really don't know how
to feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Silvers first saw the boy, his neighbor, was dead at the
scene. He then saw his daughter Kayla inside the shattered shell of
the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled her out,'' Silvers said. His little girl was dead.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board said the bus had
crossed into Tennessee, made a loop and headed back to Georgia when
it was hit by the train.
</P>
<P>
   Trains are allowed to travel 60 mph at that spot; the engineer
was able to slow only to 50 before the collision.
</P>
<P>
   Trains are a part of life in this border community, rumbling
through at all hours, blowing their whistles. Some residents said
the crossing at Liberty Church Road, which has no signal lights or
mechanical crossing arms, was a tragedy waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Stinnett, 49, said motorists often can't see the train
coming because of tall, dense foliage along the tracks. It's too
early in the investigation to assign blame, authorities said late
Tuesday. They need to reconstruct the accident and interview the
engineer, the bus driver and others.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Cloer applied for her bus driver's license in July 1991.
The Murray County school system granted the license a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer became a full-time school bus driver a year ago. She was a
substitute driver during the previous two years. She holds a valid
commercial bus driver's license and carries all proper endorsements
to drive a school bus, said Jim Shuler, spokesman for the Georgia
Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer also took a train safety workshop within the last two
months. The Bus Driver Training Institute seminar taught drivers
how to approach railroad crossings, Shuler said.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer had had no accidents within the past two years, according
to records available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Department of Safety officials said it was ``way too
early'' to consider any possible charges against the bus driver. A
routine blood-alcohol test was performed on Cloer and the train's
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of unanswered questions right now,'' said Dana
Keeton, a Department of Safety spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday wasn't the first time for tragedy on the train tracks
near Tennga.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, 15 miles up the tracks, a CSX freight
slammed into a van carrying a Polk County, Tenn., family. The
parents and three young children were crushed. A witness described
the van as ``crushed into a box.''
</P>
<P>
   It is rare in Georgia for a child to be killed while riding a
school bus. Tuesday's fatalities were the first aboard a school bus
since December 1982, when a 6-year-old Hall County girl died after
a truck hit her bus.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's worst school bus accident happened in October 1974.
Seven children were killed and 61 injured when a Southern Railway
freight train backed into a Polk County bus. The caboose crushed
the bus beneath its steel wheels, dragging it 300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Polk bus driver, who was injured, told authorities he
thought the train wasn't moving or was moving too slow to matter.
The driver and train employees shared blame, according to federal
and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's paucity of school bus fatalities mirrors national
trends.
</P>
<P>
   From 1988 to 1998, 139 people aboard school buses _ 26 of them
drivers _ died in accidents, according to the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday in Tennga, small turns of fate saved several children
who usually ride the bus. Daniel Pack's brother, Kody, had stayed
home with a cold.
</P>
<P>
   And Missie Dalton, 25, said, ``Both of my children should have
been on that bus.'' Instead, her kids were taken by car to
Northwest Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors were brought in from two other school districts, and
they rode on the buses taking children home. Bus routes were
reconfigured to avoid traveling over train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could feel the sadness in the school. It was horrible,''
said Conda Lowery, 25, whose daughter is a student there.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Webb, a neighbor, was looking after Kayla Silver's little
sister, 3-year-old Taylor. Webb said the little girl told her,
``I'm glad my sister is with Jesus, but I wish she were here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittany Gaddis, torn and traumatized, was one of the survivors.
She had her seat belt on and was sitting in one of the first four
rows when the train hit the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she did not hear the train coming,'' said Brittany's
mother, Anita Beavers, who clung to her daughter's Winnie-the-Pooh
backpack in front of the Chattanooga hospital Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany was ``slung all over the bus,'' her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl unfastened her seat belt and called out to another
girl, she told her mother. The other girl didn't answer. Or move.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany had to grab on to the train to get out of the bus. She
told her mother she saw a boy lying on the ground. She talked to
the boy, shook him. But he didn't move, either.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany stumbled to a nearby store. A woman helped her,
consoled her and tended her wounds until rescue workers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany's mother saw her daughter briefly at the Murray County
hospital before she was flown to Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she found out I was there,'' Beavers said, ``she lifted
up her little hand and waved at me.''
</P>
<P>
   A candlelight vigil is planned for this evening on the
courthouse lawn in Chatsworth. Autopsies, being conducted in
Nashville, will delay funeral arrangements for a couple of days.

   (Phoenix) - Falling asleep while driving on a busy Phoenix
street last fall was a wake-up call for Ruth Phares.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the grace of God there were no cars around,'' said Phares,
52. ``The next thing I knew, I was in the next lane. And I don't
know how I got there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peoria woman isn't alone: Nearly one in five Americans has
dozed off while driving, according to the National Sleep
Foundation's 2000 Sleep in America Poll, released Tuesday. The poll
of 1,154 adults indicated that 51 percent of Ameri cans drive while
drowsy, a dangerous state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also said that al though we work longer hours,
our productivity actually is suffering. The poll reported that half
of all employed Americans say sleepiness affects their
productivity, and that 19 percent admit making occasional or
frequent mistakes at work.
</P>
<P>
   Younger Americans aren't immune. More than half (55 percent) of
adults 18 to 29 years old acknowledge that they stay up too late
watching TV or surfing the Internet; as a result, they report
``waking unrefreshed.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all this fatigue? People exercise too little, eat
and drink too much _ and too close to bedtime _ and largely ignore
ex perts' recommendations that they get at least eight hours of
sleep to function properly. &QL;

<P>
   (Phoenix) - It's nearly Census Day _ do you know where your
question naire is?
</P>
<P>
   If it's still sitting in a pile of unpaid bills, you're in the
majority. Just 45 percent of Arizona residents have returned their
forms, barely ahead of the national average of 44 percent, the
Census Bureau reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, Ohio and Pennsylva nia led with 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say it's too early to tell whether Arizona is on
track to avoid a costly undercount. The state is aiming for a
minimum return rate of 67 percent, 5 points higher than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Graham County has posted the best return rate, 49
per cent, followed by Maricopa County with 47 percent. Apache
County, with 27 percent, and La Paz County, with 22 percent,
bringing up the rear.
</P>
<P>
   El Mirage leads Phoenix area cities with 57 percent. In Phoenix
and Mesa, 44 percent of households have responded, while
fast-growing Gil bert and Peoria both have passed the halfway mark.
</P>
<P>
   Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said the agency is releasing the
mail-response rate to motivate peo ple. Although Saturday is Census
Day, the bureau will tabulate ques tionnaires through mid-April
before sending workers door-to-door.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors have charged two men suspected of
being members of the Russian mob with abducting and murdering a
professional boxer who had disappeared from a Brooklyn garage in
late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were identified as Alexander Nosov, 24, who is in
jail in Germany on an unrelated charge, and Natan Gozman, about the
same age, who is at large. In an indictment filed Monday by the
U.S. attorney in Manhattan, the two men were each charged with four
counts of kidnapping and murder. Each also faces a weapons charge.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Sergei Kobozev, was a former army captain who had
boxed for the Soviet national team before immigrating to the United
States in 1990. At 6 feet, 190 pounds, he was the U.S. Boxing
Association's cruiserweight champion. It was not quite a major
title in an often-overlooked division, between light heavyweight
and heavyweight, but he had a 22-1 record, including 17 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   When he disappeared on Nov. 8, 1995, he was only months away
from his biggest bout: a $100,000 shot at the World Boxing
Council's cruiserweight title. He was 31.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said Nosov and Gozman shot Kobozev in a Brooklyn
auto repair shop and then spirited him, still alive, to New Jersey.
After someone else broke his neck, the indictment said, the two men
and others buried the boxer in the back yard of a house in
Livingston, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, acting on a tip last March, dug up Kobozev's body. The
current occupants of the house, which used to be the home of a
high-ranking Russian mobster, had nothing to do with the crime,
said Joseph Valiquette, an FBI spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Kobozev's remains were identified in part through a custom-made
mouthpiece that he used when he boxed, which fit the dental
formation of the skeleton found in New Jersey, Valiquette said. The
FBI was still pursuing a DNA match through relatives in Russia, he
said, but there was no doubt that the body found in the back yard
was Kobozev's.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said he was shot on the day he disappeared during
a confrontation with the two men and others in the repair shop,
which was not identified. The investigation is proceeding into
others who might have been involved in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they would seek Nosov's extradition from
Germany, while Gozman is believed to be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The two could face the death penalty for the charge of murder in
the aid of racketeering, although Germany in the past has refused
to extradite prisoners here until the U.S. government agrees not to
pursue capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says that Nosov and Gozman were members of a
Russian mob group known as Tatarin's Brigade that operates in New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland, the indictment says.
Eight other members have already been indicted on numerous
racketeering charges for the group's involvement in murder,
kidnapping, robbery and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   Nosov and Gozman had sought a greater role in the mob group's
activities by kidnapping the boxer for ransom, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers assigned to his case and some friends have said
that shortly before his disappearance, the boxer may have scuffled
with a member of a Russian organized crime family at the Paradise
Bar, in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn. Kobozev worked
there as a bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the FBI nor prosecutors would confirm that incident
or speculate about what might have prompted the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Kobozev's fellow boxers expressed relief Tuesday that someone
had finally been charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good,'' said Peter Kahn, who used to help train Kobozev.
``He was a great fighter and a great kid and it was a big
tragedy.''

PUBLIC ADVOCATE TAKES ON MAYOR OVER RELEASE OF DORISMOND'S POLICE
RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By THOMAS J. LUECK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Using an obscure, nearly century-old section of the
New York City Charter, Public Advocate Mark Green obtained a court
order on Tuesday directing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to show why he
should not be held legally accountable for the release of the
sealed court records of Patrick M. Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   The City Charter authorizes a court to inquire into ``any
alleged violation or neglect of duty in relation to the property,
government or affairs of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a motion by Green, Judge Louise Gruner Gans of
the State Supreme Court in Manhattan issued a show-cause order
requesting that the mayor or his lawyers appear on April 13 to
determine whether confidentiality laws had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best short-term remedy we have found to overturn the
mayor's self-created precedent that he is above the law is to have
a court tell him that no mayor is above the law,'' said Green, an
adversary of Giuliani's and a candidate to succeed him in the 2002
election.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference two hours later, Giuliani said he was
unaware of the judge's order. And he continued to defend his
decision to release the juvenile record of Dorismond, who was shot
and killed by a police officer on March 16.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor insisted that ``privacy interests end in death,''
although he acknowledged that the law was ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute says nothing about prohibiting the release of
those records after a person is dead, but at the same time the
statute doesn't authorize the release after death,'' Giuliani said.
``The fact is that I made that judgment based on solid legal
advice. I'm happy to defend it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has said that Dorismond's record is an indication that
he was volatile, and that evidence surrounding his shooting
indicated that Dorismond had punched Officer Anthony Vasquez and
had a history of bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's critics, and Dorismond's family, have questioned
Giuliani's decision to release details of a minor's police record.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the New York Assembly,
last week ordered two Assembly committees to investigate whether
the mayor had violated state laws on confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he was hopeful that the little-known provision of the
City Charter would provide a speedier method of examining the
mayor's decision to release the records. In the motion to Judge
Gruner Gans, Green said he had asked the court to determine how the
police and City Hall had gained access to Dorismond's sealed
records, and the legality of the mayor's public disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani suggested that more information about Dorismond's
background would be released, saying ``there are a lot of factors
that will come out in the case that will indicate the picture is
much more complicated than the press has unfortunately painted
it.''

STRINGER: OVERRATED? NO, OVERJOYED
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The clock was nearly exhausted and C. Vivian
Stringer awaited the inevitable, standing with her arms folded at
the Rutgers bench. She was about to become the first coach, man or
woman, to take three different schools to the Final Four in college
basketball. As victory approached, she smacked her fist into her
palm, she smiled, she cried, she shook her head slightly in wonder,
and finally, she held her hands above her head like a referee
signaling a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The moment culminated five years of anguished conflict for her,
professional satisfaction mixed with personal melancholy. She had
gone to Rutgers in 1995, seeking to rebuild her career and her life
after the death of her husband, William, from a heart attack in
1992. She had a severely handicapped daughter who needed constant
care and a son who would later experience legal problems. She had
been accustomed to winning, but she lost more than she won that
first season at Rutgers and she was harshly criticized for being
overpaid and overrated.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night, a career that once seemed stripped and
withered was back in full bloom. Playing with a ferocious urgency
on defense and a ravenous insistence on rebounding, Rutgers
defeated top-seeded Georgia, 59-51, to win the West Regional and
advance to its first Final Four, where it will face six-time
champion Tennessee on Friday in Philadelphia. The victory ritual
called for Stringer to climb a ladder and snip a strand of the net,
which she ended up wearing around her neck like a triumphant
necklace.
</P>
<P>
   Her quiet sentences usually dart and soar like a kite, swooping
and diving and pulling up sharply, circling back on themselves in
barely tethered flight, but now she struggled to find the words.
Tears streaked at the corners of Stringer's eyes as she later sat
to talk with reporters. Tammy Sutton-Brown, the Rutgers center who
muscled Georgia inside for 14 points and six rebounds, put a
comforting hand on Stringer's arm, as if that might also steady her
coach's voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine the emotion of pride,'' Stringer said.
``It's overwhelming. We were the only ones who believed in
ourselves. I think we represent all the have-nots. This is a team
of survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   As she stood on the sideline in those final moments, Stringer
said later, she had 28 years, a career of thoughts, dancing in her
head. It had taken her 11 seasons to reach the Final Four in 1982
with Cheyney State University, the nation's first black college.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer recalled that her team routinely traveled in vans with
holes in the floorboard, the road visible underneath, and she
sometimes jokingly wondered whether the drivers might have to start
pedaling with their feet. Her coaching success in 1982 had come
amid wrenching personal sorrow as her young daughter Janine had
begun to suffer from the debilitating effects of spinal meningitis,
which has now confined her to a wheelchair at age 19.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken a decade of coaching at the University of Iowa to
return to the Final Four in 1993. At Iowa, she had financial and
personal security and her teams won 20 games for 10 consecutive
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Now she returns to the national semifinals, although her five
seasons at Rutgers have sometimes seemed like 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have to quit after this,'' the 50-year-old Stringer said
with a tired laugh. ``I know this much. I'm never going to go
anywhere and start a program again from scratch. It's been rough. I
just want to get some rest.''
</P>
<P>
   She had not intended to leave Iowa, but it became too much to
stay after the death of her husband, who was an exercise
physiolgist at the university. Too much to pass his empty office,
which was located near hers in the athletic department. ``I have
never made a big decision without Bill,'' she said in 1995. ``Never
bought a big piece of furniture, didn't know where the fuses
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of her sisters moved to Iowa to help her, but she found
herself becoming too dependent on them. She was listing, surviving
more than living, she said. So she looked to move back East, where
she could regain her personal ballast. Rutgers offered to pay
Stringer a reported $300,000 a year in salary and other benefits,
more than any other coach on campus, more than any other coach of a
women's basketball team. But Rutgers went only 13-15 during her
first season in 1995-96, then 11-17 in 1996-97. The jobs of
parenting and coaching tugged her hard in opposing directions. Her
daughter underwent two operations that first season, and for
several weeks Stringer found herself sleeping in a hospital room in
Philadelphia, then catching a train to Rutgers for morning
practices. Her two sons were going through an uneasy adjustment to
a new environment, and she grew tired and distracted. She was
harshly judged by fans and reporters, who focused on the bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is special,'' Stringer said, still at courtside as Monday
night became Tuesday morning, her voice almost a whisper. ``I was
thinking about all the kids who believed, about things we overcame.
We came here with nothing. I read things that hurt me personally.
Hurt me. But what's important is that we believed. Sometimes you
think you don't have it all. You hear things that hurt. That you
don't know what you're doing. I wasn't used to that. Maybe I was a
little thin-skinned, but I just know the team always believed.''
</P>
<P>
   She recruited players who trusted her reputation and who had an
eagerness to build something from nothing. Players like guard
Shawnetta Stewart, who had broken Wilt Chamberlain's scoring
records in the Philadelphia Public League and whose bulky
assertiveness had drawn comparisons to Charles Barkley. Stewart
scored 22 points against Georgia, as Rutgers trailed only twice in
40 minutes, then held the ladder as Stringer cut down the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been through a lot,'' Stewart said. ``Everyone doubted
her, but she refuted all the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   She had relied on her sisters to keep her buoyant, and her
former players, and she talked often with Temple's John Chaney, who
had coached the men's team at Cheyney State when she coached the
women.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, inexorably, Stringer revived Rutgers. The Scarlet
Knights reached the Round of 16 in 1998 and the last eight in 1999.
Still, her professional triumphs continued to be tempered by
personal distress. In January 1999, her oldest son, David, was
dismissed from the North Carolina State football team and suspended
from school for his alleged involvement in an altercation that left
another student dead from a gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to get something and not have a tragedy in
your life, so you have to be happy and sad at the same time,''
Stringer said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this season, sailing in calm personal waters, she has
become the third woman to reach 600 career victories, and she is
going to the Final Four for a third time. Stringer had no doubt
Rutgers would get there. When the team traveled to Philadelphia in
late February to play Villanova, she diverted the team bus to the
First Union Center, where the national semifinals and finals will
be played, and she had her team walk on the court for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it wouldn't seem strange when we came back,'' she said.

IN SENTENCING DRUG COURIER, JUDGE SCOLDS HASIDIC GROUP
</HEADLINE>
   (hm) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dozens of Hasidic Jews packed together shoulder to
shoulder in a Brooklyn courtroom Tuesday, seeking leniency for a
teen-ager who forsook his strict upbringing to help run a huge
smuggling ring that flooded New York with the designer drug
Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   But to their surprise, the 70 members of the Bobover sect found
themselves the subject of a scathing lecture by a federal judge who
upbraided them in a quavering voice for allowing an international
drug smuggling ring to flourish in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was the community when all of this was going on?'' the
judge, I. Leo Glasser, demanded of the crowd gathered in Federal
District Court in Brooklyn for the sentencing of the teen-ager,
Shimon Levita, 18. ``Where was the family when 18-year-old boys
were traveling from Paris to Amsterdam, Montreal, New York and
Atlanta?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were gone for long periods of time,'' Glasser continued.
``They were traveling around Europe. They applied for passports.
Where were the teachers? Who was keeping tabs on these boys who
were bringing drugs back and taking money there?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his stern words, Glasser sentenced Levita, who pleaded
guilty in December to drug trafficking, to only 30 months in a
government-run boot camp. He had faced a maximum of 15 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   According to Levita's supporters, who wrote 30 letters on his
behalf to the judge, he was an earnest youngster disillusioned by
the plain garb and religious strictures of his community who was
tempted into a life of crime at 17.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said Levita was a calculating criminal who
recruited his peers into a smuggling ring that moved hundreds of
thousands of dollars and more than a million pills of Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Levita became involved in the scheme in October 1998, when he
met an Israeli man named Sean Erez, 29, who had been recruiting
couriers for his illegal Ecstasy business from the Hasidic youth in
Brooklyn's Borough Park, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the government said, Levita recruited
several young Hasidic Jews to fly between New York and Europe
carrying Ecstasy, a synthetic drug popular in New York dance clubs
that causes euphoria and extreme alertness.
</P>
<P>
   Erez and his girlfriend, Diana Reicherter, 22, were the
masterminds of the smuggling scheme, the government said,
distributing the drugs in New York City as Levita oversaw the
couriers. Hasidim were chosen on purpose, the government said,
because their black hats and traditional side curls were unlikely
to raise the suspicions of customs officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, after several couriers were arrested, Levita fled to
a tiny town near Amsterdam, according to government papers.
</P>
<P>
   But in July, he was arrested after being named in a federal
indictment with Erez, Reicherter and four other men. All pleaded
guilty except Erez and Reicherter, who are in custody in the
Netherlands, fighting extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Before handing down the sentence, Glasser noted that he had
sentenced many of the couriers in the last six months. ``As young
yeshiva boy after young yeshiva boy stands before me accused of
smuggling drugs,'' he said, ``I think there should be some very
serious thought given to what is going on here.''

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ After two days of disputes, OPEC decided
Wednesday to increase oil production without the participation of
its second-largest producer, Iran. But the increase was not what
the United States had pressed for, and was not expected to bring
down gasoline prices any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare break in the solidarity of its ranks, the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that nine of its members
would raise production by a total of 1.45 million barrels a day,
despite bitter opposition from Iran to any increase. The higher
production would begin next month.
</P>
<P>
   With Iran, the total would have been about 1.7 million barrels,
but analysts said the actual increase would end up at the higher
level because other OPEC members were likely to seize the
opportunity to cheat on their quotas to fill the gap left by Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had pressed for increases of up to 2.5 million
barrels a day to reduce gasoline prices, which have soared to more
than $1.60 a gallon in most cities. Iran's irritation at the
American pressures was apparently a major reason behind its
opposition to any increase.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimated that it would take at least six to eight weeks
before any increase in oil production found its way to the gasoline
pumps, and with inventories already unusually low in the United
States as the summer driving season approaches, gasoline prices are
not expected to decline soon. In fact, some analysts predicted,
they would rise still more before easing by fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who expects to get back to gasoline at $1 or $1.20 a
gallon will be seriously disappointed,'' said Raad Alkadiri, an
analyst at Petroleum Finance Co., an industry research firm based
in Washington. ``Whatever happens, you're going to have a tight
gasoline market this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, however, was more optimistic and
said that several other oil-producing nations that do not belong to
OPEC would also increase output. ``I think our quiet diplomacy
worked,'' said Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, at a White
House briefing on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that when all sources of production were taken
into account, ``we will be well above our objective.'' He and other
officials pointed out that prices were already down, to about $27 a
barrel from a high of $34 a barrel, in anticipation of more
production.
</P>
<P>
   In New York trading on Tuesday, crude oil for May delivery fell
70 cents, to $27.09 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual break in OPEC's ranks came after two days of
wrangling between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the largest producer,
which pushed for an increase in production. In the end, OPEC
announced that nine of its 11 members would go ahead and increase
their quotas. The production of Iraq, which says it now produces
2.4 million barrels a day, has been separately governed by U.N.
resolutions since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Iraq said Tuesday
night that it planned to significantly increase its production by
the end of the year, but experts were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   The fissure with Iran has major implications for the United
States. Indeed, the battle within OPEC was as much political as
economic, and much of the debate was over whether the group would
be capitulating to pressure from the United States for lower oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   It was OPEC's decision to cut production last year, joined by
several non-OPEC nations like Mexico and Norway, that sent oil and
gasoline prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's split could damage OPEC's discipline and
credibility, just as the organization seemed to have regained some
of the power it had in the 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, accused the other
OPEC countries of trying to ram through decisions that were not
justified by economic conditions. ``OPEC is not an organization to
rubber-stamp the decisions already made,'' Zangeneh said in a short
but biting statement about 1 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to show our flexibility,'' he continued. ``OPEC needs
a spirit of compromise, which unfortunately we didn't trace at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   If OPEC's discipline does come unhinged, the United States could
be a major beneficiary and see its bill for imported oil drop. In
the past, when OPEC failed to agree on production limits, prices
have plummeted as production soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC had a commendable record in the past year, and now one of
its founding members is not taking part in their agreement,'' said
Gary N. Ross, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group, an oil industry
research firm based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's split comes after a bitter test of wills between
Iran and Saudi Arabia, which was determined to reverse the price
cuts of last year and to allow the price of oil to settle at about
$25 a barrel, compared with about $27.50 today and its recent high
of $34 in early March.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials wanted to raise prices, partly because the
United States is its biggest market and partly because of concern
about political wrath from Congress, where some lawmakers have
pushed for legislation to block aid and sales of military equipment
to OPEC nations.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian leaders, on the other hand, had angrily denounced
American demands and insisted that OPEC should not make decisions
in response to political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Oil experts, as well as Saudi leaders, argued here that Iran was
already producing virtually all the oil it could pump, about 3
million barrels a day, and that any increase in production would
come from other countries _ Saudi Arabia in particular _ leading to
lower prices that could hurt Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, with a daily output of 7.6 million barrels, has
enough spare capacity to flood world markets in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials, alarmed when prices suddenly surged recently to
around $30 a barrel, adamantly demanded an increase in OPEC output
that would prevent worldwide shortages and stabilize prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been lobbying OPEC leaders
intensively for the last several weeks, arguing that the world
markets needed as much as 2.5 million extra barrels a day to meet
demand and to restore depleted inventories.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear that OPEC would not go that far, but Saudi
Arabia had managed to persuade all other members except Iran to
reverse the cuts they had imposed on themselves last year. The
Saudi plan had called for an increase of 1.7 million OPEC barrels
of oil a day in production limits.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the agreement Wednesday morning, many OPEC leaders
were still fuming about what they viewed as heavy-handed pressure
from Washington that only made their own political situation more
awkward.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan leaders, taking a cue from their outspoken president,
Hugo Chavez, have been particularly sensitive about being portrayed
as puppets of the American government, and went out of their way
last week to criticize lobbying efforts by Richardson, the energy
secretary. Venezuela is one of the top suppliers of crude oil to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Iranian officials almost gleefully pounced on the
issue of American pressure when Richardson reportedly called the
oil minister of Qatar, another OPEC member, just as he was meeting
with his counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Though modest, the proposed increases are still significant.
Indeed, oil prices have already drifted down about 18 percent since
March 8, to about $28 a barrel from $34, and most of that decline
reflected the anticipation that OPEC would agree on an increase of
roughly that magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials have made it clear that they would like to see
the price of oil settle at around $25 a barrel, a price they
believe could be sustained and would allow the United States and
other major oil-consuming countries to rebuild their badly depleted
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   But the increase would also fall well short of what the Saudis
envisioned. Experts said it would provide only a modest relief in
gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Rilwanu Lukman, secretary general of OPEC, tried to put the best
possible face on Wednesday's split, noting that countries have on
occasion dissented from the organization's decisions before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will remain as a group despite all of these tensions,'' he
said after Iran announced that it would not join in the agreement.
``Many people wrote off OPEC many years ago, and we're still
here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANVILLE, N.J. _ Once again mooring a traditionally Democratic
issue to the agenda of his Republican presidential campaign, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas on Tuesday proposed a 5-year, $5 billion
program to address what he termed a national literacy crisis among
children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the program would provide grants to states to test
reading in kindergarten and first grade, to train teachers and to
make tutoring available. He soberly contrasted the nation's
economic success with its educational failings, and declared that
he would bring the same improvements in reading on the national
level that he said he had achieved in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He said every child should know how to read by third grade,
vowing that states that failed to increase student performance
would lose federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more fundamental than teaching our children
how to read,'' Bush said in a speech Tuesday afternoon in Reston,
Va., the first in a series of events this week intended to
spotlight his commitment to improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ``America must confront a national emergency,'' he said. ``Too
many of our children cannot read. In the highest poverty schools _
I want you to hear this statistic _ in the highest poverty schools
in America, 68 percent of fourth-graders could not read at a basic
level in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush said his plan would help roughly 900,000 children
with poor reading skills, at a cost of $1,000 per child per year
for tutoring and other assistance. Besides that $900 million, an
additional $100 million a year would go to testing and teacher
training.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan was quickly dismissed by aides to the apparent
Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore. They sought to shift
attention to Bush's tax cut proposal, saying that it would leave no
money for new education initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall, Bush has introduced a variety of education
proposals, but none of the others would entail spending anywhere
close to the $5 billion he spoke of Tuesday. That sum in turn is
dwarfed by the $115 billion that Gore would spend for new education
initiatives over 10 years, and the disparity in the size of the two
candidates' approaches highlights the challenge facing Bush:
convincing voters that he can lead the nation to new educational
excellence without spending huge new sums, which would clash with
his broader fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush introduced his plan as the Republican Party continued to
close ranks around him. Tuesday night, Steve Forbes, who had
attacked the governor as insufficiently conservative before
withdrawing from his own race for the Republican nomination,
endorsed the governor here at a meeting of the Somerset County
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the American people are learning, and will learn,'' Forbes
said at the meeting, in his home state, ``he is a good man. He has
been tested _ I tried to test him _ and he emerged the stronger for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief rival in the primary, Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
has resisted endorsing him, but Bush called McCain on Tuesday in an
apparent bid to salve some of the lingering wounds. Bush said he
hoped that the two would meet soon, and described the conversation
as amiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I both understand that the past is the past and it's
time to move forward,'' Bush told reporters aboard his campaign
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech offered striking evidence of how he is returning
to what was his original strategy _ positioning himself as a
soft-edged, centrist Republican _ after veering to the right in the
primary to fend off McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a coalition of Asian-American groups at the
headquarters of the Student Loan Marketing Association, the
federally sponsored provider of student loans, he proclaimed that
the federal government had to redouble its efforts to confront the
educational plight of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not tolerate illiteracy amongst the disadvantaged
students in the great country called America,'' he said. ``I know
this is something a little new. Others have proposed throwing money
at the problem. But they have proposed resources without reform.
That approach has no history of results, and really no prospect of
success. Under my plan new resources will be an instrument of
reform, not another investment in failure.''
</P>
<P>
   In an echo of language used by the Kerner Commission to describe
the country's racial chasm, Bush said: ``More and more we are
divided into two nations: one that reads and one that can't. And
therefore one that dreams and one that doesn't. Reading is the
basis for all learning, and it must be the foundations for all
other education reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush is not abandoning his belief that the federal
government should not meddle in what is rightly a state and local
issue. Tuesday evening, appearing at a fund-raiser in Parsippany
with Gov. Christie Whitman, he spiritedly declared, as he often did
during the primaries, that he did not want to be the ``federal
superintendent of schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are looking at the wrong man if you want me to be the
national principal,'' he said. ``I believe in local control of
schools. The best education policy is that which bubbles up from
the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush has shaped his education proposals as a whole
around the notion that the states should have more leeway in
spending federal dollars, as well as the idea that schools must be
held more accountable for their performance. He would encourage the
creation of charter schools and has also proposed a voucher program
for students of poorly performing public schools. He has urged,
too, that Head Start, the early-childhood development program, be
primarily a literacy program.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech in Virginia, Bush's tone was largely conciliatory;
he barely mentioned Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign showed no such reticence. Douglas
Hattaway, a campaign spokesman, said that the governor's plan would
be ineffective and that given his tax cut, ``he won't have the
money to pay for a new initiative like this without dipping into
the Social Security surplus or going back to deficit spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway added: ``He has to make a choice and he hasn't said how
he is going to pay.''

FRENCH SKATER SLASHED IN HOTEL ROOM
</HEADLINE>
 (mg) 
By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France _ It was another stranger-than-fiction day in
figure skating, a sport that seems as drawn to the melodramatic as
Aleksei Yagudin does to the medal stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skating never ceases to amaze me on or off the ice,'' said
Elvis Stojko, Canada's three-time world champion, after the men's
short program on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Off the ice on the second day of these world championships, the
French pairs skater Stephane Bernadis was slashed on the arm in his
hotel room, a short walk from the arena where this event is being
staged.
</P>
<P>
   According to French kating officials, Bernadis said he heard a
knock on his door at about 3:30 p.m. and opened it, thinking it was
his partner, Sarah Abitbol.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bernadis told the officials that he found a man with a
razor. Although he said he shut the door quickly, Bernadis said the
assailant managed to leave him with a cut that required ``three to
four stitches'' said Didier Gailhaguet, the president of the French
Ice Sports Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadis later practiced briefly with Abitbol while wearing a
bandage. The French pair, who have never won a medal in the world
championships, are in fourth place heading into Wednesday night's
decisive free program and although Gailhaguet at first indicated
that the injury would not affect their participation, they are
expected to make a final decision after practicing again on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailhaguet said he had been given no indication that the
incident was linked to any effort to force the couple out of the
competition.A complaint was filed with the police, but no one has
been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephane is O.K.,'' Gailhaguet said. ``He was shocked. The
injury is not serious, but he was certainly psychologically
shaken.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident came two days after the reigning pairs champions
Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze withdrew because
Berezhnaya had tested positive for a banned substance.
</P>
<P>
   The French skaters had been assigned body guards for the
duration of the competition: a move taken in the wake of telephone
threats received by the French ice dancer Gwendal Peizerat in
France before the 1998 world championships in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   But Gailhaguet said that Bernadis had actually asked for
security to be less strict because ``he felt safe and there were no
problems.'' Gailhaguet also said the guard assigned to the pair was
not at the hotel at the time of the incident because he had left to
provide security for Abitbol during a shopping trip.
</P>
<P>
   Security at all the hotels where skaters are staying was
immediately tightened. ``They have guards now on every floor and in
every elevator,'' the American singles skater Tim Goebel said. ``I
don't feel unsafe at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Goebel, who finished second at the United States championships
to Michael Weiss, did reveal that he is not healthy. He offered no
explanation after performing poorly in the qualifying round on
Monday, but on Tuesday, after finishing seventh in the short
program, he said he had recently strained a muscle in his lower
left leg and had been receiving treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was just an off day, and I didn't want it to sound
like I was making excuses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no need for Yagudin to make any. The two-time
defending world champion was brilliant again, skating last and best
to a jazzy version of the ``Nutcracker Suite'' and landing his
quadruple toe loop and triple axel-triple toe combination with
relative ease. He received nothing lower than 5.7 for technical
merit and nothing but 5.9's for presentation and is the leader
heading into Thursday night's free program, which counts for 50
percent over all. In second is his Russian teammate and the
reigning European champion Yevgeny Plushenko. &QL;

<P>
   BAYONNE, N.J. _ A half-century after the region's last streetcar
disappeared to make way for more cars and buses, New Jersey
officials are set to open the first leg of a $1.1 billion trolley
system along the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   It will carry 25,000 riders a day, and the entire project, when
completed in 2010, is expected to carry more than 100,000 people
through the most densely populated region in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, which will carry its first
fare-paying passenger on April 15, is the metropolitan region's
most ambitious public transportation project since the 1960s, the
largest public works program in New Jersey history and an
intriguing look at the prospects for a transit system long deemed a
part of the past. Officials say they hope the system will one day
extend across New Jersey, linking light rail systems that are on
the drawing board in other parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those infrastructure investments you make at
the beginning of a century that serves you throughout the
century,'' said James Weinstein, New Jersey state transportation
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Whether enough commuters can be coaxed out of their cars to make
the system a success remains to be seen. But officials say they
believe the 20.5-mile system, when completed, will not only
persuade commuters to leave their cars at home, relieving clogged
roads and easing polluted air, but will spur redevelopment in
places that have thus far missed out on the region's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years in the making, the line will initially feed into the
ferries and PATH trains that carry thousands of commuters to
Manhattan as well as those who work along New Jersey's Hudson River
waterfront. Once a wasteland of abandoned rail yards and rotting
piers, the so-called Gold Coast in Hudson County has been
transformed into a city of office towers and luxury apartments. An
additional five million square feet of commercial space and
thousands of apartments are planned in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, there has been no easy way to move north and
south through the county, something that frustrates many of the
31,000 people who work along the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without this rail line, we'll drown in our success,'' said
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on
the Senate's Transportation Appropriation subcommittee who helped
secure more than half the project's financing.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM) Before the car became king in the years after
World War II, this heavily urbanized wedge of New Jersey was
crisscrossed by trolley lines, nearly all of them ending at the
waterfront, where riders could hop a train or ferry to Manhattan.
``We've clearly come full circle,'' said Martin Robins, director of
the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The concept of light rail was born in the 1970s, when engineers
began marrying new technology with the traditional streetcar. The
cars, which run on low-voltage electric lines, can quickly
accelerate to 55 miles per hour, effortlessly climb hills and brake
faster than a bus. Because they are entered without a step up, the
trains can more easily be boarded by the elderly, the disabled and
those pushing baby strollers.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, light rail advocates say, the lines are far less
expensive to build than subways, ``which makes them very attractive
to both taxpayers and politicians,'' said David Phelps, a light
rail specialist at the American Public Transportation Association
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by increasing traffic congestion and decreasing air
quality, two dozen U.S. cities now have light rail systems,
including such car-dependent stalwarts as Dallas, Los Angeles and
Denver. ``The verdict so far has been almost unanimously
favorable,'' Phelps said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Alan E. Pisarski, a transportation specialist and the author of
the book, ``Commuting in America,'' said cities like Buffalo and
Baltimore have found that their initial ridership estimates were
wildly overstated. As in many parts of the country, more and more
New Jersey residents are commuting from suburb to suburb, not from
suburb to city. Such commuters, he said, cannot be served by light
rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think light rail is a slam-dunk solution to the
problem of congestion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some developers are betting on the project. On Jersey
City's Martin Luther King Boulevard, one of the area's most
neglected neighborhoods, a shopping center recently opened next to
a light rail station. A dozen blocks away, not far from a vast
expanse of metal scrap yards and vacant warehouses, the sleek
black-and-white cars glide past wooden skeletons for dozens of
luxury townhouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The light rail will open up sites for development that until
now have been virtually inaccessible,'' said New Jersey Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials plan to run the trains every seven and a half
minutes at rush hour and every 15 minutes at other times. Jeffrey
A. Warsh, the executive director of New Jersey Transit, said the
$1.50 one-way fare comes down to 60 cents if passengers use a
monthly pass, which will cost $53 and will allow free transfers to
local buses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 12 stations opening next month, four more
stops along the Jersey City and Hoboken waterfronts will open by
2002, linking the system to New Jersey Transit's commuter rail
terminus and the half-dozen Manhattan-bound ferries. In 2010, when
the line is scheduled to reach the Vince Lombardi Park and Ride
station in suburban Ridgefield, transit officials said, it will
carry more passengers than all of New Jersey Transit's rail lines
combined.

CELEBRATING A PRAGUE SPRING AT LINCOLN CENTER
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lincoln Center is paying tribute to the Czech
Republic on the 10th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution by
presenting what it is calling the Prague Festival, the heart of
which is a three-concert visit to Avery Fisher Hall by the Czech
Philharmonic and Vladimir Ashkenazy, its chief conductor since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider who knows the orchestra from several decades'
worth of splendid recordings and a few visits to New York, the
Czech Philharmonic has long seemed like a jewel in Prague's
cultural life. But it has had a rough decade, marked by unhappy
relationships with the two music directors who preceded Ashkenazy
and dwindling state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But at the first Prague Festival concert, on Sunday afternoon,
there was no musical evidence that the orchestra was under stress,
nor did there seem to be any diminution of its distinctive timbral
character. Its wind and brass still play with a coloration that
registers as earthier and more textured than that of most European
and American orchestras. And its strings have a bright tone that
often conveys more energy than warmth, although warmth is hardly
precluded.
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazy's three concerts have a theme of sorts: All the
composers _ Krasa and Mahler on Sunday afternoon, with Mozart,
Janacek and Dvorak on Monday and Martinu and Tchaikovsky joining
the list Tuesday night _ had either personal or professional ties
to Prague. Some of those ties were strong and some were tenuous,
and as Michael Beckerman points out in an essay in the program
book, the links between Czech composers and Prague were not always
the happiest. Janacek, for example, was largely rejected by the
Prague musical establishment until late in life. Martinu was also
uneasy in Prague and left it for Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Krasa, whose youthful symphony (1926) opened the series, had
considerable success in Prague, where he was born in 1899. He might
have become one of the city's musical patriarchs had he not been
sent to Theresienstadt and from there to Auschwitz, where he died
in 1944. His symphony is a strange piece, dark-hued at first but
gradually brightening, and full of interesting musical imagery
meant to mirror the text of ``Die Lausesucherinnen'' (``The Lice
Pickers''). Krasa set this Rimbaud text, in a German translation,
as the work's finale. Charlotte Hellikant, mezzo-soprano, gave a
ravishing account of the setting.
</P>
<P>
   But the most interesting aspect of the work is the degree to
which it draws on two unrelated schools of compositional thought in
the air at the time. A hint of Parisian Impressionism is evident in
the shifting, gentle textures that give the work a sense of
mystery. And there are hints of the German cabaret style that
caught the attention of Kurt Weill in some of the parodistic march
figures in the second movement.
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazy devoted the second half of the concert to Mahler's
Symphony No. 7, which was given its world premiere in Prague in
1908. Mahler was trying to be cheerful in the Seventh, and that
made for outer movements that can sound banal and uncohesive unless
a performance sweeps a listener into it. Ashkenazy did not quite
achieve that, but he did test his orchestra's mettle: There was
some spectacular brass playing, and the ``Nachtmusik'' movements
had a graceful, alluring flow and an appealing sense of intimacy.

STORM TURNS HIKE INTO
 STRUG GLE FOR SURVIVAL
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - A treacherous hike and a freak storm have given
Kelly Vickrey of Chandler a new definition of adventure: ``When
you'd rather be home talking about it than doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vickrey and seven other hikers, including three Phoenix area
resi dents, are lucky to have survived a hike to Rainbow Bridge
last week that started as a lark but turned perilous when the storm
blew in. Before it was over, one of them was thinking, ``This is
how people die.''
</P>
<P>
   Their adventure was part Jack Lon don and part ``Into Thin
Air,'' the ill-fated tale of climbers on Mount Everest. Reunited
for lunch at Nel lo's restaurant in Tempe on Sunday, the eight
hikers said next time they'll be better prepared. Even under the
best of circumstances, the path to Rainbow Bridge is demanding.
With unanticipated bad weather, it can be a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives were saved thanks to a big dog, high-tech equipment
and the compassion hikers show strangers they meet along the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, March 17 was a spectacular day to view Rainbow Bridge on
the Navajo Reservation near the Arizo na-Utah border. The sky was
clear, the air was warm. Vistas of rugged canyons, landscape
brightened by junipers, sandstone and slick rock were breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Vickrey's group, including a friend from Milwaukee, were looking
for ward to a three-day hike. Four friends from Flagstaff and
Cotton wood began a similar excursion two days later.
</P>
<P>
   A battle against the elements would bring them together.
</P>
<P>
   As Vickrey and Jean Baker set up camp Friday night, they were
joined by a hospitable Rottweiler, a reserva tion dog partial to
hikers. They named him Shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Shadow followed them along the trail Saturday as they met up
with their Phoenix and Milwaukee friends. The pooch was friendly
not only to the humans but also to Phoenix resident Jane Simeth's
17-pound terrier mix, Beechnut.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Shadow's barking broke the stillness. Baker
discovered moun tain lion tracks and scat the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Along the 13.5-mile trail to Rainbow Bridge, the party met two
hikers, Kelly Williams and Jeri Ree of Flagstaff, and exchanged
brief pleas antries. They also met Bob Read, a solitary California
hiker who men tioned he had encountered a hiker with a sprained
ankle holed up in a camp several miles back.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell Sunday, the wind began to pick up. Vickrey's group
awoke to the sound of rain and the roar of a now-swollen creek and
a previously dry wash. At dawn, they heard snow falling.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures turned frigid. With bad weather threatening, the
group decided to skip breakfast, pack quickly and head back to the
trail head. Vickrey had forgotten her gloves and slipped woolen
socks over her hands.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix hiker Diane Hicks tucked Beechnut into her backpack,
fearful the tiny dog would be lost in the deepening snow.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, they came to the tent where Sarah Newberry, a
young mother from Cottonwood, was nurs ing an ankle sprain after
stepping on a rock as she and companion Glen Wesselmann hiked in.
They said they were waiting for the weather to clear before they
tried to hike out and catch a boat on Lake Powell back to Page.
</P>
<P>
   They asked that a message be relayed to their baby-sitter in
Cottonwood.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more than seven hours before Vickrey's group could
comply. Slowly plodding through snow that had obscured trail
markers, they kept each other in sight, navigating by the few
markers they could see and forging ahead when they longed to rest
and eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to keep moving,'' Vickrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Shadow never left their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us comfort knowing he was there,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the trip that had started so pleasantly for Williams
and Ree had also turned nasty. They, too, woke Monday morning to
heavily falling snow. Wearing trash bags on their feet to keep
their boots dry, they had split from their friends, Newberry and
Wesselmann, and tried to make it to Rainbow Bridge. At Redbird
Pass, they found them selves walking through water and were soon
soaked head to toe.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to Newberry's camp, where rest had soothed her
aching foot. The four decided to wait out the storm, which
forecasters had woefully underestimated as a light snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were optimistic,'' Ree said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the wind blew in. At 11 p.m., poles in the tent Williams
and Ree were sleeping under cracked, and the tent collapsed. They
scambled out and huddled with Newberry and Wesselmann, hoping their
small tent wouldn't likewise collapse.
</P>
<P>
   In their haste, they left articles of clothing outdoors,
including Wil liams's gloves. By dawn, the clothes were frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Through a seemingly endless night, the four lay awake and
listened to the wind howl. No one spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was so intense. We were so scared,'' Williams said.
``We were all waiting for the poles to snap. You can't imagine the
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Without shelter, the four would have faced exposure. But the
flimsy little tent held.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning was still cold and blowing with snow, but the
sky had cleared some. The four decided to hike out.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Ree put on all the clothes they had, though
everything was still wet. Newberry set off, gingerly, but made it
less than a mile before her ankle gave out. It was clear she and
Wesselmann would need a helicopter rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The two Flagstaff women pushed on, practically crawling through
waist-deep snow _ cold, dehydrated and a little disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   Williams thought, ``This is how people die.''
</P>
<P>
   At noon, they turned back to camp, where they met Read. He
promised to reach the trail head and summon help. Wesselmann gave
him the keys to his truck.
</P>
<P>
   Four hungry and exhausted hikers shared what scant food they had
left _ some Clif Bars, dried beef and water _ and tried to keep up
their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't let ourselves panic,'' Wesselmann said. ``We just
kept each other laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before sunset, they heard a beautiful noise: Rotors.
Williams and Ree ran out into the snow, barefoot, and saw a
helicopter circling. Pitched in a protected site, their tent was
difficult to spot from the air.
</P>
<P>
   The chopper flew away.
</P>
<P>
   What the four didn't know was that Vickrey had been on the phone
from her home in Chandler all day facilitating their evacuation
with au thorities from two states, two coun ties, Navajo officials,
the National Park Service, a Page search and rescue group, an
emergency medical technician from Kayenta and Newberry's
baby-sitter in Cotton wood.
</P>
<P>
   All worked together to locate and airlift the hikers.
</P>
<P>
   Baker had been able to supply coordinates from her GPS, or
Global Positioning System, for the approxi mate location of the
downed hikers' camp. When Read narrowed the location, the
helicopter returned.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Wesselmann wants to share his favorite part of
the harrow ing story. Last Christmas, his 6-year-old godson gave
him a bright orange vest, telling his dad that some day it might
help Wesselmann if he ever got stuck in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Wesselmann used that vest to flag down the chopper.
</P>
<P>
   With a flight nurse on board, the helicopter took Williams and
Ree back to the trail head while Newberry bundled up. She and
Wesselmann were flown to the Page hospital. X-rays showed no breaks
to her ankle.
</P>
<P>
   That night, the couple bunked at Canyon Colors bed and breakfast
in Page, with their wallets and credit cards still with Read in
Wessel mann's truck. Reunited the next morning with Read, the truck
and their money, they tried to pay for a night's lodging. Canyon
Colors pro prietors Rich and Bev Jones would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   The kind-hearted Joneses have an arrangement with the Page
hospital to take in stranded visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have a room available, we're happy to do whatever we can
for folks,'' Bev Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being discouraged by their perilous adventure, they all
insisted they're ready to take off again. Hicks is on a hike this
week.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams plans to stay away from Rainbow Bridge, no matter
how seductive its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Only half joking, she said, ``Jeri and I are going to stick to
day hikes for a while.''

TROJANS COUNTING ON PALMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He's rusty, rested and ready.
</P>
<P>
   But does the appearance of USC quarterback Carson Palmer at
spring practices really mean the Trojans' savior has returned?
</P>
<P>
   It does if you ask wide receiver Kareem Kelly, who spent just 2
games playing with Palmer before the star quarterback broke his
collarbone last September against Oregon, which effectively ended
his season.
</P>
<P>
   Without a second of hesitation, Kelly knows how many games the
6-6 Trojans would have won with a healthy Palmer: ``All of them.''
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like a giddy fan or blowhard booster, but it
clearly demonstrates the effect a player with Palmer's talent has
on his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Palmer is just trying to regain his touch and timing
this spring, Kelly sees endless possibilities after just a handful
of practices the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just adds so much more to the offense,'' Kelly said. ``It
is a totally different team. Mike (Van Raaphorst) was consistent,
but there's nothing like having your starting quarterback. This
year, I think we'll put it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   The usually laid-back Palmer is thrilled to be back, but careful
not to put too much emphasis on his return. He knows everyone
speculates that it is only a matter of time before he leaves for
the NFL, and insists he will stay at USC at least two more years.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, he just wants to become a normal, healthy
college quarterback again, comfortable doing the drills he has
practiced since junior high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I feel clumsy at times with my footwork and sitting
in the pocket,'' Palmer said. ``And you have to get used to having
defensive linemen flying toward you.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer even shies away from saying the Trojans would have been
better with him last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have hoped we would win a few more games if I hadn't
gotten hurt, but there's no way to tell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmer is certain that he is a different quarterback than
the one whose 1999 season abruptly ended when Oregon rover Michael
Fletcher tackled him near the sideline, shattering his collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``One second changed my life,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer eventually redshirted and got the year of eligibility
back, but he is definitely not the same person. He is still
considered a sure-fire NFL prospect and one of the top players at
his position in the country. But his attitude has changed immensely
from that late September night when he was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me think I couldn't take football for granted,''
Palmer said. ``You really can't take anything for granted. I used
to come to practice and go through the motions. I don't do that
anymore. I look forward to practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy every rep, every snap that I get. Before I wouldn't go
as hard as I could. Now I try to be perfect every chance I get.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of being perfect is avoiding another injury. USC is working
on sliding drills for quarterbacks this spring, specifically to
avoid another mishap, when Palmer was hurt trying to gain a couple
meaningless yards two plays before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quarterback is about leadership,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said. ``And leadership means being healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett won't object to Palmer rolling out and running next
season, he just wants a little discretion about when his franchise
player heads downfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it means the Super Bowl ... OK,'' Hackett said. ``I can
remember in '85 that Joe Montana ran in from 5 yards out and scored
a touchdown. But you have to understand when to do it. If it means
the game, it's something else. But it's a maturing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer understands he can't play with as much reckless abandon,
if for no other reason, than to not be forced to watch any more USC
games on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire time I was out I was itchy,'' Palmer said. ``The
hardest part was watching games, especially the losses.''
</P>
<P>
   It became so depressing, Palmer vowed to stop thinking about his
injury, realizing it was starting to dominate his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that if I kept thinking about it, it would always
put me in a bad mood,'' Palmer said. ``I thought about it for
awhile, but it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in order to take some pressure off Palmer's return,
Hackett stressed that he could not use the quarterback's absence as
an excuse to explain USC's mediocre record last season. The Trojans
had other problems too, but Hackett conceded that USC was severely
impacted by Palmer's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask (San Francisco coach) Steve Mariucci if the 49ers without
Steve Young were a different team, or ask the Rams if they would be
the same without Kurt Warner,'' Hackett said. ``It's the nature of
the position.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's collarbone is completely healed, and while it might
take until summer camp for him to reclaim all of his sharpness, he
isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing football is like riding a bike, you never really
forget,'' Palmer said.

WOMEN'S HISTORY MUSEUM PROPOSED IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
 MUSEUM-ART-480-(TRIMS)-NYT  (hm) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ More than 150 years after the first convention on
women's rights in upstate New York, Gov. George E. Pataki has
proposed building one of the first museums in the country to be
devoted to women's history.
</P>
<P>
   The $125 million museum would be in Battery Park City near the
southern tip of Manhattan, joining several recent museum projects
like the Jewish Heritage Museum and the planned Skyscraper Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, has provided $1 million in state money for
the project and promises to carve out more from this year's budget.
Advocates for the museum, who include a group of prominent civic
and business leaders, are planning to raise the rest from private
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have outstanding elements of history here in New
York,'' Pataki said in a telephone interview. ``The next logical
step is to pull it all together in one site that is visible and
reachable by most people. I think we're going to see a great deal
of support for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the idea originated with a one-year commission that
he appointed in 1998 to honor the achievements of women. Libby
Pataki, the governor's wife, headed the commission. Its 52 other
members included Beverly Sills, Billie Jean King and Roz Abrams,
the television anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Although the museum is still in the planning stage, it has been
laid out on paper by Ralph Appelbaum Associates, a design company
that has left its imprint on the newly renovated Hayden Planetarium
in Manhattan and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in
Washington. A drawing shows a 10-story building whose floors,
linked by ramps, overlook a multilevel visual display at the
museum's center.
</P>
<P>
   The new museum, known formally as the Museum of Women: The
Leadership Center, would differ from existing collections around
the state in that it would not focus on individuals, but would
offer a comprehensive view of women's contributions to American
history, said Lynn Rollins, former deputy director of the state's
Division for Women, who is leading the efforts for the new museum.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins said the exhibits would include photographs, artifacts
and interactive displays that help tell the story of women in
American history, from the pioneers and suffragists to recent
immigrants. ``We want every woman to walk through the museum and
feel like they're part of their history,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits would not be limited to things of interest only to
New Yorkers, Rollins said, but would be planned in consultation
with a national advisory board of historians. The building would
also include conference rooms and an auditorium to provide training
classes in leadership and business skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the seminal history of women took place in New
York, and this is a tourist mecca,'' she said. ``This is an
opportunity to let people know what women in America have
achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides said they had approached Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani and the Battery Park City Authority, a three-member state
board appointed by the governor, about the project. It would
require the approval of city and state officials and the authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a good idea, and we look forward to reviewing
the plan,'' said Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy S. Carey, president of the Battery Park City Authority,
said the arrangement would be similar to one that helped bring the
Museum of Jewish Heritage there in 1997. If approved, the women's
history museum would not have to pay rent or other fees on the
property for 20 years, Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a diverse coalition of advocacy groups,
scholars and politicians around the country has sought to promote
women's history. A 1997 campaign persuaded Congress to restore a
marble statue depicting three suffragists _ Susan B. Anthony,
Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton _ to the Capitol Rotunda.
The statue, which was commissioned by the National Woman's Party in
1921, had been kept in a downstairs corridor.
</P>
<P>
   A former opera house in Dallas is being transformed with $25
million in public and private money into the Women's Museum: An
Institute for the Future, which is expected to open in September.
It will borrow artifacts from the Smithsonian and other museums to
chronicle women's history from the 1500's to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are also under way for the National Museum of Women's
History in Washington. And a host of educational programs and
Internet sites have sprung up to inform women about their role in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a need for women's history museums,'' said Galen
Sherwin, president of the New York City chapter of the National
Organization for Women, who supports the creation of another one in
Manhattan. ``The problem with the study of history is that its
focus is on politics and economics, areas that, up until recently,
mostly excluded women.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York, some of the earliest exhibits about women's history
can be found in Seneca Falls, a village halfway between Syracuse
and Rochester that was the hometown of Stanton, the suffragist. She
helped organize the first women's rights conference there in 1848,
drawing nearly 300 people and setting off the American women's
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these historic events are commemorated there by the
Women's Rights National Historical Park, which is managed by the
federal government, and the National Women's Hall of Fame, a
private center that opened in 1969 to honor the achievements of
individuals from Stanton to Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame, which has inducted 157 women so far, has
rebounded in recent years after nearly closing in 1989 because of
financial troubles. Mary Ann Oppenheimer, the executive director,
said the center now takes in enough from ticket sales and donations
to cover its $350,000 annual operating budget. Attendance has
climbed steadily to 10,000 visitors last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much out there that could be told,'' said
Oppenheimer. ``It's a very interesting idea, and I think there are
lots of opportunities for organizations like ours to find ways to
work together and achieve our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Cott, a professor of history and women's studies at Yale
University, said the new museum would give historians an
opportunity to reach a broader audience. Other scholars and
advocates said they would like to see exhibits on everything from
the changing image of femininity in the 1990's to the role that
women played in the Civil War.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: LAPTOPS STOLEN AT AIRPORTS; ONLINE USE ON RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (hm) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that if your briefcase was stolen while you were
on the road, you'd probably be out no more than a nice leather bag,
some pens, some easily replaced papers and maybe the morning paper
and a Snickers bar. But today, the travel accessory of choice for
thieves is a laptop or notebook computer, and losing one of those
babies can really cause a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a current furor raging in Britain, where in a single
week earlier this month, two agents with the British intelligence
services lost their laptops, which were ``packed with priceless
state secrets,'' swooned The Sun, a British tabloid. One was stolen
from a careless spy who set it down briefly on a subway platform;
the other was ``mislaid'' by a spy who ``got blind drunk,''
according to The Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing quite so dramatic has happened in the United States.
Still, laptop thieves are having a prolonged field day in airports,
hotels and other places frequented by business travelers. Safeware
Inc., the largest insurer of laptops and other computers, said its
clients reported 319,000 laptop computers stolen in 1999, a 5
percent increase over 1998. In 1997, however, such thefts jumped 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A good many of those laptops are being stolen at airports,
sometimes by organized rings of thieves. ``There are teams
operating at every major airport in the country,'' said Weldon L.
Kennedy, a retired deputy director of the FBI who is now the vice
chairman of Guardsmark Inc., a security services company with 115
offices nationally. ``It's very easy to do, with very low risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's company doesn't work in airport security. He just
thought it would be a good idea to pass on a general heads-up to
business travelers about the way laptop thieves operate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best way to steal a laptop is to simply lift one
that has been carelessly left unattended or unwatched. But the
teams working airports specialize in a more clever method, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It works this way: A two-person team waits by a busy security
checkpoint for someone carrying a laptop. They then fall into place
in front of the mark. One of the thieves passes through the
metal-detector gate without incident. The other waits till the mark
has placed the laptop onto the conveyor belt, and then walks in
front of the mark and through the gate in a way that deliberately
causes a backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has all kinds of metal on him to set off the alarm,''
Kennedy said. ``The security manager asks him to step back, empty
his pockets, go through the device again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the computer has already emerged on the other
side, where the first thief simply walks off with it while its
owner waits to get through the gate and fetch his laptop from the
belt. By then, both thief and laptop are ``nowhere to be seen,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The trick works because travelers at crowded airport security
checkpoints, already somewhat distracted by the ordeal of passing
through a metal detector, typically can't see clearly beyond the
security people and machinery to ``where your stuff comes out on
the other end,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the thieves have to do is delay you,'' he continued. ``In
most airports, as crowded as they are, in just a few seconds
somebody can meld into the crowd very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding losing a laptop this way requires only a little more
alertness to your immediate surroundings at the security gate,
Kennedy said. ``When you finally put your computer on the belt,
just make sure there is no one right in front of you, and that you
can easily maneuver yourself to see the other end of the belt,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that laptops are stolen from hotel rooms, or damaged in
other ways on the road, insuring them has become a thriving niche
business. Increasingly, said Brian Haase, a marketing manager at
the Safeware insurance company, companies are telling employees,
``Here's your $4,000 laptop, and if it gets stolen, it's your
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Many regular homeowners' insurance policies ``won't touch laptop
loss with a 10-foot pole,'' Haase said. This opened up the
opportunity for Safeware, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, and
sells a policy on a $4,000 notebook for about $100 a year (with a
$50 deductible). ``We're in a great niche,'' Haase added. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Online Use on Rise
</P>
<P>
   New research suggests that business travelers may be going
online more than anticipated to book air tickets, hotels and rental
cars. In a survey of more than 800 executives, Greenfield Online,
an Internet market research firm, found that the number of business
travelers booking air travel online more than doubled in January to
28 percent from 13 percent six months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Those booking hotels online rose to 24 percent from 9 percent.
The survey isn't scientific _ those who replied did so online,
indicating that they were already predisposed to the Internet. But
the results nevertheless suggest that current projections on the
growth of online booking _ which forecasters believe will account
for about 8 percent of the total travel market by next year _ may
be somewhat conservative. &QL;

ADVERTISING: NEW AD AGENCY USES HOMESPUN APPROACH IN PITCHING
WHISKEY
</HEADLINE>
   (hm) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ The name of an agency that opened here last
month epitomizes its approach to aiming advertising at savvy,
skeptical consumers: Hayseed House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd joke when we were in New York that we were the
hayseeds,'' said Anders Carlson, one of three founders of the shop,
who collaborated on a campaign for J&AMP;B Scotch whisky on behalf of
J. Walter Thompson. ``It's a self-consciously ironic sort of
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Carlson, 25, and his friend Rick Streed, 28,
have free-lanced for Thompson to produce irreverent print
advertisements for J&AMP;B based on posters they created as managers of
Badger Liquor, a short walk from the University of Wisconsin campus
in Madison. The success of the ads in test markets prompted them to
go into business for themselves, along with Michael Kramer, 30, who
had been brand manager for J&AMP;B in New York. J&AMP;B is their first
client.
</P>
<P>
   The bold, brightly colored posters, promoting weekly specials on
beer and liquor brands, sought to appeal to potential customers,
particularly men 21 to 25, with wry humor that mocked traditional
spirits ads and humble production values meant to underscore their
homemade origins.
</P>
<P>
   One poster, for instance, pitched Dempsey's Extra Stout, brewed
in Monroe, Wis., with handwritten comparisons between the state and
Ireland in categories like ``obsessions,'' ``drinking habits'' and
``differences between respective weddings and funerals.''
</P>
<P>
   A Thompson executive visiting Madison as part of research into
finding ways to reverse a decades-long plunge in J&AMP;B sales by
increasing its appeal to drinkers younger than retirement age saw
the posters _ and the appreciative crowds gathered to peer at them
through the store windows. He was impressed enough to buy a
disposable camera and take pictures to share with colleagues back
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``My radar was up to anything I thought was speaking to the
target in a voice that didn't feel like an advertiser talking to a
consumer,'' said the executive, Michael Hart, senior partner and
group creative director at the flagship New York office of
Thompson, part of the WPP Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business is changing so rapidly,'' he added. ``I will do
anything and everything to find a voice that's heard by this new
generation.'' At a meeting, Hart and other Thompson executives
presented several of their own ideas along with a campaign based on
the Badger posters. The client chose the Anders-Streed work, which
became the basis for the test campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotch has gone through such a long-term decline that we knew
we needed to do something radically different,'' said Michael
Stoner, vice president and scotch product group director at
Schieffelin &AMP; Somerset in New York, a joint venture of Diageo,
which owns J&AMP;B, and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ads still talked in `scotch language,' always relating the
country club rules,'' he added, referring to conventional elements
like brand heritage and drinking etiquette. ``Rick and Anders'
stuff looks so different, so fresh, and is so true to this
audience, the mid-20-something beer-drinking guy, that we
immediately embraced it.''
</P>
<P>
   When research showed that other liquor brands, like Captain
Morgan's rum and Jim Beam bourbon, had made inroads into that
market by encouraging mixing with cola, the print ads by Carlson
and Streed _ initially 10, now more than 10 times that _ were
focused on drinking J&AMP;B in such a manner, which would horrify
scotch purists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are brands conquering this demographic,'' Kramer said,
``so we accepted that we had to break out of the scotch box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``J&AMP;B is a great old brand with a rich history,'' he added,
``but the concept Rick and Anders came up with is in the voice of
the consumer, like the responsible-drinking message that says,
`Drinking in moderation beats vomiting in excess.'''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was initially tested in Colorado and Wisconsin,
appearing in publications like The Onion, a satirical weekly
newspaper to which Streed has contributed. Thompson copywriters are
creating radio commercials to accompany the print ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales are up about 14 percent,'' Stoner said, ``which, for a
brand that has been declining for 22 years, is astonishing and
wonderful for us.'' The test has been expanded to San Diego and
Providence, R.I., he added, where it ``is going quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk about what's going to happen,'' Stoner said,
``but it's very likely it'll be expanded.''
</P>
<P>
   About three months ago, Kramer recalled, he began discussing
with Carlson and Streed the possibility of opening an agency ``that
would be a problem solver, an independent creative voice.'' The
collaboration is made much easier by a sensibility the three share:
an appreciation of what Carlson describes approvingly as anything
``old school.''
</P>
<P>
   That can range from the work shirt worn by Kramer bearing a
Miller Lite logo and the style of play of the University of
Wisconsin basketball team to the Old Gold Filter Kings smoked by
Carlson and the Huber beer sold at Badger Liquor, a local brand
that comes in cartons still festooned with a character resembling a
brewmaster version of Peanut.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Carlson and Streed said they used some of the money they
earned from Thompson to repair the 1940's neon sign over the Badger
Liquor entrance, which reads ``Badger Liquor Shop Ice Cubes'' and
depicts a tilted bottle pouring drops of liquid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about how can we do something bigger,'' Streed said,
``creative work that would appeal to anyone as long as we keep it
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he and Carlson are taking the advice of those
old-school comedians, Bob and Ray, by not quitting their day jobs.
Both still work at Badger Liquor and still make window posters.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson's most recent, peddling ``Carlo Rossi wine-esque wine,''
presents make-believe ``celebrity summer plans'' of stars like
Christina Aguilera, Tim Allen and Ricky Martin. The poster
resembles the Hayseed House ads for J&AMP;B but is somewhat different.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Kramer said, laughing, the font for the ad
headlines, developed by Carlson, was bought by Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson acknowledged that in a tone of voice half amused, half
amazed: ``They own my handwriting.''

PROFIT-TAKING AND COHEN ANNOUNCEMENT LEAVE STOCKS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change 5 percent to 5 percentage points in lede.)  
(mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices declined Tuesday, as investors took
profits in a number of companies that have been big winners so far
this year and Abby Joseph Cohen, the influential stock market
strategist at Goldman, Sachs, announced that she had pared the
exposure to stocks in her model portfolio to 65 percent, a
reduction of 5 percentage points. It is the first time that Cohen
has reduced the recommended stock allocation in the portfolio since
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which has risen sharply since Jan. 1 and had a good run
on Monday, was a big drag on major market indexes. The chipmaker's
stock price fell 7 Tuesday, to 135 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   The decline helped to pull the Dow Jones industrial average down
89.74 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,936.11. Hewlett-Packard and IBM
were also major contributors to the Dow's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems were big losers among
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which slumped 16.13 points,
or 1.1 percent, to 1,507.73.
</P>
<P>
   Those same stocks and other technology companies that trade on
the Nasdaq stock market combined to generate a big slide in the
Nasdaq composite index. The index fell 124.67, or 2.5 percent, to
4,833.89.
</P>
<P>
   And widespread selling of smaller technology issues was
instrumental in a 2.5 percent decline in the Russell 2000 index,
which closed at 559.04, down 14.61.
</P>
<P>
   With the quarter winding down and no substantive economic
reports expected until April 7, when March employment data will be
released, traders said there was no fundamental catalyst that
triggered the selloff.
</P>
<P>
   Before the markets opened, however, Cohen announced she had
pared the exposure to stocks in her model portfolio to 65 percent,
a reduction of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she reduced her equity weighting, Cohen maintained her
recently increased end-of-the-year estimate on the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index at 1,575. And she did not cut her forecast for
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and analysts said the change in Cohen's position hardly
qualified as a major shift in sentiment. Still, it probably served
as a catalyst for profit taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the nice rally the market had last week, we were cruising
for a bruising,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at
Prudential Securities. ``And as we wait for a decision on oil
production out of OPEC, a possible settlement in the Microsoft case
and first-quarter earnings numbers, we are in a bit of a news
vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading activity picked up a bit from Monday, but was quite
subdued compared with the recent hectic pace. On the New York Stock
Exchange, 959.1 million shares changed hands. Volume on the Nasdaq
stock market was 1.5 billion shares. ``The markets feel quieter in
all areas, from the Big Board to Nasdaq to flows in international
stocks,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``Normally, you would expect to see more
quarter-end dynamics. It is almost as if investors have their
portfolios in order and are letting the quarter go out on its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which for the most part took a hit on Monday,
bounced back a bit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, American Express rose 2, to 152; J.P. Morgan
gained 1 7/8, to 133; and Citigroup closed at 61, up 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in oil prices led to a healthy gain in airline stocks.
</P>
<P>
   UAL Corp., parent of United Air Lines, climbed 5/8, to 59 5/8.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose 1 5/16, to 32 7/16. And
Delta Air Lines rose 2 3/4, to 54 3/4.

A COLUMN GLADLY NEVER WRITTEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BUD KENNEDY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the column I prayed I would never have to write.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 5, I saw a tornado swoop down from the clouds and
peel shingles from the roof of the Lena Pope children's home in
west Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   I know tornadoes can strike Fort Worth. I've seen it happen.
</P>
<P>
   I prayed I would never see another.
</P>
<P>
   I've met some survivors of the previous major tornado to strike
Fort Worth, a 1995 twister that tossed cars and demolished
apartment buildings near Texas Christian University in southwest
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   That storm wasn't even the day's biggest headline. It came the
night of April 19, the night of the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   That tornado left only survivors.
</P>
<P>
   This tornado, for the first time in recorded Fort Worth history,
brought death.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how many people really bought into the American
Indian legend that a tornado would never strike where river forks
come together. But it was as good a way as any to explain Fort
Worth's 150 years of grace.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 50 years alone, Dallas County suffered 17 fatalities
in eight tornadoes, according to federal records kept by the
Vermont-based Tornado Project.
</P>
<P>
   That includes 10 deaths in this area's ``Big One'': the 1957
tornado that wiped out much of the Oak Cliff neighborhood southwest
of downtown Dallas and then danced along the Trinity River bottoms
past downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the tornado did not turn along the river.
</P>
<P>
   It did not strike the Indians' 1840s campground across the river
north of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   It climbed the bluff and came through downtown.
</P>
<P>
   An 1875 tornado supposedly followed the same path west of
downtown, according to a 1981 Fort Worth history. But a newspaper
then reported that ``When the wind struck the high bluffs. ... It
was dissipated.''
</P>
<P>
   The bluff may have weakened this tornado from the force that
plowed up West Seventh Street and wiped out a half-block across the
west side.
</P>
<P>
   It kept enough strength to topple the Calvary Chapel tower and
break windows and topple walls across downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 tornado rated an F2 on the Fujita scale used to rank
the force of storms. The worst tornado to hit Tarrant County in the
past half-century, at least on the Fujita rating scale, was an F3
tornado that injured nine people May 4, 1960.
</P>
<P>
   That tornado struck the Casino Beach recreation area on Lake
Worth and cut across what was then rural northwest Tarrant County,
destroying homes and businesses on Jacksboro Highway and in Sansom
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, we've been lucky. In our lifetimes, families and
entire neighborhoods have been wiped out by tornadoes in nearby
Wichita Falls, Waco, Lancaster, Lubbock, and recently, near Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Among American cities, we have been singularly spared for 150
years, says meteorologist Harold Brooks, a severe storms expert.
</P>
<P>
   Until last night.
