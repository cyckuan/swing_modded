<HEADLINE> Georgia, Abkhazia to Resume Talks in Moscow Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Georgia and its breakaway region,
Abkhazia, will resume their talks in Moscow on Monday in a bid to
work out a new mandate for Russian peacekeeping troops in the
North-Caucasian republic, a top official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Vakhtang Abashidze, the press secretary of Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze, told reporters that at the just-concluded
talks the two parties discussed the mandate issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Shevardnadze said he viewed the talks between
the sides as a serious dialogue on ways to end the conflict in
Abkhazia, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia declared its independence from Georgia soon after the
former Soviet Union was broken up in the end of 1991. Georgia has
not agreed to this intention. This quarrel has resulted in a
bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said he believes that the year 1996 will become a
critical year in the settlement of the Abkhazian conflict.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Private Sector to Launch Hydropower Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A hydropower project with a
capacity of 36,000 kilowatt is to be launched in northern Nepal by
a private company early next year, officials of the Water
Resources Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The 18-million-US-dollar project, located in about 110 km north
of Kathmandu, is expected to be completed by January 2000, they
said.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the development of the upper Bhotekoshi project
was signed here today between the Nepal Electricity Authority
(NEA) and project developer, the Bhotekoshi Power Company Pvt.
ltd., a joint venture with Nepali and American private
investments.
</P>
<P>
The upper Bhotekoshi project on the Bhotekoshi river is the
second hydroelectric project invested by the private sector in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a 60,000-kilowatt project started in east Nepal
with investment of local and foreign companies and international
commercial loans.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has adopted a policy to develop the
country's abundant water resources with the involvement of the
private investment.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that Nepal currently only harnessed less than
1 percent of its more than 83,000 megawatt hydroelectric
potential.

HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's library of parliament has
become one of the three lately designated United Nations depository
libraries.
</P>
<P>
This means Zimbabwe has entered into the international network
comprising 355 libraries of 142 countries, where users have easy
access to the UN documents and publications.
</P>
<P>
A statement released on Sunday by the UN Information Centre in
Harare says the other two libraries are located in Australia and
India.

<HEADLINE> Liu's Coach: Ranking Can't Say Everything </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Ge, coach of China's
butterfly world champion Liu Limin, said here on Sunday that the
top world ranking cann't present everything.
</P>
<P>
"The world top-ranked swimmer is not the one who will surely
gain an Olympic gold, " said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
Liu Limin, the world champion in both the women's 100- and
200-meter butterfly, is only ranked fourth in both of two events,
according to the latest world rankings.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese butterfliers made a stunning progress in recent
years and scored the year's best times in both events.
</P>
<P>
Ayari Aoyama clocked 58.83 seconds in the 100m while her
teammate Hitomi Kashima, only 14, timed 2:08.69 in the 200m at the
Japanese Olympic Trials in April. The Japanese squad tipped the
main Olympic gold hope on the two teenagers.
</P>
<P>
"Our strongest events lie in the butterfly." said Toshiaki
Nomoto, head coach of the Japanese swimming squad.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Japanese are taking the advantage, Zhao said:"It's
true that they (the Japanese) swim faster, according to the
rankings, but the rankings are not everything. You have seen what
happened to the Chinese young swimmer."
</P>
<P>
China's two new faces Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, pre-Games
favourites in the individual medley, suffered a disasterous
first-day competitions, both crashing out of the final in women's
400-meter IM on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen ranked number one while Wu placed second in the ranking in
the event.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Government Urged to Reduce Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Chamber of Commerce
is urging the government to reduce public sector expenditure,
boost foreign and local investment and solve rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The delegates to the just-ended Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce Conference in the resort town of Kariba in north Zimbabwe
said the soaring budget deficit, which they blamed squarely on the
government's financial indiscipline, should be tackled now.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National News Agency today quoted the delegates
as saying the government borrowing from the domestic market to
finance the deficit has led to a high inflation rate of about 24
percent.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's failure to reduce the budget deficit has been the
main impediment to achieving most of the targets of the first
phase of the economic reforms. The country will begin its second
phase of the reforms later in the year.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe government originally planned to cut the budget
deficit to five percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The goal remained elusive since 1991 and latest figures show
this year's deficit may be as high as eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank withdrew
162.5 million US Dollars in September last year because Zimbabwe
had failed to reduce the deficit to five percent of GDP by
1994/95.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's unemployment rate is currently running at about 50
percent, a situation which the conference said is of major concern
not only for the government but for the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Petroleum Products Import Rises in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has to turn
to heavy importation of petroleum products recently to feed the
local need as production in its ailing refineries is nearly
paralyzed mainly due to lack of proper maintenance of equipment.
</P>
<P>
For about four weeks, refined petroleum products maintained
their dominance of imports through the Lagos Port Complex known
as Apapa. On Friday alone there were six tankers waiting to
berth, port authorities said, adding three other vessels are
being expected at the port before next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the tankers waiting to berth at Apapa, three are carrying
petrol, while the other three are loaded with diesel, jet oil and
lubricating oil respectively.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that over the past six weeks, Nigeria, the
largest crude oil producer in west Africa, has imported about
690,000 tons of refined petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
There are now four refineries in Nigeria with an aggregate
installed capacity of 445,000 barrels per day. At present, two of
these refineries, with an installed capacity of 125,000 barrels
and 110,000 barrels respectively, are out of production as they
are undergoing repairs. The other two are reported to be working
at about 70 percent of their installed capacity, also because of
equipment-related matters.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is a short supply of petroleum products by
some 180,000 barrels daily at the local market, leading to the
rapid massive importation of the products in the recent several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The epileptic production of the refineries due to lack of
proper maintenance, among other factors, has been a headache of
the Nigerian government. Huge investment is needed to solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Kabir Chafe said
last week that the government will need about 200 million US
Dollars to put in shape all the ailing oil refineries, in order
to produce at their maximum installed capacity.
</P>
<P>
However, fund shortage has been one of the principal factors
hindering the growth of the country's economy as almost all
enterprises in Nigeria, particularly state-owned ones, are
thirsty for investment.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, since the equipment in oil refineries
can not be put in good order in a short period of time, incessant
fuel shortage and regular importation of petroleum products will
become a necessary job despite the high cost of imports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995 alone, Nigeria imported a total
of 2.197 million tons of petroleum products to meet the domestic
needs, at a cost of about 424 million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that this year, the government may have ordered
1.49 million tons of petrol valued at 2.83 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure for the importation of petroleum products is
not a big amount compared with Nigeria's tens of billions of
Dollars crude oil export income every year.
</P>
<P>
But experts from the energy sector fears that as long as the
refineries continue their epileptic production method, the era of
incessant fuel scarcity and regular importation of petroleum
products would continue unabated.

<HEADLINE> Dinner with Prime Minister Major at 100,000 Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
and his Cabinet colleagues are being hired out for private dinners
with businessmen by a secretive Conservative fund-raising
organization in return for up to 100,000 pounds (150,000 U.S.
dollars), the Observer newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The donations are being channeled through the Premier Club,
which was established last November with Prime Minister Major as
its patron and Conservative party chairman Brian Mawhinney as its
President, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Premier Club is thought to have two tiers: "Ordinary
members" are invited to have suppers with Cabinet members at the
price of 10,000 pounds (15,000 dollars); "founder members" are
invited to have two dinners a year with Prime Minister Major at
100,000 pounds (150,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Frances Prenn, the Club's membership secretary, revealed the
"unique benefits" for those who pay six-figure sums, saying
"Sometimes there's a very sensitive political issue: we try and
tell them what's the best way of getting around it".
</P>
<P>
"And if there are specific business concerns, we will try and
assist in getting that answered. We can't promise what the end
result will be, but we can certainly facilitate an opportunity
for one to air one's views," she said.
</P>
<P>
Political commentators predict that the disclosure of the
details of the Premier Club operation will severely embarrass
Major, who has claimed, after repeated scandals over secret donors
to the party, to have distanced himself from the process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior Shadow Cabinet member Robin Cook is reported
as saying, "the very name of this club is intended to convey the
impression that you get access to the Prime Minister. Businessmen
are being given influence by access to government ministers."

<P>
MOGADISHU, July 21 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed
and six others wounded today when a round of mortar landed near a
refugee camp in South Mogadishu, according to eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
The mortar round came after a serious of explosions were heard
around the former Zoppe commercial center near Bosnia Vicinity.
</P>
<P>
Three more mortar rounds also hit the residential areas around
the milk factory of South Mogadishu, but no casualties were
reported.
</P>
<P>
The mortar bombardment forced the civilians to flee their
houses more than three miles away from the battle zones in fear
of mortar attacks.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of heavy fire continued until mid-day, but people
from the neighborhood confirmed that no ground attacks were made
by any of the warring sides.
</P>
<P>
The seemingly interminable fighting between the militiamen of
General Mohamed Farah Aidid and those of his former financier,
Osman Hassan Ali Atto, has subsided for the past few days even
though sporadic shooting continued between the opposing
militiamen at their defense positions.
</P>
<P>
Radio South Mogadishu supporting Osman Atto accused the
militiamen of General Aidid of what they called the blind mortar
attacks on the civilian areas. There's no word yet from the
government of General Aidid or any of his top officers over the
mortar attacks.
</P>
<P>
There are no peace negotiations going on at the moment between
the opposing sides.

<HEADLINE> Heyns Dampens Riley With Early World Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- South African Penelope Heyns
shattered her own world best with a clocking of 1:07.02 in the
women's 100-meter breaststroke heats here on Sunday in the
Centennial Olympics.
</P>
<P>
She sliced 0.44 seconds off her previous mark set four months
ago at the National Championships in Durban.
</P>
<P>
The magic girl, 21, considered as the vanguard in her country's
swimming events, has showed her prowess in the sports to the
world.
</P>
<P>
The second-time Olympian finished a lowly 32nd place in the
100m breast and 34th in the 200m breast at the Barcelona Games
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Then came her turning point last summer when she burst onto the
international scene with a gold in the 100m and a silver in the
200m breaststrokes at the Pan Pacific Games here in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The South African, who lives and trains in the United States,
also swept the two golds in the breaststroke events at the
Universiade in Fukuoka last year.
</P>
<P>
She finally attracted the swimming world with her world mark in
Durban in March, which also won her the top-ranked swimmer in the
event of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the morning's heat, she again showed her superiority in the
event, diluting another pre-race favourite Australian Samanthy
Riley, the drug scandal-involved swimmer.
</P>
<P>
Riley finished a disappointing fourth at 1:09.37, but enough to
book a berth in the finals.
</P>
<P>
American teenager Amanda Beard finished second, followed by
Agnes Kovacs of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
"I do hope a world record in the morning heats," Heynes said,
"I trained extremely hard in the last three months, I think
tonight will be a great opportunity for me."
</P>
<P>
She said she didn't expect Riley to swim so slow in the heat,
"I really hope she performed well, so we can race against each
other."
</P>
<P>
Her Czech coach Jan Bidrman, also present at the news
conference, admitted he was satisfied with Heyns' performance.
</P>
<P>
If she wins the finals tonight, the 1.70-meter Heynes will
become the first South African Olympic gold medalist in the
swimming competitions.

<HEADLINE> France Commemorates Jews Transportation in Nazi Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- About one hundred people joined this
morning a ceremony in Drancy, northeast of Paris, commemorating
67,000 Jews who were sent from a concentration camp there to Nazi
death camps during the 1940-44 Vichy collaboration period.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, held at the former site of the concentration camp,
was presided by government representative Eric Raoult and prefect of
Seine-Saint-Denis Jean-Pierre Duport, and was participated by some
survivors of Nazi death camps, Agence France Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
The Drancy concentration camp jailed 100,000 Jews from August
1940 to August 1944. About 67,000 of the Jews, among them 10,000
children, were loaded on trains bound for Nazi death camps. Only
1,500 of them survived the death camps.
</P>
<P>
The camp was run by the Vichy puppet regime until July 1943, when
the German occupation force took over the camp.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 68 convoys loaded with Jews left the camp for death
camps. The last convoy left on July 31, 1944, with 1,300 Jews,
including 300 children.

<HEADLINE> Russian Soldier Wins Shooting Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian markswoman Olga Klochneva
took the women's 10 meters air pistol gold medal here on Sunday
with a grand total of 490.1 points in the Olympic shooting
competition.
</P>
<P>
Klochneva, who scored 390 points after the preliminaries to
share the lead with her teammate Marina Logvinenko, fired steadily
in the 10-shot shoot off and finally overturned Logvinenko to win
the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Logvinenko, the defending champion, took silver after pipping
Mariya Grozdeva of Bulgaria in a single pellet shoot-off after
they finished tied on 488.5 points. The Bulgaria came third in the
41-shooter field.
</P>
<P>
Klochneva called on divine inspiration to depose compatriot
Logvinenko and win the title. She displayed none of the last-shot
wobbles that had undone the leaders in Saturday's opening two
events.
</P>
<P>
Instead, she shot a near-perfect 10.7 with her last effort to
ensure the gold.
</P>
<P>
When asked how she managed to keep her nerve, Klochneva said
she has been in the army since 1987 and hoped to be promoted to
officer status shortly. Her gold medal performance will presumably
enhance her prospects.
</P>
<P>
Klochneva embraced Logvinenko after her fellow Russian secured
silver.
</P>
<P>
This is the second gold medal won by Russia since the
Centennial Games opened on Friday. The Russian fencer took the
men's individual epee title on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Klochneva's total bettered the Olympic final record of 486.4
posted by both Logvinenko and Yugoslav Jasna Sekaric in the
Barcelona final four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Klochneva's clinical display was in contrast to the final-shot
drama in the first two medal events on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China's Yifu Wang collapsed after his disastrous final shot
handed gold to Italian Roberto Di Donna in the men's air pistol.
</P>
<P>
Wang had to be carried from the hall on a stretcher with an
oxygen mask strapped to his face.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Petra Horneber also threw away a winning position
with a poor final shot in Saturday's women's air rifle final.
</P>
<P>
That error enabled Poland's Renata Mauer to claim her place in
history as the winner of the first gold of the Centennial Games.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- In the swimming pool, Penelope
Heyns of South Africa testifies that she is the best woman
breaststroker in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old svelte swimmer led throughout and touched home
with an edge of half a body's length against Belgian Brigitte
Becue, chief rival in the heats.
</P>
<P>
Heyns clocked in a world record of 1:07.02, chopping 0.44
seconds off her own mark set in Burban, South Africa, four months
ago.
</P>
<P>
Franziska Van Almsick, a German "golden fish" with two silvers
and two bronzes at the Barcelona Games four years ago, was atop in
the heats of the women's 200-meter freestyle with a timing of
1:59.40, edging the 1.90-meter Claudia Poll of Costa Rica to the
second by 0.47 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Van Almsick failed to qualify for the 100m and 400m freestyle
events at the German Olympic Trails whereas she clocked the year's
best time of 1:58.88 in the 200m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Trina Jackson of the United States was third at 2:00.29.
</P>
<P>
Australian medal hopeful Susan O'Neill also qualified for the
200m finals, an off event against her hot beat of butterfly
wherein she won the double at the Pan Pacific championships.
</P>
<P>
American Eric Namesnik, national record holder in the men's
400m individual medley, enjoyed the upperhand over his fancied
teammate Tom Dolan, a vicitm of chronic asthma, to win the heats
at 4:16.21.
</P>
<P>
Marcel Wouda of the Netherlands finished second, ahead of
Dolan, at 4:17.66.
</P>
<P>
World record holder in the men's 200m individual medley, Jani
Sievinen of Finland crashed out of the finals by finishing in an
miserable ninth place.
</P>
<P>
The host squad had the dominance in the men's 4X200m freesytle
relay event, clocking 7:18.28 for the first place.
</P>
<P>
Both Sweden and Britain took their distant second and third
spots at 7:20.61 and 7:21.92 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Gore Hopes For Improvement in Welfare Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
said on Sunday that welfare legislation now moving through
Congress has "some real shortcomings," and expressed hope for
improvement to make it acceptable to the White House.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote Tuesday on a bill that would end
60 years of federal guarantees for the poor, setting time limits
for a person receiving benefits and turning over to the states
much of the management of welfare programs. The House of
Representatives passed a similar bill last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has praised the main objective of the
measure worked out by congressional Republicans: getting people
off welfare rolls and into jobs, but has expressed concern about
specific aspects of it.
</P>
<P>
Gore reiterated the concerns on CBS' "Face the Nation,"
particularly language that prohibits legal immigrants from
receiving benefits, cuts food stamp programs and cuts off
non-monetary vouchers for children whose parents have used up all
their time for receiving welfare.
</P>
<P>
Before the bill reaches the president's desk, "we are going to
work very hard to change the elements of the bill which we think
still need attention. We've already gotten improvements in the
bill that was just passed by the House, although there are still
some real shortcomings," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore said he still hoped the House-Senate conference on the
bill would take steps to make it acceptable to the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton vetoed two previous welfare bills proposed by the
Republican-controlled Congress on the grounds that they were too
harsh toward the poor or linked to other legislation that he found
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Republicans say their plan would save nearly 60 billion dollars
over six years. The plan would require welfare recipients to find
jobs withing two years of joining the program and in most cases
set a five-year lifetime limit for receiving benefits.

<HEADLINE> Longo Captures Olympic Gold in Women's Road Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atlanta, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Jeannie Longo of France captured
her first Olympic gold medal in the women's individual road race
here today, realizing her dream of adding an Olympic gold to her
collection of 10 world titles.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old cyclist finished the 104.4 kilometer wet course
in two hours, 36 minutes and 13 seconds amid light rains in the
suburbs of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Imelda Chippa of Italy edged Clara Hughes of Canada by six
seconds to take the silver medal in 2:36:38 in the first Olympic
Games opened to professional cyclists.
</P>
<P>
Defending Olympic champion Kathryn Watt of Australia, who beat
Longo by 20 seconds at the Barcelona Games, finished the ninth in
2:37.06 on the slippery and treacherous road.
</P>
<P>
Longo led the first lap of the race, but she fell behind in the
third lap as Allessandra Cappellotto peddled to the front for the
lead. In the fifth lap, Longo, Chippa and Hughes charged up and
pulled away from the crowd, finishing their fifth 13.05 kilometer
circle in a few seconds more than 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Longo, who turned professional after the Barcelona Games, built
up her lead over Chippa and Hughes as she approached the final
kilometer of the race. Longo was the gold medalist at the 1995
World Cycling Championships.
</P>
<P>
Chippa, who started racing relatively late at the age of 16,
was a surprising silver medal winner at the race. She had won no
major world competitions. Her highest placing in the World
Championships is a fifth place finish in 1994 when the
championships were held in Palermo, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Hughes, silver medalist in time trial at the 1995 World
Championships, was Canada's national speedskating champion before
taking up cycling in 1990 at the age of 18. She is also a favorate
to win women's time trial on August 3 here.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Women Prone to Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Statistics produced by Zambian
police show that Zambian women are the most prone to murder.
</P>
<P>
Last year over 80 percent of the murder cases recorded were of
women, according to the statistics quoted by today's Sunday Mail.
</P>
<P>
Of the 94 murder cases recorded last year in the country with
a total population of nine million, 81 were of women.
</P>
<P>
Most of the murders of women arose from domestic disputes,
which led to the killings of wives by their husbands and
boyfriends. The domestic disputes ranged from failing to prepare
a meal to adultery and even being barren.
</P>
<P>
The commercialized bride price is also blamed for the
increasing murder. Some men think that wives are the property
they have bought so they have the right to abuse.
</P>
<P>
Various women's organizations in the country are concerned at
the rising number of killings of women.

<HEADLINE> Gore: U.S. Troops Out of Bosnia by End of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
reiterated today that the 18,000 American peace implementing
troops will be out of Bosnia by the end of the year and there are
no plans form them to participate in a future NATO peacekeeping
force in the war-torn Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe their mission will be completed by the end of this
year," Gore said in an interview with reporters of the CBS' "Face
the Nation."
</P>
<P>
"There is no successor force at this point," the vice president
stressed when asked if the United States might join such a force.
"That is hypothetical, we are not anticipating any such thing. We
believe that the mission will be completed."
</P>
<P>
There have been wide speculations that NATO will form a
multinational force to maintain the peace in Bosnia after the
current 60,000-strong NATO-led peace implementing troops withdraw
from the nation at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
During an European tour last month, U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry told reporters that he would recommend U.S.
President Bill Clinton to send the American troops to participate
in the proposed future NATO force in Bosnia if the western
military alliance decides to keep troops there.
</P>
<P>
Gore also repeated the U.S. administration's stance that the
American troops would not be asked to capture Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic so he could be sent to The Hague for trial before
the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe that U.S. troops should be assigned the
mission of going door-to-door hunting a single individual in
circumstances where it would be very difficult to complete that
mission and there would be very larger risks faced by our troops,"
he noted.

<HEADLINE> Tripartite Meeting Likely to Solve House Crisis in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 3rd day's sitting of the new parliament Sunday looked dull
in absence of the key opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) in the house. The BNP legislators walked out of the house
Thursday protesting Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury's alleged
refusal to allow them to move a motion as they wanted.
</P>
<P>
The absence of the 110 BNP MPs Sunday forced the speaker to
defer the major task of formation of some crucial parliamentary
committees until today.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad, together
with some MPs from the treasury bench, went to meet opposition BNP
leaders Sunday for half an hour and both sides agreed to hold the
tripartite meeting to ensure the smooth functioning of the house.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen after Sunday's meeting, deputy leader of the
opposition in parliament Prof. A.Q.M. Badruddoza Chowdhury said
the BNP was awaiting for the proposed meeting where the problems
in running the parliament would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The BNP wanted to help the ruling party positively for the
smooth and effective functioning of the parliament. But the
treasury bench should listen to the opposition and the speaker
should allow the BNP members to speak in the house, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday after the walkout, the BNP chairperson
Begum Khaleda Zia said that the opposition would not return to the
house session until the matter is solved.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Downplays Liquidity Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand, the
country's central bank, has denied that the Financial Institutions
Development Fund is facing liquidity difficulties and said that
the fund is sound, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fund has assets of 100 billion baht (four billion US
dollars), which is enough to meet its responsibilities in
rehabilitating financial institutions that run into trouble, said
Swangchit Jaiyawat, fund manager of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the central bank is planning to sell its holdings
in the First Bangkok City Bank to bolster the fund, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has also opened credit lines worth five
billion baht (0.2 billion US dollars) with the Government Savings
Bank and the Krung Thai Bank to provide cash for the fund's
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the fund's injection of some 25
billion baht (one billion dollars) into the debt-plagued Bangkok
Bank of Commerce has possibly drained the cash of the fund.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A new political party, the Thai
Labor Party, has been set up with a professed aim to promote and
protect workers' rights in Thailand, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The party's immediate agenda is to oppose the government's
decision to legalize and expand the use of foreign labor in the
country, said Chin Tapplee, leader of the Labor Party elected by
some 300 members at its first caucus at a hotel here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party would fight to prevent certain sectors
from being flooded with immigrants, especially the transport and
industrial sectors, in order to protect Thai laborers from
competition with foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Other policies of the party include upholding Thai workers'
welfare and voting rights and suppressing drug dealers and crime.

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge Changes in Zone Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Not all industries registered in
China's 52 State-level high and new technology development zones
deserve preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
Experts raised the proposal last week at a symposium held in
Qinhuangdao, a seaside resort in North China, on how to
industrialize high and new technology achievements, today's "China
Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
One problem plaguing the technology development zones is that
whatever they produce, enterprises have incentive policies
earmarked for the special zones within which they operate.
</P>
<P>
Many participants at the meeting noted that, unable to solicit
a large number of high-tech projects, local governments tend to
let labor-intensive projects into the zones in a bid to recoup
infrastructure spending earler.
</P>
<P>
The practice needs to be checked as it runs counter to the
initial spirit of the "torch program," -- boosting the national
economy through high and new technology, experts warned.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25 State-level zones were set up in China in 1991,
and a second batch totalling 27 zones was established in late
1992. Local governments approved more on grass-roots levels.
</P>
<P>
"We have been looking for a scheme to check projects'
credentials and starting from this year, a system will be worked
out to cover 18 select zones in the first place," said Li Linxi of
the State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
Results of the assessment will be published and zones trailing
the line run the risk of being thrown out, she said.
</P>
<P>
China's State-level high and new technology development zones
is likely to have a total production and commercial turnover of
more than 500 billion yuan (60 billion US dollars) by the year
2000, authorities predict. Whereas, the figure was 332 billion
yuan (40 billion US dollars) for the 1991-95 period.

BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A 10,000-year-old fossilized
skeleton of an extinct buffalo has been found in Zhaoyuan County
in China's northernmost Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Once the bones are reconstructed, the buffalo will measure four
meters long and approximately two meter high, according to "China
Archaeological News."
</P>
<P>
The remains were discovered at a construction site to build a
transformer near the county prison.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that all of the fossilized bones
were intact, except for the lower jaw and the sharp tips of the
horns, which were damaged by the bulldozer when it was first
working to clean the construction site.
</P>
<P>
The find will contribute to the study of the geographical
environment, climate, animals and plants, and other relevant

<HEADLINE> Tortoise the Perfect "Patient" in East China Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A hospital doctor in China has
successfully performed a life-saving operation on his most unusual
ever patient - an old tortoise.
</P>
<P>
The mountain tortoise had refused to eat anything for a
month. So a monk from Minghou county in east China's coastal
province of Fujian trekked for over 100 kilometers to take the
wrinkly tortoise to the ear-nose-throat department of the
provincial hospital.
</P>
<P>
The tortoise, with a 50-cm-long head, had refused to eat
anything for a month and was spitting blood, said the monk, who
was desperate that doctors at the hospital would save the rare
reptile.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Zhuang Jinmei, who had no experience of operating on
animals, was determined to have try his best. During a two-hour
operation the doctor retrieved a six-centimeter long fishhook
from the tortoise's stomach.
</P>
<P>
When the ailing repile quickly realized that the suffering was
over it showed its approval by moving happily across the operating
table.
</P>
<P>
Even Dr. Zhuang acknowledged that the tortoise was the perfect
patient.
</P>
<P>
"When the tortoise was brought to the operating theater, I
said, 'Extend your head. Open your mouth'. It did exactly what I
told it to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the doctor's successful operation was broadcast on a
local tv station, three more mountain tortoises were subesquently
brought to him for treatment. Three more fishhooks were retrieved
from their stomaches -- and three more tortoises were able to
continue with their slow pace of life after making full
recoveries.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-invested Enterprises in Jiangsu Surge to 31,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign-invested
enterprises in east China's Jiangsu Province has exceeded 31,000,
latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Since China implemented the strategy of developing Yangtze
River reaches in 1990, the province, which lies along the lower
reaches of the river, has become a hot spot for foreign
investment. said Shen Xiaojian, chief of foreign fund division
under the Jiangsu Foreign Trade Committee.
</P>
<P>
For several years, the amount of investment utilized by the
province topped all districts in the Yangtze River reaches, Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
Since China adjusted its policies on tariffs this year,
multinationals, large enterprises and large consortiums have
continued to inject investments in the province, she said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, 1,638 foreign-invested
enterprises were given approval, a 12 percent increase over the
first half of 1995. Pledged investments totalled 7.2 billion US
dollars, up 125 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The scale of investments has also been upgraded, with
investment in each project going up from an average three million
US dollars to 4.38 million US dollars, she said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's largest project in China, involving an investment of
80 million US dollars in the first phase of the project, has been
launched in Nantong City in the province.
</P>
<P>
Wuxi City approved 59 projects, each with an investment of more
than 10 million US dollars in the first five months.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Hitachi, Germany's Seimens and other big name firms
have set up projects in the city.
</P>
<P>
The constant improvement of the investment environment, and the
good performance of launched enterprises in Jiangsu are the main
factors attractive to large overseas investors, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, exports of joint ventures hit
2.3 billion US dollars, up 16.6 percent over the same period last
year. The proportion of exports by joint ventures among the
province's total exports has continued to increase, which has
encouraged a group of the enterprises to put in more
investment. In the first five months, 26 joint ventures in Wuxi
city added a total investment of 57 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
At present, Jiangsu is adjusting foreign investment structures,
by upgrading technology in industrial processing projects and
actively attracting more investment into energy, infrastructure,
raw materials and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Shen revealed that Jiangsu will soon publicly announce 50
major projects for the introduction of foreign investment in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000).

<HEADLINE> Iranian Children Disencouraged to Attend Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati issued an order demanding all the ministry's employees
abroad send their children to Iranian schools rather than foreign
schools in a bid to stay away from foreign culture, the Persian
daily Akhbar reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the nation's efforts to observe the Islamic
value and prevent the invasion of foreign culture, Western culture
in particular, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities have announced that they would invite
professors with foreign education background to teach in Iranian
universities rather than send their students abroad for further
education.
</P>
<P>
Velayati reportedly said that the expansion of Iranian schools
abroad is a necessity for Iran and a good platform for the
preservation and promotion of the Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if Iran is negligent about the education of the
Iranian children abroad, the second generation of the Islamic
Revolution would be kept away from their mother tongue Farsi
(Persian) language, which is also their Iranian Islamic identity.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said the loss of Iranian Islamic identity would
eventually lead to the loss of their Iranian personality.
</P>
<P>
Iran's educational system should do its best to spread the
teaching of Farsi via schools abroad, he said.

<HEADLINE> Health Care of Women, Infants Gets World Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the World
Bank will provide grants of 100 million US dollars to health care
projects for China's women and children in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The WB has agreed to lend China 90 million US dollars and the
United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) will provide 9.5 million
US dollars, today's "China Daily" quoted an official with the
Ministry of Public Health as saying.
</P>
<P>
The local governments involved will also increase their annual
budget for projects designed to further reduce mortality rates for
women and infants during pregnancy and delivery, said Wang
Fenglan, director of the Women's and Children's Health Department.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the ministry hopes to set up a
state-of-the-art national health-care service network for women
and children through expanding professional training among rural
doctors and renovating the health-care facilities that provide
basic care to women and children, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The projects are targeted at a population of 220 million in 717
counties, many in poor and remote areas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is negotiating with other international
organizations and foreign countries on co-operative projects
promoting the health of women and children, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The country has established co-operative projects with about 20
international organizations and foreign countries including
Unicef, the World Bank, UN Population Fund, World Health
Organization and the UN Development Programme.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, China received foreign grants of 27
million US dollars - a sum that was more than doubled by
local-government commitments of 320 million yuan (38 million US
dollars) -- for projects in 305 counties and 177 prefectures and
cities.
</P>
<P>
About 110,000 villages in these areas were equipped with modern
medical facilities and 360,000 township and village doctors
received professional training, while another 400,000 doctors,
midwives and nurses in obstetric departments in hospitals above
county level attended lectures on modern technology.
</P>
<P>
The country currently has departments for maternal- and
children-health courses in eight medical colleges across the
country, with more than 800 undergraduate students receiving
training now.

<HEADLINE> China to Announce Public Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China plans to make September the
month for issuing public service announcements (PSAs), according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A government award will also be given to honor outstanding
advertisements, the newspaper cited a recent report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move will help implement the law on advertisements that
took effect early last year, said the report from the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce, which oversees the
country's advertising sector.
</P>
<P>
The national PSAs spots will focus on the theme of "traditional
virtues of the Chinese nation," such as practising thrift and
showing respect and love towards the aged and young, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Along with the rapid growth of the advertising industry in
recent years, PSAs have attracted attention and aroused public
interest in such issues as ethics, environmental protection and
caring for old people, women and children.
</P>
<P>
But PSAs are still at an early stage in China and need
improvement, both in production values and in the number of issues
covered, it said.
</P>
<P>
The State has started planning themes for advertisements, such
as the September move and is asking local governments to produce
advertisements in various media including TV, radio, newspapers,
magazines and outdoor signs from September 1 to October 1, it said.
</P>
<P>
China's advertising sector enjoyed sustained growth in the past
five years, and last year's turnover was 27.33 billion yuan (3.29
billion US dollars), 10 times that of 1990.
</P>
<P>
The industry had 48,000 companies and media outlets nationwide,
with 477,000 people handling business last year.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Tightens Control over Land Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong province
has made public 15 land-use violation cases in a bid to strengthen
control over the use of its precious land.
</P>
<P>
Among offenders are enterprises and government departments at
city, township and development zone levels.
</P>
<P>
The cases involve 355 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
"By exposing offenders in these cases, we issue a serious
warning to those who have used or continue to use land illegally,"
said an official from the province's Land Administration Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Ten of these cases have been wound up. Some of the land was
confiscated, and fines were issued for remaining amount of land,
at a rate of 10 yuan (1.2 US dollars) per square meter, the China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Other cases are still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
A golf project in the city of the city of Huiyang is one of the
major cases.
</P>
<P>
The city's Planning Committee and Economic and Trade Committee
granted 101 hectares of land for a golf course, in violation of
State policy that stipulates that only governments at or above
provincial level can authorize such projects.
</P>
<P>
The province has decided to take four major measures during the
period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1966-2000) to protect its land.
</P>
<P>
First, cropland will be put under strict control, with the aim
of keeping the total area under cultivation at the present 3.3
million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Second, a system of agricultural land protection zones will be
established.
</P>
<P>
Third, no more land will be granted for industrial development
in areas where there is still large amount of unused land waiting
for construction.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, a cropland protection and reclamation fund will be
established.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to spend 250 million yuan (30 million US
dollars) on land reclamation in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
From 1985-1995, 261,000 ha of crop land was taken up by
industrial development or by the change in agricultural production
structure, representing 54.7 percent of total cropland.

<HEADLINE> China's Ties with Egypt Continue Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Enjoying excellent political
relations, China and Egypt should take measures to further improve
their economic cooperation, which to date has not grown as
expected, said Samir Borhan, Egyptian ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
The volume of import and export trade between the two nations
in recent years hovers around 460 million US dollars, the China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"This field needs much attention from State enterprises,
business people and entrepreneurs to double or treble that
figure," the Egyptian ambassador stressed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and China are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the
forging of diplomatic ties between the two countries. In 1956,
Egypt broke its diplomatic relations with Taiwan and opened its
first diplomatic misson in Beijing, which was "a step in the right
direction and paveed the way for all Arab and African countries to
follow suit," according to Samir Borhan.
</P>
<P>
Since then the relations between the two countries continued to
improve. There were exchanges of political support, official
visits on all levels, cooperation in international forums, and
frequent and fruitful exchanges in culture, education and other
fields.
</P>
<P>
To further improve economic cooperation, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in his last visit to China in 1994 suggested to the
Chinese leadership that a free zone might be opened in an Egyptian
port to serve as a launching pad for Chinese exports to markets in
the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Such a project, according to Borhan, will enhance the Chinese
exports to these flourishing markets, and will also benefit Egypt,
as new jobs and services will be created there.
</P>
<P>
Timetables are being developed, and the ministries of
international cooperation in the two countries are working to
bring about this project in the near future, said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
"Sincere efforts from both sides have been displayed to create
common objectives and to maximize the mutual and bilateral trade
between them," he said.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) - Belgium's Ulla Werbrouck took the
women's 72kg class gold while Pawel Nastula of Poland won the
men's 95kg category title at the Centennial Olympics judo
competition.
</P>
<P>
In the women's event, French judoka Estha Essombe was left
writhing on the floor with a suspected leg fracture when she was
thrown by Italy's Ylenia Scapin in the event.
</P>
<P>
Scapin took the bronze medal with the fast ippon throw and
waved to the crowds as Essombe was removed by stretcher. Team
doctors said later they suspected Essombe's leg was broken. She
was sent to hospital for further checks
</P>
<P>
The silver medal went to Japan's Yoko Tanabe, a three-time
Olympian who is bidding farewell to the games in Atlanta. Cuba's
Diadenis Luna, the 1995 world champion, shared the bronze with
Scapin.
</P>
<P>
Three-time world judo champion Pawel Nastula of Poland won the
men's gold medal in the 95kg class.
</P>
<P>
Nastula, 26, one of Europe's most consistent competitors, made
quick work of 21-year-old South Korean student Kim Min-Soo, the
1994 junior world champion. Less than two minutes into the match
he felled the younger man with a text-book ippon throw.
</P>
<P>
"The fight ended so fast I had no time to judge him," Nastula
said.
</P>
<P>
Kim reached the finals after a hard struggle against
30-year-old veteran Stephane Traineau of France, the 1991 world
champion, whose drive for the gold at the 1994 Barcelona Games
fizzled early.
</P>
<P>
Traineau shared the bronze with Brazil's Miguel Fernandes, a
gold medallist in Barcelona in the event.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Both Japan and South Korea won
their morale-enhancing openers in the soccer tournament of the
Centennial Olympic Games on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Asian champions, scored one goal to nil for a major
upset in Group D of the tournament against World Cup champions
Brazil in Miami, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Forward Teruyoshi Ito netted the winning goal in the 72nd
minute although the Japanese had to resort to their defensive
tactics against the star-studded South American squad.
</P>
<P>
Despite their dominance in the green pitch, neither of the
Brazilian World Cup stars of Bebeto, Aldair and Juninho
capitulized on their numerous chances.
</P>
<P>
A grunting Brazilian fan was arrested by four policemen when he
rushed into the pitch with 23 minutes after the scoreless first
half.
</P>
<P>
To justify their prowess, South Korea, four-time entriests in
the World Cup finals including a latest three-straight outing,
overcame their Group C first opponents of Ghana 1-0, former world
junior champions.
</P>
<P>
It was the first Olympic soccer victory since 1948 for the
Koreans who were being coached by Anatoly Bychovets, a man who led
Soviet Union to its last Olympic gold at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
A penalty by Yoon Jong-hwan in the 41st minute dealt a blow to
Ghana, the first African nation to win an Olympic soccer medal
when it took the bronze four years ago, after Choi Yoon-yeol was
fouled by Osei Kuffour within the box.
</P>
<P>
In Birmingham, Mexico also scored their victory of 1-0 against
European soccer power Italy through Francisco Palencia.
</P>
<P>
In a heat at 32-degree, Palencia fired home the late winner
with seven minutes left before the final whistle. His low kick
off a left-wing pass from Duilio Davino made Italian goalie
Gianluca Pagliuca aghast for a while.
</P>
<P>
By pulling down Italy, Mexico became the co-leader with South
Korea in the group.
</P>
<P>
In another Group D match, Nigeria, the 1994 African champions,
defeated Hungary 1-0 when Nwankwo Kanu scored in the 75th minute
in Orlando, Florida.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Hezbollah Exchange Soldiers' Remains, POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KFAR TIBNIT, Lebanon, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel today returned
the remains of 123 Hezbollah guerrillas and released 44 Shiite
Muslim prisoners of war in exchange for the remains of two Israeli
soldiers and the release of 17 South Lebanon Army (SLA) prisoners.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held in Kfar Tibnit, a village on the
Israeli-Lebanese border in the Israeli self-claimed "security
zone" in south Lebanon, Israeli officials handed over the coffins
containing the remains of the 123 guerrillas to Lebanese officials.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 Hezbollah supporters, mostly relatives of
guerrillas killed in conflicts with Israelis, attended the
ceremony, weeping and singing mournful songs.
</P>
<P>
The hand-over was supervised by delegates from the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
After the hand-over of the guerrillas' remains, 17
Israeli-sponsored South Lebanon Army (SLA) prisoners were freed by
Hezbollah (Party of God) and driven by several ICRC ambulances to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the released SLA prisoners said most of them
were not willing to return to the so-called "security zone" in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
ICRC delegates conveyed their requests to stay in the Lebanese
government-controlled areas to the SLA, the source said. But SLA
Commander Antoine Lahd turned them down flatly, saying Hezbollah
prisoners held in the Khiam Jail would not be set free if the SLA
prisoners refused to return.
</P>
<P>
In another south Lebanese town, Nabuteh, 70 kilometers south of
Beirut, Israel released 44 Shiite Muslim prisoners soon after the
remains of Israeli privates Rahamim Alsheikh and American-born
Yosef Fink arrived at Israel's Ben-Gurion airport.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis were killed in 1986 after their capture by
Hezbollah guerrillas in an ambush in south Lebanon that year.
</P>
<P>
The released 44 prisoners were greeted by about 100,000
Hezbollah supporters.
</P>
<P>
A driver, called Ali Hassan Surour, 29, told Xinhua that he and
his wife were very happy today because they had met a close friend
who had been jailed by the Israelis for 11 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Poland took the limelight of the
men's greco-roman wrestling competition here on Sunday by claiming
two gold medals at the current Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Adrzej Wronski, Olympic champion in 1988 and world champion in
1994, overpowered European champion Sergey Lishtvan of Belarus in
the 100kg category final, while Ryszard Wolny beat his rival Ghani
Yolouz of France in the 68kg class showdown.
</P>
<P>
With these two triumphs, Poland has boosted its gold medal
tally to three.
</P>
<P>
The other three golds offered today were snatched by Sim Kwon
Ho of South Korea in the 48kg class, Yuriy Melnichenko of
Kazakhstan in the 57kg category and Hamza Yerlikaya of Turkey in
the 68kg class.
</P>
<P>
Saturday was a giant-killing day when five Olympic and as many
world champions were eliminated. Four of the five American
wrestlers were elbowed out of the action, only leaving the 1995
world champion Dennis Hall in today's 57kg final.
</P>
<P>
But in today's actions, all big names won their expected
victories except the local crowd's favorite Hall.
</P>
<P>
Hall moved into the afternoon's final after a controversial win
over China's Sheng Zetian in the morning.
</P>
<P>
"Sheng should have scored points twice, if the judges were
justified enough. I knew they were under a huge pressure from the
local crowd," said the Chinese coach Zhang Wenqiu this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hall was beaten by world champion Yuriy Melnichenko of
Kazakhstan 4-1. Sheng Zetian, bronze medalist at the last
Olympics, won the third position after badly injured his left
ankle one minute into the fight.
</P>
<P>
Sim Kwon Ho, hot favorite before the final, beat Belarus'
Aleksandr Pavlov in the lightest class duel. Zafar Gulyov of
Russia took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Yerlikaya upset Germany's European champion Thomas Zander for
the 82kg title. Valeriy Tsilent of Belarus got the minor medal.

compromise, President Glafcos Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address Saturday on the 22nd anniversary of the
Turkish invasion of the island, President Clerides said "the
anniversary coincides this year with the new initiative launched
by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to
assist efforts toward a Cyprus settlement."
</P>
<P>
President Clerides stressed the need for common ground between
the two sides for direct negotiations for an overall solution to
the problem and noted that the initiative of the U.N. Security
Council permanent members is aimed at this direction.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek Cypriots are willing to negotiate if the Turkish
side is ready for a reasonable and viable compromise," the
president added.
</P>
<P>
As for the prospect of Cyprus' accession to the European Union
(EU), the president described it as a "new element to the Cyprus
problem that could act as a catalyst for its solution."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey's Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan arrived
Saturday in the Turkish-controlled northern part of the island to
take part in the annual celebrations of the Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan assured the Turkish Cypriot regime of Ankara's
continued support.
</P>
<P>
"In Cyprus there are two separate societies and two separate
states. We want peace and tranquillity. The two communities must
live in peace in their own regions," Erbakan told cheering crowds
during a military parade.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan was the first Turkish prime minister to attend such an
annual celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' President Glafcos Clerides has described Erbakan's
visit to the Turkish-controlled northern part of the island as a
"provocation that comes to emphasize that Turkey has not regretted
the crime it committed by invading the island in 1974."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and
took control of the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Relics in Potala Palace Well Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Tibet's Potala Palace, home to
thousands of exquisite cultural relics, has been well protected
over the past seven years thanks to up-to-date monitoring and
telecommunications equipment and a 24-hour alarm system.
</P>
<P>
The palace's efforts to protect its precious store of relics
have been spoken highly by experts from the State Bureau of
Cultural Relics and the United Nations Education, Scientific and
Culture Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
During a field survey of the Potala Palace, some experts from
the UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, said to the palace's
managerial staff: "the interior protection and management of the
palace is in good order, and we thank you for the contributions
you have made to the cultural heritage of the humanity, and you
can be indeed counted as the protective god of the Potala Palace."
</P>
<P>
Included on UNESCO's World Heritage List, the 2,000-room palace
contains valuable objects made of gold, silver, bronze and iron,
enamel, lacquer, bamboo carving, horns and ivory, as well as
jewels, embroidery, stone tablets, seals, coins, historical
documents, Buddhist classics and religious artifacts.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to protect these priceless pieces, the palace
erected a 60-meter long fireproof wall and installed
fire-resistant pipes and firefighting equipment. It has spent
60,000 yuan annually to update some of the equipment.
</P>
<P>
Fifty craftsmen, including carpenters, painters, stonemasons,
bricklayers and tailors, oversee the 24-hour conservation of the
relics a day.
</P>
<P>
The artisans also have made about 100 square meter of carpet,
cloth book covers for 9,000 Buddhist classics, and bookshelves
that have an space of 500 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The palace is now in the process of registering the cultural
relics. So far, about 29,000 items in five storage areas and 16
halls have been inventoried.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, more than 9,000 archives have been established and
20,000 photos taken.
</P>
<P>
Some exploratory researches on the cultural relics have been
conducted and enhanced in recent years. Tangpo, Thubdun and other
scholars are working to help categorize the Buddhist classics. To
date, more than 25,000 volumes of Buddhist sutras belonging to a
branch of Tibetan Buddhism have been sorted out.

<HEADLINE> Textile Firms Should Cut Production: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Textile enterprises should comply
with market demand and cut excess production capacity o alleviate
the situation in the ailing industry, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Firms should stop making products that do not fit the market
demand, and develop those with potential instead, the daily quoted
Wu Wenying, chairman of the China National Textile Council, as
saying at a recent industry conference.
</P>
<P>
Textile firms in China have suffered from a shortage of capital
due to overstock of unmarketable products in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Wu cited a township enterprise, Zhejiang Fansheng Group, as a
good example which has prospered by making yarn-dyed fabrics
currently popular in the market.
</P>
<P>
She also called on enterprises to make finished products with
high added value, which will sharpen their competitive edge in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Textile exports stood at $12 billion in the first five months
of this year, dropping by nearly 16 percent from last year due to
rising costs and strong competition from other developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the difficult situation has forced the textile
industry to cut excess capacity of primary products and move some
textile firms from the downtown city to suburban and cotton
planing areas, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 million cotton spindles will be eliminated from textile
factories in major cities over the next several years, she said.
</P>
<P>
With textile production transferred to outlying areas and major
cotton planting provinces like Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
the major textile cities such as Shanghai, Qingdao and Dalian can
focus on developing technology-intensive products with high added
value.
</P>
<P>
While special policies will be given to support large
enterprises, which take up only 1.5 percent of the nation's 50,000
textile firms, more methods will be introduced to save medium- and
small-sized firms, such as leasing, purchasing, annexing and
setting up share-holding companies, Wu said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Grant 293.4 Million Dollars to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) will extend a total of 293.4
million U.S. dollars in grant and technical assistance to Egypt to
support the country's development and economic growth in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker, Egyptian Minister of
Economy Nawal el-Tatawi and Minister of State for Scientific
Research Venus Gouda signed here today three agreements for the
grant.
</P>
<P>
Under the first agreement, the USAID will extend approximately
13.4 million dollars in technical assistance to expand and enhance
technologies available to Egypt's privately-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
The second agreement was signed for granting 200 million
dollars to help Egypt's privately-owned companies import equipment
and materials from the United States. The agreement is part of
the Private Sector Commodity Import Program (PRCIP), which started
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The USAID will also release 80 million dollars to support
Egypt's economic reform program under the third agreement.
</P>
<P>
Walker said at the signing ceremony that since 1992 the U.S.
government had granted 380 million dollars to support Egypt's
economic reform, which began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He added that the implementation of the economic reform program
is encouraging more U.S. businessmen to invest in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Lauding the U.S.-Egyptian economic relationship, Walker said,
"I believe these agreements demonstrate the commitment of both
governments to advancing even further our joint business
relationship."
</P>
<P>
"Assistance to the private sector will foster business
cooperation with the U.S. and provide the growth envisioned by
President (Hosni) Mubarak to assist job creation here in Egypt,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Van Almsick Beaten in Women's 200m Freestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- World record holder in the women's
200-meter freestyle event Franziska Van Almsick of Germany was
beaten in her speciality by Costa Rica's Claudia Poll here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Claudia, 23, a student in the American International University
who is competing in her first Olympic Games, came from behind to
surpass her more fancied German opponent after 100 meters and held
on the edge to clock a time of 1:58.16 for the laurel, followed by
the German at 1:58.57.
</P>
<P>
Another German swimmer Dagmar Hase came in third at 1:59.56.
</P>
<P>
Van Almsick, Germany's "golden girl", who made a big splash at
the Barcelona swimming pool four years ago with two silvers and
two bronzes when she was just 14 years old, failed to fulfill her
Olympic gold dream.
</P>
<P>
The world record holder Van Almsick, who also scored the year's
best time at the Olympic Trials in May, felt somewhat disappointed
by the results.
</P>
<P>
"I just expected too much of myself," the top German swimmer
said, "To be in top form for four years is not easy for me, I just
feel exhausted."
</P>
<P>
But she said she would not quit, at least at the moment. Asked
if she would participate in the next Olympics, she said: "I still
have time to consider it. "
</P>
<P>
The men's 400-meter individual medley witnessed a
stroke-to-stroke all-American duel between Tom Dolan and Eric
Namesnik.
</P>
<P>
The two exchanged the lead for several times before Tom Dolan
chalked up the first Olympic title for the U.S in the pool.
</P>
<P>
Dolan scored a winning time of 4:14.90 to edge his fellow
teammate Namesnik into the silver. But the time was far from his
world mark of 4:12.30 set at the Rome World Championships in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Namesnik was second at 4:15.25, followed by Canada's Curtis
Myden, who won the bronze with a new national record of 4:16.28.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Penelope Heyns, the fresh world mark setter this
morning, easily grabbed the crown in the women's 100m breaststroke
with a winning time of 1:07.73, 0.71 seconds off her new world
record.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old American gial Amanda Beard had to settle for
the silver with 1:08.09, with Australia's Samanthy Riley in the
third place at 1:09.18.
</P>
<P>
The United States claimed the title of the men's 4X200
freestyle relay at 7:14.84, ahead of Sweden and Germany.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian Michael Diamond beat a
strong field including world champions and world record holder in
the men's trap event, while Russian Olga Klochneva dethroned
teammate Marina Logvinenko in the women's air pistol at the
Olympic Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Diamond scored 124 hits out of a perfect 125 and never missed a
shot in the 25-target final to win Australia's first gold medal in
the Games.
</P>
<P>
Americans Josh Lakotos and Lance Bade were deadlocked at 147
hits after the final. Lakotos won the silver after Bade missed
the 28th target in the shoot-off.
</P>
<P>
Italians, tipped sure bets on the title before the competition,
even failed to make top 10.
</P>
<P>
Reigning world champion scored a poor 120 hits to finish a
joint 13th, while Marco Venturini, three times world champions and
World Cup Finals winner twice in 1994 and 1995, and Marcello
Titarelli, who set new world record of 125 and world final mark of
150 last month, finished among 13 shooters who shared the 20th
place.
</P>
<P>
In the women's air pistol final, Klochneva garnered 490.1
points to finish first, beating Logvinenko by 1.6 points.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think anything during the final, that was why I got
gold," Klochneva said through interpreter.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Logvinenko, who came first in the qualification
round with a new Olympic record of 390 points, hit an unimpressive
9.7 points twice in the first two shots and never had a chance to
catch up with her leading teammate.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Mariya Grozdeva, who picked up a bronze medal in the
Barcelona Games, tied with Logvinenko in the final with 389
points.
</P>
<P>
She finished third again after losing the shoot-off with 9.9
points against Logvinenko's 10.1.
</P>
<P>
Grozdeva, who had jumped to first after the first two shots,
said she got really nervous as the final went on.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavian Jasna Sekaric fell two notches down from her second
place in Barcelona after collecting 384 points.

<HEADLINE> China Beat Sweden 2-0 in Women's Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China scored their first victory
in the Olympic women's soccer tournament, beating their old rivals
Sweden 2-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two teams met in the first women's World Cup in Guangzhou
in 1991 when Sweden stopped hosts China from entering the last
four. But in last year's women's World Cup held in Sweden, China
took revenge by beating Sweden in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's match is the third encounter between the two teams at
major international competitions, the Chinese team took an upper
hand over their Swedish opponents.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team kept up most of the pressure on the Swedish
rivals but their efforts were time and again turned down by the
brave Swedish goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese team finally broke the deadlock at the 30th
minute when Shi Guihong beat the Swedish goal-keeper from the
right side.
</P>
<P>
Only two minutes later, Zhao Lihong consolidated China's
victory by making it 2-0 as she dribbled across the center of the
penalty box and volleyed from the left side into the upper right
corner.
</P>
<P>
In a other match played on Sunday, hosts the United States
trounced Denmark 3-0.
</P>
<P>
The American team had all the advantage over Denmark but failed
to score until later in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Tisha Venturini opened the scoring while 5 minutes later Mia
Hamm scored the second of the match to give the host team a 2-0
half time lead.
</P>
<P>
The third goal came four minutes into the second half when
Tiffeny Milbrett beat the Danish goal-keeper to wrap up the game.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Strikes Weightlifting Olympic Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese hercules Tang Lingsheng
claimed the men's 59kg class gold medal with a world record
performance in the Centennial Olympic Games weightlifting
competition here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese lifter, who was born on January 1, 1971, lifted
137.5kg in snatch and 170 in jerk, totalling 307.5kg for the gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
His result surpassed the world mark of 305kg set by Nikolai
Peshalov of Bulgaria on November 13, 1993. On his way for the gold
medal, Tang also equalled the world clean and jerk record of
170kg, also set by Peshalov last year.
</P>
<P>
This is the first gold medal for China in the Olympic
weightlifting competition in 12 years. At the 1984 Los Angeles
Olympics, the Chinese won two gold medals in lighter categories.
</P>
<P>
Leonidas Sabanis of Greece was second, registering 137.5kg in
snatch and 167.5kg in jerk for a total of 305kg.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Peshalov finished third with 302.5kg,
137.5kg in snatch and 165kg in jerk.
</P>
<P>
The 1.60-meter Chinese strongman was born in the scenic city of
Guilin in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. He began his
weightlifting career at the age of 15 and finished third at the
1993 world championships in Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
As a promising star in the Chinese national squad, he won his
first major title in 1995 at the Asian championships in Pusan,
South korea.
</P>
<P>
However, he suffered a defeat at the world championships in
Guangzhou, Guangdong province late in the year by finishing a
disappointed sixth place.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the Atlanta Olympics, Tang went to Japan
last April and retained his title at the Asian championships in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so excited that I can not put it in words," said Tang
after his victory. "My trip here means a lot for me and also for
the team."
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Yang Hanxiong said: "when he lifted 170kg in
jerk, we were very satisfied as he passed his personal best in
training."
</P>
<P>
Tang, a soccer enthusiast, lifted six weights in a row on his
way to strike the gold.
</P>
<P>
"This is a breakthrough," Yang said. "It indicates that our
training program catches up the pace with the traditionally strong
European countries."

in 2 hours 36 minutes and 13 seconds amid light rains in the
suburbs of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"I hate the rain because it's slippery and dangerous, but it
made the race faster," Longo said.
</P>
<P>
Imelda Chiappa of Italy edged Clara Hughes of Canada by six
seconds to take the silver medal in 2 hours 36 minutes and 38
seconds in the Centennial Olympic Games wherein professional
cyclists make their debut.
</P>
<P>
"I suffered from coughs and cramps - unfortunately, that's the
way it went," Chiappa said. "The rain complicated the situation a
little."
</P>
<P>
Olympic defending champion Kathryn Watt of Australia, who beat
Longo by 20 seconds at the Barcelona Games, finished ninth in
2:37.06 on the slippery and treacherous course.
</P>
<P>
Longo led the first lap but fell behind in the third as
Allessandra Cappellotto peddled to the front. In the fifth lap,
the trio of Longo, Chiappa and Hughes fired up to break away from
the crowd, finishing their fifth 13.05-kilometer lap in a few
seconds more than 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Longo, who turned professional after the Barcelona Games, built
up her lead over Chiappa and Hughes as she approached the final
kilometer of the race.
</P>
<P>
The French cyclist first launched her bid for an Olympic gold
medal in 1984 when the Los Angeles Games allowed women cyclists to
compete in road races for the first time in the Olympic history.
But she finished sixth after a collision with Italian rider Maria
Canins. She had to walk across the line with a broken deralleur.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, she went to Seoul for the 25th Olympic Games. But she
overextended herself while launching an attack with six kilometers
left to catch American Inga Thompson and eventually dropped to
21st. In 1992, Longo said, she did not know Australian Kathryn
Watt was up the road by at least a kilometer and when she crossed
the line she thought she was the winner, but in fact she was the
second.
</P>
<P>
"I could say I lost the gold medal" in Barcelona, she said
after finally getting the gold medal today.
</P>
<P>
Chiappa, who started racing relatively late at the age of 16,
was a surprising silver medalist.
</P>
<P>
The Italian cyclist had won no major world competitions with
her highest fifth place set in the World Championships in Palermo,
Italy in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Hughes, silver medalist in the time trial at the 1995 World
Championships, was Canada's national speedskating champion before
taking up cycling in 1990 at the age of 18. She is also a
favorate to win the women's time trial on August 3 here.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- France and Russia split the two
fencing gold medals on the second day of competition at the
Centennial Olympic Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Former dancer Laura Flessel waltzed to victory in the inaugural
women's Olympic epee competition while Russian Stanislav
Pozdnyakov pocketed the men's individual sabre title.
</P>
<P>
The Guadeloupe-born 24-year-old -- nicknamed "the Wasp" because
of her all-action style and ability to attack from all angles --
got the better of compatriot Valerie Barlois 15-12 to take the
title. The bronze went to Gyorgyi Horvathne-Szalay of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Flessel and Barlois' success Damien Touya
completed the set for France, with a bronze in the men's sabre.
</P>
<P>
Pozdnyakov took the gold ahead of teammate Sergei Sharikov,
winning 15-12.
</P>
<P>
Flessel's victory also completed an individual set of medals
for the 24-year-old, after she won an individual bronze and team
silver in her debut in last year's world championships in the
Hague.
</P>
<P>
"Now I hope I can team up with Valerie to win the team gold,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Flessel abandonned dancing for fencing after watching France's
Jean-Francois Lamour, who won the Olympic sabre gold in 1984 and
1988, on television.

<HEADLINE> Russia Takes Lead After Women's Compulsory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia took a lead by registering
193.796 points after the compulsory rotations when the Olympic
women's gymnastics tournament started on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Trailing behind the hosts United States after three rotations,
the Russians took over the lead by scoring 48.674 points on
vaulting horse, a mere 0.013 points more than the Americans.
</P>
<P>
In the thrid and fourth places of the 12-team standings were
world champion Romania and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Current world all-around champion Lilia Podkopayeva headed the
individual standing with 39.149, followed by Barcelona Olympic
silver medallist Shannon Miller of the United States in 39.061.
</P>
<P>
The third individual place went to another American, Dominique
Moceanu, in 38.824.
</P>
<P>
Title favorite China crashed down to the fifth after their
world champions Kui Yuanyuan dropped down from the beam and Mo
Huilan had a flew on the uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
China's Liu Xuan also fell down on the uneven bars and the
three mistakes totally costed the Chinese team 1.300 points.
</P>
<P>
Mo Huilan, who had led the individual stangings after the
compulsories at last year's world championships in Sabae of Japan,
once again dimed her chance to enter the individual finals on the
uneven bars, one of her favorite and strongest apparatus.
</P>
<P>
"Our grils seemed too nervous and didn't show their best forms
on their best apparatus," said Chinese head coach Qian Kui,"And
they also made too many unexpected mistakes."
</P>
<P>
The women's team gold medal is likely to end up among the top
three teams from the compulsories since all of them are strong in
the optional exercises.
</P>
<P>
"Russia, U.S. and current world champion Romania are
traditionally strong in the team event," said Qian, "And with a
fifth place from the compulsories, the best result for China could
be a fourth place, but it's not easy."
</P>
<P>
The team title will be dicided by the combined scores of both
optionals and compulsory performance, a long time fixed rotations
which appear in the Olympics for the last time.
</P>
<P>
The optionals for men's team competition will be held on
Monday while the same rotations for the women's is scheduled on
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy came from a halftime deficit
to outplay China 62-53 in the opening day of the Olympic Games

the world championship preliminaries two years ago, trailed 27-36
at the halftime.

<HEADLINE> Rare Red Wolves Attack Cattle in Central Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Over 20 red wolves, believed to be
the last of their species living in Vietnam, have been blamed for
the death of about 300 head of cattle and buffaloes in the western
mountainous area of the central province of Quang Tri, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fir-colored wolves, named "cuonalpinus", were listed in the
World Wildlife Fund's Red Book because they face global
extinction, said the sources of the National Ecological Resource
Center.
</P>
<P>
Only a single wolf has been killed by local residents in recent
years after falling into a trap set by wild boar hunters.
</P>
<P>
A local hunter said there were about three packs of wolves
within the area, each pack containing seven to eight wolves.
</P>
<P>
He said he had witnessed spectacular raids on cattle by the red
wolf packs.
</P>
<P>
Local residents count their herds once a week or once a month,
providing an easy food source for the wolves.
</P>
<P>
The wolves appear to feel safe in the area, which might be a
possible explanation for their increasingly aggressive behavior.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts to Study Xia, Shang Dynasties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts are to study
major sites from the Xia (21-16th Century BC) and Shang (16-11th
Century BC) dynasties, to help set up an accurate chronicle of the
period.
</P>
<P>
The lack of historical records and chronology of the two
dynasties has long been a difficult problem for Chinese
archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologist An Jinhuai, 75, leader of the project, says that
archaeological findings made in the past decades have offered a
chance to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
Since 1950s, a number of sites dating from the two dynasties
have been unearthed, including the Erlitou Site in the capital of
central China's Henan province, which was from the Xia Dynasty,
and the Gucheng Site in Yuanqu, in north China's Shanxi Province,
which was from the early stage of Shang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers, historians and scientists from other related
subjects are also involved in the cross-subject project, which has
drawn an investment of 30 million yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Taiyuan, capital of north China's
Shanxi Province, has launched a clean-up drive to wipe out
pornography at karaoke houses.
</P>
<P>
The number of karaoke houses in the city has soared to 3,000,
with supply outnumbering the demand, claim officials. They say
that some owners have switched to offering pornographic services,
which pollute local culture and undermine social order.
</P>
<P>
The clean-up campaign in the city, with a five million
population, is aimed at fighting and clearing up pornographic
services, and punishing people running illegal services.
</P>
<P>
Karaoke houses located in eight downtown streets will be closed
or shifted to other businesses by August 15, and no more such
houses will be permitted to operate.
</P>
<P>
And the remaining karaoke houses will be required to have at
least 40 square meters, and those with VIP rooms must have no less
than 80 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The Taiyuan drive is part of a nationwide endeavor to fight
pornographic services. Other cities have already started similar
clean-ups on game halls and disco houses.

<HEADLINE> Israel Hands over Remains of Hezbollah Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KFAR TIBNIT, Lebanon, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel returned 123
bodies of dead Hezbollah guerrillas today in exchange for the
corpses of two Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The trucks carrying the bodies of dead guerrillas arrived at
the Kfar Tibnit village at 5:15 p.m. (14:15 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Kfar Tibnit is situated on the Israeli-Lebanese border in the
Israeli self-claimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Upon the arrival of the convoy, more than 200 supporters of
Hezbollah (Party of God) converged in front of the trucks and led
the convoy to the center of the village. Holding high Hezbollah's
yellow flags, the supporters patted their chests with their hands
as they marched, shouting militant slogans.
</P>
<P>
As the convoy arrived at the square at the center of the
village, more than 5,000 people surrounding the square wept and
sang mournful songs.
</P>
<P>
The trucks lined up at the square, and the hand-over ceremony
began with International Committee of the Red Cross delegates and
Lebanonese officials checking and counting the corpses. The square
was surrounded by Hezbollah's yellow flags, which flew in a
breeze.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Red Cross delegates and local residents, present on
the occasion were mostly relatives of the guerrillas who died in
the struggle against Israelis. Hezbollah supporters draped each
coffin with a Hezbollah flag and put flowers on its top.
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged man told Xinhua that four of his sons died in
military operations against Israel in south Lebanon in 1987.
</P>
<P>
After the hand-over ceremony, the 123 bodies were carried to
southern Beirut and buried there.
</P>
<P>
Along with the hand-over of guerrilla remains, several
ambulances of the International Committee of the Red Cross
carrying 17 Israeli-sponsored South Lebanon Army (SLA) prisoners
headed for Israel.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the hand-over of corpses, events took
an unexpected turn in swapping prisoners.
</P>
<P>
According to a source close to the SLA prisoners released by
Hezbollah, most of the prisoners were not willing to return to the
Israeli self-styled "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross has informed the
SLA of the prisoners' request. But SLA Commander Antoine Lahd said
that if the SLA prisoners did not return, he would not release the
guerrilla prisoners detained in the Khiam Jail.
</P>
<P>
The source said the Red Cross undertook negotiations on this
matter. When the reporters contacted Red Cross delegates, they
declined to make comments and barred the reporters from talking
with SLA prisoners.
</P>
<P>
An SLA prisoner told the reporters on the quiet that he did not
want to return to the "security zone" because he had no contact
with his family for long and known nothing about his family
members.
</P>
<P>
The ambulances carrying the SLA prisoners then parked on the
road outside the Kfar Tibmit village.
</P>
<P>
After the mediation by the International Committee of the Red
Cross and the German side, the problem was solved.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the prisoners should personally put forward
their requests to the Headquarters of the SLA before they are
allowed to stay in the Lebanese government-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
At 7:20 p.m. (16:20 GMT), six ambulances carrying the prisoners
drove to the "security zone" and some minutes later they were all
sent back to the village on board the ambulances.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the first group of 19 guerrilla prisoners left the
"security zone." And the second group of 25 guerrilla prisoners
was expected to be released soon. One guerrilla prisoner has been
allowed to remain in the "security zone" on his own accord.
</P>
<P>
The release of prisoners in south Lebanon began after the
remains of Israeli privates Rahamim Alsheikh and American-born
Yosef Fink, who died after their capture by Hezbollah guerrillas
in a 1986 south Lebanon ambush, arrived at Israel's Ben-Gurion
airport.
</P>
<P>
In the south Lebanon town of Nabuteh, 70 kilometers south of
Beirut, about 100,000 Hezbollah supporters turned the ceremony of
Israel releasing 44 Shiite Moslem prisoners into a
festival. Streamers bearing Hezbollah's militant slogans hung on
tall buildings along the main streets.
</P>
<P>
As the first ambulance carrying Hezbollah prisoners arrived at
the town at 8:30 p.m. (17:30 GMT), the welcoming crowd chanted
slogans and surged toward the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
People from the crowd vied with each other in shaking hands
with the released prisoners, with smiles as well as tears on
everyone's face.
</P>
<P>
A driver, called Ali Hassan Surour, 29, and his wife stood
beside the road. He told Xinhua that they could not get near the
ambulance because it was too crowded. But they were very happy
because they had seen a close friend who had been jailed by
Israels for 11 years.

compromise, President Glafcos Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address Saturday on the 22nd anniversary of the
Turkish invasion of the island, President Clerides said "the
anniversary coincides this year with the new initiative launched
by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to
assist efforts toward a Cyprus settlement."
</P>
<P>
President Clerides stressed the need for common ground between
the two sides for direct negotiations for an overall solution to
the problem and noted that the initiative of the U.N. Security
Council permanent members is aimed at this direction.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek Cypriots are willing to negotiate if the Turkish
side is ready for a reasonable and viable compromise," the
president added.
</P>
<P>
As for the prospect of Cyprus' accession to the European Union
(EU), the president described it as a "new element to the Cyprus
problem that could act as a catalyst for its solution."
</P>
<P>
"It is now up to the Turkish side to take the necessary steps,
if it wishes for Turkish Cypriots to benefit from the EU," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey's Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan arrived
Saturday in the Turkish-controlled northern part of the island to
take part in the annual celebrations of the Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan assured the Turkish Cypriot regime of Ankara's
continued support.
</P>
<P>
"In Cyprus there are two separate societies and two separate
states. We want peace and tranquillity. The two communities must
live in peace in their own regions," Erbakan told cheering crowds
during a military parade.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan was the first Turkish prime minister to attend such an
annual celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' President Glafcos Clerides has described Erbakan's
visit to the Turkish-controlled northern part of the island as a
"provocation that comes to emphasize that Turkey has not regretted
the crime it committed by invading the island in 1974."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and
took control of the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup by Greed Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Children not Allowed to Attend Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati issued an order demanding all the ministry's employees
abroad to send their children to Iranian schools rather than
foreign schools in a bid to stay away from foreign culture, the
Persian daily Akhbar reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the nation's efforts to observe the Islamic
value and prevent the invasion of foreign culture, Western culture
in particular, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities have announced that they would invite
professors with foreign education background to teach in Iranian
universities rather than send their students abroad for further
education.
</P>
<P>
Velayati was reportedly said that the expansion of Iranian
schools abroad is a necessity for the Iran and a good platform for
the preservation and promotion of the Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if Iran is negligent about the education of the
Iranian children abroad, the second generation of the Islamic
Revolution would be kept away from their mother tongue Farsi
(Persian) language, which is also their Iranian Islamic identity.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said the loss of Iranian Islamic identity would
eventually lead to the loss of their Iranian personality.
</P>
<P>
Iran's educational system should do its best to spread the
teaching of Farsi via schools abroad, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses US of Hindering Implementation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice-President Taha Yassin
Ramadan today accused the United States of hampering the
implementation of the oil-for-food deal signed between Iraq and
the U.N. in May.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, the vice-president was
quoted as saying that the U.S. is the only country among the 15
members of the U.N. Security Council that deliberately obstructed
the implementation of the last steps of the memorandum of the
U.N. understanding on Iraq's partial oil export for urgently
needed food and medicine for its people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. government hampered the issuance of a
draft of measures to implement the memorandum which was finalized
two weeks ago by the U.N. sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen members of the U.N. sanctions committee have accepted
the formulation of the draft but it was refused by America, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has appreciated the endorsement of the food distribution
plan by U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali but
repeatedly blamed the U.S. for its impeding the quick
implementation of the oil-for-food deal, which allows Iraq to sell
2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to pay for
food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. trade sanctions for nearly six years
following its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.

<HEADLINE> Ciller Reelected As Turkey's DYP Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller was reelected here today as
Chairwoman of the center-right True Path Party (DYP) at the 5th
DYP Grand Congress held this morning.
</P>
<P>
Ciller was elected as the DYP leader by 1,095 out of 1,208
delegates participating in the congress.
</P>
<P>
Despite the expected "symbolic" candidacy of two politicians,
Ciller entered the leadership race virtually unchallenged since
her chief adversaries quit over her coalition with the pro-Islamic
Welfare Party (RP) led by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Ciller's U-turn after months of abuse she heaped on the RP has
already resulted in the resignation of 16 deputies.
</P>
<P>
Ending a long-term coalition partnership with social democrats
last year, but disappointed with December 24 election results that
catapulted the RP to the fore, Ciller broke up with rival
center-right Motherland Party (ANAP) in May when its leader,
former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, backed the corruption charges
against her.
</P>
<P>
Although her leadership remains unchallenged, Ciller now has
to cope with a last-minute rebellion from the party's provincial
politicians who seek to shape the DYP's governing bodies in line
with their preferences.
</P>
<P>
Many have reportedly threatened to quit if overruled, raising
the specter of further cracks.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Safe and Sound Despite Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Torrential floods and downpours
sweeping China's Yangtze River areas have not caused any damage at
the gigantic Three Gorges dam project, which is well under way.
</P>
<P>
During one recent five-day spell the amount of rainfall at the
dam site reached 184.9 mm, equal to the average amount for the
whole of each July since 1993, when the project was launched.
</P>
<P>
Following that five-day lashing the dam site experienced
another two torrential rainstorms. The intensity of downpours in
the local area has been one of the three worst in 47 years since
new China was founded.
</P>
<P>
With so much rain, water levels in the Yangtze River rose very
rapidly, and the Yangtze section at the dam site has seen two
flood peaks this month.
</P>
<P>
The country has insured the project for 4.5 billion yuan (about
542 million US dollars) with the People's Insurance Company of
China (PICC).
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ensure the safety of the project, Wei Lucong,
president of the Wuhan branch of the PICC, has led experts to the
dam site, checking flood-control methods, in co-operation with the
China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation
(CTGPC), the undertaker of the project.
</P>
<P>
Major structures at the permanent shiplock, the stage-one
cofferdam, sand stone system, and the highway linking the dam site
with the outside, have been found to be safe and sound. No
compensation has so far been sought from PICC.

The number of international tourists who have visited the area
has increased 40 percent annually, reaching 125,000 by 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Chongqing, Fuling, Wanxian and Yichang cities, 36
good-quality hotels have been built to accommodate foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen's Investment Zone Growing Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xiamen, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen's booming investment zone,
one of China's five special economic zones, reported a 100-percent
growth rate this year making it a new attraction for overseas
capital.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, the Haicang Investment
Zone, which has an area of just 100 square meters, approved 14
overseas-funded projects involving more than 100 million US
dollars, double the figures for projects and their investment
during the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The zone was initially approved by the State Council as a
special investment park for Taiwanese businesses. Since the
beginning of the year, it has opened its door to capitals from
other overseas regions.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Taiwan, more than 10 foreign countries including
Singapore, the United States, Malaysia, Netherlands, Austria,
Britain and Japan have opened businesses in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that by the end of June, more than 50
industrial projects, with a total value of one billion US dollars,
were granted by the zone's administration. Of those, 19 projects
are now in operation, and reported output values totaling 1.37
billion US dollars during the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
Zou Pinzhu, a member of the Haicang Investment Zone's
management committee, attributed the rapid growth to the zone's
advantages of infrastructure construction and general investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the local government spent 3.4 billion yuan
on a number of infrastructure projects including highways, a power
plant, a water-supply system, telecommunications projects as well
as ports.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the low cost of land leasing, which is regarded
as the major attraction for overseas investors, the approval
procedure has been further simplified since the early this year,
according to Zou.

<HEADLINE> China to blacken "Red Flag" limousine with its own paint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed
a fine carbon black which will enable the country's automobile
manufacturers to use home-made black pigment to paint China-built
limousines such as "Red Flag" and "Audi", instead of using
imported black paint.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, since China produced its first
"Red Flag" limousine in 1960s, its automobile industry had been
importing black paint for the model, posing a major handicap for
the localization of the country's car industry.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the National Engineering Research Center of
Natural Gas under the Chinese Academy of Sciences have produced
carbon black successfully by placing natural gas inside a plasma
reactor, separating it under temperatures between 3,000 to 10,000
degrees Celsius, and cooling it immediately.
</P>
<P>
"The pigment is blacker than that imported from the United
States," researchers at the center reported.
</P>
<P>
Since the technological processes of plasma technology is
simple and requires only a small amount of equipment and factory
space, researchers held that the new technology has pointed a way
in the application of natural gas in the oil and natural gas
fields in China's remote areas.
</P>
<P>
The research center now has an annual production capacity of 50
tons of the pigment. The Chinese Academy of Sciences said that it
would held speed up the industrialization of the new technology in
an effort to localize the car industry, and particularly, the
production of raw materials for black paint.

Since the launching of project five years ago, local water
supply and environmental protection departments have taken strict
measures to ensure the hygiene of the drinking water for
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
They have removed pollution sources around a water well, the
water source, and set up a protection zone by erecting a wire mesh
screen 200 meters away from the well. The hygienic conditions in
an area with a radius of 100 meters from the wire meshes are
constantly guarded. A strict water disinfection system has also

reported "the New Vision" paper today.
</P>
<P>
Richard Owora Othieno, principle public relations officer of

72.1 percent of the country's connections and a telephone density
of 3.18 telephone lines per 100 residents.
</P>
<P>
Othieno disclosed that the project to fix another 10,000

<HEADLINE> Hunting Ban Declared in Traditional Hunting Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Genhe city in the hinterland of
China's largest forest area has declared a five-year hunting ban
in the city covering about 20,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The ban, excluding a national minority folks' township
inhabited by the Ewenki ethnic group, has been issued by the city
in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to protect endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
The city is located in the northern part of Greater Hingan
Mountain, the country's leading timber producing area.
</P>
<P>
With rich forest and wildlife resources, the Greater Hingan
forest areas under the management of the Ministry of Forestry
covers 84,000 sq km, including part of Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region and Heilongjiang province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Oroqen Autonomous Banner (or county)
Inner Mongolia, densely populated by Oroqen ethnic group,
announced a five-year hunting ban.
</P>
<P>
Hunting has been the source of income and food for the Oroqen
ethnic people group.
</P>
<P>
The ban has been popular among the multi-ethnic people in the
banner, the China Forestry News reported.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale logging and development over the past few decades
has caused unfavorable damage to biological environment in the
Inner Mongolia part of the Greater Hingan Mountains, including
reduction in forest resources and a drastic decrease in wildlife
resources, with some wild animals taken to the brink of
extinction.

<HEADLINE> &AMP;0                      Continue Bloody Battle At Mulaitivu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Tamil rebels are
fighting all out at a northeastern military base as their major
bid for revenge of earlier defeats entered the fifth day and
turned out to be the bloodiest battle in the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
In an statement last night, the government admitted that 340
soldiers and 400 rebels were killed while over 200 soldiers were
injured in fighting at Mullaitivu base, some 280 kilometers from
Colombo on the northeast coast of the country.
</P>
<P>
The military said that one of the two commanders at the base,
Col. Aslam Fazly Laphir, was killed in action while the other,
Lieut. Col. Raj Wijesiri, was injured.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, claiming a much higher toll on the government side,
offered to return 500 bodies of dead soldiers through the
International Commission of the Red Cross and have already
returned 55.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 Tamil rebels have reportedly penetrated both the
northern and southern front lines of the 1,000-strong military
installation at the base, which has come under heavy mortar and
rocket fires.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the rebels' Sea Tigers attacked the base from
the sea. Two rebel suicide launches rammed into a navy gunboat
"Ranaveera" and destroyed it together with the 30 men aboard last
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Signs of an early end to the fighting seem to be invisible as
the military, determined to get back at the rebels, is landing
hundreds of reinforcing troops daily in the area by both air and
sea.
</P>
<P>
The reinforcements, failing to get in touch with the
beleaguered camp, are struggling to inch their way towards the
camp amidst stubborn rebel resistance and heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
The government has insisted that the base is still in the hands
of the army but the rebels claimed that they have overrun the camp
and seized large quantities of arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here described the Tamil assault on Mullaitivu as a
major set back, both militarily and psychologically, to the
government troops who were under the euphoria of their recent
victory on Jaffna peninsula, the heartland of the Tamil rebels.

<HEADLINE> No New Tobacco Joint Ventures in China: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has decided
not to approve the establishment of any foreign-funded enterprises
in the tobacco industry in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau said that China will not
launch any new Sino-foreign joint ventures in production of
cigarettes and filters, as well as tobacco processing, during the
state's Ninth Five-year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
But the industry will continue to conduct technological
cooperation with foreign manufacturers, bureau officials said.
</P>
<P>
The decision has been made in accordance with the fact that
supply and demand has been basically balanced on domestic market,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Annual production of cigarettes is expected to be 36.5 million
cases by the year 2000, an increase of just 5.1 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government will focus on rectifying the order of the
tobacco market and curbing illegal operations in the industry,
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Equitise 200 Enterprises by 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government is
scheduled to equitise some 200 state enterprises by the end of
1997, Vietnam News Agency quoted an official as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean privatisation, said Nguyen Duy Tuoc,
Deputy General Director of the General Department for Management
of State Property.
</P>
<P>
The central steering board on equitisation is considering
applications for equitisation at 40 more businesses in addition to
eight enterprises which have been turned into joint stock
companies in the country with six in Ho Chi Minh city having total
shares paid for some 15 million U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
A list of another 50 companies applying for equitisation has
been finalised by the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee for
submission to the steering board for approval.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 4,300 of the existing 6,300 state
enterprises are qualified for equitisation.
</P>
<P>
The conversion of state enterprises into joint stock companies
aims to make business management more effective, mobilise more
investment capital for development, and readjust structure of
state enterprises, the deputy general director said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that equitisation does not mean privatisation,
adding that proceeds from share sales are to be re-invested in
expanding production so as to make more property for the state.
</P>
<P>
Employees of equitised enterprises will be entitled to buy 40
per cent of the total shares, while the state will hold 51 per
cent and the rest will be sold to other sectors, including
foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Home of Ancient Herbalist Becomes Hot Tourist Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Tourists viewing Xi'an's famous
terracotta warriors can now trace the footsteps of one of China's
most famous herbal doctors.
</P>
<P>
A new attraction has been provided in the area - the old
residence of Sun Simiao(581-682), the renowned ancient herbalist.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "King of Chinese herbal medicine", Sun Simiao of
the Sui(581-618) and the Tang (618-907) dynasties was a native of
Yaoxian County, and lived in seclusion in his late years in the
county's Yaowang Mountain, leaving behind him a rich heritage of
medicine and culture.
</P>
<P>
Because of its historical value and the convenient geographical
location between Xi'an and other tourist attractions in the north
of Shaanxi Province, the central as well as local governments in
recent years have earmarked huge funds renovating Sun's residence
in hope of turning it into a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Among the renovated properties are the residence of Sun, the
mountain path by which the emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty
went to visit Sun, and the Yaowang (King of Chinese herbal
medicine) Temple.
</P>
<P>
The temple alone, which has 33 ancient buildings, cost about
one million yuan (120.480 US dollars) from the State
Administration for Relics to rebuild.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Hezbollah Complete Swap of Prisoners, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The German-mediated deal
between Israel and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party of God) on MIA
(missing in action) body exchange has been completed, the Israeli
Defense Forces (IDF) announced here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, bodies of Rahamim Alsheikh and Yosef Fink, who
died after their capture by Hezbollah guerrillas in a 1986 south
Lebanon ambush, were sent back today to Israel in return for
bodies of 123 Lebanese (most of them Hezbollah members) and
unidentified bodies, which were buried in Israel and in the Israel
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The South Lebanon Army (SLA), Israel's surrogate militia, has
reportedly released 45 Hezbollah detainees in exchange for 16
captive SLA members. Hezbollah had released five additional SLA
members in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The IDF said that the Israeli government thanks German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl for his untiring efforts for the deal and
hopes that the exchange would be the first step toward the return
of other MIA's.
</P>
<P>
The deal marks the first time in five years that Israel and
Hezbollah have managed to reach an agreement on an exchange of
prisoners and bodies.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Israel released 51 Lebanese prisoners and handed over
the bodies of nine Lebanese guerrillas in return for proof that
Alsheikh and Fink were dead and for the return of the body of
Samir Assad, who had been held by the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a Damascus-based PLO group.
</P>
<P>
Israel hopes that the swap may lead to more information on
captured navigator Ron Arad. His family believes that he is still
alive and being held by Hezbollah somewhere.

<P>
TOKYO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese boy has set out from
Tokyo's Yumenoshima marina for a 10,000-kilometer, 50-day solo
voyage across the Pacific, Kyodo News Service reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old Subaru Takahashi is a junior high school
student from Shirone, Niigata Prefecture, central Japan. He plans
to reach San Francisco in early September aboard the Advantage, a
9-meter yacht designed by Japanese yacht designer Osamu Takai.
</P>
<P>
If successful, he will be the youngest sailor ever to make a
solo crossing of the Pacific, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The yacht is loaded with water and food for two months and
equipped with a global positioning system to locate its position
via satellite and a radio system and keep in contact with his
supporters in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Takahashi began canoeing at the age of 5 and crossed the
30-km-wide Sado Strait between the Sea of Japan island of Sado and
Niigata by canoe when he was 9.
</P>
<P>
He began yachting at 10 and underwent 500 hours of intensive
training given by yachting experts for the preparation of the
Pacific voyage.
</P>
<P>
Takahashi was advised to try a trans-Pacific voyage by Kojiro
Shiraishi, 28, a yachtsman who has sailed around the world without
making any port call, when he met Shiraishi last September to seek
his advice for a round-the-world voyage.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Population to Hit 28 Million By 2051 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's population was
expected to reach 28 million by the year 2051 from the current 18
million, but it could be 20 million at that time if overseas
migration slow down.
</P>
<P>
A report released here today estimated that the population will
grow to between 22.5 million and 23.9 million in 2021 and to
between 24.9 and 28.3 million in 2051.
</P>
<P>
"If it is assumed that there is no net gain from overseas
migration, the growth would be even slower, with the population
actually beginning to decline to 20.1 million in 2051 after
reaching a peak of 20.7 million in the year 2033," the report
issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
On projections in Australian states and territories, the report
said, Queensland's population is likely to be doubled, while
Tasmania would be the only state to face a decline in population.
</P>
<P>
The Capital Territory (Canberra) was also expected to overtake
Tasmania's population, with an estimated number of between 462,000
and 564,000 in 2051, up from the current 304,000.
</P>
<P>
The aging of Australia's population would also continue, with
median age increasing from 34 years in 1995 to between 42 and 44
years in 2051. The number of Australians aged 65 years and over
would also jump from 2.2 million in 1995 to up to 6.4 million in
2051.

Jordan made the biggest share of the number of Arab tourists,

<P>
Up until May, there were 13,871 American tourists who visited
Lebanon despite a ban on travel to this country, which was imposed
by the U.S. administration on American citizens in the mid-1980s
following a wave of extremist attacks targeting American interests.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department issued a communique last week,
reaffirming that Lebanon was still an "extremely dangerous place
where any American citizen can not regard himself as aloof from
terrorist operations."
</P>
<P>
Tourism used to be a major source of revenue for Lebanon. But
its importance in the country's national economy has declined
since the 1975-90 civil war.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Filipinos to Support Mindanao Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today urged his people to "give peace and development a chance in
the southern Philippines" by showing their support for the
Mindanao peace deal forged by the government and a Muslim rebel
group last month.
</P>
<P>
In his address at the second session of the 10th Congress here
this afternoon, Ramos said that the peace agreement has "moved us
closer towards the resolution of the conflict that has cost more
than 120,000 lives, with so many more dislocated from their homes
these past 27 years."
</P>
<P>
The government has heard "many voices, pro and con, from
Congress, sectoral leaders, media and the affected communities"
about the agreement reached by the government and the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) in June, Ramos said, referring an
on-going nationwide debate on the deal.
</P>
<P>
"But the decision to go forward rests with me as your
president," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Mindanao peace deal came to light, it has
provoked heated debate between the government and those who saw it
not a formula for peace but of appeasement.
</P>
<P>
Critics, mostly from the Christian majority in Mindanao, said
that the establishment of the MNLF-led Southern Philippines
Council for Peace and Development proposed in the agreement is
effectively imposing Muslim rule on the Christian regions in the
South.
</P>
<P>
Some congressmen said that as they were not consulted at all
before the deal was forged, the proposed council, which will
oversee peace and development in 14 provinces and 10 cities in the
South, is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos said that the MNLF-led council is not a
provisional government or a governing authority.
</P>
<P>
The council is "neither an autonomous region nor a political
subdivision of government," he said, adding that it is simply a
transitory administrative arm under the control and supervision of
the president.
</P>
<P>
"Now, I ask all of you for your support -- to give our
government and our people in our southern regions... this
long-sought opportunity under our transitory arrangements to
convert swords into plowshares," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Government negotiators and MNLF representatives are continuing
their talks on remaining issues, such as the integration of MNLF
fighters into the government army and the setting up of a special
regional security force in a new and broader autonomous region in
the South.
</P>
<P>
A peace accord is expected to be finalized next month when the
two sides meet in Jakarta, Indonesia.

CHANGSHA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Three Iranians have been detained
for theft in central China, police in Changsha, capital of Hunan
Province, announced today.
</P>
<P>
A police officer said that the Iranians, Shabanxali Asghar,
Moslem Esmaeil Poor and Ghassem Omidi, used tourism visas to enter
China from Urumqi, the capital of north China's Xinjiang Uygur

<HEADLINE> Northern Nomadic Tribe Had Complete Legal System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Nomadic Mongolians who roamed north
China's Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region from the Ninth to the
Eighteenth Century lived by the rules of a complete legal system.
</P>
<P>
Qi Ge, an associate research fellow who has written a history
of the Mongolian legal system, says that the Mongolian nationality
has a long history of self-rule by law.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the Eighth Century, the Mongolians' ancestors
moved to the Mongolian Plateau and gradually changed from a
hunting tribe to one that is nomadic.
</P>
<P>
The group later developed regulations to govern meetings,
sacrificial rites, marriage, and the protection of grasslands,
that were passed down through generations.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, arson was punishable by killing
the arsonist's family, while hunting wild animals was banned
except for a special period during the year.
</P>
<P>
In 1206, the famous explorer Genghis Khan established the
Mongolian Empire and publicized a law that dealt with politics,
military affairs, foreign affairs, pasture, grassland management,
finance, commerce, taxes, religion, culture, and education. It is
the first law written in the Mongolian language.
</P>
<P>
In subsequent dynasties, the legal system of the Mongolian
Plateau was further improved, and three laws were issued. These
laws provided a legal basis for the nationality to handle its
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Qi Ge said that the study of the ancient Mongolian legal system
will help create practical laws for ethnic minority groups in
autonomous regions.

<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- All faction leaders in the Liberian
crisis might be brought to court on war crimes if they still
stick to their current stand, Sierra Leonean President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah has said.
</P>
<P>
Unless the warlords changed their attitude, the summit of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) taking place
in Nigeria this week might be compelled to seek international
assistance to arraign the warlords before an international

Kabbah made the remarks at a meeting in Freetown, Sierra Leone
at the weekend, with the out-going field commander of the ECOWAS
peace monitoring group known as ECOMOG, major-general mark
inienger. the daily times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
after the signing of the peace agreement in Abuja, nigeria's
capital, last year, on ending the civil war in Liberia, the
warlords of the country have been expected to demonstrate good
faith toward amicable resolution of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
but contrary to the expectation, the warlords took advantage
of the immunity granted to them as leaders of the Council of
State to flood the capital city of Monrovia with arms and
ammunition and subsequently declared war on the city, President

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loans Benefits Education In Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China's poverty-stricken Guizhou
Province, in the southwest, has made effective use of World Bank
loans to develop primary education.
</P>
<P>
Yang Qingxiu, an official at the province's education
commission, told reporters that the World Bank has provided a
total of 27.77 million US dollars in loans for five
education-related projects in Guizhou since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The money, matched by 114.47 million yuan in local funds, has
been used to build or rebuild 1,431 schools, and repair 1,032
others. The work has reduced the proportion of insecure schooling
facilities from 10.5 percent in 1992 to 4.1 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the combined funds have also been used to
provide training for more than 50,000 rural teachers, and purchase
237,000 pairs of desks and chairs for primary and middle school
students in poverty-ridden villages and townships.
</P>
<P>
Primary education has been made universal in 10 of the 20
counties covered by the World Bank-backed projects, said Yang,
adding that he expects the number of such counties to increase by
five this year.

<HEADLINE> Two Tehran Officials Sentenced to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Two high-ranking officials of
Tehran Municipality were sentenced to imprisonment and dismissed
from their posts, according to a local press report.
</P>
<P>
The Persian evening daily Kayhan reported Sunday that a
director and deputy director of the municipality were imprisoned
on charges of unlawful use of public property and illegal arrests
and questioning.
</P>
<P>
However, the Justice Ministry did no reveal their
identities. The officials were also charged with meddling in the
affairs of the law enforcement forces, collecting illegal
information and detaining individuals without legal permits.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the director was sentenced to 15 months
of imprisonment and six months of dismissal from the post, while
the deputy director was fined 1 million rials (about 250
U.S. dollars) and three years of suspended prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here noted the imprisonment of the two
officials of Tehran Municipality would serve as a heavy blow to
liberal minded Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who is backed
by moderate President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
During the Fifth Parliamentary elections from March to April,
hardliners and extremists headed by Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri accused Karbaschi of illegal use of public fund for
election campaign and violation of election law.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri had repeatedly lashed out at liberals in the
country, warning that they even posed serious threat to the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
He noted if liberalism prevailed in the country, not only the
implementation of the Islamic laws would be retarded but also
previous humiliation and dependence would return.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Specifies Economic Tasks for Next 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today said in his state of the nation address (SONA) that the
government will put agriculture and environment on top of its
economic development agenda in next two years.
</P>
<P>
The state of the nation address was delivered this afternoon at
the second regular session of 10th Congress.
</P>
<P>
In specifying the tasks for the next two years of his remaining
term, Ramos stressed the government will first "guarantee
productivity and profitability of our primary producers," so as to
"assure our food security and self-sufficiency."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that government will speed up building irrigation
systems, farm-to-market roads, post-harvest facilities and
increase the flow of credit to farmers, fisherfolk and rural
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, although the agrarian reform has
achieved significant progress in the distribution of agricultural
land to landless farmers during the last four years, "we are only
half way to our target."
</P>
<P>
He said we have to speed up the land distribution and
productivity program between now and 1998. He urged the Congress
to increase the ceiling of the agrarian reform fund and expand its
sources and improve the adjudication system for agrarian reform.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines will not subscribe the "grow now,
clean up later" approach of some the countries that have already
industrialized.
</P>
<P>
"We are cleaning up as we grow," the president said while
urging the Congress to pass the environment code which will help
make the Philippines the emerging "green tiger."
</P>
<P>
The president said the government will also review the
institutional, policy and funding support for the small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) which "have long been the missing middle link"
in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the government has project exports
to grow at an average annual rate of 25 percent in next two years
instead of the current 20 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
He said over the next two years, the government will complete
its efforts to "shift exports from so called high-volume standard
products to high-value customized goods and services."
</P>
<P>
The president also urged the Congress to pass the comprehensive
tax reform package (CTRP) in a bid to simplify the tax system,
broaden its base, lower its rates, and make it economically
efficient and socially equitable.

<HEADLINE> Residents Being Calm With Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Rising water levels in Wuhan,
capital of central China's Hubei Province, hit 28.35 meters at
8:00 Saturday morning, 1.05 meters above alarm level. The danger
level was reached after days of non stop torrential rain.
</P>
<P>
About 140,000 army troops and residents in Wuhan are working
together to reinforce the embarkments of the Yangtze River, and
look tired and exhausted as they keep a check on the rising water
level.
</P>
<P>
However, the residents in the downtown areas still remain calm
about the floods, going shopping at weekends and dancing in disco
halls as usual. Machines at construction sites of a foreign-funded
recreation park have continued to operate as if no floods have
been reported.
</P>
<P>
So far the city has seen no sharp rises in the prices of key
consumer goods, and no factories have been forced to shut down
because of the floods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city has maintained good telecommunications
links with the outside, and a sound traffic order in the downtown
areas.
</P>
<P>
This is a result of the city's 286.2 kilometres of embarkments
along the Yangtze River banks able to protect local residents from
attack of floods.
</P>
<P>
According to weather forecast, heavy rains in the city will
stop in the coming days, and the rising of the rivers water level
should be slowed down.

<HEADLINE> 70 Percent of Kuwaiti Armed Forces Rebuilt, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Seventy percent of the Kuwaiti
armed forces have been rebuilt since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis,
according to a senior Kuwaiti official.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Defense Minister Sheikh Ahmed Al-Humoud al-Sabah said
in an exclusive interview with local Arabic daily Al-Amba (News)
published today that "we have rebuilt nearly 70 percent of the
Kuwaiti army and we are pursuing this task according to a prepared
plan and timetable."
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Kuwait had bought sophisticated weapons that
"may not be in the possession of the northern neighbor,"
apparently referring to Iraq which occupied the small emirate for
seven months during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis before it was driven
out of the country by allied forces led by the U.S. army in the
Desert Storm campaign.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to reports that Iraqi military forces have
been conducting military drills.
</P>
<P>
He said, "they have been carrying out intensive drills and we
have been monitoring them," adding that the Kuwaiti military was
keeping a state of vigilance regarding movements of the Iraqi
forces.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the Kuwaiti military reconstruction strategy
was designed to purchase modern weapons and train personnel so as
to enable them to use the sophisticated arms.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Gulf war, Kuwait has earmarked nearly 30 billion
U.S. dollars for purchasing advanced military equipment from the
U.S., Britain, France and Russia under defense cooperation
agreements with these countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister expressed to the paper his satisfaction
with combat capability of the Kuwaiti National Armed Forces, which
were totally destroyed by the Iraqis in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ahmed indicated that in case Kuwait was targeted with a
new foreign aggression, the world "will see the Kuwaiti soldiers
have become completely different" from what they were before the
Iraqi invasion.
</P>
<P>
On Kuwaiti defensive precautionary measures against Iraq, the
minister said a plan to beef up fortifications along the
200-kilometer border with the northern neighbor was underway,
including the installment of sensitive monitoring devices and
barbed wires.

government in developing the friendly Sino-Indonesian relations
and Indonesia's support for China on international issues.
</P>
<P>
Alatas told Qian that "the developing countries have their
advantages, but some people want to weaken these advantages."
Therefore, he said Indonesia and China should strengthen their
cooperation and support each other in international affairs.
</P>
<P>

should discuss the security cooperation and encourage development
of normal relationship among countries in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China Hong Kong and
Macao Regional Office announced here today that the ratings on the
eleven sister banks of the Bank of China Group assigned by a U.S.
credit rating agency are "unfair and not objective."
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in response to the recent ratings on
the eleven sister banks assigned by Moody's Investors Services.
Without being invited, Moody's rated the eleven sister banks of
the Bank of China Group and announced the ratings today, it said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that the sister banks rated by Moody's
are subject to the strict supervision of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority. Their businesses are sound, capital bases are solid,
creditability is strong, and their financial positions are
comparable to other fellow banks of similar sizes in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
Since Moody's ratings do not reflect the actual positions of
the Bank of China Group's sister banks, they are received with
much regret, according to the announcement.

<HEADLINE> Seven Gun Thieves Executed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Seven people involved in stealing
or robbing firearms and ammunition were executed today by local
People's Courts.
</P>
<P>
"Firearms and ammunition are extremely dangerous and can become
tools that cause serious harm to society if they fall into the
hands of criminals," said Liu Jiachen, vice-president of the
Supreme People's Court, at a press conference in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Chaorang, a 20-year-old farmer from Guangdong Province,
broke into a store of firearms on a farm on June 10, 1995,
stealing three handguns and 14 bullets.
</P>
<P>
On July 16 last year, Zhong stole another 13 handguns from the
same location, with the help of two accomplices, Guangdong farmers
Liang Guanghuo and Lin Liang.
</P>
<P>
Zu Guijun and Xiang Shucheng, young farmers from Yunnan
Province, stole one handgun in the province in February, 1995, and
robbed another gun in Hebei Province in April of last year, along
with a score of bullets. They were involved in many subsequent
thefts.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhongming, a 46-year-old farmer from Qinghai Province, was
arrested for killing more than 800 rare Tibetan antelopes at the
end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994. He tried to escape, stole
guns from escorts and killed a pursuer.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhi, a 22-year-old farmer from Sichuan Province, stole
large quantities of guns and ammunition from a military firearms
storage facility.
</P>
<P>
In July, provincial People's Courts in Guangdong, Hebei,
Qinghai and Sichuan sentenced the seven people to death and
deprived them of their political rights for life.
</P>
<P>
China has been enforcing strict gun control measures, Liu
Jiachen said, but there have been several gun-related criminal
cases in recent years that have posed a serious threat to people's
property, public security and social stability.
</P>
<P>
China's Criminal Law and other laws have stipulated harsh
penalties for those involved in the illegal production, selling,
transferring, or theft of firearms, ammunition and other
explosives. Those whose activities pose serious threat to society
can be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Firearms Control, passed on July 5 this year by the
20th meeting of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, includes stricter regulations on gun control.

At the afternoon ceremony in Beijing, Japanese Ambassador to

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in South Korea Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment in South
Korea jumped a third to 1.27 billion U.S. dollars in the first
half of this year compared with last year, the Finance and Economy
Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector claimed the lion's share of the rise
with 772 million U.S. dollars, up 65 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Investment from the European Union rocketed 97 percent to 394
million. But Japanese investment plunged by half to 127 million
dollars. U.S. investment fell 5.4 percent to 348 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the sharp increase in investment to the
improvement in the country's foreign investment environment,
including the opening up of domestic markets and the
simplification of investment procedures.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in South Korea has gradually
recovered since it slumped from 1.39 billion dollars in 1991 to
890 million dollars in 1992. It bounced back to 1.04 billion
dollars in 1993, 1.31 billion dollars in 1994 and 1.94 billion
dollars last year.

Total foreign direct investment in South Korea reached a
cumulative 15.67 billion dollars by the end of last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren
said in Beijing today that the Chinese Government wishes to
promote long-term friendship and cooperation with Japan.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a delegation from the Japan Association for
the Promotion of International Trade, Rong said he hopes the
association will play a more positive role in pushing forward the
cooperation between Chinese and Japanese business circles, since
economic cooperation is a significant step toward the growth of
Sino-Japanese ties.
</P>
<P>
Rong extended a welcome to the Japanese delegation, which is
here to study the investment environment of north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Rong told the visitors that Inner Mongolia has an established
industrial foundation and rich resources. He expressed the hope
that they will become acquainted with the situation there in order
to facilitate their cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Rong noted that developing the economy of central and western
China constitutes an important part of China's Ninth Five-Year
Plan and its Long-Term Development Program for the Year 2010,
adding that China will further promote the foreign economic and
technological cooperation of those regions.
</P>
<P>
Rong pointed out that the Japan Association for the Promotion
of International Trade has long been making contributions to the
development of Sino-Japanese friendship and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased to see that this association has sent
quite a few delegations to the Chinese hinterland in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Setsuya Tabuchi, vice-chairman of the association and head of
the delegation, said his association and the Japanese business
circle wish to further develop cooperation with these regions,
since they have a full understanding of the importance of the
investment in China's remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Tabuchi said that his association sent delegations on tours of
China's Sichuan, Hubei, Heilongjiang, and Yunnan provinces last
year, and to Guangxi this year. Delegates will brief the Japanese
business circle on the result of the tour to promote further
understanding of China.
</P>
<P>
Tabuchi, who is also the advisor to Nomura Securities of Japan,
believes that the investment of the Japanese business circle will
continue to expand during China's Ninth Five-Year Plan period and
in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Guo Dongpo, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade (CCPIT) was present at the meeting.

China and Bangladesh have had traditionally friendly relations

</P>
<P>
Sobhan said Bangladesh and China have cooperated well with each
other in the past. He added that economic links between the two
countries should be strengthened, especially the forging of direct
links between enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh attaches much importance to China's experience with
its economic growth process, and the development of rural industry
in particular, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sobhan arrived in the Chinese capital last Saturday to conduct
a yearly consultation with Chinese Foreign Ministry. During his

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Leader Promises to Find out Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Top leader of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, vowed here today to make
efforts to collect informations on the fate of an Israeli air
force navigator, Ron Arad, who has been listed as missing in south
Lebanon since 1986.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held this morning, Hezbollah's Secretary
General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah stressed that efforts were
"crucial" for a continuation of negotiations with Israel to seek
the release of more prisoners jailed by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah held the press conference in the building of the
Lebanese Press Syndicate to publicize a Sunday operation of
swapping remains of two Israeli soldiers for the bodies of 100
Shiite Moslem guerrillas and 45 prisoners captured by the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Local press sources noted that this was the first time for the
Hezbollah leader to meet reporters at a place outside facilities
of the Shiite fundamentalist party.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah accused Israel of having always placed obstacles in
the way of the U.N.- sponsored negotiations before it knows the
fate of the missing Israeli pilot, saying that the negotiations
were launched several years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We derived understandings from the negotiations that the key
to a solution is to determine the fate of Arad and other two
Israeli soldiers," he said, "and we had made it clear since the
beginning that we did not know anything about Arad."
</P>
<P>
Israel reportedly believed that Arad, whose plane was shot down
in south Lebanon on October 16, 1986, was the only one alive
among the six Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon since that
year.
</P>
<P>
On the reason behind Germany's success in mediating the swap
deal which was backed by Syria and Iran, the Hezbollah leader
pointed out that Germany enjoys good relations with Iran, Syria
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Hezbollah's response to Germany's initiatives made the things
end with positive results," the Hezbollah leader emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Germany for its mediation efforts, along with the
Iranian, Syrian and Lebanese governments.
</P>
<P>
Iran, by supplying consistent arms and financial assistances
to Hezbollah, has a major influence in this party. Syria, with its
35,000 troops deployed on two thirds of Lebanon's lands, is the
main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah repeated a promise to exert all efforts for a
release of remaining prisoners jailed in prisons inside Israel as
well as the Khiam jail in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no bodies of Israeli soldiers and prisoners
from Israel's South Lebanon Army (SLA) client militia are still in
Hezbollah's hands after the Sunday swap.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallay refused to link the swap deal with any political
development and the approaching parliamentary election in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the operation of exchanging bodies and
prisoners "could not alter Hezbollah's strategy of carrying on
the resistance" as long as the Israeli occupation in south
Lebanon is not terminated.
</P>
<P>
The swap deal brokered by Germany's top security official
Bernd Schmidbauer was the biggest between Hezbollah and Israel
since 1982, the year when Israel invaded Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Hezbollah handed over, through the
International Committee of Red Cross, the remains of two Israeli
soldiers, Rahamim Alsheikh and Yosef Fink.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed party also released 17 SLA prisoners, but
the prisoners refused to return to the Israeli-occupied border
strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel, on the other hand, delivered the bodies of 123 Shiite
Moslem soldiers, most of whom were Hezbollah members, and
released 45 prisoners from the Khiam jail.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Vietnamese Banks to Cooperate in Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
today signed agreements on cooperation in bilateral border trade
with its Vietnamese counterpart, the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the banks have cooperated with each
other, and is an outgrowth of the rapid bilateral border trade
between the two countries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese banking officials said that the border trade value
between the two countries hit 2.6 billion yuan last year. However,
businessmen from both countries could only deal through cash
settlements or barter, because the two banks had no existing
agreements on cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreements signed today will pave the way for the two banks
to engage in extensive cooperation in foreign trade
settlement. And the banks will soon initiate exchanges of credit,
loans and personnel.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Sea Rebel Boats Destroyed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Deputy Minister of
Defense A. Ratwatte said today that over 100 sea tigers boats were
destroyed by the air force and the navy during the recent Tamil
rebel attack on the Mullaitivu army base.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a news conference here this evening just
two hours after he returned from a four-day trip to the battle
front at Mullaitivu, 280 kilometers northeast of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
He said the fighting was very hard and both sides had suffered
heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the morale of the soldiers who were holding on and
 fighting back from a portion of the base was high and that they
had sufficient stocks of arms, ammunition and food.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcements had been airdropped and sent in by sea amidst
heavy enemy resistance and they were determined and well-motivated
to move forward to the base, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the troops had established a beach-head and were
now in full control of the seas off the coast of Mullaitivu and
the beach.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Tamil rebels' objective on launching
this attack was to restore its international image after the
debacle in Jaffna peninsula which regained by the government
troops in May this year.

<HEADLINE> Mining Industry Vital to China's National Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The mining industry has become one
of the most important basic industries in the development of
China's national economy.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics released by the Ministry of
Geological and Mineral Resources (MGMR), the output value of the
mining industry has risen to almost six percent of the country's
total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
And the output value generated from the mining industry and the
processing of mineral products account for more than one quarter
of the country's total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Song Ruixiang, minister of MGMR, said that China has discovered
168 minerals, 151 of which have deposits. The potential value of
these deposits ranks third in the world.
</P>
<P>
A complete mining system has been set up for the development of
national economy, Song added.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has established over 10,000 mines and more than
280,000 collectively-owned or private mines. In addition, 323
oilfields have gone into operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister went on to say that over 300 cities have been
established on the basis of developing mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 21 million people are employed by the mining
industry, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, China's output value of ore extraction increased by
1.16 times that of 1985, while output value of the mining industry
increased by 2.3 times. The number of state-owned mining
enterprises and other mining enterprises increased by 70 percent
and 130 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The country's mining development scale ranks third in the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government vowed to exercise stricter supervision
over the legal development of mineral resources in the next five
years.

<HEADLINE> Istunka Festival on at Afgoe, Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The biggest traditional
festival of Istunka entered the second day today at Afgoe
district, 30 km south of Mogadishu, with thousands of happy
people, men and women, old and young, gathering at the western
river bank to witness the major event in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Istunka, a unique festival dating back to 600 years ago, takes
place at this time of the year every year.
</P>
<P>
During the event, two groups of male youngsters numbering
dozens use sticks to fight until one side is defeated.
</P>
<P>
The two groups are not divided on tribal basis, but on
residential area. River Shabelle winds through the town dividing
the two groups of contestants. The two dominant clans of Wadan
and Galadi participate in the contest, calling themselves the
eastern and western people according to their distance toward the
river.
</P>
<P>
The play ground is about 400 by 150 meters, divided by lime
marks into two parts. First the two captains meet right at the
center while their colleague players stand about 25 meters
behind.
</P>
<P>
The two show off their feats similar to that of Chinese
Kung-Fu, then yell at each other before starting to fight and
immediately the dozens of their followers rush to fence each
other with sticks.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of supporters of both sides cheer the fighters on by
shouting at the top of their voices standing outside the play
yard.
</P>
<P>
According to tradition, young women do not marry young men of
the defeated side until they emerge victorious next year.
</P>
<P>
If the practice of Istunka stops, it will not rain and women
will not give birth to any sons as the saying goes, Mohamed Ali
Hilowle, one of the local elders at Afgoe, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"This tradition is believed to be bringing joy and prosperity
to the communities in Afgoe district," Hilowle said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day traditional festival began with happiness as
usual yesterday. Almost all of the players suffer slight
injuries, but their wounds have been treated free of charge at
all the private heath centers at the town.
</P>
<P>
The late regime had prohibited the exercise in 1976, but was
obliged to lift the ban again a year later after serious
complaints were lodged and demonstrations staged at the town.
</P>
<P>
Afgoe is vivid today with hundreds of people pouring in from
all surrounding villages for the second day. The business stalls,
restaurants and hotels are all busy and the road linking the town
to Mogadishu has been full with traffic.
</P>
<P>
The festival will continue until tomorrow. This noble
tradition of the people of Afgoe leaves no animosity behind for
the contestants. At the end of the festival, people will use
water cannons to stop the fighting as time runs out.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Submits Budget Proposal for 1997 to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today submitted to the Congress a 476.2-billion-peso budget
proposal for the 1997 fiscal year which lays emphasis on poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
After his state-of-the-nation address before the joint session
at the 10th Congress, President Ramos presented to House Speaker
Jose de Venecia the proposed budget of 476.6 billion pesos (about
18.2 billion US dollars) for 1997, an increase of 11 percent over
this year.
</P>
<P>
In his budget message, Ramos said that poverty remains a very
serious problem in the country, and with what this budget
provides, the incidence of poverty which the government managed to
reduce from about 40 percent in 1991 to 35.7 percent in 1994, will
plummet to 30 percent by 1998, or even lower.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, he said, the biggest share of the proposed
budget will go for the social services sector, which has an
allocation of some 156.4 billion pesos (about 6 billion dollars),
an increase of 16 percent over the 1996 level.
</P>
<P>
The continued growth of the national economy is the most
powerful instrument to fight poverty, Ramos said, adding the new
budget aims to accelerate the growth of the gross national product
to 7-8 percent in 1997 from this year's projected growth rate of
6.5-7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government will also hold inflation rate down to 6-7
percent from an average of 6.5-7.5 percent in 1996 and push
interest rates down to 11 percent from about 12.5 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the country's inflation rate
fell back to a single-digit of 9.8 percent in June this year after
 consecutive months of double-digit.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos administration said it will maintain the present
prudent fiscal policy and targets a budget surplus of 14.7 billion
pesos (56 million dollars) next year.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Build Alumina Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait Industries Company,
a state-run company, will build a one-billion-dollar alumina
factory, the Kuwait News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nsser Naki, director general of the company, was quoted as
saying that the factory is expected to produce annually 900,000
tons of alumina, a raw material used in producing aluminium, and
will provide work for up to 500 Kuwaiti nationals or residents of
the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
With the operation of the factory, Kuwait could supply alumina
to the two aluminium factories in Bahrain and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), which currently import up to 1.5 million tons of
alumina from Australia, the director said.
</P>
<P>
There are only three aluminium factories in the Arab world,
including the two in Bahrain and the UAE, which produce,
respectively, 460,000 tons and 245,000 tons of aluminium
annually. The third one is located in Egypt, producing 170,000
tons of aluminium a year, according to the director.
</P>
<P>
Naki estimated the world's consumption of alumina at 100
million tons a year.

<P>
DHAKA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina today told Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh Zhang Xujiang
that her government sticks to "One China Policy" and treats Taiwan
as a part of China.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government will give top priority to its
relations with China and maintain such ties on the basis of "One
China Policy," Hasina said when meeting with the Chinese
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
She recalled her visit to China in November 1993 as the then
opposition leader at the invitation of the Central Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also expressed her satisfaction at China's
keen interest in Bangladesh's economic development, especially in
the infrastructure sector.
</P>
<P>
Noting there is room for the two countries to expand
cooperation in economic and trade fields, she expressed her hope
that China will increase its imports from Bangladesh to narrow the
trade gap between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang conveyed thanks of Chinese Premier Li Peng to Hasina for
her message and sympathy to the flood victims in China and
extended the Chinese government's invitation to Hasina to visit
China.
</P>
<P>
While Looking forward to the visit, the Bangladeshi leader also
extended her invitation to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Li Peng to visit Bangladesh.

Yamousoukro meeting with the RUF demanding the withdrawal of
foreign troops, particularly the South African mercenaries of
Executive Outcomes from Sierra Leone before the commencement of
disarmament.
</P>

The Sierra Leone government has rejected the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs New Farming Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Africa's poor food security
situation will not be improved by increasing land under
agriculture, but by developing technologies that enhance soil
fertility, Agriculture Minister Denis Norman said today.
</P>
<P>
He said because of the harsh production environment
characterized by low fertility and fragile soils for thousands of
Zimbabwe's small scale farmers, use of fertilizer and other
agro-chemicals should be increased.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a week-long southern African regional workshop on
agri-inputs, marketing and extension which opened in Harare
today, Norman said food is likely to become more scarce and
expensive.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, being attended by smallholder farmers from
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) member states,
seeks to increase the participants' knowledge and skills of the
role of plant nutrients in crop production.
</P>
<P>
''Area expansion has been the conventional way of increasing
output but because of population pressure, this is becoming
difficult... thus the most viable option is the development and
adoption of technological innovation,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
Southern Africa has on numerous occasions relied on food
imports to supplement local stocks that have clearly been
inadequate to cater for the rapidly growing population, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates of the U. N. food and agriculture
organization, only 24 percent of future food needs can be met by
putting new land into production, the remaining 76 percent has to
come from intensification of production on currently farmed land.

<HEADLINE> Central Group Directing Flood-Relief Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A flood-relief group authorized by
the CPC Central Committee and the State Council has been sent to
flood-stricken Liuzhou, the most heavily-hit city in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The group, headed by Shi Wanpeng, deputy general director of
the State Flood-Control and Drought-Relief Headquarters, consists
of officials from nine state ministries including agriculture,
finance, health and civil affairs.
</P>
<P>
Shi conveyed the support of the CPC Central Committee and the
State Council to the officers and soldiers who are combating the
raging waters. He also explained the flood relief guidelines given
by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
During their inspection tour, the group members discovered that
the social order is stable in the flood-torn areas, and the
victims there are safe. Local people have minimized the losses
caused by the flood to the greatest extent.
</P>
<P>
Shi praised the People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers,
armed police and the public security forces who have played a
great role in the fight against the floods.
</P>
<P>
He also offered four suggestions for local flood-relief work,
saying that authorities should:
</P>
<P>
-- Ensure food, drinking water, power supplies, and temporary
living quarters for the victims;
</P>
<P>
-- Resume production as soon as possible and rebuild their
homes;
</P>
<P>
-- Pay attention to health work in order to prevent the
outbreak of epidemic diseases; and
</P>
<P>
-- Continue to strengthen the leadership of flood-relief
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Begin to Get Bank Loans to Buy Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to its high bank
deposits, a Beijing taxi company received more than one million
yuan in loans, enabling it to add 14 Jetta sedans to its fleet.
</P>
<P>
"The loans really helped resolve our money problem," said Ji
Donghe, business manager of the taxi company.
</P>
<P>
Chinese residents now can buy Jettas with a new mortgage-backed
loans provided by the Construction Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
In early June, the Construction Bank of China provided the loan
service to private buyers and car dealers who want to buy the
Jettas, on the condition that they mortgage the property rights of
the cars for loans and repay the loans in installments.
</P>
<P>
Jettas are manufactured by China's First Automotive Works
(FAW)-Volkswagen Automotive Company, based in Changchun, the
capital of northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
Though it is common for financial circles to grant loans for
buyers and sales agents in foreign countries, this is the first
time the service has been offered to China's car buyers.
</P>
<P>
The Construction Bank of China has signed an comprehensive
agreement with FAW, in a bid to help the enterprise expand sales,
and to help the bank's business grow.
</P>
<P>
A group has been formed to promote the service, which was first
provided in the bank's branches in Beijing, Changchun, and Wenzhou
in east China's Zhejiang Province, using network-linked settlement
systems.
</P>
<P>
Soon after it was advertised in Wenzhou, a newly-prosperous
area in the country, the service received positive feedback and
assisted more than 50 local self-employed workers buy Jettas.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the service, the branch of the Construction
Bank of China in Changchun allowed buyers and dealers to mortgage
other properties, in addition to the Jetta property rights, for
loans.
</P>
<P>
The branch also listed three-year loan terms for individual
buyers, two-year terms for collective groups, and a one-year term
for agents.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of 10.7 billion yuan, the FAW-Volkswagen Automotive
Company has completed its construction and is able to produce
100,000 sedans annually.
</P>
<P>
The installment plan to pay back mortgages will influence
China's private purchasing power of sedans.
</P>
<P>
The new service should enhance the market competition for
homemade sedans, said Zhao Ji, deputy general manager of the
company.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that if 800 million yuan in loans for the
service is provided, 35,000 more sedans will be sold. This figure
is equivalent to the company's annual Jetta output, added Zhao Ji.
</P>
<P>
The service has attracted great interest from foreign
automobile industries and financial circles.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and over
50 others injured today when a high intensity bomb exploded in the
middle of the main hall at the Lahore airport in Punjab province
of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the hall was engulfed by smoke while a tea
stall and panes of the airlines offices in the hall were smashed
by the explosion, indicating the high intensity of the blast.
</P>
<P>
The army personnel took over the control of the airport after
the explosion and all vehicles were ordered to stop outside the
premises of the airport.
</P>
<P>
Bomb experts collected pieces of explosive device but were not
yet sure about its make. They said the device was probably placed
beneath concrete-made chairs in the waiting hall.
</P>
<P>
Senior police officials believed that those people probably
wanted to place explosive material in an aircraft, but they could
not do so.
</P>
<P>
Senior provincial officials visited the airport and hospitals
where the injured were treated to inquire about the health of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
The law-enforcing agencies had been put on red alert and
directed to nab the culprits.
</P>

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. House
Representative Dan Rostenkowski Monday begins a 17-month sentence
for mail fraud at the federal medical prison in Rochester,
Minnesota, where he will stay while completing his recuperation
from prostate cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
A Chicago Democrat, Rostenkowski for years was chairman of the

Rostenkowski, 68, pleaded guilty in April to two counts of mail
fraud involving the operations of his House office. He admitted to
converting office funds to his own use for gifts and to hiring
people on the congressional payroll who did little or no official
work. He also admitted sending House payroll checks through the

<HEADLINE> Judicial Cooperation in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece, Bulgaria and Romania has
signed a joint proclamation aimed at coordinating efforts by the
three Balkan neighbors in the fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
The proclamation, signed in northern Greek city of Salonika
over the weekend, foresees cooperation in the sectors of
transferring prisoners to serve out their term in their native
country and bolstering the use of arbitration to adjudicate in
commercial disputes.
</P>
<P>
Greek Justice Minister Evangelos Venizelos told a press
conference today that the meeting with his Romanian and Bulgarian
counterparts had agreed on the transfer of 240 Romanians and 39
Bulgarians currently imprisoned in Greece, which would alleviate
conditions for overcrowded Greek jails.
</P>
<P>
Greece already has a similar agreement with Albania regarding
some 1,000 Albanian inmates here but that it has not yet been
enacted due to ''technical difficulties''.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of the agreement, Greece, Bulgaria and
Romania will also establish regional cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
Venizelos said that Greece would organize two annual seminars
in Salonika for Bulgarian and Romanian judges and legal officials
to receive training in European Union law.
