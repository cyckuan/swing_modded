<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Helicopter Catches Fire, 2 Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan Air Force MI24
helicopter gunship caught fire Wednesday during an emergency
landing in the northern Jaffna peninsula where fresh fighting
erupted between government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels, a
government statement said Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"The rear cabin of the helicopter caught fire at the time of
emergency landing. Two gunners were killed due to the cabin fire,"
the statement said, adding that two pilots were rescued by ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
It said the helicopter was used to support the ground troops in
the west of Sarasalai, who have been resisting offensives launched
by the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
However, the statement did not mention why the helicopter
caught fire, saying only that investigations were in progress.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate Tamil state in Sri
Lanka's north and east since 1983, are engaged in a ferocious
assault in a bid to retake their of former stronghold of Jaffna.

<HEADLINE> India Ready for Sri Lankan Troops Rescue: Senior Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Indian naval officer
said Wednesday that preparations were complete for a joint naval
and air operation for possible evacuation of the beleaguered Sri
Lankan troops out of Jaffna peninsula at very short notice, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
"We will be able to move within half an hour if orders come
from Delhi," Rear Admiral Vijay Shankar, flag officer commanding-
in-chief of India's Southern Naval Command, was quoted as saying
on a private TV channel at Kochi, a port city in South India's
Kerala State.
</P>
<P>
India announced Tuesday that it would help evacuate the nearly
30,000 Sri Lankan troops trapped in Jaffna if the Sri Lankan
government raised a formal request under some "proper conditions."
</P>
<P>
According to a contingency plan worked out by the Indian
government, the Eastern Naval Command based in Vishakapatnam on
the eastern coast would be in charge of any naval operations while
the Southern Air Command in Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala would
carry out air operations, said Shankar.
</P>
<P>
The naval ships were capable of carrying only 800 evacuees each
and, if required, merchant vessels could also be pressed into
service, said Shankar.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that there was a lack of confidence in the
success of the air operations, since the Palaly air-base, the only
airport in the Jaffna peninsula, could be unfit for landing.
</P>
<P>
"Evacuation is not an intervention but a humanitarian relief
operation," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Embassy Bombed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian Embassy here was bomb-
attacked by unidentified persons Wednesday evening hours after
Norway's Deputy Foreign Minister Raymond Johansen left Sri Lanka
after a peace mission.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, heard within several blocks of the fashionable
Cinnamon Gardens diplomatic quarter in Colombo, shattered windows
at the chancery but there were no casualties, police said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
A government spokesman here said an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
Bomb disposal units began searching the area for any unexploded
devices after the attackers fled on a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Ambassador Jon Westborg said he believed the attack
was connected with his country's efforts to bring the island's
Tamil Tiger rebels and government forces to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
There have been protests and demonstrations outside the
Norwegian Embassy here recently with nationalist groups demanding
that Oslo stay away from the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line nationalist groups have accused Norway of
supporting Tamil Tiger rebels who are fighting government forces
in the island's northern Jaffna peninsula in a bid to carve out a
separate Tamil state.

<HEADLINE> Lippi to Remain as Inter Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Inter Milan's owner Massimo Moratti
said on Wednesday that Marcello Lippi will remain as manager of
the Milan soccer team.
</P>
<P>
"We're going forward with Lippi," said Massimo Moratti, the
Italian industrialist who owns the Inter.
</P>
<P>
Lippi, who won three Serie A titles as head coach of Juventus
in the late 1990s, took Inter Milan only last year. However, he
had been criticized for the team's unstable performance this
season.
</P>
<P>
In a one-game tiebreak Tuesday night, veteran striker Roberto
Baggio scored twice to help Inter beat AC Parma 3-1 and earn a
berth in next year's Champions League. The victory may have
sealed plans to keep Lippi.

<HEADLINE> OAU Reiterates Call for End of Ethio-Eritrean Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Wednesday reiterated its call for an end to
two-year-old border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, the OAU asked the two African countries to
immediately implement the redeployment of their respective forces
to the positions they controlled prior to May 6 of 1998 without
prejudging the final status of the territories concerned, which
will be determined at the end of the delimitation and demarcation
process.
</P>
<P>
The OAU requested Eritrea to announce immediately its decision
to carry out this redeployment and to implement it immediately.
</P>
<P>
In the same spirit, the OAU requested Ethiopia to announce at
once, after Eritrea, its decision to redeploy its forces, noting
the redeployment must concern all the positions taken since
February of 1999 and which was not under Ethiopian control before
May 6 of 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika has invited both Ethiopia and Eritrea to send their
delegations to Algiers for the resumption of the proximity talks
immediately after they made announcement of the decision of
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika, who is also current chairman of the Organization of
African Unity, met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi soon
after he arrived here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The summit talks lasted more than two hours. The details of the
talks were not revealed at the press time.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Calls for Arab Aid to Accommodate Eritrean Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Sudan on Thursday appealed to the Arab
countries for help to accommodate Eritrean refugees, who have
stormed into Sudan to flee the ongoing Eritrean-Ethiopian war.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Abdel Halim, Sudan's permanent representative to the
Cairo-based Arab League, met with Arab League Secretary-General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid in the day to discuss the refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Abdel Halim said he
asked Abdel-Meguid to intervene, together with the league member
states, in solving the issue.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum pledged to address an
urgent appeal to Arab countries, organizations and finance funds to
provide Sudan with necessary aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, 22,000 Eritrean refugees have entered Sudan, the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean-Ethiopian war broke out two years ago for
territorial disputes on the border.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar Hassan el-Bashir has been in contact
with Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders and urged them to stop the war
and seek peaceful solutions to their disputes, Abdel Halim said.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 2 Injured in Building Collapse in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A building collapsed on Thursday in a
poor district of Alexandria on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, leaving
one youth dead and two people injured.
</P>
<P>
The three-story building in the Karmuz neighborhood fell down
while Magdi Mohammed Mussa, 40, was cutting 17-year-old Mohammed
Badr's hair, crushing the customer to death, a police officer told
the country's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mussa and another customer in the barber shop on the ground
floor, 15-year-old Ahmed Khashba, managed to flee, escaping with
minor injuries as the 55-year-old building fell down, the officer
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He added that the upper floors of the building had been
uninhabited following an order by local authorities to evacuate the
building due to cracks appearing in its walls. The barber had
defied the order.
</P>
<P>
The hairdressing salon was the latest structure to fall down in
Egypt that saw 16 people die in an apartment block collapse less
than two weeks ago and dozens more crushed to death in at least
seven building accidents last year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Discusses Israeli Withdrawal in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General's special
envoy to the Middle East Terje Roed-Larsen on Thursday held talks
here with Lebanese leaders on Israel's troop withdrawal from south
Lebanon, Central News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, who arrived here Wednesday night, discussed with
President Emile Lahoud and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri "how the
U.N. can assist to restore peace and security" in the liberated
area of southern Lebanon, said the report.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Berri, Larsen told reporters that he
had "discussed all matters related to the Israeli withdrawal,"
particularly, urgent humanitarian aid to the south and
reconstruction of public facilities.
</P>
<P>
Larsen said he was commissioned with three tasks on his visit to
Lebanon: formal confirmation of Israel's troop withdrawal from
south Lebanon; the way U.N. and other countries to help the
Lebanese government restore peace and security in the liberated
zone; studying the border between Israel and Lebanon and helping
the local government establish administrative system.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Larsen also mentioned the danger of left
mines in south Lebanon. He promised to Berri that the U.N. will get
a map of the minefield from Israel and put into motion a program
locating and removing the mines left behind in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Local radios reported that five people were killed in the
explosions of shells and mines in south Lebanon when thousands of
people rushed into the abandoned Israeli positions on Wednesday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Larsen will visit the south on Friday.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Urges Israel to Withdraw From All Occupied Arab Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary-General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid stressed on Thursday that a just and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East will not be realized unless
Israel withdraws completely from the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel must return the Golan Heights, the West Bank as well as
East Jerusalem, Abdel-Meguid said after meeting with an Indian
Defense Academy delegation.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to implement the United Nations Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338 in a bid to seek guarantee for its own
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights from Syria, the West Bank and
Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Syria and Israel
have yet to resume negotiations on the return of the strategic
plateau.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future
independent state to be established in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. The Palestinians and Israel have been negotiating for
solutions to the thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the pan-Arab forum warned that Israel's continued
occupation of Arab lands will fuel Arab resistance and backfire on
the Jewish state itself.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid lauded the victory of the Lebanese resistance which
forced Israel into ending its 22-year occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed troop withdrawal from south Lebanon on
Wednesday, much ahead of its earlier schedule to pull out troops by
July 7.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails Eritrean Statement on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday hailed the statement by Eritrea on peace in the region,
saying that the 15-nation body looks forward to a positive
response by Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the Council,
Wang Yingfan of China, said, "Members welcomed, as an important
step in the process toward peace, Eritrea's announcement of its
intention to redeploy its troops to the positions controlled prior
to May 6, 1998."
</P>
<P>
"Members looked forward to the completion as soon as possible
of Eritrea's redeployment from all such territories along the
length of the Eritrea/Ethiopia border," as outlined in the first
and second de-escalation points of the May 24 Communique by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members looked forward to a positive response by Ethiopia to
the requests contained in the Communique, including to an
announcement of its decision to redeploy its forces from all
territories occupied since February 6, 1999, as outlined in the
third point of the Communique's proposal to de-escalate the
conflict," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members welcomed the willingness of both parties to send
delegations to Algiers for the resumption of Proximity Talks to
finalize consolidated Technical Arrangements as also called for in
the May 24, 2000 Communique," the statement said. "Members urged
the talks to reconvene as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said, "Members commended the personal
engagement of the current Chairman of the OAU, Algerian President
Bouteflika, in the peace process at this critical moment."
</P>
<P>
"Members deplored the loss of life from fighting and stressed
the need for both parties to achieve a peaceful solution of the
conflict," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia Thursday dismissed as "a despicable farce" a claim by
Eritrea that its forces had pulled back in a disputed border area
as a prelude to restarting peace talks, an Ethiopian Foreign
Ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Eritrea said it had accepted an appeal from the
OAU to withdraw its troops to positions they held before war first
broke out with Ethiopia in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Accuses U.S. of Violating Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, told a press conference that Yugoslavia, a
signatory and a guarantor to the peace treaty, is the legitimate
member of the of the Peace Implementation Council and should
attend the Council's ministerial meeting, scheduled for May 23-24
in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Russia has officially decided not to attend the meeting, he
said. "Some other members of the Council also announced their
intention not to take part in the meeting," and "we still don't
know how these countries have realized their warning."
</P>
<P>
In addition, even U.S. allies, such as Canada, Italy, Greece,
Turkey and Germany, do not back the U.S. move, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States, by that action, has only demonstrated its
continuous hostile policy towards Yugoslavia irrespective of the
rights of Yugoslavia on the basis of the U.N. Charter and the
Dayton/Paris Agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the meeting adopts any decision, then those decisions will
not be legally bounding for Yugoslavia and Russia," both
guarantors of the peace accord, he said. "This can only weaken the
whole process of implementation."
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Jovanovic has twice asked the U.N. Security
Council to convene an urgent meeting to condemn the U.S.
insistence, saying he is looking forward to seeing the Council
moves to defend its resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the Security Council, which is being
distributed here Thursday, Jovanovic said, "The failure to invite
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia represents yet another explicit
example of violating the norms of international law and the
demonstration of arrogance and diktat of the United States
Administration, which is systematically undermining the role of
the Security Council and the reputations of the world organization.
"
</P>
<P>
"If the legitimate rights of Yugoslavia were further ignored,
then Yugoslavia will consider the new situation," he said,
indicating his nation's unwillingness to carry out the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton Agreement was signed by Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia
in the United States on November 21, 1995, under Russian, U.S.,
British, German, French and Italian mediation.
</P>
<P>
It was intended to end the three-and-a-half Balkan war, provide
a unified, democratic Bosnian state, solve territorial problems
and settle how elections could be held.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves 15 Billion Dollars in Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives approved Thursday a package of election-year farm
assistance amounting to 15 billion U.S. dollars to compensate
farmers for a third straight year of low commodity prices and to
make it much cheaper for growers to buy crop insurance.
</P>
<P>
The package includes 5.5 billion dollars in direct payments
that would reach farmers by September 30, in the midst of the
congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Some 8.2 billion dollars would go toward reducing premiums on
federally subsidized crop insurance over the next five years, and
the legislation makes a series of changes in the insurance program
designed to get more farmers to buy the coverage.
</P>
<P>
Grain prices collapsed in 1998 in the wake of the Asian
financial crisis and have yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has given farmers 15 billion dollars in extra
income assistance over the past two years, and the Agriculture
Department estimates that net farm income this year would drop 7.6
billion dollars, or 16 percent, without another round of aid.
</P>
<P>
The measure also would offer coverage for the first time to
livestock producers and expand coverage for fruit and vegetable
growers.

UNITED NATIONS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan had urged all partied concerned in the Middle East to
cooperate fully with the United Nations in order to ensure a
successful implementation of U.N. Resolution 425, the U.N.
spokesman's office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in letters to Prime Minster Ehud Barak
of Israel and President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon as well as to
other regional leaders with whom the U.N. chief had been in
regular contact in recent weeks, the spokesman's office said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General called upon them to be as supportive as

</P>

an effort to maintain calm.

U.N. Special Envoy to the Middle East Terje Roed-Larsen is in
the Middle East, seeking assurances from governments that U.N.
helicopters can have access to their airspace for the
identification of the practical line corresponding to the 1923
borderline between Israel and Lebanon, he said.

The United Nations would confirm Israel's withdrawal and, over

authority over its territory, he added.
</P>
<P>
The last soldiers of Israel returned home Wednesday, ending
Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon which lasted for 22 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
Thursday urged, in his African Freedom Day message, African
countries to stop fighting and find lasting solution for peace and
development on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that scourges of war fire, even 37 years after the
first Freedom Day, were still impeding the continent from total
liberation from poverty and deprivation.
</P>
<P>
The president told an audience in front of the State House here
marking the day that Zambia was regretful at the resumption of
wars in Sierra Leone and some other places on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the taking hostages, by Sierra Leone former rebels,
of the Zambian soldiers serving on the noble cause of the United
Nations peace keeping mission in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
But he said Zambia was determined to promote peace within its
borders and beyond despite the sad incident.
</P>
<P>
The president said he had dispatched a team lead by the
country's defense minister and army commander to Sierra Leone to
assess the situation there and seek for the release of the
remaining captured Zambian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the UN to urgently deploy the 5,537
peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to avert a
resumption of hostilities.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Troop Deployment to S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has not sent troops, except
those under the United Nations' flag, to Sierra Leone since the
inception of President Olusegun Obasanjo last May, said the
country's Defense Minister Theophilus Danjuma.
</P>
<P>
Danjuma made the remarks Wednesday in a response to some
ungrounded reports that Nigerian government had deployed fresh
troops to the west African nation, said the Guardian, a leading
Nigerian newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Danjuma said, on the contrary, the government had brought back
home over 4,000 soldiers who served in the former West African
Peace-Keeping Force, known as the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nigeria, whose troops used to constitute the
backbone of the ECOMOG, had handed over the security
responsibility in Sierra Leone to the United Nations Peacekeeping
Mission, known as the UNAMSIL.
</P>
<P>
But during meeting of the defense ministers and chiefs of staff
of the Economic Community of the West African States (ECOWAS) last
week in Abuja, Danjuma pledged that Nigeria would be ready to send
"one or two battalions to Sierra Leone if the sub-regional body's
Heads of State gave the go-ahead" .

<HEADLINE> Barak Vows to Push Peace Process Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIRYAT SHEMONA, Northern Israel, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli
government is determined to push the Middle East peace process
forward after the troop withdrawal from south Lebanon, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special session of the Knesset (parliament) which
was held to show solidarity with residents in northern Israel,
Barak said he and his government will "do everything possible" to
realize peace not only in Israel, but in the Middle East as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Barak for the first time called upon Lebanese
people and government to join hands with Israel to maintain border
safety, not to turn south Lebanon into a battle field again after
Israel's troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has pulled out its troops from south Lebanon to the
international border and now Israel does not occupy Lebanese
territories, so it is time for the peoples of Lebanon and Israel to
live in peace," Barak stressed.
</P>
<P>
As ordered by Barak, Israel extracted some 1,500 troops from
south Lebanon by early Wednesday, ending 22 years of occupation of
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal did cause concern in northern Israel. More than
half of the residents of Kiryat Shemona, only about 10 kilometers
south of the border and within the range of cross-border attacks,
had fled to the south for fear of such attacks in the wake of the
pullback.
</P>
<P>
Barak also called on Lebanese leaders not to allow terrorists to
attack Israel from south Lebanon, which he said had been one of the
main reasons for Israel to take military actions in the past.
</P>
<P>
He urged Lebanese government and people to accept Israel's "
hands of peace" and work together for a better future for the
peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility for safety and security along Israeli-
Lebanese border now lies with the Syrian and Lebanese governments,
Barak emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his thanks to the residents of northern Israel for
their help and sacrifice during the time of need and difficulties
and promised his government will try its best to develop the north
in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
After Barak's speech, opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon
took the floor, saying he supported Barak's decision for the troop
withdrawal, but could not accept the way Barak handled the pullout,
which was described by the press as "hasty," "disorderly" and "
humiliating."
</P>
<P>
Barak decided to quicken the pace of the pullout, well ahead of
the self-imposed July 7 deadline, in view of the swift collapse of
the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's session was the first Knesset meeting held outside
Jerusalem in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Mordechai Indicted on Charges of Sexual Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein decided Thursday to indict Transport Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai on charges of forceful indecent acts and sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai will be charged with three counts of sexual
harassment, one involving a temporary worker who claimed the
minister assaulted her in his office earlier this year, Rubinstein
said in his decision.
</P>
<P>
A second count involves a similar case while Mordechai was
serving as defense minister in the former government headed by
Benjamin Netanyahu, and the third one, dating back to 1992,
concerns a similar case while he was serving as commander of the
northern front.
</P>
<P>
Next week, Rubinstein will ask the Knesset (parliament) to
remove Mordechai's immunity.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's attorney said that the minister will not object to
the removal of his immunity and that he will resign from his post
of Transport Minister next week.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai is also the leader of the Center party, a coalition
partner of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government.

CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will
visit Egypt on Saturday to brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on the peace talks with Israel, especially the negotiations held
recently in Stockholm, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's planned visit comes as part of the constant
coordination and consultations between the two leaders in a bid to
seek ways to push forward the peace process, Zohdi al Qedra told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will keep Mubarak posted on the present situation in the
Palestinian territories in the light of recurring Israeli attacks

</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to discuss the Mideast peace
negotiations with Mubarak, who plays a key role in mediating
between the Arabs and Israelis in their talks.
</P>
<P>
Al Qedra welcomed Wednesday's Israeli withdrawal from southern
Lebanon, calling on Israel to draw lessons from what happened in
southern Lebanon and go ahead with the peace march to bring about a
just and overall peace in the region under the United Nations
Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for-peace
principle.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The 20 percent pay gap between men
and women in Britain may not be closed for another 30 years
despite decades of equal wage laws, a report released Thursday
warned.
</P>
<P>
The Equal Opportunities Commission said companies should be
made to carry out pay audits if they did not monitor their wage
systems.
</P>
<P>
Julie Mellor, chairman of the commission, said: "After 30 years
of equal pay legislation, it is hard to believe that women are
still so consistently undervalued in the workplace."
</P>
<P>
The Trade Union Congress (TUC) said the gap widened to 40
percent for part-time workers. It called for reform of equal pay
and sex discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: "Women workers have
put up with poor pay because of institutionalized discrimination
and the fact that society has traditionally undervalued the kind
of work they do."

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Honors Jamaican Nonprofit Organization for Outstanding Work With Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children'
s Fund (UNICEF) Thursday gave its highest honor to the Rural
Family Support Organization (RuFamSo), a Jamaican nonprofit that
reaches out to children and adolescents in many of the country's
poorest communities.
</P>
<P>
The award was announced by the Executive Board of the UNICEF on
the final day of its spring meeting in New York. Joyce Jarrett,
executive director of the RuFamSo, accepted the award on behalf of
the organization.
</P>
<P>
Along with the Maurice Pate Award, the RuFamSo also received 25,
000 U.S. dollars of donation from the UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
The Maurice Pate Award was established in 1965 in memory of the
first Executive Director of the UNICEF, and the Pate Award fund
was created with money the UNICEF received when it won the 1965
Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
The Maurice Pate Award is given each year to an institution,
organization or individual whose work embodies the spirit of the
UNICEF's mission of protecting and promoting the health, welfare
and general well-being of children.
</P>
<P>
The RuFamSo works with children and teenagers in 60 of Jamaica'
s poorest communities, where a high prevalence of female-headed
households, teenage pregnancies, inadequate access to early
childhood services, and pervasive unemployment hinder the
development and well-being of children.
</P>
<P>
In the face of these challenges, the RuFamSo provides
educational support and skills training to teenage mothers, offers
vocational training to adolescent males, fights illiteracy with an
outreach effort called the "Uplifting Adolescents Program," and
supports the health and well-being of very young children with its
"Roving Caregivers Program," which provides child-care education.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Raise Nuclear Electricity Ratio to 33 Pct by 2030: Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia will actively promote
national atomic industry in the future 50 years and plans to raise
the proportion of nuclear power from the present 14 percent to 33
percent of the country's needed electricity by 2030, the Russian
Atomic Energy Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power plants or NPP will generate 160 billion kWh of
electricity annually in the country by 2005, 205 billion kWh by
2010 and 235 billion kWh by 2020, the ministry said in a program
on the national nuclear industry's development by 2030 and 2050,
which was presented to a cabinet session Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the year of 2000-2001, NPP energy production will increase
by 20 billion kWh to 140 billion kWh, it said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has the uranium reserves and infrastructure to quadruple
the capacity at nuclear power plants, and by 2030 only a quarter
of the country's electricity will be generated using gas,
according to the program.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the ways to achieve the goals are to advance
the existing nuclear power systems, involving prolonging the life
of power generating units by 10 or 20 years, and to build new NPPs
to phase out the use of gas and heating oil in European Russia.
</P>
<P>
For example, Russia could become less reliant on gas by using
the Ignalina NPP in Lithuania, which will be churned out up to 16
billion kWh of electricity per year for Belarus and northwest
Russia, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Russia plans to spend 17.5 billion rubles (618.4 million U.S.
dollars) by 2005 in upgrading and extending the service life of
its first generation nuclear power producing units and another 65
billion rubles (2.30 billion dollars) in completing the five units
that are already nearly built or half-built.
</P>
<P>
The total investment requirement by 2010 would total some 380
billion rubles (13.4 billion dollars). And a special off-budget
investment fund could be set up to collect the money earmarked in
the tariffs for products and services of natural monopolies,
including some of the proceeds from gas exports.

MAPUTO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi stressed here on Thursday that his country has the right
to protect its sugar industry in face of dumping of foreign
products on its market.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement while the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has been mounting pressure upon his government to scale down
the protection.
</P>
<P>
He told a Maputo press briefing that withdrawal of the
protection at the time being would simply lead to the collapse of
the country's sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
Currently the Mozambican government discourages the dumping of
cheap imported sugar from neighboring countries through use of a
"reference price" system.
</P>
<P>
The government makes 385 U.S. dollars a ton for brown sugar,
and 405 dollars a ton for white reference prices for imported
products. Imported sugar that is cheaper than the reference price
must pay the difference at the border.

<P>
HARARE, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The core of Africa's development for
the future lies in smart partnerships initiated and developed by
Africans for Africans, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said this at the opening of a joint-venture between
Zimbabwe and Namibia of Cresta Lodge Pandu Ondangwa, about 700
kilometers north of Namibian capital Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "African people are mature enough not only to run
their own governments, but also to manage the economic affairs of
their countries and the continent."
</P>
<P>
He said the project showed that Africans were capable of
developing strong brands and did not need to rely on
international brand names to endorse their regional projects.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation between the various stakeholders in the
region will make southern Africa become the beacon for African
development in the 21st century, according to a report from the
Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe added Zimbabwe and Namibia were translating their
political and military partnership into social and economic
partnerships.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Angola has registered at least 2.5
million refugees since 1998 when the civil war recrudesced, said a
 report issued by the United Nations Office for Humanitarian Aid.
</P>
<P>
Information reaching here on Thursday quoted the report as
saying that the displaced Angolans are camped at some 120
settlement centers in the country's inland regions, with 36 of
which inaccessible to direct humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The provinces of Huambo, Bie (Center), Kuando Kubango
(Southeast), Huila (South), the northern Uige and Kwanza-norte are
among the UN agency's priority list for emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
The document said the World Food Program (WFP) has also noted a
 significant rise in the humanitarian assistance dependants in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A WFP appraisal made between March and April this year had
suggested that some 65,947 tons of food are urgently required to
feed the needy.
</P>
<P>
The WFP also warned that a break of the aid might occur in
August, if no fresh contributions from the international community
were made.

<P>
LAGOS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has declared
May 29 as "National Democracy Day" to mark the rebirth of
constitutional rule after long-term military rule of the country,
The Guardian, a leading newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Jerry Gana was quoted as saying after
Wednesday's weekly Federal Executive Council meeting in the
capital Abuja that May 29 would be observed yearly as work-free
day nationwide
</P>
<P>
Gana said the Council took the decision to afford Nigerians the
 opportunity of using the day to celebrate and reflect on the need
for an enduring democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Council, he said, also directed the Federal Ministry of
Education to evolve appropriate curriculum for the teaching of the
Nigerian constitution at the primary, post-primary and tertiary
school levels.
</P>
<P>
This year's celebration, which will climax on Monday, would be
marked by a joint session of the National Assembly to be addressed
by President Olusegun Obasanjo and a mass rally at the Eagle
Square in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
On May 29, 1999, Nigeria became a democratic nation with the
inauguration of democratically-elected President Olusegun
Obasanjo, henceforth ending 15 years of uninterrupted military
rule of the country.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Investigate Tax Frauds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- South African government will
launch intensive investigations into widespread customs and Value
Added Tax (VAT)- related frauds, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel
announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Opening debate on his ministry's budget vote in the National
Assembly in Cape Town, Manuel said: "I must mention that South
Africa is sadly plagued by low tax morality, which has led to an
increase in tax fraud and criminality."
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in the country's losing of an estimated 20
billion rand (about 2.85 billion U.S. dollars) a year, revealed
the minister.
</P>
<P>
"All in all, South Africa has too many people and businesses
who choose to ignore the full extent of their tax obligations,"
Manuel criticized.
</P>
<P>
The government's agencies concerned will take measures to root
out tax frauds by targeting specific industries and companies they
believe are guilty of these crimes, he said.

LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain Thursday expressed concern
at a call made by Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs, the country's
traditional powerful body, for the replacement of its prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs has
recommended the replacement of the democratically elected
government of Fiji with an interim administration, which would
include members of the group responsible for taking hostage Prime
Minister Chaudhry and members of his Cabinet," Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The use of armed force to achieve political ends cannot be
tolerated," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I urge Fijian leaders to resolve this crisis in a manner
consistent with democratic and constitutional principles and to
bring to justice those responsible for the forcible takeover of
the Fijian parliament and the kidnapping of the People's Coalition
Government," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhryby is currently held by
coup leader George Speight.
</P>

The country's Great Council of Chiefs Thursday urged Fiji's
president to replace Chaudhry and pardon Speight's gunmen, who

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian dollar hit its 10 month
low at 1.51 against one U.S. dollar Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The locally called loonie ended at 66.19 cents (U.S.), down 0.
14 cents from Tuesday, the lowest close since July 27, partly due
to fears that interest rates will rise faster in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Canada has recently raised its interest rates by
half a percentage point to 6 percent to keep pace with the U.S.
Federal Reserve while Statistics Canada reported a falling
inflation to 2.1 percent in April from 3 percent in the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
Some investors were reported to fear that Canada's central bank
may not be able to follow the Fed in raising the rates in the
coming months to keep the U.S. economy from being overheated.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian currency was also weakened by Wednesday's report
from the country's official statistical agency that activity in 10
key sectors which tend to lead the overall economy slipped to 0.9
percent last month from 1.2 percent in March.

<P>
PARIS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- France will send arms to Senegal for
the latter's participation in a United Nations peacekeeping
mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R.Congo), said
French officials Thursday.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin made the promise during a
meeting with visiting Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade.
</P>
<P>
Senegal is in charge of commanding the Force of United Nations
Mission in Congo which is expected to be deployed in the D.R.
Congo in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France has made clear that Senegal cannot use the
arms provided by France in its civil war with rebels in the
southern region of Casamance.
</P>
<P>
France has encouraged African states to build their own
peacekeeping capacities and has set up a military aid program
called "Reinforcement of African Capacities of Peacekeeping."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Jeune Afrique-L'Intelligent daily
published in Paris Tuesday, Wade said that Senegal needs more
French arms aid to counterbalance armament by its neighboring
countries, in particular Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
France has a bilateral defense pact with Senegal and has 1,300
troops permanently deployed in the western African state.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Leading cycling officials met here
Thursday to discuss a new form of screening for the banned drug
EPO and ways to stop its use in this summer's Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
Hein Verbruggen, president of the International Cycling Union (
UCI), and a French delegation including Tour de France director
Jean-Marie Leblanc were examining the process for detecting the
drug devised by the Chatenay-Malabry laboratory near Paris.
</P>
<P>
Joining Leblanc from France was Daniel Baal, president of the
French cycling federation and the laboratory head Jacques de
Ceaurris.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Manolo Saiz, representing the international association
of cycling groups, was also present.
</P>
<P>
If a cyclist's red cells count is found to be higher than the
regulated threshold of 50 percent, it is usually associated with
the use of EPO, which boosts the amount of oxygen-carrying red
cells in the blood, thereby increasing a rider's resistance to
fatigue.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Returns Home From Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani returned home from Bahrain on Thursday, after
agreeing to resume operations of the Qatari-Bahraini Supreme
Committee tasked to work out ways to bolster the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad al-Thani, who arrived in Manama Wednesday, held
talks later in the day with Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa al-
Khalifa on the latest developments of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
According to a final communique issued after the meeting, the
two leaders agreed to resume the work of the joint committee after
the International Court of Justice ruled on their border dispute.
</P>
<P>
"Work of the Joint Supreme Committee will be resumed after the
International Court of Justice issued a final ruling over the
border dispute," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Doha and Manama are locked in a dispute over several small but
potentially oil-and-gas-rich Gulf isles, including the Hawar
islands, which are controlled by Bahrain since the 1930s but also
claimed by Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been taken to the International Court of Justice
in Hague, the Netherlands, pending a verdict.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain had agreed last December to set up a joint
committee chaired by their crown princes to try to settle the
border dispute through cordial means.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the case will be withdrawn if an "
acceptable solution is reached by the joint committee before the
court's verdict."
</P>
<P>
But last Friday, Bahrain halted operations of the committee on
grounds that "Qatar referred the issue to the Hague international
court and that it did not receive any positive response from Qatar
over the recommendations made to solve the border dispute."
</P>
<P>
Bahrain, which prefers a bilateral compromise solution,
considered Qatar's reference to the court as stepping over the
mediation efforts by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE).
</P>
<P>
But the Qatari Foreign Ministry said last Monday that its demand
for a court's verdict on the dispute did not jeopardize the
mediations by other countries.
</P>
<P>
Resorting to the International Court of Justice was "in line
with the agreements of 1987 and 1990, which were signed by the two
countries as part of the Saudi mediation," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Embarks on Visit to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
left here Thursday for Britain on his way to the United States for
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton over bilateral ties and
developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Abdullah and Clinton, expected to be held in
the first week of June, will deal with Middle East issues,
particularly the security prospect after Israel's sudden troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The king's 10-day visit to the U.S. provides "an excellent
opportunity to reinforce the strong partnership between Jordan and
the U.S.," said U.S. Ambassador to Amman William Burns in a
statement issued before the king's departure.
</P>
<P>
Washington takes Jordan as a strategic ally in the Arab world
and provided some 300 million U.S. dollars in various economic and
military aid packages to the kingdom in 1999 to reward its role as
a major peace broker in the fragile Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the second
Arab country after Egypt to reach such a peace deal with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Abdullah is also expected to meet with leaders
of the American business community and visit information technology
firms and parks, as his kingdom, given its sparse natural
resources, is striving to develop itself into an IT and computer
software center in the Middle East as part of its strategic options
to develop the national economy.

NEW YORK, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Police Thursday hunted two men who
walked into a Wendy's restaurant at closing time and fatally shot
five employees during an apparent robbery.
</P>
<P>
Two other workers were wounded, and one of them remained in
critical situation.
</P>
<P>
Police responding to a robbery call early Thursday saw the
wounded workers upstairs and broke through the locked glass door
to help them, Chief of Detectives William Allee said at a news

</P>
<P>
The other five were found in a basement walk-in refrigerator,
their hands behind their backs and their mouths taped shut. All
but one died at the restaurant in the Flushing Section of Queens.
The fifth died soon after arriving at a hospital.
</P>

the suspects as two men whose ages range from 18 to 20.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows 5.4 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy, driven by
brisk consumer and government spending, increased at an annual
rate of 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 2000, the Commerce
Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The January-to-March increase in the gross domestic product (
GDP), the nation's total output of goods and services, matched the
government's previous estimate and followed the fourth quarter's 7.
3 percent rate of growth, the best showing in nearly 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Robust spending by consumers and by state and local governments
helped boost first-quarter economic growth, while the trade
deficit and slower buildup of businesses' inventories subtracted
from it.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending in the first quarter grew at a strong 7.5
percent rate, the largest increase since 1985. The revised
estimate was not as brisk as previously estimated but was well
ahead of the 5.9 percent rate posted in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Plentiful jobs, stock market gains and rising incomes have put
Americans in the buying mood.
</P>
<P>
All that spending, pulled the nation's savings rate, savings as
a percentage of disposable income, to a quarterly low of 0.6
percent, worse than the government's initial estimate and down
from the previous all-time low of 1.8 percent recorded in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Businesses, confident that consumers will continue spending,
boosted investment in new equipment and plants in the first
quarter by a rate of 25.2 percent, stronger than the government's
previous estimate, easily surpassing the 2.9 percent rate recorded
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to first-quarter growth was spending by state
and local governments which grew at a 7 percent rate, slightly
less than previously estimated, but up from the fourth quarter's 6.
4 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit, however, continued to be a drag on
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, businesses increased their inventories 30.5 billion
U.S. dollars in the first quarter, down from 66.7 billion dollars
in the fourth quarter. The change in inventories subtracted 1.43
percentage points from the first-quarter GDP growth, after adding
1.24 percentage points to the fourth-quarter growth.
</P>
<P>
The first-quarter performance was faster than the rate of 3.5
percent to 4 percent that the Federal Reserve regards as the pace
that can be sustained without sparking inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has boosted interest rates six times since June,
including a half-point increase last week, in an effort to slow
the economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to personal consumption expenditures
that is closely watched by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan rose at an
annual rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter, slightly less
than the government estimated one month ago. Surging energy prices
accounted for most of the gain. The inflation measure rose at a 2.
5 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's report also said that after-tax profits of U.S.
corporations increased by 4 percent to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 635 billion dollars in the first quarter, up from a
2.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter. After-tax profits rose
11.4 percent from the first quarter a year ago.

<HEADLINE> ANC Wants to See Free, Fair Elections in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 JOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- South African ruling party,
the African National Congress (ANC), on Thursday dismissed fears
that violence in Zimbabwe would prevent the country from holding
free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, like South Africa in its first democratic election,
should be given a chance, ANC Chief Tony Yengeni, said.
</P>
<P>
 He said violence had continued in South Africa until the 1994
 elections.
</P>
<P>
That violence was worse than what was now being experienced in
Zimbabwe, but nothing could stop the South African people from
holding elections, Yengeni said.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day we had free and fair elections, despite
the violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ANC did not believe different standards should be applied
to Zimbabwe, Yengeni said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to reports that the position in Zimbabwe was denied
access to state-controlled media, Yengeni said: "That is exactly
the reason why we are going to Zimbabwe as MPs to look at the
situation ourselves."
</P>
<P>
The South African Parliament will send 20 members of
parliament to observe the elections on June 24 and 25, up from an
initial seven.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Yengeni, will consist of members from
different political parties.
</P>
<P>
The MPs would leave "soonest" to observe the run-up to the
poll, election day itself and the post-election period.
</P>
<P>
 Another four MPs would also form part of a Southern African
Development Community observer delegation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Calls For Peaceful Resolutions to African Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge Thursday called upon African leaders to promote peaceful
resolutions to conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In a statement marking the Africa Day celebrations, Mudenge
said the leaders should respect the mechanisms in place to avoid
the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that African countries have recourse to these
 mechanisms and respect their decisions if the mechanisms are
indeed to serve the purposes for which they were created," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was distressing that only a year after African
leaders proclaimed the year 2000 the year of peace that conflict
returned to Sierra Leone and war resumed between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The minister said African leaders were delighted by the peace
process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but called
upon the United Nations to speed up the deployment of
peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent soldiers to the DRC in 1998
to support the government of DRC President Lauren Kabila against
assaults from rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to appeal to our brothers in these and many more
similarly affected countries to forego war and seek peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Africa Day is celebrated throughout the continent on May 25 to
mark the launch of the Organization of African Unity in 1963 in
Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Somalia's RRA Stages Demonstration against Djibouti Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people on Thursday
took to the streets of Baidoa town, some 250 kilometers southwest
from the capital, protesting against the on-going conference for
the reconciliation of Somalia in Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The rally sponsored by the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA)
officials in Baidoa was in response to the latest developments
achieved by the main traditional leaders of Somalia now attending
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators carried placards and shouted against the
Djibouti government as well as the meeting in Arta, some 40
kilometers north of the capital Djibouti, for the restoration of
Somali fragmented nationhood.
</P>
<P>
In an official letter signed by the RRA chairman Colonel Hassan
Mohamed Nur Shargudud, the RRA said they are totally boycotting
the conference.
</P>
<P>
The letter urged the government of Djibouti to return back the
72-member Rahanwein delegation now attending the conference in
Arta.
</P>
<P>
The letter has appealed to the international community not to
assist the government of Djibouti for what it called its plot
against the Somalis in general.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the RRA officials have been angered by
comments made by the political advisor of Djibouti President
Ismail Omar Ghelleh over the current reconciliation efforts for
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the BBC, the political advisor of
President Ghelleh, Osman Ahmed Yussuf, said all clannish
differences had been solved including that between the Rahanwein
and Habar Gidir clans who have been fighting for control of Bay
and Bakol regions for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
The RRA officials also dissatisfied at comments made by the
main traditional leaders of the Rahanwein communities including
Sultan Malaq Mukhtar on the Djibouti television Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Malaq Mukhtar spoke about the dramatic developments they had
achieved in regard to the general reconciliation with the Somali
communities as well as the differences among the Rahanwein people.
</P>
<P>
Despite the RRA leadership's boycott, most of the Rahanwein
politicians, intellectuals and civic society groups are attending
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the absence of main Somali warlords, such as
Hussein Aidid, Mohamed Qanyareh, Osman Ali Atto, Mohamed Ibrahim
Egal and Colonel Shargudud, from the meeting will remain to be a
little headache for the Djibouti government.
</P>
<P>
The Djibouti conference, which began in early May, has now
concluded its first part which dealt with the reconciling of
Somalia numerous clans with the traditional leaders playing the
most important role.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the meeting and the most complicated part
to deal with the political issues is likely to begin on Saturday.

after the Israeli pullout from the area, local radio reported
Thursday.

Armed personnel stopped people from entering the position and
six trucks removed the ruins of several cannon and many shells.
The military base was destroyed by Israeli planes Tuesday night
before Israeli troop withdrawal from all south Lebanon.

<P>
However, hundreds of cannonballs and some missiles were left
undetonated. On Wednesday, hundreds of Lebanese and resistance
guerrilla members rushed into the base to ransack magazines. (

SEOUL -- South Korea will bring a lawsuit against the United
States at the World Trade Organization (WTO) next week over its
unfair action on South Korea's exported steel pipes since last
February.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. action against the South Korean product is
discriminatory and goes against international trade regulations,
the South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has imposed 11 to 19 percent tariffs on South Korean-
made steel pipes over the next three years since last February. (

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Join U.N. Peacekeeping Mission in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Defense Minister Bjorn
Von Sydow said Thursday that Sweden will join the United Nations
peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow told the parliament that the government will send a
contingent of more than 40 personnel, including 6 officers and a
mine-sweeping unit, to join the U.N. peacekeeping force in
southern Lebanon from where Israel pulled out the last of its
troops on Wednesday to end a 22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
According to a government draft plan, the Swedish contingent
will set out for Lebanon by the end of June and serve a six-month
term. About 22.5 million crowns (2.5 million U.S. dollars) will
be needed for the mission.
</P>
<P>
Analyst says that sending more troops to Lebanon is beyond
Sweden's means since more than 850 Swedish peacekeeping troops are
now serving in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council on Monday, U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan proposed increasing U.N. peacekeepers in
Lebanon from some 4,500 troops to about 5,600 to confirm Israel's
withdrawal and then to 7,900 to help restore the authority of the
Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to work with the Lebanese government in assuring
their own control over the territory and maintain peace in that
part of the region," he said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that as soon as he had assurances of cooperation and
security for U.N. personnel, the United Nations would send
additional peacekeepers to Lebanon to "calm the situation."

<P>
BERLIN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras won an important warm-
up for next week's French Open with a straight-sets win over ATP
Champions Race leader Magnus Norman of Sweden at the World Team
Cup in Duesseldorf, Germany on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the Americans, with earlier defeats to Slovakia and Germany
in the event, have no chance of winning the Red Group to earn a
spot in Saturday's final.
</P>
<P>
Despite of back-to-back losses in the round-robin tournament
earlier this week, Sampras outscored the hard-hitting 23-year-old
Swede for a 6-3, 6-4 win.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to sharpen up his game for the French Open after an
injury break though, Sampras had lost to Dominik Hrbaty of
Slovakia on Sunday and Germany's Tommy Haas on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In other Red Group actions on Thursday, Hrbaty beat Germany's
Tommy Haas 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 to give Slovakia a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Sweden are even in the race to win a spot in the
final, against the winner of the Blue Group, with two wins from
two matches.

</P>
<P>
 MOFTEC Spokesman on Passage of PNTR Bill
</P>
<P>
The bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on keeping
permanent normal trade relation (PNTR) status with China is a wise
decision, a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
This will help the healthy and stable development of bilateral
trade and economic cooperation with China on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit, he added.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC Spokesman Hu Chusheng said that solving the PNTR issue
is the foundation and precondition to implement the Sino-U.S.
agreement on China's entry into the World Trade Organization,
noting that the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill
early Thursday morning (Beijing time).
</P>
<P>
 FM Spokeswoman on Passage of PNTR Bill
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here
today that the passage of the bill on China's Permanent Normal
Trade Relations (PNTR) status by the U.S. House of Representatives
is "wise."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives approved the bill in a 237-
197 vote.
</P>
<P>
It should be pointed out that PNTR status is an obligation of
the United States in accordance with World Trade Organization (WTO)
rules, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that settlement of the PNTR issue constitutes
the basis and prerequisite for carrying out the Sino-U.S.

China is a responsible country and will observe its commitments
made in any international agreement, said Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue here today when asked about whether China
will implement all WTO agreements after its entry.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Renewable Energy Consumer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China has become the world's largest
renewable energy consuming country, according to sources with the
International Symposium on Renewable Energy Development underway
here.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Ogutcu, principal administrator of the International
Energy Association, said that among the energy China is presently
using, one fourth is renewable energy, including water power,
bioenergy and solar energy.
</P>
<P>
Li Longxing, deputy secretary general of the World Energy
Council China Committee, said that China is second only to the
United States in energy consumption. But most of the energy China
uses is coal, which causes environmental problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the use of renewable energy can help make China
less reliable on traditional energy sources.
</P>
<P>
China has abundant resources of renewable energy. For example,
the country is able to produce 130 million kwh of hydro-
electricity every year.
</P>
<P>
Rural areas are leaders in use of renewable energies, such as
bio-gas and solar energy. Doing so in turn relieves the government
's burden of providing energy for the vast countryside.
</P>
<P>
China has also decided to promote wind power in coastal areas
and northwest hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
The country will increase use of renewable energy by 10 percent
annually, according to its five-year energy development plan.

<HEADLINE> Summary Meeting Held on Stopping Army From Involvement in Businesses (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
Central Committee, the State Council and the Central Military
Commission (CMC) jointly held a televised meeting here to sum up
the work of stopping the army, the armed police and law
enforcement departments from involvement in extracurricular
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice-chairman of the CMC,
addressed the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In July, 1998, the CPC Central Committee decided according to
the suggestion by Chinese President Jiang Zemin that the Chinese
army, the armed police, and law enforcement departments could no
longer be involved in business. The decision won the wholehearted
support of the Party, the military and the people.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the work has proceeded smoothly and
resulted in notable achievements, said Hu, also vice-president of
the country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the Chinese army, the armed police, and law
enforcement offices had severed their ties with their businesses
and enterprises. By end of this March, the work had been basically
completed and the goal realized, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
This has been a major move in the building of the Party and the
army, and a great achievement in the strengthening of a clean
party and government.

BEIRUT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese army took over a
position at a former Israeli artillery base on the hilltop of
Zafaty in south Lebanon after the Israeli pullout from the area,
local radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Armed personnel stopped people from entering the position and
six trucks removed the ruins of several cannon and many shells. The
military base was destroyed by Israeli planes Tuesday night before
Israeli troop withdrawal from all south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, hundreds of cannonballs and some missiles were left
undetonated. On Wednesday, hundreds of Lebanese and resistance
guerrilla members rushed into the base to ransack magazines.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lebanese Interior Minister Michel Murr has said
Lebanese government troops will not enter south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Orders Air Authorities to Ensure Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
ordered air authorities Thursday to adopt stricter measures to
ensure the safety of air passengers following a hijacking incident
in a Manila-bound flight.
</P>
<P>
Estrada gave the order after getting a briefing on the incident
involving a Philippine Airlines (PAL) Airbus 330 flight from Davao.
</P>
<P>
"The president said that everything possible should be done to
contain the situation and make sure all the passengers are safe,"
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The plane landed safely at the Ninoy Aquino International
Airport in Manila at 4:20 p.m. after an attempted mid-air hijack
failed. All 278 passengers and 13 crew members were safely
disembarked.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was on a routine flight, PR 812, from the southern
Davao City to Manila when a man wielding a pistol and a grenade
announced the hijack.
</P>
<P>
At around 3:18 p.m., just five minutes away from the flight's
estimated arrival in Manila of 3:23 p.m., the pilot in command,
Captain Edwin Nadurata, signaled a hijack situation.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft proceeded to circle over the greater Manila area
at an altitude of 6,000 feet (1,829 meters) while the crew tried
to reason with the hijacker, later identified by authorities as
Augusto Lacandula.
</P>
<P>
Lacandula was reportedly demanding the redirection of the plane
to Davao City, but the pilots said that the plane was running
short of fuel.
</P>
<P>
At around 4:00 p.m., the hijacker demanded that he be allowed
to leave the aircraft by a home-made parachute which he apparently
brought onboard.
</P>
<P>
After depressurizing the cabin and determining that the safety
of the aircraft would not be compromised, the captain acceded to
the demand.
</P>
<P>
At 4:10 p.m., the hijacker exited the plane by parachuting over
the Antipolo, Rizal Province. The hijacker is still at large while
the motives of the hijacking were not known.
</P>
<P>
This was the first attempted hijack of a PAL aircraft in 18
years.The last incident occurred on May 21, 1982, when a farmer
armed with a grenade seized control of a PAL plane before it
landed at Cebu on a flight from nearby Bacolod City.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Spend 1.5 Billion Dollars on Rural Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government will
spend a total of 1.5 billion U.S. dollars on a program of rural
infrastructure construction, Cronica Romana daily newspaper quoted
a top official as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Public Works Minister Nicolae Noica said that the program,
outlined shortly after the government was sworn in, is the first
national project in this field. Under the program, more than 2,
300 kilometers of rural roads and water supply facilities in 2,000
villages will be built.
</P>
<P>
The government has spent as much as 590 billion lei (one U.S.
dollar equaled 3,100 lei in early 1996 and 19,000 at the end of
1999) during the 1996-1999 period to build roads and 380 billion
lei for water supply facilities.
</P>
<P>
An international auction was held in 1998 to collect money for
the program. The Deutsche Bank AG London agreed in March to
provide a loan to finance the construction of water supply
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Rural areas account for about 90 percent of Romania's territory
and more than 45 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Noica said village modernization is a priority of his ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Some European countries deemed it
necessary to harmonize their penal laws in order to facilitate
joint fight against cross-border economic crimes at a forum opened
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The forum on fighting economic crimes and relevant legislation
was held in response to increased cross-border crimes following
the elimination of trade boundaries.
</P>
<P>
"Economic boundaries have been opened, which, unfortunately,
allowed crimes to wander about. The boundaries raised by the law
are rigid and that in turn favors crimes and criminals," Romanian
Justice Minister Valeriu Stoica said in an opening speech.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the forum stressed that harmonizing European
penal laws was a prerequisite for an effective joint war against
fraud and organized crimes at both national and transnational
levels.
</P>
<P>
The forum was jointly sponsored by the European Union's
executive body, the European Commission, and the Romanian Research

GUILIN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Gongcheng County of south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region don't get too excited
about their 20-year practice of using methane gas from animal
droppings as a source of fuel.

But a group of foreign experts attending a world energy

Council, said that more than 1.6 billion rural people in world
still use conventional energy sources, such as burning timber and
straw.
</P>
<P>
"China is the largest user of bio-energy in the world, and its
experience can be borrowed by other developing countries," Murray
said.
</P>
<P>
No region in China has more marsh methane than Gongcheng County,
where 70 percent of the rural families have access to it.
</P>
<P>
An eight-cu-m marsh methane pond costs 800 yuan (about 96.4 U.S.
dollars) to build, a sum which can be borne by ordinary rural
family. The local government also subsidizes each rural family for
constructing marsh methane facilities, according to a local
agricultural official.
</P>
<P>
The county government of Gongcheng invested more than 600,000 (
about 72,289 U.S. dollars) in this regard last year. Local farmers
also use by-products of marsh methane to replace pesticide and
fertilizer, so every marsh methane pond is capable of producing 2,
000 yuan (240.9 U.S. dollars) in direct economic benefits annually.
</P>
<P>
Hilal A. Raza, director general of the Hydrocarbon Development
Institute of Pakistan, said that in Gongcheng County, farmers are
not only beneficiaries of marsh methane, but also main investors.

<HEADLINE> China's Use of Bio-Energy Fascinates Experts (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early 1980s, county residents suffered from shortages of
timber used for fuel. Local villagers recalled that some people
risked their lives to climb steep mountains far away to get
firewood. Finding a new source of energy that could replace timber
as fuel became imperative.
</P>
<P>
Two decades later, the popular use of marsh methane has saved
70 percent of Gongcheng's forest resources from destruction. The
forest cover in the county is 74 percent, creeks flow down from
the mountain tops, and trees watered with by-products from marsh
methane processing have become pest resistant.
</P>
<P>
Gongcheng County has grown into an important fruit production
base in China, and persimmons, shaddocks and tangerines produced
here are labeled as green-food products.
</P>
<P>
Wu Libin, with the China Bio-gas Association, said that by late
1999, 7.6 million rural families in China had built marsh methane
ponds, capable of producing 1.5 billion cu m of methane a year.
</P>
<P>
This bio-energy technology helps form a complete eco-
agricultural cycle, starting with local conditions and moving on
to planting skills and breeding technology.
</P>
<P>
Wu said there are more than 100 other counties like Gongcheng
experimenting with ecological agriculture, and some 10,000
organizations across the country offer technical services on
renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, China spent six billion yuan (about 723
million U.S. dollars) on these eco-agricultural experimental bases,
and the investment produced 13.7 billion yuan (1.65 billion U.S.
dollars) in direct economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
In these bases, renewable energy such as marsh methane, solar
and wind power, as well as tidal power has replaced traditional
timber resources to become major energy sources for rural living.
</P>
<P>
An expert with the China National Energy Research Center said
the annual use of new and renewable energy in China is equivalent
to 300 million tons of standard coal.

<HEADLINE> ROK to Play a Role in West China's Development: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Kwon Byong-hyon, ambassador of the
Republic of Korea (ROK) to China, has said here that his country
will play a role in the development of China's western regions.
</P>
<P>
During a recent tour of the region, Kwon said that recent years
have witnessed rapid development of ROK-China economic cooperation.
However, the ROK's investment focused on China's developed
southeast regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's decision on the strategy of developing its central and
western regions offered an opportunity for ROK to invest in China'
s west, he said in an interveiw.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a bright prospect for the cooperation
between the ROK and Gansu Province in northwest China because the
ROK is competitive in the fields of automobiles, electronics and
machine building, and has experience in the infrastructure sector.
The country is interested in cooperating with the province in the
hi-tech field, traditional Chinese medicine and exploration of
mineral resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ROK is also interested in the ecological protection in
Gansu, he said.
</P>
<P>
ROK has offered the province a long-term preferential loan of
50 million U.S. dollars for upgrading its running water system. A
feasibility study is underway for building a forest belt in the
province, with an annual investment of one million U.S. dollars
from the ROK side.

<HEADLINE> China Builds Advanced Space Observation, Control Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China has created an advanced space
observation and control network that over the next ten years can
meet the requirements of China's medium- and low-altitude orbit
satellites and some high-altitude satellites.
</P>
<P>
The network includes a control center and several observation
and control stations that are linked by a telecommunications
system.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said today that as an important part of space
technology, the special technological network is designed for
tracking, observing and control of spacecraft such as rockets and
satellites.
</P>
<P>
The Internet-connected network is under remote surveillance and
control and is proved to be much more effective than its
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
The network was designed by Beijing Tracking and
Telecommunications Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Trial use of the network indicated that it could provide
observation and control support to the test launches and orbits of
carrier rockets and other spacecraft at different altitudes.
</P>
<P>
An expert from the research institute said the new network was
set up to cater to the rapid development of China's space
technology.

<HEADLINE> Manager Sentenced to Death for Embezzling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A former general manager of the Xi'an
Electro-mechanical Devices, in northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
was sentenced to death by a local court at the first trial today
for embezzling company funds.
</P>
<P>
In January, 1997, Zhou Changqing was scheduled to attend a
conference in Shenzhen of south China's Guangdong Province, but
instead went to Macao to gamble. After he lost all of his own cash,
he dipped into the 328,000 yuan (40,000 U.S. dollars) he was
carrying from his company and lost all of that, too.
</P>
<P>
Later, Zhou illegally withdrew 39,829,000 yuan (4,799 U.S.
dollars) from local branches of his company to gamble again.
</P>
<P>
In August that year, Zhou collaborated with another defendant,
Liu Xiaorong, to flee overseas. The pair got two cheques worth 11
million yuan (1.3 million U.S. dollars) under his company's name
from a bank.
</P>
<P>
Liu was nabbed by police in Guangzhou when he was checking out
at the customs in December 1997, and Zhou was apprehended in
Ecuador in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
During his post as general manager, Zhou embezzled 48,437,000
yuan (5,836,000 U.S. dollars) worth of company money, and
misappropriated 2,720,000 yuan (328,000 U.S. dollars) of public
funds.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was given the death penalty, his political rights were
deprived for life, and his personal property, valued at 50,000
yuan (6,000 U.S. dollars), was confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Liu received a life sentence, his political rights were
deprived for life and his personal property of 10,000 yuan was
confiscated.

<HEADLINE> Religious Circles Voice Support for Taiwan Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The religious circles in Beijing
gathered here today to voice their strong support for the central
government's recent statement on the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was issued on May 20 by the Taiwan Work
Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council following
the inauguration speech by the new leader of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Religious leaders from China's Catholic, Buddhist, Taoist,
Islamic and Christian communities held that the statement clearly
outlined the government's stance on the cross-Straits relations
and its strong opposition to Taiwan's independence and separation.
</P>
<P>
The statement has also reiterated the government's policy of
holding talks and negotiation on the basis of one-China, and
expressed the common wishes of people on both sides of the Straits,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The religious leaders noted that it is unwise for the new
Taiwan leader to sidestep the one-China principle, which is
against the trend of the times and the wishes of the majority of
people on both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
They called on the Taiwan authorities to abandon their stance
of Taiwan independence and revert to the one-China principle as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The earliest reunification of the motherland is in the best
interests of the Chinese nation. The religious circles are ready
to contribute to the ultimate reunification, they said.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was chaired by Fu Tieshan, member of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and chairman
of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association.

<HEADLINE> HK Gov't to Nurture Young Generation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government would carry out
comprehensive reforms with utmost determination and perseverance
in order to nurture the young generation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner reception on "Nurturing Future Leaders"
Thursday, Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, commissioner for labor of the
Hong Kong SAR, said human resources were the most valuable
investment and developing these resources was most rewarding in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR government was seeking an allocation of 246
million HK dollars (31.5 million U.S. dollars) from the Finance
Committee of the Legislative Council for the Youth Pre-employment
Training Program in the coming two years to benefit 24,000
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
"The government launched the program last September to provide
young school leavers with a range of employment related training.
It aimed at developing their self-confidence as well as improving
their inter-personal skills and job specific skills, thereby
enhancing their employability and abilities," Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
The first training program ended in March this year and
benefited over 10,000 youngsters. Many of them considered the
program extremely rewarding, Cheung noted, adding that at least 4,
000 trainees had secured jobs now.
</P>
<P>
"To provide more training and employment opportunities for the
trainees, we are adding a new On-the-Job Training Scheme to the
program. We will encourage employers who have manpower shortage to
nurture new blood through in-house training. The government will
share the training cost by granting subsidies to participating
employers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only education that met the requirements of
the day could ensure the young generation's ability in meeting
challenges in the rapidly changing world and contributing to the
future well-being of the society with new initiatives and creative
ideas.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that students, parents, schools and different sectors
of the community alike could all understand the importance of all-
round development and life-long learning and render their support
in action.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Post-Crisis Asia Challenged by Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Globalization amid technological
advancements is challenging Asia, which has just moved beyond the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It represents huge risks which, if not managed properly, will
cost dearly to both market players and the stability of the
financial systems as a whole," said Rebecca Lai, acting secretary
for financial services told the Regional Conference on Finance
entitled "Asia's New Financial Landscape &AMP; Opportunities" in Hong
Kong Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that in this new environment, the present
international
financial architecture (IFA), whose foundations were laid down in
1944 at the Bretton Woods conference, is outmoded, deficient, and
ill equipped.
</P>
<P>
"It cannot effectively deal with the systemic crisis, high
degree of volatility or risks associated with high capital
exposures and mobility," said Shamshad Akhtar, manager of
financial sector and industry division east of the Asia
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of capital flows, floating exchange rates,
fragile domestic
financial structures, financial and technological innovation and
new communication techniques have increased the volume of
financial transactions, fostered higher levels of competition, and
contributed to market volatility.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bank for International Settlement, the
external assets of the banking sector increased by 691 billion USD
to 9,864 billion USD from December 1997 to September 1999.
International debt securities held by banks rose by nearly half to
5,112 billion USD during the same period.
</P>
<P>
As economies become more interlinked with one another, domestic
measures alone appear to be insufficient to reduce the risks posed
by the global movement of massive and at times volatile capital
flows.
</P>
<P>
Development of a regional debt market and enhancement of
corporate governance are considered as two initiatives that can
strengthen risk management and competitiveness to harness the
forces of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Developing a regional debt market will minimize the risk of
liquidity crunch brought by over-reliance on short-term bank
lending and capital from the securities market. It will also
sharpen Asia's competitive edge by providing an alternative to the
mature debt markets in North America and Europe," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
"Transparency and accountability which are the core values of
corporate governance have become the minimum requirements if we
are to compete for foreign capital," she added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Knesset Solidarity Session Begins in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIRYAT SHEMONA, Northern Israel, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli
Knesset (parliament) held a "solidarity session" Thursday afternoon
in the northern border town of Kiryat Shemona.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak is expected to address the session,
which is aimed to show solidarity with residents in northern
Israel, and Knesset members from across political spectrum are
expected to attend the session.
</P>
<P>
However, deputies of the Israeli Arab's Hadash party will not
participate in the session.
</P>
<P>
The session is convened in Kiryat Shemona in spite of objection
from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which voiced concern over the
security condition in the town and suggested the session be held at
Rosh Pina, a northern Israeli town about 40 kilometers south of
Kiryat Shemona.
</P>
<P>
However, most Knesset members said the gesture will be pointless
if the venue is out of the "confrontation range." Then, Ruby
Rivlin, deputy speaker and whip of the opposition Likud party,
asked Knesset clerk Aryeh Hann to decide on a suitable place in
Kiryat Shemona.
</P>
<P>
The town, about 10 kilometers south of the border with Lebanon,
was within the range of cross-border Katyusha and mortar attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas, who had taken over south Lebanon after Israel
completed its hasty pullout from the so-called "security zone"
early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the residents of the town have fled to the
south for fear of guerrilla attacks in the wake of the Israeli
withdrawal. Life of those staying in the town, however, has
returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
The special Knesset session was also aimed to improve the
relations between Barak's One Israel ruling coalition and the
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Some influential opposition members, including Likud Chairman
Ariel Sharon, have reportedly changed their previous objection to
or doubts over the withdrawal and began to praise Barak's pullout
decision as "brave moves."
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the new solidarity between the coalition
and the opposition parties will make Barak's decision-making
regarding Lebanon somewhat easier.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet approved the withdrawal from the security
zone, set up by Israel in 1985 with a self-claimed aim to prevent
cross-border attacks, in March.
</P>
<P>
After the South Lebanon Army, the military ally of Israelis in
south Lebanon, soon disintegrated under the pressure of Hezbollah,
the Israelis quickened the pace of withdrawal and completed it
early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the withdrawal, Israel's northern border has been quiet.
Barak has repeatedly warned of harsh reprisals if civilians and the
army come under attack from across the border.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopes for Speedy Release of 21 Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government expressed
high hopes Thursday for the speedy and safe release of the 21
hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf in the southern Sulu province as
it prepares to resume negotiations with the extremist group Friday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential flagship committee chairman Robert Aventajado,
head of the negotiating panel tasked by President Joseph Estrada
to secure the hostages' safe release, said arrangements are now
being made for his meeting with the Abu Sayyaf's leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is doing his part to fulfill the order of President
Estrada for the hostages' safe release," Aventajado said in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects to join Farouq Hussein and former Libyan
Ambassador Abdul Rahab Azzarouq in meeting with all five leaders
of the Abu Sayyaf Friday in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Security for the meeting place will be provided by the
Philippine National Police and Special Air Force with the military
staying 500 meters away.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he added, the supply of food and medicines to
the hostages will continue, with a doctor taking regular pictures
and videos of them.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado also belied speculations that he has had a falling
out with Sulu Governor Abdusakar Tan, who met Tuesday with two of
the Abu Sayyaf's five leaders.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Tan went there at his request and immediately
informed him about the outcome of the meeting. Aventajado added
that Tan helped arrange the Friday meeting between the government
panel and the Abu Sayyaf leaders.
</P>
<P>
The 21 mostly foreign hostages were seized from diving resort
in Malaysia on April 23 and taken to Sulu by the Abu Sayyaf.

<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora made this clear in a
statement as he belied the charge of Manila Archbishop Jaime
Cardinal Sin that there is a vacuum of leadership in the
government when it comes to handling peace and order problems.
</P>
<P>
"The Cardinal's claim is not correct. For instance, we have a
clear cut program to address the situation in Mindanao, and its
residents know that," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said
Sin should see for himself how Estrada and his cabinet address the
daily problems that affect the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Puno, Estrada is working hard to resolve not only
the Mindanao hostage crisis, but also the economic problems now
affecting the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear the president is not just in control. He and his
cabinet are also working hard to address the problems of the
country,including those concerning our economy," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the cabinet is working under the close
guidance and direction of the President.
</P>
<P>
"So I don't know, with all due respect to our Cardinal, where
he based his statement on the supposed leadership vacuum in the
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Cardinal Sin's criticism on the government's handling of the
bombings in Metro Manila, Zamora pointed out that the president
has already ordered the police and military to take action against
their perpetrators.

Bastola said this on his return from the 9th ministerial level
talks on Bhutanese refugees held in Thimpu, Bhutan on May 22-25.
</P>
<P>
"The process for refugees categorization will start in a month'

and the two countries would go ahead with the categorization
process on their own.
</P>
<P>
In the previous eight rounds of ministerial talks on refugees,
the two countries have been bickering over the categorization
process.
</P>
<P>
The about 100,000 Bhutanese refugees living in eastern Nepal
since they were evicted from Bhutan in early 1990s will be divided
into four categories: bonafide Bhutanese who were forcibly evicted,
Bhutanese who emigrated under compelling circumstances, non-

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Sugar Mill Urges Not to Yield to IMF Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican largest sugar mill
threatened to withdraw its investment If the government yield to
IMF pressure to slash the protection for domestically produced
sugar, the independent newspaper " Metical" reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Marromeu sugar mill, on the south bank of the Zambezi
river, sabotaged by Renamo rebels in 1986, has been rehabilitated
by the Sena Company, a majority of whose shares are held by a
Mauritian consortium.
</P>
<P>
Sena company manager Anton de Wal told "Metical" that if the
IMF forces an end to the current protection, then "the result will
be the closure of the factories".
</P>
<P>
De Wal said the investors are reluctant to put any more money
into Marromeu, since they do not know what position the government
is taking towards the IMF's demands.
</P>
<P>
The Sena company had pledged investment of over 100 million
U.S. dollars in Marromeu, and so far put 26 million dollars into
repairing the factory and restoring 2,000 hectares of the 13,000
hectare plantation.
</P>
<P>
What really attracted investors was the government protection
against a flood of cheap imported sugar from neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The protection mechanism is a reference price for imported
sugar of 385 dollars a ton for brown sugar and 405 dollars a ton
for white sugar. Those who import sugar that is cheaper than the
reference price have to pay the difference at the border.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November last year an IMF team visiting Maputo told the
government the protection should be slashed, so that by 2002, the
reference price should be no more than 20 percent above the CIF
price. At that time sugar was at its lowest world market price for
a decade and a half -- about 150 dollars a ton.
</P>
<P>
The Sena Company had planned to take over another sabotaged
sugar plant at Luabo, on the north bank of the Zambezi. But it is
now dragging its feet on investing in a second plant. It will wait
for the government to give a definite indication of whether it
will yield to IMF pressure or not.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed up Development of Microelectronics Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China should work hard to turn its
microelectronics industry into a new economic growth point in the
next decade and develop more advanced technology, suggested
experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese
Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
The next ten years is the key period for the development of the
country's microelectronics industry, according to a report which
experts from the two academies submitted to the State Council in
April. The report was based on two years of research on the growth
of the microelectronics industry.
</P>
<P>
The report has put forward four goals which China's
microelectronics industry should hit by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The first goal is that the output value of the industry should
reach 200 billion yuan (about 24 billion US dollars), or four
percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that if China's consumption of integrated
circuits (IC) continues to grow by 30 percent a year, the total
consumption value of the Chinese market will be 600 billion yuan
by 2010. And if one-third of ICs are produced by domestic
manufacturers by then, it means that the country will have secured
the speedy, stable growth of the microelectronics industry.
</P>
<P>
The other goals include to design and produce chips of key
technology, to build up a positive circle of microelectronics
research, production and personnel training, and to develop some
major scientific results and high technology which are on a par
with the world advanced level.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total consumption value of China's IC
market was 43.6 billion yuan (about 5.2 billion US dollars) in
1999. Only one-fifth of the ICs were made in China, accounting for
0.6 percent of the world's total.

<HEADLINE> (More Added) China Reforms Urban Medical Care System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a key reform of
the urban medical care system with the aim of ensuring affordable,
fair, and quality medical services for everyone under a socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Major elements of the reform slated for the next two to three
years include allowing the establishment of for-profit hospitals,
improving community-based medical services, and lowering the price
of medicines and medical service, it was announced at a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The reform is expected to pave the way for the country's
painstaking creation of an urban medicare system.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, organized by the Information office of
the State Council, officials from the Economic Restructuring
Office (ERO) of the State Council, the Ministry of Health (MOH),
and the State Drug Administration explained key points of the
reform.
</P>
<P>
According to the reform, administrations of public health will
enhance macro-control of the entire health sector to achieve a
more balanced distribution of health care resources.
</P>
<P>
Song Xiaowu, director of the ERO's Department of Macroeconomic
Control, said that the reform is necessary because of the many
complaints resulting from an outdated system, such as health
resources highly concentrated in large hospitals but lacking in
grassroots medical institutions, and doctors prescribing expensive
medicine for profit.
</P>
<P>
He said various forms of hospital ownership should be
encouraged, and competitive mechanisms should be introduced in
hospitals so people will have more choices for better service.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals across the country are to be separated into two kinds,
commercial and non-profit. The latter run by the government, and
community and non-governmental organizations will continue to
dominate the market and provide basic health care.

<P>
Hospitals whose revenues rely heavily on drug sales will be
eventually weaned from their profitable pharmacies, said Wu
Mingjiang, director of the MOH's Department of Medical
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Pharmacies in outpatient departments will be transformed into
drugstores with independent accounting and tax liabilities as
required.
</P>
<P>
Wu also assured hospital workers that their incomes will be
guaranteed by imposing higher "technical fees" such as fees
charged for diagnosis, outpatient services, operations, and
nursing.
</P>
<P>
The future health system in urban areas will be composed of
community-based health care institutions and general and
specialized hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The community institutions will be responsible for disease
prevention, health promotion, health education, family planning
services, and the treatment and rehabilitation of common illnesses
and chronic diseases. Large hospitals will specialize in the
treatment of disease and clinical studies.
</P>
<P>
The reform also focuses on adjusting the structure of the
pharmaceutical industry by discouraging redundancy among small
drug manufacturers while prompting the formation of large
enterprise groups which will be in a better position to develop
new medicines.
</P>
<P>
Supervision of drug safety, from production to use, will be
enhanced as well.

<HEADLINE> Government Urged to Control Spread of HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) have urged the government to take measures to
control the spread of HIV/AIDS to avoid a future crisis.
</P>
<P>
The key to harnessing the deadly infectious disease lies in the
prevention of HIV/AIDS among drug addicts, prostitutes,
homosexuals and other people who are under greater threat of the
disease, experts from the Division of Biology in the CAS pointed
out in a report to the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Statistics in the report show that intravenous drug users are
China's biggest population of HIV/AIDS casualties. In some areas
in Yunnan, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Sichuan and Guangdong where there
are large numbers of drug addicts, the spread of HIV is rampant.
</P>
<P>
The report said that blood transfusions are another major
source of HIV infection, because some grass-roots hospitals in
China do not follow the rules of the Ministry of Health and still
use donated blood that has not undergone HIV testing.
</P>
<P>
The numbers of people who are infected through sexual contact
or from mothers to children are also increasing.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health estimated that the total number of HIV/
AIDS patients in China will reach 500,000 this year, and it might
be 20 times the figure by the year 2010 if no effective disease-
control measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
The CAS experts urged the government to issue laws and
regulations on the prevention of the disease.

<HEADLINE> S. African Firearms Control Bill Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Catholic
Bishops' Conference (SACBC) on Thursday welcomed the tabling in
Parliament of the draft Firearms Control Bill which was designed
to control the widespread availability of weapons in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The SACBC pointed out in a statement that on average 33 people
died every day in South Africa through injuries sustained from
firearms.
</P>
<P>
"We need to take immediate steps to remedy the situation and to
do this there needs to be stricter gun control than is currently
the case," the SACBC said.
</P>
<P>
The SACBC said firearms should only be available to those who
could show an extraordinary need and a high level of
responsibility in handling them.
</P>
<P>
It could never be only a question of what is in the interest
of the firearm owner, but more specifically what is in the
interests of the broader community. Arming civilians does not
contribute to a safer or more secure environment.
</P>
<P>
The SACBC said a culture of respect for life needed to be
fostered and this could be done by controlling the number of guns
in society and promoting more responsible ownership.
</P>
<P>
"This can only be done by finding alternative methods to
resolving conflict and not by encouraging people to use guns," the
SACBC said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) Air Force has played a big role planting trees in the
remote and mountainous western region of the country.
</P>
<P>
Since China began aero-planting trees 18 years ago, the Air
Force has made 11,338 flights to plant trees covering 866,000 ha.
of land in northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
An aero-transport regiment of the PLA Lanzhou Military Area,
which has been responsible for the afforestation program, has
tried diligently to upgrade their technology and equipment, and
the satellite automatic navigation system has been employed for
aero-planting.
</P>
<P>
Able to aero-plant trees on mountain slopes at an angle of 70
degrees, the Air Force regiment has reached the world level by all
standards of tree aero-planting, according to Zhong Weiguo,
political commissar of the region.
</P>
<P>
"As we are aero-planting trees in the vast mountains and
deserts, each of our flights is like opening a new route" he said.
The very low altitude flights required to plant trees are always
threatened by complicated geographical and climatic conditions, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> HK External Trade Posts Marked Increase in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports and
imports showed further marked increases in April 2000, external
trade figures released today by the Hong Kong Census and
Statistics Department show.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports, comprising re-exports and domestic
exports, increased notably by 15.5 percent in April 2000 over a
year earlier to 123.1 billion HK dollars (15.78 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within the total, the value of re-exports rose by 16.7 percent
to 109.4 billion HK dollars (14.02 billion U.S. dollars), and that
of domestic exports by 7.4 percent to 13.7 billion HK dollars (1.
75 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the value of imports also increased strongly, by
18.0 percent in April 2000 over a year ago to 133.6 billion HK
dollars (17.13 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 10.5 billion HK dollars (1.35
billion U.S. dollars), equivalent to 7.9 percent of the value of
imports, was recorded in April 2000, larger than the deficit of 6.
7 billion HK dollars (858.97 million U.S. dollars) recorded in
April 1999.
</P>
<P>
For the first four months of 2000 as a whole, the value of
total exports increased strongly by 18.7 percent over a year
earlier, and the value of imports rose by 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A government Secretariat spokesman noted that the value of
total exports recorded double-digit growth for the sixth month in
a row in April 2000, bolstered by strong import demand in all the
major markets.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also pointed out that the intake of imports for
local use remained strong in April, causing the visible trade
deficit to be higher than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
This nevertheless was associated with the further pick-up in
domestic demand and the process of inventory replenishment, along
with a more entrenched economic recovery, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Celebrate Victory Along Border with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
METULLA, Israel, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Lebanese
Thursday morning gathered on the Lebanon side of border fence at
the Good Fence Crossing in northern Israel to celebrate a national
holiday following the Israeli troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The jubilant Lebanese reveled at the reunification of their
homeland after Israel brought its two-decade occupation of south
Lebanon to a haste and disorderly end early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were waving Lebanese national flags and the
flags of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite Muslim militia who had been
spearheading fighting to end Israelis occupation, and shouting
slogans, such as "Deaths to Israelis" and "Hezbollah gets power."
</P>
<P>
The Israelis decided to withdraw troops from south Lebanon in
March, after Hezbollah guerrillas made the lives of Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) in the so-called security zone very hard and caused
great casualties.
</P>
<P>
The zone was set up by Israel in 1985 after two invasions, with
a self-claimed aim to protect its north from cross-border guerrilla
attacks. Since then, Most Lebanese have been barred from entering
into the area.
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged Lebanese, who preferred not to be named, said
Wednesday that he had not been in the Good Fence Crossing area for
24 years. Once he got the news from the television that Lebanon had
reclaimed its south, the men added, he just could not wait to come
there to embrace the land again.
</P>
<P>
Another Lebanese with traditional Arab kerchief, who also asked
anonymity, said:" Thank Allah (God), we returned to the land
finally. And Allah (God) Curse the evil Israelis."
</P>
<P>
The frolic children, who were brought there by their parents to
show them the land is theirs, were holding gun-toys, and posing for
Journalists on the Israeli side of the border fence, which is one
kilometer north of the town of Metulla.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Abbas, a Palestinian living in Lebanon as refugee
interviewed by Xinhua, said "We Palestinians should also fight for
taking over our land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as Hezbollah
had done in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are in the process of negotiating with Israel
in order to reach a peace agreement on final-status issues
including Jerusalem, border, Jewish settlements, water, security
and the return of Palestinian refugees. About 350,000 Palestinian
refugees are now residing in Lebanon and many are eager to come
back to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Nadoine Helad, a young Lebanese woman, said she never came to
the area before but now she can came there freely and the feeling
is very good.
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the jubilation and happiness of most
demonstrators, an old man, with tears in his eye, said that he
still can not return home he used to live two decades ago, as it
remains under control.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli withdrawal is not complete, he said, some areas now
on the current Israeli side of the fence are Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
As the Israelis had to fast wrap up their withdrawal plan in the
past few days due to the unexpectedly rapid collapse of their proxy
South Lebanese Army, the exact line of the international border
between Israel and Lebanon is still awaiting confirmation of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli soldiers opposite the demonstrators were embarrassed
by the taunts of Lebanese meters away. But there was no move from
Israeli side, except for the occasional patrol of armed vehicles
along the border fence.

<HEADLINE> URGENT Israeli Pullout Should Be Verified by U.N.: Hoss </HEADLINE>

BEIRUT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Al-Hoss
said Thursday that the Lebanese government troops will be deployed
in south Lebanon after the United Nations verifies that Israel has
withdrawn completely from the region.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark when inspecting the notorious Khiam prison as
part of his tour of south Lebanon in the wake of Israeli troop
withdrawal which Israel said completed early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hoss also said Lebanese resistance group Hezbollah, which has
taken outpost and areas vacated by Israeli troops and their proxy
South Lebanon Army, is a responsible force.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes Hezbollah will cooperate with the U.N.
peace-keeping force and the Lebanese government in maintaining the
security of south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Israel Ready to Cede Part of Disputed Farms to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Ministry issued a
statement Thursday, which said Israel was willing to cede part, not
the whole, of the disputed Shebaa Farms to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The statement was a response to earlier reports by Israeli media
that Prime Minister Ehud Barak had told French President Jacques
Chirac that he was considering withdrawing Israeli troops from the
entire farms.
</P>
<P>
The farms are on a slope of Mount Hermon now under Israeli
control. Israel said it seized the area from Syria in the 1967
Middle East War, but both Lebanon and Syria said the farms belong
to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The intended Israeli move was apparently aimed to deprive Syria
of any excuse to encourage Hezbollah guerrillas to continue
military attacks against Israel. Hezbollah has vowed to fight on
until Shebaa farms are returned and Lebanese detainees in Israel
freed.
</P>
<P>
However, what Barak told the French leader was that "only a
small part of the Shebaa Farms which is in Lebanese territory
according to the U.N. maps is going to be evacuated," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
There was no basis to reports that Israel intends to give up to
Lebanon those part of the farms that do not belong to Lebanon
according to United Nations maps, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The fertile farms are located between 400-2,000 meters of
altitude in the Har Dov military zone on the western foothills of
Mount Hermon on Syrian-Lebanese border, which was seized by Israel
in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. ruled on Tuesday that Israel does not have to leave the
farms.
</P>
<P>
Under the order of Barak, who is also defense minister, Israel
completed its troop withdrawal from south Lebanon early Wednesday,
ending 22 years of occupation of the border strip, where it set up
in 1985 a buffer zone to protect its north.
</P>
<P>
Barak also ordered the Israeli troops to pull out of Astra, one
of the three outposts in the Har Dov area. Hezbollah shelled
Israeli outposts in the area twice this week for the first time in
years.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military establishment said if Israeli outposts remain
in the area, Hezbollah might use Israel's presence as an excuse to
attack Israeli sites across the border.
</P>
<P>
Barak has warned Lebanon and Syria that any attack from Lebanon
against Israeli civilians and the army will meet with harsh
retaliation.

<HEADLINE> Wahid Backs Direct Presidential Election in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said here Thursday that the next Indonesian president and
vice president should be elected directly by the people, instead
of by the Peoples Consultatives Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
Wahid's statement came after factions in MPR, the country's
highest legislative body, agreed Wednesday on a constitutional
amendment on presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"If the president and vice president are still elected by the
MPR, that means our political system has not been mature," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, members of the MPR began tabling proposals for a
constitutional amendment on presidential election. Of the 11
factions, eight are supporting a new system for direct
presidential election in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Opposing the proposal are the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI P), societal group representatives and the faction
of the Indonesian Military/Police.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing constitution, president and vice
president of the country are elected by members of the MPR through
a general session which takes place every five years after general
election completed.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Needs New Economic Strategy: Advisor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Economic Advisor
Mustapa Mohamed Thursday stressed the need for the country to
formulate a new strategy to support further growth and to
strengthen its economic structure and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The fast paced development in information and communication
technology globally and the increasing role of knowledge-based
ventures must be taken into account, he said at a luncheon talk
here organized in conjunction with the one-day symposium on
Financial Markets in Malaysia: Challenges in The New Millennium.
</P>
<P>
The financial market must play a vital role in supporting the
new economic activities by providing alternative avenues to non-
bank forms of financing, and the market must have the capacity and
ability to provide effective and efficient financing to support
the country's goal of moving towards a K-based economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The advisor said that the big challenge for the financial
market in Malaysia is to recognize the rapid economic
transformation and to adapt as well as adjust to meet the changing
requirements for
financing in the new areas of economic activity.
</P>
<P>
He said the reason for this is that the new areas of growth
have different characteristics, which may limit access to the
traditional form of bank-based financing.
</P>
<P>
"Our financial market should be able to provide the necessary
infrastructure, such as flexible legal framework for venture
capital to operate and attractive exit mechanisms for venture
capital firms to reap profits from their investments," Mustapa
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that ultimately, it is in the interest of the financial
market participants to continually enhance their reliance,
efficiency and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"We can be assured of continued prosperity if the financial
market players are able to assume higher risks while remaining
efficient, competitive and resilient in the face of challenges,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said these characteristics would enable financial
market players to weather future challenges.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Travellers within East Africa will
no longer be required to produce yellow fever vaccination
certificates at immigration points, the New Vision reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move is meant to ease movement of East Africans within
member states in line with renewed activities of the East African
Cooperation (EAC), said a document signed by health officials from
Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The yellow fever vaccination certificate had been the only
health paper required for one to travel between the states, and
cholera had already been dropped, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
During a three-day EAC health sectoral meeting, officials from
the three countries also agreed to harmonize their health action
plans, exchange health information, and organize regular inter
sectoral meetings on control of pharmaceuticals, food products and
chemical substances.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which was held in Entebbe, Uganda, also formed

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Urges Rebels to Respond to Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has urged rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) to take
advantage of the amnesty and surrender in order to put an end to
the people's suffering.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the call when addressing the Gulu district
movement referendum committee at Acholi Inn on Wednesday,
according to a Thursday's press release from the President's
Office.
</P>
<P>
The people of Uganda have agreed to forgive the rebels for
whatever atrocities they committed against the population, said
the president, referring to the Amnesty Law which came into
effect early this year.
</P>
<P>
The government enacted the Amnesty Law to benefit all rebels
including their leaders, said Museveni.
</P>
<P>
He assured the rebels that those who surrender now will
automatically benefit from the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government had signed an agreement in Nairobi with
Sudan where it was agreed that Sudan would stop Joseph Kony,
leader of LRA rebels, from using bases in southern Sudan, said
Museveni.
</P>
<P>
He said Uganda fulfilled its part by releasing all the Sudanese
 prisoners of war and is now still waiting for Sudan to implement
its part of what was agreed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan was full of praise for Steve McManaman after watching him
help Real Madrid win the Champions' League final.
</P>
<P>
McManaman was one of the stars of the show as Real beat
Valencia 3-0 in Paris Wednesday evening, with his volley being the
pick of the goals.
</P>
<P>
The former Liverpool star is now guaranteed a place in Kevin
Keegan's Euro 2000 squad.
</P>
<P>
Keegan confirmed as much when he said: "Steve McManaman was
tremendous and, if he wasn't the man-of-the-match, then I don't
know who was - and there were a lot of great performances from
Real Madrid players."
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely delighted for him. We are looking forward to
seeing him join up with the squad and bringing the extra
confidence with him that he will have gained from such a great
result and performance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Keegan added: "I want him to go and enjoy things and I know
what it is like to play in a foreign side in a European Cup final.
Then he can come and join us, watch the Brazil game with us -
which he will not be considered for - and then hopefully focus on
Euro 2000."
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the final at the Stade de France, a delighted
McManaman said: "This is without a doubt the biggest game I've
ever played in and the fact that we've come out winners is
fantastic."
</P>
<P>
McManaman is now hoping to play an integral part of England's
campaign at Euro 2000, with Keegan most likely to utilize him on
the left flank.
</P>
<P>
"There's no problem, as long as I play it will be fantastic. I
know the lads are watching in Burnham and hopefully I'll see them
at the weekend," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Adds 810 Mln Yuan to Comprehensive Agro-Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China will spend 6.1 billion yuan
this year for comprehensive agriculture development, a rise of 810
million yuan over last year, according to an official from the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The fund, provided by the central government, also includes 607
million yuan in loans from the World Bank, said Wang Zheng, deputy
director of the State Office of Comprehensive Agriculture
Development under the ministry, at the National Work Conference on
Comprehensive Agriculture Development.
</P>
<P>
He said the increased funds will center on restructuring
agriculture, improving low- and medium-yield farmland, and
promoting agro-technology and the environment.
</P>
<P>
China has been successful in its wide-ranging agro-development
project launched in 1988. Statistics show that the project's pilot
zones, involving some 1,500 counties, have increased grain
production capacity by over 53 million tons annually, and farmers'
annual income there is 260 yuan higher than in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Funding for the project has come mainly from the central and
local governments, who have divided their investments equally, and
several bank loans and overseas contributions.

published a commentary titled "One-China Principle Is Definitely
Not a Question" critical of the Taiwan leader for his covert "
Taiwan independence" stance as revealed in his speech of May 20.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Taiwan leader said he "will not declare
independence," will not include the 'two-states remarks' into the
constitution," and "will not hold a referendum on the issue of
reunification and independence." All of this was said in a
negative and evasive way, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
He only mentioned "one China" once in his speech, while the
word "Taiwan" was repeated more than 40 times, the commentary said,
noting that considering that the theme of his speech was "Taiwan
Stands Up," the idea of "one China, one Taiwan" was concealed in
the speech.
</P>
<P>
As the Taiwan leader has not given up his "Taiwan independence"
stance, he has no sincerity and goodwill to create a "new age of
reconciliation," Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary went on to emphasize that the One-China
Principle is definitely not a "question," as it is the basic
premise for the reunification of China. It reiterated the
constant position of the Chinese government on the One-China
Principle that there is only one China in the world and that
Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China has sovereign rights over Taiwan has never
changed, it said, adding that the One-China Principle has been
widely recognized by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, the two sides have had political disputes, but they
have reached a consensus on the One-China Principle, which has
contributed to the long-time peace across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan leader called the One-China Principle a "question"
in his speech, which has the same nature as the "two-states remark
" and "two Chinese nations." The Chinese government and the
Chinese people will by no means accept anything like "one China,
one Taiwan" or "Taiwan independence," according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Acceptance or rejection of the One-China Principle has become
the main criterion for judging whether the Taiwan leader is going
to safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity, or
continue to stubbornly push forward the secessionist policy of "
Taiwan independence," Xinhua said.

<HEADLINE> China's Ethnic Minorities Support Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Beijing-based ethnic minority
leaders and notables from all walks of life held a symposium here
today to voice their strong support for the one China principle
and reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, who is of Tibetan origin and a vice
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), pointed out that the
one-China principle is strongly supported by the majority of
Chinese people all over the world, including Taiwan compatriots,
and the principle is also comprehensively accepted by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The reunification of the motherland is the common wish of all
ethnic minorities on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and is in
the interest of the people across the Straits, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pan Beilei who is of Gaoshan nationality and Taiwan origin, and
also a CPPCC Standing Committee member, said the new Taiwan leader
has adopted an evasive and ambiguous attitude and lacks sincerity
in improving cross-Straits relations, because he never mentioned "
Chinese people" or "reunification" in his May 20 speech.
</P>
<P>
Well-known musician Fu Gengchen called on the Taiwan
authorities to accept the one China principle.
</P>
<P>
"The reunification of the motherland is an irreversible
historic trend, and the peaceful reunification is the common wish
of all ethnic minorities including those in Taiwan", Fu said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Visits Lebanon in Wake of Israeli Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi arrived here Thursday morning on a one-day visit to
Lebanon, Oriental radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi is scheduled to visit south Lebanon, shortly after
Israel's withdrawal from the area, and deliver Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami's greetings to the Lebanese people, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi is the first high-ranking Iranian official to visit
Lebanon since the victory of Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Re-asserting Iran's support to Lebanon, Kharrazi said Lebanon
and Syria should continue the existing solidarity so as to face new
developments in the future.
</P>
<P>
He also delivered a letter from Khatami to Lebanese President
Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its full-scale withdrawal from south Lebanon
early Wednesday, ending its 22-year occupation in south Lebanon,
where it set up in 1985 a buffer-zone aimed to protect its north
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iran supports the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrilla group, the
most prominent Lebanese resistance force fighting to end Israeli
occupation over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Tehran supplies Hezbollah, or Party of God, with weapons
transported through Syria. Damascus, on the other hand, is the main
power broker in Lebanon where it deploys 35,000 troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A severe drought has been spreading
in east and central China, threatening the summer harvest and
limiting the supply of water to an increasing number of people and
their livestock.
</P>
<P>
According to information reaching here today, the drought has
affected at least 2.8 million hectares of crops and caused a
shortage of water for more than one million people and some 340,
000 head of livestock in Hubei Province in central China, and
Anhui and Jiangsu provinces in the east.
</P>
<P>
In Wuhan, capital of Hubei, local residents are experiencing
the driest weather in some 120 years, with 363,000 people and 100,
000 head of livestock short of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Anhui and Jiangsu, both located along the Huaihe River, one the
country's longest, are suffering their worst drought in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
In Anhui, the mainstream of the Huaihe River is nearly dry, and
hundreds of cargo ships have been held up at the river's ship
locks in Bengbu, a major provincial city.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 2.6 million hectares of farmland have been
affected, and 640,000 people have had difficulty getting drinking
water.

<TEXT>
<P>
The substantial reduction in tariffs and removal of many non-
tariff barriers that China has committed itself to in WTO
negotiations, will lower company costs in the global arena and may
facilitate the growth of Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China has recently joined the Agreement on Information
Technology and promised to remove tariffs on more than 300 key
information technology products within five years.
</P>
<P>
Long hopes this move will spur multinationals to invest in
China's IT sector, which may help China merge into the global IT
industry.
</P>
<P>
Instead of covering all sectors in production, Chinese
companies should make themselves one part of the global production
and sales framework, he said. For instance, while China aims to
establish its own auto industry, it will be prompted to turn to
purchasing components worldwide, which is more cost-efficient and
in turn conducive to the industry's competitiveness on the global
market.
</P>
<P>
Long also noted that China will undoubtedly carry out all its
promises made in the WTO negotiations amidst worries from United
States over China's credibility.
</P>
<P>
All the promises will become a reality because they also comply
with China's own interests, he said.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China's chief WTO negotiator Long
Yongtu said here today that China will conform to international
standards and practices in the process of merging itself into the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a symposium on WTO and enterprise management in
Shanghai, Long said China will take the initiative to promote
economic globalization, which is fundamental to the country's
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The 13-year-long negotiations for China's WTO entry are
preparation for taking part in globalization, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has just reached an agreement with the European Union on
its entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The U.S. House of
Representatives adopted the bill on permanent normal trade
relations (PNTR) with China on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Long underlined three priorities in China's participation of
globalization, stressing the importance of a market economy,
implementation of opening-up policies, and conforming with
international practices.
</P>
<P>
The WTO entry poses a great challenge to China's economic
administrations as the government must change its functions to
cater to requirements of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
China has pledged to reduce government intervention in
corporate affairs in its WTO negotiations, and urged enterprises
to protect themselves with regulations and rules, said Long.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Beginning this year, China will
increase by 1.3 million hectares the amount of water-saving
irrigated farmland annually in the project area for comprehensive
agriculture development.
</P>
<P>
Gao Anze, chief engineer of the Ministry of Water Resources,
said at the ongoing National Work Conference on Comprehensive
Agriculture Development here today that water-saving irrigation
will greatly increase water-use efficiency, and provide strong
support for the country's drive toward the modernization of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China is severely short of water resources, and its per capita
water accounts for only one-fourth of the world's average. It is
estimated that some 26 million hectares of farmland suffer from
droughts every year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, China has spent 35 billion yuan for
water-saving irrigation projects, and by the end of last year the
amount of water-saving irrigated farmland reached 17 million
hectares.

solve a series of key high-tech problems to pave the way for
massive offshore oil and gas development.
</P>
<P>
These technologies include offshore oil recovery, multi-wave
seismic data collection, and offshore oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
CAS President Lu Yongxiang noted that the CAS has always paid
great attention to solving key scientific and technological
problems in the country's important economic construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The CAS has achieved remarkable scientific research results in
offshore oil and gas exploration, geological and environmental
monitoring and appraisal, as well as many other offshore oil
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed the desire to apply scientific research
results to offshore oil production as soon as possible in a bid to
meet the target of enhancing oil and gas output equivalent to 40
million tons of oil by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Hospitals to Be Divided into Commercial and Non-profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China's public health authorities
have given the green light to commercial hospitals as part of the
country's new medical care system, which is undergoing drastic
reform.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals should be separated into two categories - commercial
and non-profit - to satisfy the varying demands for medical
services, an official with the Ministry of Health said here today.
</P>
<P>
Non-profit hospitals are mainly run by local governments,
enterprises, communities and non-governmental organizations, and
should guarantee basic medical care for the public, putting any
profits into improving medical equipment and introducing new
technology. These hospitals enjoy preferential tax treatment and
financial allocations.
</P>
<P>
Commercial hospitals will have the freedom to decide their own
fees, but will have to pay taxes according to regulations, said Wu
Mingjiang, director of the MOH's Department of Medical
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals have long been considered public benefit institutions
in China because they were funded by the government as a part of
the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
However, privately owned, joint-stock, and foreign joint-
venture hospitals have been burgeoning in recent years, though
they still make up only a tiny percentage of the country's 16,600
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Public health specialists believe that this new system may help
improve the quality of hospital services since competition would
be prompted.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of the reform is to provide affordable, fair, and
quality health care service to the people. I believe that most
patients can be benefited from the reform," Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Levy Clarifies Israeli Policy on Alleged Armenian Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
has delivered a letter to his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem in an
effort to make clear Israeli position on the alleged Armenian
genocide and put bilateral relations back on track.
</P>
<P>
Levy reiterated in the letter that the Israeli government is
clinging to its policy that the alleged Armenian Genocide should be
discussed by historians, not by politicians or diplomats, Turkish
Daily News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ties between the two countries became strained after two
Israeli ministers said Turkey should admit the fact that Armenians
were massacred ethnically by Turks during the first World War.
</P>
<P>
Armenia is pushing for a bill condemning Turkey and trying to
win sympathy from the world.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was outraged by the remarks of the two Israeli ministers
because it has claimed that the killings were the unfortunate
outgrowth of deportations intended to prevent Armenians from
assisting the invading Russian armies at that time.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel, which have had close ties since early 1990s,
distanced each other after Ankara reacted by not allowing its high
ranking officials to attend the Israeli national day reception held
at the Israeli embassy to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Levy stressed that the two ministers' statements on the issue in
no way reflected the Israeli government's position, expressing his
wish to maintain the already excellent relations with Turkey on
every level. 
</P>
<P>
While Israeli sources argued that the issue is now over once and
for all, Turkish diplomatic sources stated that the crisis is over
for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said that Ankara views the Armenian genocide
allegations seriously, adding that they expected not to hear
further statements from Israeli ministers over the issue, which
could damage close bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have enjoyed very good relations in recent
years following the signing of agreements to boost cooperations in
political, economic, cultural and even military fields.

<HEADLINE> Israel May Withdraw From Shebaa Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel is considering to hand over
the disputed Shebaa Farms area to Lebanon, Israel Radio reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak informed foreign leaders he was
considering withdrawing from the farms, which Israel said it seized
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War but both Lebanon and Syria
said belongs to Lebanon, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the United Nations ruled that Israel does not have
to leave the farms, but Barak told French leaders that he has
decided to have a "total withdrawal" from Lebanon to deprive Syria
of any excuse to encourage the Hezbollah guerrilla group to conduct
military attacks against Israel, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Ordered by Barak, Israel completed its troop withdrawal from
south Lebanon early Wednesday. Barak also ordered the Israeli
troops to pull out of Astra, one of the three outposts in the Har
Dov area on the western foothills of Israel-occupied Mount Hermon,
where the farms located.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, vowed to continue fighting as long
as Israel remained in the Har Dov area, and it shelled the outposts
in the area twice this week for the first time in years.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military establishment said if Israeli outposts remain
in the area, Hezbollah might use Israel's presence as an excuse to
attack Israeli sites across the border.

NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's request for the resumption
of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan could be considered
by the board of the fund by late July, according to a news release
issued by the office of the IMF Resident Representative in Kenya
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions between the Kenyan authorities and the IMF
mission on Kenya's economic program have proceeded well and have

The key macro economic indicators of the east African country
have continued to be broadly stable, the IMF team concluded in the

<HEADLINE> Water Rationing Starts in Kenyan Capital From June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan capital Nairobi City
Council will begin rationing water supply for both residents and
industrial users next month, newspapers here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made Wednesday by acting general manager
Joseph Kimani of the City Water and Sewerage Department, who said
the city is currently experiencing a 50 percent water deficit.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers quoted Kimani as saying that unless water is
rationed, there is a looming danger of a serious shortage before
the short rains season begin in October.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Sasusmua Dam with a water capacity of 31 million
cubic meters now has less than 10 million cubic meters, and
Ndakaini Dam with the largest capacity of 70 million cubic meters
now has 35 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Kimani emphasized that water rationing was the only option to
ensure there is sufficient supply of water distributed within the
city until October.
</P>
<P>
Due to the long spell drought, Kenya is facing a severe water
problem nationwide which has affected power supply and farming.
</P>
<P>
The country has adopted an electricity rationing since last
September. On Tuesday, the government decided to spend around 121
million U.S. dollars in next four months to rent an emergency
diesel power plant to solve power shortage.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi on Wednesday appealed to the
international community for emergency food aid to 23 million
Kenyans facing starvation following the failure of the long rains
season.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Finishes Troop Withdrawal From Border With Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has completed its troop
withdrawal from the Uganda-Rwanda border, a Ugandan Army Spokesman
told Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal is now completed," John Katirima said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart
Paul Kagame agreed to reduce their troops on the common border to
the minimum level in the summit in Mwanza, Tanzania, on May 14.
</P>
<P>
Military chiefs of the two neighboring countries also reached a
 consensus to implement the agreement of the summit in their talks
in Kampala on May 15.
</P>
<P>
"One battalion has gone back to base in Mbarara while two
others have left for Kabarole, only those forces previously there
have remained," said Katirima.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman hoped that the Rwandans are doing the same "in
the spirit of the Mwanza summit and the Kampala meeting between
the commanders of the Rwanda Patriotic Army and the Uganda
People's Defence Forces".
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda amassed troops along their borders as tension
 escalated between the two countries after their troops clashed on
May 5 and 8 in Kisangani, the northeast city of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said Uganda and Rwanda are expected to
begin pulling their troops out of Kisangani on Thursday and the
process will take 16 days.
</P>
<P>
The two countries sent troops to support rival rebel factions
fighting against the DRC President Laurent Kabila.

<P>
SEOUL, May 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will bring a lawsuit
against the United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO)
next week over its unfair action on South Korea's exported steel
pipes since last February.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. action against the South Korean product is
discriminatory and goes against international trade regulations,
the South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has imposed 11 to 19 percent tariffs on South Korean-
made steel pipes over the next three years since last February.
</P>
<P>
The ministry made the decision to sue the United States
following consultations with South Korean steel product exporters,
who said the U.S. tariff slapping over the next three years is
unfair.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to take around a year for a WTO panel to rule on
the case.
</P>
<P>
So far, South Korea has filed three law actions against the
United States at the WTO with cases of DRAMs, color TVs and
stainless steel.

<HEADLINE> Sulfur Sorbent to Avoid Three Million Tons of Pollutant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A novel sulfur sorbent developed by
Chinese researchers will effectively reduce at least three million
tons of sulfur dioxide emission each year.
</P>
<P>
China's power plants and industrial boilers alone consume one
billion tons of coal each year. The emission of sulfur dioxide
will be cut by three million tons if 80 percent of the one billion
tons of coal were mixed with the sulfur sorbent, said Yuan
Zhongshan, an engineer with the Dalian Institute of Chemical
Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Air pollution caused by sulfur dioxide means 18.5 billion yuan
(2.2 billion U.S. dollars) of economic losses each year to China.
</P>
<P>
Yuan and his colleagues have done an experiment in the Anshan
Iron and Steel Complex, the oldest steel giant in China that burns
two million tons of coal each year to generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
Result of the experiment done in the complex's No. 1 Power
Plant showed that the steel giant will avoid emitting 15,000 tons
of sulfur dioxide if 80 percent of the coal were burnt together
with the sulfur sorbent.
</P>
<P>
The sulfur sorbent is made of waste lye from paper mills and
slag from iron and steel plants with no chemical additives.
</P>
<P>
"Burning the sorbent will not result in further pollution,"
Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Coal burning is blamed for deteriorating the air quality in
China. Seventy percent of air pollution is caused by burning coal.
</P>
<P>
Acid rain caused by sulfur dioxide in the air covers more than
one third of China.

<HEADLINE> Zambia not to Grant More Tax Concessions to Economic Sectors </HEADLINE>

<P>
LUSAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Finance Minister Katele
Kalumba has ruled out possibilities of more special tax
concessions to any economic sections in the country this year,
Times of Zambia reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Kalumba as saying Wednesday that the Zambian
government has made a commitment to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to adhere to the laid down economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
He said only the tax concessions announced in this year's
budget will be recognized.
</P>
<P>
Last week owners of the Kabwe cobalt processing plant appealed
to the government to reconsider its application for exemption from
duty and value added tax (VAT).
</P>
<P>
The plant felt the tax obligations are too harsh for a company
that has settled in a desolate town.
</P>
<P>
Without specific reference to the company, Kalumba said that
the government has put a legal framework that bars any granting of
tax exemptions beyond what was provided for in the budget.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot give tax concessions all over the place. If we start
doing that we will have a budget deficit. Then what will be given
to schools, to hospitals?" the minister asked.

LUSAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has condemned the killing by
Sierra Leone rebels of some captured U.N. peacekeepers and

Mando said in an interview on Wednesday: "It is a shame that

the rebels' country that the troops are protecting. How do you
kill people who want to bring peace to your country? It is a
disgrace for Africa."

advice from the United Nations, he was quoted as saying by the

BELGRADE -- Yugoslavia Wednesday accused Albanian President
Rexhep Mejdani of making an illegal visit to the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani's tour to Kosovo, which was made on Wednesday without
Yugoslavia's permission, is against international norms and
detrimental to stability in Kosovo, the state news agency Tanjug
said in an article. Mejdani's visit is illegal because Belgrade
severed diplomatic ties with Tirana on April 14, 1999, in the heat
of NATO's 78-day air strikes against Yugoslavia under the disguise
of averting "human rights disasters" in Kosovo. (Yugoslavia-

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday
afternoon passed a bill on permanent normal trade relations (PNTR)
with China, with a vote of 237-197 after more than seven hours'
heated debate.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which was jointly tabled by Representatives
Bill Archer (Republican), Philip M. Crane (Republican) and Robert
T. Matsui (Democrat), will terminate the annual review of China's
"most-favored-nation" (MFN) status (normal trade relations) in
accordance with certain provisions of the 1994 Trade Act, and
realize normal trade relations with China, after China joins the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
But the bill contains conditions that interfere in China's
internal affairs on the excuse of human rights and other issues.
The Chinese government has taken up the issue with the U.S. side
and expressed strong opposition and rejection to the conditions. (

TOKYO -- Takashi Fukaya, Japan's Minister of International

relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the passage marks a big step forward in
negotiations on China's membership of the World Trade Organization
(WTO)," Fukaya said in a statement.  "Japan has consistently
supported China's early accession to the WTO by such means as
reaching a bilateral market-access accord with China before the
United States and the European Union did," the Japanese trade
minister said. (Japan-China-PNTR)

the conflicts, said the report. (Yugoslavia-Russian Peacekeepers-

<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Croatia, a former Yugoslav
republic, was signed on Thursday into the security fold of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Partnership for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
The signing took place during a two-day NATO foreign ministers
council meeting and a get-together among NATO foreign ministers
and their counterparts from non-NATO countries affiliated with the
program.
</P>
<P>
Croatia has thus become the 46th PfP member and the 27th non-
NATO nation to be included in the program designed to coordinate
and cooperate across Europe and the trans-Atlantic region.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General George Robertson said prior to the
signing ceremony that almost every European country is sitting
around the same table with NATO "cooperating and not confronting
each other".
</P>
<P>
Croatia was admitted into the NATO PfP program for its "
increasing democratization following the take-over of the new
government", NATO sources said.

<HEADLINE> New Insects Found in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 new species of insects
have been found in the Tibet Autonomous Region, according to Wang
Baohai, a research fellow from the regional Agricultural Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Among the insect family, some ancient and rare varieties have
well been preserved, while new species are emerging, Wang said,
adding that Tibet boasts 4,200 kinds of insects, one-quarter of
which are unique to the region.
</P>
<P>
The distinctive climate and geographical conditions are the
cause of the insects' evolution and transformation, Wang said,
pointing to Tibet's high altitude.
</P>
<P>
Under such natural conditions, it is difficult for insects to
survive and they are inclined to change.
</P>
<P>
Of the insects distributed in China's high altitude and cold
areas, some 50 percent are found only in Tibet, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The evolution and distribution of Leptomias is a good example
to illustrate why some new species of insects are found in Tibet.
Leptomias insects have no back wings and can't fly, so it is hard
for them to spread to other places.
</P>
<P>
However, this kind of insect can easily adapt to its natural
environment, evolving into a unique variety of insect in Tibet,
said Wang.

recently as the government managed to keep the economy on track
amid widespread perceptions of political instability in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura stressed that the government will not intervene to
defend the peso at this time, adding that it will stick to the
general rule of letting market forces take over.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think intervention is necessary. We come in from time
to time to stop speculation, but generally we let market forces
take over," Buenaventura said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the peso slide reflects the global trend,
with other currencies similarly battered, as a result of the move
by the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, Buenaventura said the central bank is ready to
penalize any bank that takes advantage of the situation by
charging high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public anew not to engage in currency speculation
or hoard dollars. "These are unnecessary. It would be a waste," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has appealed for international assistance to prevent 23 million
Kenyans from starving in near future.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted Wednesday that 80 percent of the country's population
were likely to starve following the failure of the long rains from
March through May, according to a news release by the Presidential
Press Service.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the gloomy forecast, the president sent an
appeal to the United States, the European Union, the World Food
Program and other aid agencies for assistance in averting the
looming food crisis.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that many Kenyans were faced with a serious food
shortage because of the prolonged drought and urgent assistance
was needed.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Kenya has suffered from failures of
rainy seasons, leading to the power rationing since last
September. The shortfall of rains from March to May deteriorated
the situation further and water rationing in Kenya's capital
Nairobi will start in June.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
succeeded in cloning two white rabbits by making a gray rabbit
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
They have extracted karyons which carried DNA of a white rabbit
from its embryo. The karyons were then combined in a laboratory
with oocytes from another female white rabbit.
</P>
<P>
The two white rabbits have actually three mothers and one
father but did not inherit any genes from the gray rabbit,
according to researchers from Hebei and Shandong provinces who
have conducted the cloning research program, listed as one of
China's key national programs.
</P>
<P>
This was only an embryo cloning experiment, they said. Such a
cloning technology has not reached the level of Dolly, a sheep
cloned with a cell from a sheep's udder by British scientists four
years ago.

But the experiment has laid the foundation for developing China

<HEADLINE> All SOEs in North China Municipality to Make Profits in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, a traditional industrial
base in China, will spare no efforts to make all its State-owned
and State-controlled enterprises turn their losses into profits by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
After a two-year reform period, seventy large and medium-sized
SOE's are no longer in debt. Debt in SOEs and SCEs was 1 billion
yuan (120 million U.S. dollars) less than last year. However, they
are still in the red.
</P>
<P>
SOEs and SCEs in 20 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions across China ceased to make losses by the end of last year.
Tianjin is the only region in north China whose SOEs and SCEs are
still making losses.
</P>
<P>
Industrial enterprises in Tianjin have made 12.6 billion yuan (
1.5 billion U.S. dollars) in added value during the first quarter
of the year, up 13.4 percent compared with the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of SOEs was 8.3 percentage points higher than
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"Major industrial indexes are better than that of last year,"
said Bo Yun, chief accountant of the Tianjin Municipal Economic
Commission. "We are confident that the SOEs and SCEs will make up
deficits and make profits this year."
</P>
<P>
During the first two months, Tianjin's SOEs and SCEs ranked
first place in China in sales/output ratio.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A 26-year-old woman who was
recently kidnapped from her workplace and sold to a farmer in
Inner Mongolia has been rescued by local police, the Ministry of
Public Security said today.
</P>
<P>
The victim, who has the surname Zhang, is a clerk with the
Justice Bureau of Jiangyou in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
She was kidnapped and sold to a farmer in Xinghe County in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said that last December, two kidnappers
disguised as businessmen asked Zhang to act as a notary at an
agreement-signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
When Zhang arrived at the appointed place she was immediately
kidnapped and taken to Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to be sold
and forced to become a farmer's wife.
</P>
<P>
She repeatedly attempted to write SOS letters, but she was
denied any chance to mail them, because her "husband" and "father-
in-law" kept a close eye on her.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Zhang found out by watching news programs
on television that the Ministry of Public Security was launching
an anti-abduction drive. She tried to find some way to escape.
</P>
<P>
Finally, she got a chance to send an SOS letter to local police
with help of a visiting housewife.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers have been arrested. Zhang's "father-in-law" has
been detained but her "husband" is still at large, police said.

<HEADLINE> WB Offers Bangladesh Credit to Fight Malnutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will intensify its fight
against malnutrition with a credit of 92 million U.S. dollars from
the World Bank and the assistance from the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) and the government of the Netherlands,
The Independent newspaper reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Nutrition Project is the first of a series of
projects that will support the government's 15-year vision to
extend community nutrition services to the entire country under
the WB-supported Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project (BINP),
said the WB's Dhaka office.
</P>
<P>
The interest-free credit of 92 million dollars is provided by
the International Development Association, the WB's lending
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
The total project will cost 124.46 million dollars, of which 13.
7 million dollars will be provided by the Bangladeshi government,
6.3 million dollars by the CIDA, and 12.5 million by the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Under the new project, about 30 percent of the rural population
and people living in two urban areas will receive community-based
nutritional services provided by non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
These services target nutritionally vulnerable groups such as
children under two, adolescent girls, and pregnant and breast-
feeding women. In addition to the expansion of community-level
services, national activities financed by the project include
behavior change, communication interventions and micro-nutrient
supplementation.
</P>
<P>
More than 5 million children and 1 million pregnant and breast-
feeding women will benefit from community nutrition services
provided under the project, which include monthly growth
monitoring for children under two, counseling and nutrition
education for mothers, and provision of supplementary food for
malnourished children and pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
Levels of malnutrition in Bangladesh remain the highest in the
world, with 600 to 700 children dying of malnutrition-related
causes in the country everyday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 percent of children under five are underweight and
more than half are stunted. The low birth weight rate is estimated
at 45 percent, probably the highest in the world, and almost half
of women suffer from chronic energy deficit with more than 70
percent of pregnant women being anemic.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A 17-year-old Nepali girl was
killed by her husband and mother-in-law Tuesday night because she
could not bring plenty of dowry for her husband's family,
according to a report reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The girl from Panchthar district in southern Terai plain was
beaten severely and fed with insecticide by her husband and mother-
in-law, the report quoted a local police officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
She died immediately after she was given poison.
</P>
<P>
The girl, named Nirmala Rijal, had been beaten from time to
time for not bringing enough dowry at her husband's home. Her
husband was arrested and pleaded guilty of murdering his wife, the
officer said.
</P>
<P>
The custom goes in Nepal, especially in the Terai area, that a
bride is supposed to bring heavy dowry to the bridegroom, or she
would be maltreated by the husband and the family. The custom
leads to many deaths of women in the Terai area every year.
</P>

For the same reason, a newly-wedded woman was reported to be
killed in a ruthless manner by her husband's family last month.

<HEADLINE> hke052515--Malaysia Announces Code of Conduct for Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Thursday published
the code of conduct for capital market institutions, requiring
them to ensure that regulatory processes within the market
institutions are clear, consistent, fair, equitable and
transparent.
</P>
<P>
The code would form the basis for each market institution to
establish detailed policies, procedures and decision-making
structures at all levels within the market institution, the
Securities Commission (SC) said in a statement here.
</P>
<P>
Corporate governance is relevant not only to companies but also
applicable to exchanges, clearing houses and central depositories
as well, the SC said.
</P>
<P>
These market institutions must act in the public interest and
in doing so, observe the highest standards of governance in
conducting their affairs, it said.
</P>
<P>
They must adopt the best practices of governance, particularly
in ensuring fairness and probity of regulatory and other decisions,
and see that procedures ensure accountability for decisions and
actions of market institutions and personnel within the market
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The code applies to all personnel of market institutions, with
emphasis on those individuals within the institutions who are
decision-makers handling confidential information, including the
directors, chief executive officers, members of any committee and
management of market institutions, it said.
</P>
<P>
There should be public disclosure of policies where possible
and at all times, communication policies should be in place to
make information accessible to market participants, it said,
adding that regulatory action might take the form of disciplinary
action such as reprimands, fines and suspension or termination of
membership.
</P>
<P>
The SC said that in the context of market institutions, it is
important to emphasize that individuals should uphold the
principle that the interests of the public should prevail over any
other conflicting interests.
</P>
<P>
If there is a conflict between the interests of the public and
the interests of the institution itself, decision-makers must
ensure that the interests of the public prevail, the SC stressed.

ZHENGZHOU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Luoyang in the hinterland
province of Henan in China has invited a group of experts from
Beijing University to map out a blueprint for developing local
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The plan gives details comparing the city with such big

Commerce Thursday welcomed the passage of Permanent Normal Trade
Relations (PNTR) status to China in the United States House of
Representatives.

more stable Sino-US trade relationship, which I think will
definitely enhance the bilateral relations between the two nations,
" said C C Tung, Chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of

<HEADLINE> China to Formulate New Rules on Medical Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese patients will have more
freedom to chose experts to judge who is responsible for medical
accidents, a Beijing-based newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Medical-accident disputes are judged by experts from local
hospitals who may have relations with the hospitals. Their
judgments are invariably biased.
</P>
<P>
"Victims and their relatives have lodged bitter complaints
against such practices, which have become much louder in recent
years," said the "China Quality News".
</P>
<P>
After exhaustive consultation with experts concerned, the
Ministry of Health seems to have made up its mind to replace the
12-year-old medical-accident-handling rules with new rules
expected to be issued in October.
</P>
<P>
Other rules have also been changed. Medical records long
monopolized by hospitals will be within the reach of patients and
compensation for the medical accidents will be raised.

<P>
MACAO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is planning some effective measures to
ensure that more investors have fair competition in the local
telecommunication market.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that new license for mobile phone
operation is expected to be issued in early June, and more telecom
services should get open gradually.
</P>
<P>
As both mobile and fixed phone services are held exclusively by
the Macao Telecommunication Company, new proprietors of mobile
phone service will have reasonable fees in connection with the
fixed telephone network, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
For the existence of new competitors, current mobile phone
users will be free to choose mobile phone service providers
together with their original phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government encourages new investors to
develop broadband Internet access.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Urged to Improve Trekking-Area Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists from Nepal and
abroad have appealed to the Nepali government to take actions to
improve what they described as "alarming environmental problems"
along Nepal's popular trekking routes.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter Wednesday, available to the press Thursday,
42 pro-environment trekkers from Austria, Germany, Switzerland and
Nepal called on the Nepali government as well as non-governmental
organizations to ponder ways to promote environmentally sound
trekking and make provision of incentive for people returning the
waste.
</P>
<P>
The 10-point suggestions, presented to the Ministry of Culture,
Tourism and Civil Aviation and Ministry of Population and
Environment, also included starting active patrolling by national
park rangers and making the travel and tour operators accountable
to the tourist-borne pollution problem.
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked to see garbage littered along the trekking
route, and we found the quantity of garbage more than we expected,
" they said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
The most popular trekking routes in Nepal are in Mt. Annapurna
and Mt. Qomolangma (the world highest peak) region.
</P>
<P>
Suggestions have also been made to increase the national park's
entrance fee and to impose a general tax waste "which might
increase the awareness to avoid excessive waste production."
</P>
<P>
Back Wednesday after completing the "5th Annual ATE (
Association of Trekking and Expedition Tourism) Clean Up Trek 2000
" in Mt. Qomolangma region, the 42-member clean-up trekking team
collected 42 sacks of garbage during its 15-day trek.
</P>
<P>
As the home of eight of the world's 14 peaks above 8,000 meters,
Nepal is a favorite destination for world trekkers and tourists.
However, a great influx of tourists and trekkers have brought
heavy pollution to the trekking areas, thus threatening the
fragile ecology in the areas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes Bill on China's PNTR Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Wednesday afternoon passed a bill on permanent
normal trade relations (PNTR) with China, with a vote of 237-197
after more than seven hours' heated debate.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which was jointly tabled by Representatives
Bill Archer (Republican), Philip M. Crane (Republican) and Robert
T. Matsui (Democrat), will terminate the annual review of China's
"most-favored-nation" (MFN) status (normal trade relations) in
accordance with certain provisions of the 1994 Trade Act, and
realize normal trade relations with China, after China joins the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
But the bill contains conditions that interfere in China's
internal affairs on the excuse of human rights and other issues.
The Chinese government has taken up the issue with the U.S. side
and expressed strong opposition and rejection to the conditions.
</P>
<P>
The House started debating the bill on Tuesday afternoon, which
was resumed at 10 a.m. and continued to 5 p.m. local time
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Many representatives argued that a solution to the issue of
permanent normal trade relations with China will help the United
States expand trade with and investment in China and access the
Chinese market, and that it is in the common interests of the
United States and China and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Congress schedule, the Senate will debate and
vote on the bill in early June.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that after the legislation is approved
by the two houses of Congress, the annual review of China's trade
status, which the United States has conducted for the past 20
years, will come to an end, and that this will be good for China
and the United States to develop healthy and stable economic and
trade ties on an equal and mutually-beneficial footing.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States established diplomatic ties in 1979
and signed a bilateral trade agreement in the same year, under
which the two countries are required to give each other the MFN
treatment.
</P>
<P>
But after the agreement went into effect in 1980, the U.S. side
started the annual review on whether or not to give the MFN to
China, in accordance with related articles of the 1974 trade act.
</P>
<P>
China's MFN status could only be extended for a year after a
bill on it was submitted by the U.S. president and approved by the
Congress before every June 3.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a tax reform
act, formally changing the parlance of the MFN into normal trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the two countries reached agreement on China's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
In March this year, Clinton submitted a legislation proposal to
Congress, urging the realization of permanent normal trade
relations with China by the United States after China joins the
WTO.

LOS ANGELES, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Led by a surge in the memory
segment, worldwide semiconductor revenue is forecasted to reach
222 billion U.S. dollars in 2000, up 31 percent from last year,
said a report released Wednesday.

chip market grew 22 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest said that the volatile dynamic random-access memory (
DRAM) market will provide much of the semiconductor industry's
short-term growth, with revenue forecast to grow from 23.1 billion
dollars in 1999 to 76 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
In mid-2002, the DRAM market will become oversupplied, leading
to price declines. Within the following 12 months, the foundry
market will also become oversupplied, triggering soft prices
across a range of semiconductor products.

WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday hailed the passage of a House bill on permanent normal
trade relations (PNTR) with China, saying it is in the interests
of both the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
"Today the House of Representatives has taken a historic step
toward continued prosperity in America," Clinton said shortly
after the House approved the legislation by a vote of 237-197.
</P>
<P>
"If the Senate votes as the House has just done, to extend
permanent normal trade relations with China, it will open new
doors of trade for America," he said.
</P>
<P>
The measure, if approved by the U.S. Senate early next month as
expected, would do away with discriminatory annual review of
China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most important votes the Senate will face
in this session," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, in a
statement issued after the passage of the bill, said the House
voted to advance the economic interests of the United States.

closer to taking full advantage of the benefits of this historic
agreement with China," she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Communities Welcome Passage of PNTR Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Major U.S. business associations
and leading companies extended welcome to Wednesday's bipartisan
House vote which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR)
to China.
</P>
<P>
"It's a victory of fact over fear and a historic win for the
American economy and our national security," said Thomas Donohue,
President of U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
"The truth about free trade won today," said Donohue. "PNTR
opens China's markets for American products, businesses and
farmers, and created jobs for workers here at home. Once Congress
focused on the facts, no amount of union pressure to isolate this
country could defeat the fact that this trade deal with China is
in America's best interest."
</P>
<P>
It was a bipartisan victory, noted Donohue, head of the world's
largest business federation representing more than three million
businesses and organizations of every size, sector and region.
</P>
<P>
And Tim Timken, vice chairman of the National Association of
Manufacturers said they are witnessing the birth of a new
relationship between the United States and China that will benefit
the peoples of both nations economically and socially.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the vote, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and
chief software architect, called Wednesday "a great day for
America."
</P>
<P>
He said the passage of the PNTR bill will foster closer contact
between Chinese citizens and Americans as trade barriers drop, and
there is more communication and interaction between the two
peoples and countries.
</P>
<P>
Gates believed that the bill will have profound and positive
implications for the long-term growth potential of both the
Chinese and U.S. economies, and he hoped that the Senate will
consider and pass this measure soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, General Motors Corporation said the vote paves the
way for the United States to benefit from China's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The world's number-one automaker said the bill will result in
the removal of long-standing trade barriers and the creation of
new business opportunities for U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
Northwest Airlines, the first foreign carrier to start service
in China and operates 13 weekly round-trip flights between China
and the United States, expressed welcome to the vote, saying the
legislation will foster vigorous economic growth, a dynamic global
economy and a well-trained and productive U.S. workforce essential
for future competitiveness.

ethnic groups autonomous prefecture in central China's Hubei
Province. Workers are building a 142.5-meter tall, 12-meter long
dam within the cave.
</P>
<P>
Once the cave is sealed, cement will be poured into cracks
above the cave and under the ground's surface to make the dam as
high as 180 meters. The reservoir will have a water storage
capacity of 126 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
By taking the advantage of narrow riverbed, the cost of
building the Shiziguan hydropower plant will be cut by up to two
thirds in terms of the national average cost for per kilowatt. The
time for the building will also be greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower plant is designed to have an installed
generation capacity of 10,000 kw and is expected to begin
operation by the end of 2001, with an annual power generation of
26.7 million kwh.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower plant will be connected with the power grids in
central China.

<HEADLINE> Massive Project To Be Launched in S.Lanka's North, East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A massive Asian Development Bank (
ADB) project costing 36 million U.S. dollars is to be launched in
October this year to provide immediate facilities to people living
in Sri Lanka's war-torn north and east, the official Daily News
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ADB representatives and government officials met residents
in these areas and heads of non-governmental organizations
operating in the area to finalize the project, a senior government
official told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Affected families will be assisted specially to build houses
and begin their agricultural and livestock activities.
</P>
<P>
The project will also renovate irrigation networks, the
fisheries industry and road network in the area and provide
drinking water, and sanitary and healthcare facilities.
</P>
<P>
While the ADB will fund 25 million U.S. dollars to meet the
costs, the balance will be met by the Sri Lankan government.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will be implemented by the North Eastern
Provincial Council, will be simultaneously operated in Vavuniya,
Ampara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Mannar districts.
</P>
<P>
The government has already implemented a similar large project
in collaboration with the World Bank to renovate irrigation
systems and minor roads in the North Central Province, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The north and east of Sri Lanka have been plagued by the
ongoing 17-year-old ethnic war between government troops and
rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam who have been
fighting for a separate Tamil state since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Most of these areas have been devastated by the war with
buildings flattened to the ground and roads and irrigation systems
in complete disarray.
</P>
<P>
The life of the people in the areas has been totally disrupted
and they are finding it extremely difficult to get back to normal.
Most of the refugees have been housed in temporary camps and the
government is keen on their early rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Condemns Albanian President's Kosovo Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia on Wednesday accused
Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani of making an illegal visit to
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani's tour to Kosovo, which was made on Wednesday without
Yugoslavia's permission, is against international norms and
detrimental to stability in Kosovo, the state news agency Tanjug
said in an article.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani's visit is illegal because Belgrade severed diplomatic
ties with Tirana on April 14, 1999, in the heat of NATO's 78-day
air strikes against Yugoslavia under the disguise of averting "
human rights disasters" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mejdani met Hashim Thaci, leader of the newly
formed Party for the Democratic Progress of Kosovo (PPDK), which
derived from the former rebel guerrilla group -- the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA). Thaci himself was a KLA commander.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani congratulated the KLA for turning into a "democratic
party," said Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the province ahead of illegal local elections, Mejdani
meant to show that the Albanian authorities are standing side by
side with the ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led administration in Kosovo wants to hold the first
municipal elections in Kosovo in October this year, but the
Yugoslav government has strongly protested against the move.
</P>
<P>
NATO launched its aggression against Yugoslavia in March last
year, allegedly to avert "human rights disasters" in Kosovo.
Ironically, the war prompted a mass exodus of refugees and today,
U.N. peacekeepers are still struggling to stop waves of ethnic
clashes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians form an overwhelming majority in Kosovo, a
traditional cultural hub of Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Four People Die From E. Coli Outbreak in Southern Canadian Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Four people have died in the worst
outbreak of E. coli bacteria in the town of Walkerton in
southwestern Ontario, Canada, local hospital sources said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The victims are a baby and three adults including an elderly
woman, while about 20 patients remain hospitalized with three
children in critical conditions at the nearby London Health
Sciences Center.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of residents in this small town of 5,000 are suffering
from symptoms of diarrhea, cramps, nausea and fever, according to
health officials.
</P>
<P>
"There's never been anything like this in Canada before of this
magnitude," said Dr. Murray McQuigge, of the South Bruce Grey
Health Center.
</P>
<P>
Health officials are closely watching the situation and the
death toll is likely to rise if the situation cannot be brought
under control soon.
</P>
<P>
The officials confirmed the presence of bacteria called E. coli
0157 in the town water supply Tuesday, and up to 160 people had to
get hospital treatments.
</P>
<P>
The provincial Ministry of the Environment is still trying to
determine the source of the contamination.
</P>
<P>
E. coli produces toxins that are particularly hard on the
kidneys and children under the age of five are at a greater risk
of developing complications, according to public health officials.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Athletes Told to Follow Thomas Cup Victors' Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Sports Council Vice
Chairman Arie Sudewo urged the country's athletes to follow their
compatriots lead in winning the Thomas Cup on four consecutive
occasions, and a total of 12 times, after defeating China on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arie, who is training director for the 2000 Olympic Games, also
ask athletes from 11 separate sports events to follow the
shuttlers' road to victory.
</P>
<P>
"Their success story should give the other athletes a lot of
inspiration. However, regarding the Uber Cup, we admit that our
women's shuttlers are less qualified than the Chinese shuttlers.
But we are proud of their achievements because we only assumed
they would reach the semi-finals," he was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arie said 74 athletes and 36 officials would be registered in
the entry form by number with the Sydney Olympic Games Organizing
Committee by June 1 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
"The number of athletes we register will include those who have
qualified, who are still competing in the pre-qualifying round and
who are waiting for the wild cards," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arie also said that the Olympic athletes would receive new
equipment as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I will check it out and make sure the equipment is delivered
immediately to allow for an adjustment period for the athletes,"
he said, adding that almost all the equipment was imported.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Badminton Association of Indonesia executive
director Karsono said the body handed over 860.5 million rupiah (
101,250 U.S. dollars) to the Thomas and Uber Cups team members.
</P>
<P>
Each men's shuttlers received 60 million rupiah and coaches got
25 million rupiah each. Women's shuttlers earned 5 million rupiah
and the coaches received 2.5 million rupiah each.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokeswoman on Passage of PNTR Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today that the passage of the
bill granting China Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status
by the U.S. House of Representatives is "wise."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives approved the bill in a 237-
197 vote.
</P>
<P>
It should be pointed out that granting PNTR status to China is
an obligation of the United States in accordance with World Trade
Organization (WTO) rules, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that settlement of the PNTR issue constitutes
the basis and prerequisite for carrying out the Sino-U.S.
bilateral agreement on China's WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
Settlement of the PNTR issue will not only help both China and
the United States develop trade and economic ties on the basis of
equality and mutual-benefit, but also help create conditions for
the healthy and stable development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
However, "the bill contains articles which attempt to interfere
in China's internal affairs and harm China's interests under the
pretext of human rights and others," which "the Chinese side pays
close attention to and dissatisfied with."
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the Chinese government has already made
solemn representations to the U.S. government regarding this issue,
clearly announcing that China is firmly opposed to these articles
and will not accept them.
</P>
<P>
China urged the U.S. side to earnestly abide by the three Sino-
U.S. joint communiques, basic norms governing international
relations and rules of the WTO, to guarantee the healthy and
stable growth of Sino-U.S. relations and bilateral trade and
economic ties.

<HEADLINE> Rabuka Says Fiji Should Brace for Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Fiji should brace itself for an
international backlash against a compromise designed to end the
nation's hostage crisis, Fiji's former Prime Minister Sitiveni
Rabuka said Thursday, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Rabuka, who is chairman of Fiji's powerful Great Council of
Chiefs, said Fiji's chiefs wanted coup leader George Speight to
play a role in an interim government.
</P>
<P>
The Great Council of Chiefs is still working on a deal to end
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speight and his gunmen stormed Fiji's parliament last Friday
and they continue to hold more than 30 hostages, including Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
Rabuka said in a radio interview that the hostages should be
released on Thursday, but the constitutional resolution to the
crisis would probably be unacceptable to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We should brace ourselves for international, the modern day or
contemporary time, curses which people can bring upon a nation,"
Rabuka said.
</P>
<P>
"They include trade bans and aid bans and so on," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rabuka said the chiefs wanted Speight to have a role in any
interim administration brought in to replace the Chaudhry
government.
</P>
<P>
But that would depend on President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who
would consider the views of the international community, Rabuka
said.
</P>
<P>
Rabuka said he did have some personal sympathy for Speight's
views, but not his methods.
</P>
<P>
"I have sympathy for the views expressed by Mr. Speight, but
not his methods," Rabuka said.

JAKARTA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR), Indonesia's highest decision-making body, will convene its
annual session from August 5 to 12 in Jakarta, according to MPR
Chairman Amien Rais.
</P>
<P>
Rais said the MPR will establish three commissions to deal with
the session which among others will discuss constitutional and
national problems.
</P>
<P>
"We will establish three commissions. They are a constitution
amendment commission, a commission to discuss national problems
and a commission to discuss the MPR's internal problems," Rais was
quoted by national newspapers Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The session will also demand a progress report from the
president.
</P>
<P>
"The president will only be asked to deliver a progress report,
not an accountability. The president in August will only be asked
to explain the government's progress which will then be evaluated
by the MPR. If judgment (by the MPR) of the president and his
Cabinet is not favorable, it doesn't necessarily mean that he will
have to step down," Rais said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, House of Representatives Speaker Akbar Tandjung also
stressed that there was little threat of unseating the president
in the coming session.
</P>
<P>
"I have to stress that so far, the House has not seen the
president violate the constitution," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Not to Extradite Citizens to The Hague: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
will not extradite any of its citizens to The Hague-based
international tribunal under any circumstances, Justice Minister
Petar Jojic said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to chief prosecutor of the international
tribunal Carla Del Ponte, the minister said his country will carry
out the policy at any cost.
</P>
<P>
Del Ponte sent him a letter on April 26, asking the Justice
Ministry for cooperation in extraditing Yugoslav nationals to The
Hague tribunal.
</P>
<P>
He told Del Ponte in the letter that both the Yugoslav
constitution and criminal law prevent extradition of Yugoslav
citizens to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal has been turned into an evil criminal organization
as it merely carries out policies of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) led by the United States, covers the crimes
committed by NATO in Yugoslavia last year and brings groundless
accusations against Yugoslav citizens, he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO launched an aggression against Yugoslavia in March last
year, unleashing months of massive air strikes against the country.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorians More Impoverished Due to Dollarization: Former Bank Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian government should
consider giving up dollarization as opinion polls show that 85
percent of the Ecuadorians have been adversely affected by the new
monetary scheme, a former central bank chief suggested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Valencia, member of the Economic Forum of Quito and
former governor of the Central Bank of Ecuador (CBE), said that
dollarization is an economic model that has no theoretical support,
nor has it been successfully applied anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the first four months of dollarization
which began in January, hunger and unemployment grew, with opinion
polls showing that 85 percent of the Ecuadorian people were poorer
than before.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, he said, what Ecuador needs is
setting up an economic model of its own, accepted and supported by
all social sectors, entrepreneurial associations and regions in
the country, so that in a 20-year period, crisis in Ecuador will
hopefully be over with a revitalized economy.
</P>
<P>
It is better to change course in time than to follow stubbornly
a dollarization model that is adversely affecting Ecuadorians, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Valencia said Ecuadorians are no longer able to bear a daily
increase in prices of basic goods and services while salaries do
not increase accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to announce within the next few days
new measures of economic readjustment that will include the
elimination of subsidies to oil and increases in prices of fuels,
domestic gas and electricity.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Reaches New High in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar reached a record new
high Wednesday after the liberal opposition, which controls the
majority of the Congress, rejected a debate on economic reform
laws and a new reduction in the monetary and foreign debt bonds
qualification in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was valued at a top price of 2,175 pesos and a
bottom price of 2,115 pesos, closing at 2,140 pesos. The average
price was 2,141 pesos, an increase of 29 pesos from Tuesday's
average, due to a high market demand.
</P>
<P>
"The perspective is still negative," said Standard &AMP; Poors, the
risk management firm, on Wednesday when announcing the reductions
of its grading in Colombian papers. The risk rating of Colombia
has been gradually falling in response to the worsening of the
political crisis caused by the confrontation between the
government and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo Salazar said this is a "
punishment" placed by international risk management firms, adding
that the government does not rule out a possible state of economic
emergency to assume extraordinary legislative powers without
counting on the Congress.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Tackles Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Increased desertification in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has brought direct
economic losses of 18 billion yuan annually to the region in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Frequent sand storms in the Spring have worsened ecological and
environmental conditions in north China, Beijing and the Yellow
River areas, said a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
"We need to urgently address desertification in the region,"
emphasized the official. Statistics show that desertification in
the region is the most serious among all provinces, municipalities
and autonomous region, where sandy area now accounts for nearly
one third of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Over-cultivation and a surplus of stock in the region are the
main causes for the rapid desert expansion. The quantity of
livestock will not resolve problems between limited pastures and
ever increasing herds of animals. Upgrading technology will be
beneficial to the industry.
</P>
<P>
Serious measure are needed to tackle the problem if the region
wants to achieve sustained economic development, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Returning low-yield farmland in sandy areas and slopes to
pastures, and striving to increase the quality and yield of the
farming areas will be crucial to the long-term interests of the
region as well as the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Increasing the crops yield per hectare to the nation's average
level while maintaining the annual yield at about 12.5 billion kg.
will make it possible for the region to return 2.6 million
hectares of farmland to either grassland or forests.
</P>
<P>
High-yield farmland makes up only 15.7 percent of the region's
total, while land with sufficient irrigation is just some 24.6
percent, both lower than the nation's average levels.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has 23.3 million people
inhabiting an area of 1.183 million sq. km.

WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- San Antonio Spurs All-Star
forward Tim Duncan, the MVP of the 1999 NBA Finals, underwent
surgery on his left knee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Duncan is expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
The 2.13m Duncan, who along with centre David Robinson forms
the Spurs' vaunted "Twin Towers", tore cartilage in his knee on

One of the top players in the NBA, Duncan becomes a free agent
on July 1.
</P>
<P>
With Duncan and Robinson leading the way, the Spurs went 15-2
during the 1999 playoffs and captured their first NBA championship.

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Rose Honored Most Improved Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Indiana small forward Jalen Rose,
who averaged a career-high 18.2 points per game to lead the Pacers
in scoring during the regular season, on Wednesday was named the
NBA's Most Improved Player.
</P>
<P>
In his sixth NBA campaign, Rose beat Miller by one-tenth of a
point per game.
</P>
<P>
"Last season, I came off the bench and now I am a starter, so
it was a gradual progression," said Rose, who had started only
seven games in his first three seasons with Indiana.
</P>
<P>
The 2.03 meter Rose received 32 of a possible 121 votes from a
nationwide panel of sports writers and broadcasters. He edged
Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki (25 votes), Detroit's Jerry Stackhouse (19)
and teammate Austin Croshere (17).
</P>
<P>
Rose, 27, posted career highs in a number of categories,
including rebounds (4.2), steals (1.05), 3-point shooting (.393)
and foul-shooting (.827).
</P>
<P>
In 1998-99, he averaged 11.1 points as the Pacers' leading
scorer of the bench. He earned a starting job at small forward
this season and teamed with Miller to form one of the league's
most formidable one-two tandems.
</P>
<P>
Selected by Denver with the 13th pick in the 1994 draft, Rose
played two seasons with the Nuggets before he and Reggie Williams
were traded to Indiana on June 13, 1996 for Mark Jackson and Ricky
Pierce. Jackson was reacquired by the Pacers in 1997.

JERUSALEM -- Israel's top prosecutor decided Wednesday not to
file criminal charges against President Ezer Weizman for accepting
cash gifts from a French businessman.
</P>
<P>
But Weizman had clearly committed violations of ethical rules
applying to senior civil servants which could, in the future cases,
be considered as criminal acts, Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein
said in a broadcast statement.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited decision was contained in a 60-page document
which included Rubinstein's formal decision and State Attorney Edna
Arbel's examination of the allegations and the reasoning behind her
decision to close the file. (Israel-Weizman-Case)

<HEADLINE> Feature: Entering Liberated South Lebanon after Israel's Withdrawal  By Huang Ling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Since the beginning of last week when
Israel began retreating its occupation troops from south Lebanon,
Lebanese swarmed into those liberated villages, and more squeezed
onto the road to the south after Israel completed the pullout
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bedecked with Lebanese ensigns and Hezbolla's yellow or black
flags, hundreds of cars headed for the south on the freeway from
Beirut on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and set up a so-called security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a self-claimed aim of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks. Since
then, the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas have been spearheading a
war to oust the Israeli occupation troops and the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Nabatiye, the second largest city in south
Lebanon, more Hezbollah flags can be seen hung above the roads, on
which the pattern of a hand holding a gun embodies the
organization's purpose. Though Nabatiye is located out of Israel's
self-styled "security zone", resistance guerrillas used the city as
a springboard to penetrate into the occupied zone and attack
Israeli troops, and the suburb of the city often became the target
of Israel's raids.
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah member named Ali Tayibu in Nabatiye said "we have
been fighting for our legitimate rights and the liberation of our
country for dozens years. We are very proud, as Lebanon is the
first Arabic country that forced Israeli troops to leave. We will
not cease fire if Israel is still occupying our lands." He alluded
the controversial Shebaa Farms that is under Israel control as an
alleged part of Syria.
</P>
<P>
On the zigzag road from Nabatiye to south "security zone", many
Israeli military jeeps and panzers were abandoned by Israel. In a
intersection, lied a ruined Israeli tank. Some witnesses said
Israeli plane destroyed it with air-to-ground missile on Tuesday
night, which could not be conveyed back to Israel and was afraid to
be seized by Hezbollah. Dozens of passers-by climbed onto the
barbette of the tank to take photo as a historic memento.
</P>
<P>
Israel deserted an artillery front at the hilltop of Zafati.
Nine cannon were destroyed in the base while about hundred of
bombshells were scattered in the magazine room. A truck with
Hezbollah flags entered the base and several armed men moved the
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
At the border town of Kafla Kala, about six kilometers south of
Nabatiye, hundreds of Lebanese gathered in front of entanglements.
Resistance fighters waved flags and exclaimed to a patrolling
Israeli military jeep. A Lebanese photographer crossed the 3-meter
isolation zone between two entanglements and gave Hezbollah's flag
to his Israeli counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Arabic women shrieked to express their joy in the traditional
way. Sheikh Abiden Aoun, the mayor of the town, said the number of
the resident has decreased since Israel's occupation. "We got
nothing but humility and blood. Many people have no choice except
emigration. We hope every thing will get better from now on," he
added.
</P>
<P>
While the jubilant air overwhelmed the south, an old Christian
man in Kafla Kala asking not to be identified, expressed the
typical fear, "I am pleased now, but I am not optimistic for the
future. Israeli troops have broken into our gate twice (in 1978 and
1982), it has the might to come again if Hezbollah attacked across
border."
</P>
<P>
Standing on the Lebanese-Israeli border, only one kilometer
stretch into the Israeli territory lies a beautiful village.

DAMASCUS, MAY 25 (Xinhua) -- The Committee on Solidarity with
Syrian Prisoners of War (POWs) in Israeli jails and the POWs
friends
staged a sit-in here Thursday before the office of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
The protesters hoisted photos of dozens of the Syrian detainees
in Israeli jails and banners condemning the maltreatment and
torture of the detainees.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the sit-in, the protesters read a statement which
said that their support to the detainees in the Israeli jails
represent the conscience of the people.
</P>
<P>
The protesters urged the international community to do justice
to the POWs and stop the atrocities inflicted on them by the
Israeli Prison Department.
</P>
<P>
They handed over a message to the ICRC Damascus bureau chief
Claud Foala, urging the Geneva-based ICRC chief to step in and help
the POWs secure their legitimate right to freedom.

<HEADLINE> World Community Urged to Exert Influence on Turkey on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
Thursday once again appealed to the world community to exert
influence on Turkey so that the talks on Cyprus issue will be
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the 25th Cyprus International Fair, Clerides
stressed that the Cyprus government wants to see progress made by
autumn.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that "we must reach a just, viable and workable
solution" to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have
already completed two rounds of proximity talks under United
Naitons auspices on a Cyprus settlement, the first in New York last
december and the second in Geneva in February.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks is scheduled to begin on July 5 in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the Greek Cypriot side has proved its genuine and
strong political will to find a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that now it remains to be made clear, in substantive
negotiations, whether the Turkish side has the political will for a
solution.
</P>
<P>
Clerides reiterated "what we are seeking is the evolution of the
Cyprus Republic into a federal, bizonal and bicommunal state, with
one international personality, one sovereignty and one nationality,
consisting of two politically equal communities."

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian companies have exported a total of 103,000
tons of cotton to 36 countries all over the world by the end of the
35th week of the current exporting season, said a report issued by
the
Alexandria-based Cotton Exporters Federation (CEF).
</P>
<P>
Italy, Turkey, India, the U.S. and Switzerland were listed as
the top five importers.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the CEF voiced its concerns over the shrinking
areas cultivated with cotton this year, which may lead to a decline

in production and a rise in prices.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef
Boutros Ghali has recently told businessmen in Alexandria that the
government plans to establish an Egyptian Stock Market for
marketing cotton via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The living conditions of Palestinian
workers in Israel are deteriorating every year due to the rising
unemployment and poverty rates.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the number of Palestinian workers in
Israel has reached more than 100,000, the unemployment rate is
ranging from 12 percent to 20 percent, and the poverty rate has
jumped to 23 percent among residents of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the workers demanded the Palestinian National
Authority to iron out a law fixing the minimum wages for workers.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian attorney has said that those workers are exposed
to such risks as unemployment, aging, sickness, disability and work

injuries, which mean that they lack the economic and job security
needed for protecting the only source of their income.
</P>
<P>
He added that social unrests are also spreading in the
Palestinian self-rule territories, including increasing labour
strikes in the most vital economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides on Thursday opened
the 25th annual International Fair held here from May 26 to June 4.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Nicos Rolandis
said that the fair is to promote imports and exports of goods,
adding that Cyprus must focus on an economic vision leading up to
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
He said this vision relates to the restructuring, rebuilding and

modernizing of the public and semi-governmental services; to the
supporting, strengthening and development of industry, trade,
energy,
transport, construction and agriculture sectors, as well as the
development of tourism, services and high technology.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 380 foreign and domestic exhibitors, the fair
will mainly display industrial equipment, domestic appliances,
cars, computers, telecommunications equipment, travel goods,
furniture and foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
The fair is expected to draw over 150,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Official negotiations are underway which aim to resume
regular commercial flights between Egypt and Libya, said the head
of Libyan Airlines Sabri Saad Allah before leaving Cairo Wednesday,
the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-departure statement, Saad Allah said that his talks
with Egyptian officials have focused on concluding an agreement to
allow the resumption of flights between the two countries, which
were suspended due to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya.

<HEADLINE> OAS Considers Peruvian Vote Counting Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of American States (
OAS) observers mission for the Peruvian elections Thursday
considered that the vote counting system for the run-off election
is efficacious.
</P>
<P>
The OAS observers attended a test of the system and verified
its functioning in the Electoral Processes National Office (ONPE),
said the mission in a communique.
</P>
<P>
"Although we do not have the total of the itemized reports of
our observers in the provinces, their telephone advance reports
indicate us that the simulacra offers a positive result," said the
OAS mission.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian presidency will be disputed in a run-off election
by President Alberto Fujimori, of the Peru 2000 coalition, and
opposition candidate Alejandro Toledo, of the Peru Posible
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The second round is foreseen for this Sunday, but Toledo said
he would not take part if it is not postponed until June 18, which
was rejected by the National Elections Jury (JNE).
</P>
<P>
The interamerican mission, presided over by former Guatemalan
Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein, considers that the result of
Wednesday's simulacra shows a political will applied to the
achievement of concrete solutions in the short term.
</P>
<P>
The group of interamerican observers decided Wednesday that the
run-off election would have to be postponed.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Teamsters Block Road to Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This action of the teamsters worsened the crisis caused by the
roadblocks maintained without interruption for 16 days to close
the circulation of vehicles from the interior of the country to
the Colombian Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
The blockade of the main arteries of the country by hundreds of
peasants is a protest against the announcement of President Andres
Pastrana's government of the demilitarization of three
municipalities of the zone to facilitate the dialogue with the
rebel National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The peasants do not want the army to leave because they fear
that this could increase the violence and deaths, since the rebels
or the irregular paramilitary bodies would occupy those places.
</P>
<P>
However, the teamsters that isolated the air terminal are
against the roadblocks raised by the peasants because they cause
them losses and some of them are bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
The teamsters said they will not permit anyone to pass toward
the airport until the Colombian government resolves this situation.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Humberto de la Calle, and peace commissioner
Camilo Gomez maintain contact with peasant leaders to arrive at an
agreement, clear the road, and continue with the process to
achieve the peace in this convulsed country.

<HEADLINE> Annan Dismayed at Fiji Chiefs' Recommendations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 25(Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Thursday expressed concern at a call by Fiji's Great
Council of Chiefs for the country's prime minister to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by his spokesman's office said "The
Secretary-General continues to follow closely developments in Fiji
following the visit by his Special Envoy, Mr. Sergio Vieira de
Mello."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General was dismayed to hear that the Great
Council of Chiefs has recommended to President Mara that the
democratically elected Prime Minister and his Government be
replaced by an interim administration," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"These recommendations appear to go well beyond the scope of
the powers vested in the Great Council," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General strongly appeals to president Mara to
resolve the present crisis on the basis of the 1997 constitution.
It is only by upholding the democratic process that the long-term
stability and prosperity of the population of Fiji, as well as the
international standing of Fiji, can be secured," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
Council chiefs today urged Fiji's president to replace Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and pardon the hostage takers who have
held the Prime Minister for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
De Mello, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and
Emergency Relief Coordinator and Special Envoy to East Timor, wan
sent to Fiji by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
De Mello Wednesday visited Fiji's Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry and other senior officials who have been held captive
following the coup on Friday.
</P>
<P>
De Mello also met George Speight, a businessmen, who leads the
hostage takers.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Indians make up about 44 percent of Fiji's population of
813,000 while indigenous Fijians account for 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry is Fuji's first ethnic Indian prime Minister. Speight,
who launched his coup attempt Friday , accuses him of favoring the
country's economically dominant Indian minority.

<HEADLINE> Greece Expects Turkey's Tangible Actions for Better Relations </HEADLINE>

<P>
ATHENS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece expects tangible actions
from neighboring Turkey to prove that Ankara's policy of threats
against Athens had come to an end, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos reiterated that Greece's conditions for an
improvement in Greek-Turkish relations were the principles of
international law and respect for international treaties in
handling pending issues, a just solution to the Cyprus problem
based on a bizonal federation and the withdrawal of unilateral
claims against Greece.
</P>
<P>
Another condition was the implementation of confidence-
building measures (CBMs) based on the 1988 memorandum signed by
the then foreign ministers of the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also stated that Greece's foreign and defense
ministries had agreed that military dialogue with Turkey was not
desirable at present.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their dispute in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem, but the two neighboring countries have
since last June taken some steps to improve their strained
relations.
</P>
<P>
Being dissatisfied with Turkey, Greece has complained that
Turkey has not done enough to improve the bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Approves Farm Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congress on Thursday gave
final approval to a package of farm assistance amounting to 15
billion U.S. dollars to compensate growers for a third straight
year of low commodity prices and to make it much cheaper for
growers to buy crop insurance.
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the measure 91-4 after the House had passed
it on a voice vote earlier in the day. It now goes to President
Bill Clinton for his signature.
</P>
<P>
The package includes 5.5 billion dollars in direct payments
that would reach farmers by September 30, in the midst of the
congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Some 8.2 billion dollars would go toward reducing premiums on
federally subsidized crop insurance over the next five years, and
the legislation makes a series of changes in the insurance program
designed to get more farmers to buy the coverage.
</P>
<P>
Grain prices collapsed in 1998 in the wake of the Asian
financial crisis and have yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
Congress has given farmers 15 billion dollars in extra income
assistance over the past two years, and the Agriculture Department
estimates that net farm income this year would drop 7.6 billion
dollars, or 16 percent, without another round of aid.
</P>
<P>
The measure also would offer coverage for the first time to
livestock producers and expand coverage for fruit and vegetable
growers.

border over the past week.
</P>
<P>
The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) in Kenya's capital Nairobi said Thursday that most of the
new arrivals came from Eritrea's Western Tesseney region after
Ethiopian troops entered Eritrea on May 12.
</P>
<P>
Even more had left their homes and scattered along the border
area preparing to move into Sudan if the fighting worsens, said
the office.
</P>
<P>
As an emergency measure, the UNHCR is airlifting tents and
other relief supplies from its stocks in Sudan and Balkan
continues to the refugee camps, said the UN agency.
</P>
<P>
The current war between the two Horn of Africa countries has
displaced an estimated 500,000 people from their homes, adding to
the population of some 300,000 Eritreans formerly displaced by the
drought, according to the UN office.

<HEADLINE> WFP Provides Urgent Aid to Eritrean Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
launched an urgent airlift of high protein biscuits to tens of
thousands of Eritreans displaced by the wars between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The first two WFP-charted airplanes, each carrying 14 tons of
such biscuits, left for Asmara, Eritrea's capital, on Tuesday from
Lokichokio, the WFP' s northern Kenya air base, said a WFP news
release available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An additional flight from the WFP's base in Uganda also arrived
on Tuesday in Asmara, carrying approximately 40 tons of biscuits,
said the same source.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is preparing to move additional supplies of high
protein biscuits from its stocks in the the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Access to large number of the displaced people within Eritrea
remains difficult due to the ongoing fightings, as the biscuits
must be trucked to the needy after arriving in Asmara.
</P>
<P>
"The immense challenge we're facing is how to rapidly feed a
highly mobile population which is without water, cooking pots and
fuels," said Kofi Owusu-Tieku with the WFP' s office.
</P>
<P>
"In these situations, high protein biscuits are one of the
best solutions, however WFP had no stocks of these in the country
when the crisis hit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, the WFP is also deploying emergency
staff to Eritrea to help cope with the worsening humanitarian
situation there, said the WFP official.

<HEADLINE> E-Commerce Profits To Reach $300 Billion:IBM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sanchez said in the city of Merida, capital of the Mexican
southeastern of Yucatan, that the advances in the matter of
communication through informatics networks have given a new
impulse to the business area that permit a bigger development of
the enterprises at a world level.
</P>
<P>
The IBM executive said during a brief interview that there are
some 200 million Internet users in all the world, among them is an
important number of enterprises and consortiums that make their
main transactions through the web.
</P>
<P>
He commented that only 15 percent of the total buying and
selling operations through the informatics network enter in the
segment of "business-consumer," while the rest are direct
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the market through Internet has a big
expansion, mainly because of the increase in the number of users
of the systems of telecommunications networks with entrepreneurial
and personal computer equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the development of Internet at a world level,Sanchez said
that there are countries where more than 50 percent of the
population has access to the informatics network and that the
figure is expected to reach one billion in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
IBM of Mexico helps its users to make purchases for about six
million dollars a day through the Internet, which means more than
2 billion dollars a year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Online Auto Sales in U.S. Expected to Go Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new automobiles over
the Internet in the United States, after being sluggish for five
years, may accelerate by now, according to a report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
New automobile sales revenue generated from the Internet is
expected to reach 27.3 billion U.S. dollars in 2004 from 2.1
billion dollars last year, said the report from American market
researcher International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
"Reducing the cost of any good increases the product's
consumption, and there's a lot of room for the Internet to reduce
the cost of car buying," said the report. For auto consumers,
costs involve the time and patience it takes to wade through a
complex process made even more so by the artificial complications
introduced by the automobile distribution system. The technology
exists to dilute those complications, and the online auto sales
industry has used those tools more aggressively than ever before
over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being mere adjuncts to car dealers' marketing,
according to IDC, online firms have begun to change the auto sales
process by promoting up-front, no-haggle pricing.
</P>
<P>
No major technological barriers exist that would inhibit online
car sales, the report said. Instead, the obstacles that have to be
overcome are systematic. According to IDC, automobile dealers,
online firms, financing and insurance companies, and manufacturers
need to find a way to coexist and an appropriate business model
needs to be developed.
</P>
<P>
Americans spent some 289 billion dollars on motor vehicles and
car parts in 1998, the last complete year for which the U.S.
Department of Commerce has records.
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 11,600 franchised auto dealers in the
United States -- many more than are needed. Even without new
competition popping up on the Internet, U.S. market analysis firm
Forrester Research predicted earlier this year that 7,000 of them
will disappear during the next 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Dismisses New Oil Output Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Energy Minister Luis
Tellez Thursday dismissed a report that there could be new cuts to
oil production, "since the market is demanding more crude and the
prices are good and adequate resources are being obtained."
</P>
<P>
Tellez made the remark when he referred to the upcoming meeting
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) member
countries to be held on June 21, as well as to the accord of
Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said that the producing countries must exert prudence
and caution to revise the evolution of the inventories.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said after inaugurating the 3rd National Congress of the
Mexican Association for Energy Economy at the Mexican Oil
Institute, that there is not a United States request to lower the
prices in the international market and to increase production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a top Venezuelan official said Wednesday that oil
ministers from Venezuela, Mexico and Sausi Arabia will meet before
the next OPEC ministerial meeting for discussing the condition of
the world oil.

<P>
BRASILIA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian National banks need to
expand their
financing to small and micro enterprises so the country can export
more, said Thursday Sao Paulo State Industries Federation (FIESP)
chairman Horacio Lafer Piva.
</P>
<P>
Piva said during the Industry Day celebration that Brazil must
make heavy investments in exporting policies, in the commercial
promotion of national products abroad, and especially, to simplify
the model of export of small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The FIESP chairman said that the participation of the small
enterprises in Brazilian exports does not amount to three percent,
while that number corresponds to 54 percent in the United States
and to 62 percent in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Piva also criticized the basic annual interest rate maintained
Wednesday by the Central Bank at 18.5 percent, saying that Brazil
needs to be more daring with inflation under control, stability in
the job supply, and in the recovery of economic growth.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
repeated its call on gunmen to free Fiji's prime minister and more
than 30 hostages.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the hostages should be released immediately and
unconditionally," State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said at
a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
"As we have previously stated, the consequences of any
unconstitutional seizure of power on U.S.-Fiji relations would be
very substantial and very detrimental to Fiji's standing in the
international community," he added.

Fiji's Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and the hostages were
seized last Friday by the hands of Fiji's gunmen headed by George
Speight, who claimed power for indigenous people in the South
Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Sitiveni Rabuka, chairman of Fiji's Great
Council of Chiefs said the chiefs had recommended a council of
advisers be appointed to run an interim government under the
leadership of President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. But Reeker said
the decision appeared to violate the constitution.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says no Deal Expected on ABM in Clinton-Putin Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, Clinton's national security advisor Sandy Berger told
reporters in the White House that Clinton will discuss "new threat
" with Putin during their first summit since Putin was elected
Russia's president.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of Clinton-Putin summit will be the Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty and third round of talks on nuclear
arms control, or START III.
</P>
<P>
"With respect to ABM and START, I don't expect any resolution
of this issue during this visit," Berger said during a background
briefing on Clinton's last important foreign trip in his term.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time the president will have had an
opportunity to discuss it with President Putin. He will describe
for President Putin what we see as a new threat," Berger added.
</P>
<P>
The United States is trying to persuade Russia to agree to
amend the ABM Treaty signed by Washington and Moscow in 1972.
Clinton is due to decide whether the United States should deploy a
national missile defense (NMD) system, which will violate the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government opposed the NMD system and rejects any
changes to ABM Treaty while Washington argues that the NMD system
is aimed at threats from some "rogue" states only, not from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Berger said that Clinton will explain to his Russian
counterpart that that there is such a threat. "I think almost
everyone agrees there is, over some time horizon, the danger of
long-range ballistic missiles from third countries that could
reach the United States."
</P>
<P>
Russia believes that an NMD system and changes to ABM treaty
will undermine the basis of international security order and the
arms control architecture.
</P>
<P>
"We've developed, but not yet decided upon, a limited national
missile defense system that deals with the threats that are
anticipated. We would like to do that in the context of an ABM
treaty that is modified in some respects so that it strengthens
arms control and, in parallel, we would like to proceed on START
III," Berger noted.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't expect these issues will be resolved at this
summit. I expect that there will be a good opportunity for us to
explain our view of the problem and for President Putin to express
his view of the problem," he added.

</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell after a Wall Street analyst said Goldman
Sachs will likely miss its earning estimate of 1.47 U.S. dollars
per share in the second quarter. The comments reminded investors
that recent weakness in the stock market will affect the bottom-
line profits of investment banks.
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers
were all lower.

The market was also hit by Microsoft's antitrust case. A U.S.
federal judge ordered the Justice Department to revise its plan to
break up the computer software maker and submit the new version by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new order dragged the Nasdaq composite as well as the Dow
index lower.
</P>
<P>
Investors paid little attention to a report on the U.S. economy.
The U.S Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a 5.
4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, down from 7.3 percent
in the final quarter of last year.
