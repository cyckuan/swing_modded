<HEADLINE> Moi Declares War on Corruption, Tribalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today appealed to all Kenyans to join him in "declaring war
on corruption and tribalism" which he described as "unfortunate
vices".
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a mass rally today at the Uhuru (Freedom)
Park in Nairobi in celebration of this year's Kenyatta Day which
commemorates the arrest of Kenya's founding father, the late Jomo
Kenyatta on the night of October 20, 1952.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that these vices were a threat to
Kenya's nationhood and undermined the principle of justice.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "we cannot allow these vices to continue
eating away our national structures and pillars because
corruption cuts across party lines, across tribes, across
religion and indeed across international boundaries."
</P>
<P>
Moi announced that an anti-corruption authority would start
work as soon as the draft bill creating it was enacted by the
National Assembly, Kenya's parliament.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged local media to investigate and objectively
report on corruption and tribalism which "encroach on the very
fabric that our structures and pillars as a nation are made of."
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended last July a
205 million U.S. Dollars loan package to Kenya, citing the
corruption of government departments as the main reason.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Builders Step Up Operations in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean construction firms
are trying to make headway into China's Hong Kong, where their
presence has been negligible so far, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Though having a weak entry into the Hong Kong market, the
industry was encouraged by the recent success of Hyundai
Engineering and Construction in winning a number of projects there.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai secured a residential housing project worth 69 million
U.S. dollars and part of a redevelopment project valued at 247
million dollars, the first for the company and a wake-up call to
others.
</P>
<P>
The company's officials are confident that they will win more
project orders in the plentiful Hong Kong market, particularly in
the areas of civil engineering and construction.
</P>
<P>
Samsung's construction division will also step up efforts to
secure construction projects in Hong Kong, following its
successful completion of a school building for the South Korean
community there in 1992.
</P>
<P>
A company official said that Samsung is especially interested
in a Hong Kong administration project for 40,000 individual
housing units for its resident community.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo's construction division has also sharpened its strategy
in an effort to gain a foothold in the Hong Kong construction
market, although it has previously devoted little attention to
acquiring projects there, according to the sources.

<HEADLINE> British Companies Ill-Prepared for Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A large number of British
companies with trading links to the other European Union (EU)
countries have not made any preparations for the planned Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU), according to a survey by the Barclays
Bank plc.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 300 firms with turnovers above 500,000 pounds
(about 800,000 U.S. dollars) a year said, "Although the number of
businesses making plans for EMU has increased since research
conducted in April, it is still the case that a significant
majority may not be ready."
</P>
<P>
The findings of the survey revealed that 65 percent of those
firms which trade with EU countries had yet to make any plans for
the single currency named euro due to be launched on January 1,
1999, while 60 percent said they did not foresee any preparations
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Barclays's euro program director Grant Phillips said, "We are
pleased to see that the issue of EMU is gradually moving up the
business agenda."
</P>
<P>
"However, overall this latest survey confirms that there is
still a reluctance to give the euro priority," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Government to Curb Undue Price Hike: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Commerce Minister
Ishaq Dar today described as "unjustified" the increase in price
of every item in proportion to the rupee re-adjustment, saying
"administrative measures will be taken to control the price-hike."
</P>
<P>
"Government will closely monitor the price situation as the
hoarders and profiteers are responsible for this unreasonable
upward movement," Ishaq said during his meeting with members of
Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) here.
</P>
<P>
"The government would not let any one to inflate prices beyond
due increase", he said.
</P>
<P>
He briefly talked about the reasons which led to the recent
8.71 percent devaluation of Pakistan rupee against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
"I am personally not in favor of such measure as it leads to
inflationary trend," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the commerce minister said the government adopted adequate
safeguard measures to protect the common man from the negative
impact of this decision, adding that efforts will be taken to
check any undue raise in prices.
</P>
<P>
The currency adjustment followed as a result of external and
internal factors, he said. However, the internal factors were
under control and external factors were largely responsible for
the rupee re-adjustment, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign exchange reserves were increased, the stock market was
strengthening and industrial sector was showing signs of
improvement," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the external factors as devaluation in European
currencies and those of the South East Asian countries, which, he
said, adversely affected Pakistan's competitiveness vis-a-vis
exports.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, inflation rate in Pakistan was higher by
around 8 percent as against its other trading partners.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Major Commercial Banks Lower Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- As expected, major
commercial banks in South Africa have announced a reduction of
one percentage point in their lending rates, following the
interest rate cut of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
As for today, First National Bank, Standard Bank, ABSA and
Nedcor are all reducing their prime lending rate to 19.25 percent
and home loan rates to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some smaller banks also announced rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, South African Reserve Bank, Friday announced
that it would cut its lending rate to commercial banks by one
percentage point, from 17 to 16 percent. The reduction went into
effect today.
</P>
<P>
The financial and business circles welcomed the long-awaited
rate cut.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that the strength of the economy has enabled
a reduction in interest rates that is now being passed on to the
consumer," South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted a Nedcor
official, Phaldie Kalam, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals said the central bank came
to the decision after most of the financial aggregates used by
the bank as basis for monetary policy decisions have moved in the
right direction recently.
</P>
<P>
Among the positive developments are the down trend of money
supply growth and consumer and producer inflation, the
stabilization of the currency and the increase of gross reserves,
Stals said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen are looking forward for further interest rate cuts
from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"Although the reduction is modest in terms of the impact on
the pocket of the consumer and translates into a small benefit to
take home pay, we are encouraged by what signifies a positive
trend and we look forward to further reductions in the medium
term," SAPA quoted a bank official, Trevor Olivier, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the one percentage point cut translates into a saving
of 78 Rand (17 U.S. dollars) per month on a mortgage loan of
100,000 Rand (21,000 dollars) over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut is expected to boost house and motor sales.
</P>
<P>
The cut is likely to bring about an improvement in the actual
financial capability of potential buyers, a real estate group
leader said.
</P>
<P>
A household which currently has to earn about 5,200 Rand
(1,100 dollars) a month to qualify for a 100,000 Rand bond, would
now only have to earn 4,900 Rand (1,040 dollars) to qualify for
the same bond.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Has Right to Buy Arms: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus respects the right of
every state to purchase arms just as it expects this right to be
respected in the case of the Cyprus Republic, a government
spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides made the remarks at
his daily press briefing while commenting on Turkish Cypriot
and Israeli press reports concerning the Turkish purchase of
Israeli Popeye 2 missiles.
</P>
<P>
"Just as we demand respect of our inalienable right to
purchase weapons the way we consider proper, we recognize this
right to other countries," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot official said that "Israel is considered a
friendly country and we would like to believe that this
friendship will continue."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Cypriot government is disturbed by the fact
that this purchase will be within the framework of a military
agreement between Israel and Turkey, Christofides said,
"Irrespective of whether there is an agreement or not, since we
recognize their right to sell and buy arms, it is not important
within which framework purchases take place."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reacted strongly to a decision early this year by
the Cypriot government to buy Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air
missiles, which will be deployed by mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to strike these missiles if they are
deployed. The United States and some other western countries
also opposed the decision made by Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony marking the first
day of shooting of the 40-part TV series "Yongzheng Dynasty"
(1723-1736) was held yesterday in Chengde City, a summer resort in
north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The series will focus on the political and economic reforms
implemented by the emperor. Authorities note that the effort is of
both historical and realistic significance.
</P>
<P>

yuan, was approved by the Ministry of Broadcasting, Film and
Television.
</P>
<P>
The Changsha Television Station in Hunan Province and the

villain blamed for his sinister and diabolic behavior in obtaining
and consolidating power.

feudal dynasty, as well as the examination and promotion system,
living conditions and the folklore of the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The Qing Dynasty, the last feudal dynasty of China, was in
place for more than 260 years, with the early part of the dynasty
featuring short periods of peace and prosperity. However, the
government was thereafter beset with corruption and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
Yongzheng, who was on the throne for 13 years, is regarded as
one of the most diligent emperors by historians and written
records.
</P>
<P>
The the stage version of the "Yongzheng Dynasty" series is
based on a best-selling novel both at home, the Emperor
Yongzheng. The novel is written by famous contemporary author Er
Yue He and the series will be directed by Hu Mei, one of the top
ten female directors in China.
</P>
<P>
Work on the series is scheduled for completion in August of
next year. China Central Television (CCTV) and various televisions
both at home and abroad will telecast the series at a later date.

BONN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A Hezbollah leader has threatened
likewise actions inside Israel to answer any Israeli attacks on
civilian targets in Lebanon, noting all means were justifiable in
a merciless war, the German news weekly Der Spiegal reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"The Zionists should not believe that we and our Mujahedin
brothers in Palestine are not in the position to blow up every
civilian target," Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of the
Hezbollah, or Party of God, told the magazine in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"In a merciless war all means are allowed," stressed the party
leader, who rejected any compromise or peace with Israel, even if
Israel would pull out of southern Lebanon and the occupied Golan
Heights, which it seized from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah believed only weapons and deaths could bring peace to
the Middle-East region.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah was set up in 1982 and has currently nine seats
in the Lebanese parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Der Spiegal magazine also reported that the Hezbollah

first since assuming office in the country's after-apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
He had a brief meeting this evening with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on the Middle East peace process, the latest
developments of the situation in Africa and bilateral ties, South
African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Another round of Mubarak-Mandela talks is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the third leg of Mandela's Mideast tour that started
last week and has taken him to Tunisia and Morocco. He will also
visit Libya on his way to a Commonwealth summit in Edinburgh,
Scotland from October 24 to 27.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said Mandela is to visit Libya on schedule despite
U.S. pressure against such a tour.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed an air ban on Libya in 1992
to force the surrender of two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, who arrived here Sunday to arrange for Mandela's visit,
held talks this morning with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Today's summit between Mubarak and Mandela has been hailed by
both sides as a move to crown their bilateral relations, though no
agreements expected to be signed during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Praising bilateral economic ties, Moussa told reporters Sunday
that the two countries signed several economic and cultural
cooperation agreements during his visit to Pretoria in August.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is South Africa's third biggest trading partner in the
Arab world and its second largest oil supplier in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade rose to 90 million U.S. dollars in 1996 from 14
million dollars in 1993, the year South Africa, emerging from the
dark days of apartheid, opened its first representative office in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
A South African military delegation led by Chief of Staff George
Meiring also paid a visit to Egypt late last month for talks on
furthering bilateral military cooperation.

<HEADLINE> First Irish Legal Tobacco Battle Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The first legal challenge to the
tobacco industry in Ireland is set to take the center stage as two
long-term Irish smokers started a damages case against some
multinational tobacco companies, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Irish lawyer Peter McDonnell said he had launched proceedings
in Dublin's High Court on behalf of his two clients Susan Riley
and Anne Maloney who have both been smoking since they were
children.
</P>
<P>
This is commonly regarded as a direct result of the
ground-breaking U.S. legal battle in which some victims have
secured billions of dollars in compensation from the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
"This is the start of the war, today was only the declaration
of intent," McDonnell said, adding that the American cases would
open up similar claims across the world.
</P>
<P>
McDonnell, who claimed to have another 70 possible clients,
stressed that they stood to make between 100,000 and 1 million
Irish pounds (about 150,000-1.5 million U.S. dollars) if they won.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Russia to Strengthen Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Russia will make
efforts to strengthen bilateral economic ties and cooperate in
attracting investments for Russia.
</P>
<P>
This was stressed here today by Cyprus' Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou and Russian Ambassador Georgi Mouratov
at a three-day Investment Conference for South Russia.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou praised the traditional bilateral relationship,
describing Russia as a friend and good business partner.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus as an international business center is capable enough to
help facilitate an investment flow to Russia, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 30 businessmen and investors from Russia, Cyprus
and other countries attended the meeting which discussed Russia's
promising projects.
</P>
<P>
Mouratov expressed satisfaction with the development of the
bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the trade volume between Russia and Cyprus in the
first half of this year has amounted to 350 million U.S. dollars,
or 63 percent of that for the whole of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador said that Cyprus, with its unique
geographical position and highly developed services, has become an
important investment channel for Russia.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Muhammad Ali Memorabilia Brings in 1.3 Mln Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Collectors, investors and
sports fans together spent 1.3 million dollars here Sunday to buy
things linked to the lord of the ring, Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
Collection of Ali memorabilia for bidding at a Beverly Hills
auction house included fight posters, boxing photographs, shorts,
shoes, gloves and letters.
</P>
<P>
The boxing champ had no association with the auction and did
not benefit from the sales. But his disapproval did not deter his
fans or affect the bidding.
</P>
<P>
His trademark white satin "Everlast" trunks went for 50,000
dollars and gloves from the Leon Spinks fight brought in 28,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The most coveted item was a robe, embroidered with African
designs, which Ali wore at the epic fight against George Foreman
in 1974 when Ali scored a stunning victory to reclaim the world
heavyweight title. An anonymous buyer won it with a telephone bid
of 140,000 dollars, tax and commission not included.
</P>
<P>
At the day-long auction were also the shaving cream, gourmet
cookies, shoe polish, a toy action figure of the champ and roach
traps that Ali endorsed and helped to peddle. Ali himself was also
a superb salesman.
</P>
<P>
The collection of Ali memorabilia was put up for auction by a
garment industry executive. But Ali's attorney said in a statement
last week that his client could not "verify the authenticity" of
any of the items.

<HEADLINE> Study: Currency Crash Possible in Bulgaria, Romania, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A currency crash was possible to
hit Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Turkey in a year, Deutsche
Bank's subsidiary Deutsche Morgen Grenfell said today in a report
on eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
The report listed Bulgaria as the most vulnerable of all
eastern European countries to a currency crash in the next 12
months, with an over 80 percent chance. Romania and Ukraine came
second and third with about a 40 percent chance, followed by
Turkey with a 30 percent chance.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Morgen Grenfell based the conclusion on an analysis of
a series of financial and economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
It defines a currency crash as a month-over-month drop of at
least 15 percent in the nominal exchange rate against the U.S.
dollar. And during the periods of hyperinflation, the depreciation
needs to be at least 10 percent larger than in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Extremist Jews' Attempt to Enter Aqsa Mosque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian guards at the
holy Muslim shrine Aqsa Mosque dwarfed today an attempt by a
group of extremist Jews to enter the compound.
</P>
<P>
Scores of members of two extremist Jewish groups Hai Vecayam
and Temple Mount Faithfuls tried to lay a corner stone of the
destructed Jewish Temple in the site of Aqsa Mosque by taking
advantage of the annual festival march to celebrate the Jewish
holiday Succot.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police also prevented the Jewish radicals from entering
the compound to avoid bloodshed. Jewish radicals make such
attempts on nearly all Jewish holidays every year.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Hussein, Director of Aqsa Mosque, said that
Palestinians "will not allow extremist Jewish groups to enter the
Islamic Mosque as long as Palestinian Muslims are ready to
sacrifice with everything to keep the Islamic nationality of the
Mosque."
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, Minister for Jerusalem Affairs in the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), denounced the Jewish
radicals for provoking Muslims by trying to enter the holy shrine,
where Jews believed their ancient holy temple stood.
</P>
<P>
He called the attempt and the Succot march in Jerusalem as
"part of Israeli incitements and schemes aiming at Judaizing the
holy city."
</P>
<P>
A large number of Israeli police were deployed today
throughout Jerusalem in order to prevent possible terror attacks
by Islamic militants to disrupt the annual Succot march.
</P>
<P>
Dancing, singing and drum-beating, tens of thousands of joyful
marchers, from across Israel and abroad, marched through
Jerusalem to underline Israel's sovereignty claim over the holy
city.
</P>
<P>
The marchers, escorted by armed police and border troops,
marched through the city by two main routes, causing terrible
traffic jams as some of the main roads were closed.
</P>
<P>
In the Jewish holiest site of West Wall, or Wailing Wall, an
estimated 60,000 of Jewish worshipers held a prayer service in the
fully packed plaza to mark the end of the week-long Succot
holiday that started from last Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> SAR Chief on HK-EU Customs Cooperation Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region chief executive, Tung Chee-Hwa, today
expressed optimism on further cooperation with the European Union
on trade and customs.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions with European Commission leaders has cleared the
way for substantial negotiations on a customs cooperation
agreement," said Tung after talking with European Commission
President Jacques Santer and Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan.
</P>
<P>
"All sides hope that the negotiations (on the customs
cooperation agreement) can be concluded as soon as possible," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The EC vice-president told the press that EC politicians
discussed with Tung the possibility of an agreement on customs
cooperation between Hong Kong and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"In the course of discussion," said Brittan, "we established a
foundation for what I believe can be rapid progress in detailed
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The consolidation of concrete EU-Hong Kong relations, the
links through the business community, is appropriate," he added.
</P>
<P>
Brittan believed that it is important to reach agreements of
this kind with Hong Kong in that they will be beneficial to both
Hong Kong and the EU and they will demonstrate the exercise by
Hong Kong of the competence granted it by the Sino-British Joint
Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore possible to tell everybody that the system
under which the policy of one country, two systems is firmly in
place has a much greater conviction of Hong Kong actually entering
into and concluding agreements."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR chief said that the cooperation in customs
will be an area where both sides share a lot of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Securing visa-free access for the Hong Kong SAR passports,
liberalization of the financial service markets, China's accession
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and Hong Kong's active role
in the global trade body and the importance of permitting free
trade on a multilateral basis were the other issues also discussed
during Tung's short stay here.
</P>
<P>
Tung told a press conference that visa-free access is something
quite important to Hong Kong, which allows visa-free access for
all EU nationals.
</P>
<P>
The SAR chief said that though some EU member countries showed
sympathy, it will have to take some time to secure visa-free
access for Hong Kong SAR passport holders.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I raised the issue of visa-free entry with the
commissioners and also with the president and I think their
response was quite sympathetic, I think very sympathetic, and they
will talk with individual member states on this issue."
</P>
<P>
The European Commission leaders pledged to encourage member
states to provide visa-free travel to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Britain has given Hong Kong visa-free access while Germany has
recently agreed to grant five-year visas for Hong Kong SAR
passports.
</P>
<P>
On the financial service issue, Brittan and Tung shared the
view that the negotiations on financial services under the WTO
must be brought to a successful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"We also have a common interest in the successful launch of a
millennium round of multilateral trade negotiations," said
Brittan. He added that both sides were not seeking formal
agreement on the issue in a short period of time but are seeking
to build up consensus.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the world's seventh largest trading economy and
the 10th largest trading partner of the European Union. Bilateral
trade totaled 21.358 billion ECUs in 1995, with the EU enjoying a
surplus of 8.008 billion ECUs.
</P>
<P>
Some 43 percent of the EU companies that have established
regional offices in Hong Kong are engaged in trade.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Shares Hit Six-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong shares were pounded
for a second day this week, slumping over 500 points to close at a
six-month low.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed at 12,403.10, down 567.78
points or 4.38 percent, the lowest finish since April this year.
The index had already lost 630.13 points, or 4.63 percent, in
Monday's trading following sharp falls on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The sub-index for properties today nose-dived by 1,538.91
points or 7.26 percent, followed by utilities, commerce and
industry, and finance, which shed 522.71, 350.76 and 317.55 points
 respectively.
</P>
<P>
China-related shares were hit hard again. The red-chip Hong
Kong China-affiliated Corporations Index plunged 242.46 points, or
9.43 percent while Hang Seng China Enterprises Index down 55.14
points, or 5.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slump today was pressured by regional currency woes which
overshadowed an overnight technical rebound on Wall Street,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The market is further weakened by selling pressures from
overseas and domestic funds managers and by renewed currency
volatility in the Asia-Pacific region including Taiwan, said Ogyu
Kenju, vice president of Sanyo Securities.
</P>
<P>
He said the bearish sentiment was also heightened by higher
interbank rates as there were fears that the Hong Kong currency,
which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, could be attacked by
speculators, like the Taiwanese dollar has of late.
</P>
<P>
Turnover value amounted to 19.26 billion HK dollars (2.47
billion US dollars) today, up from Monday's 17.26 billion dollars
(2.21 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Ramos Signs Into Law Two Financial Reform Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today signed into law two financial reform measures designed to
attract more mutual fund investments and improve the country's
savings position.
</P>
<P>
The first act, which amends the country's 1973 investment
houses law, sets a new maximum limit of 60 percent for foreign
equity participation in investment houses, according to a press
release from the Presidential Press Office.
</P>
<P>
The act aimed to encourage more foreign capital to go into the
operation of mutual fund investments in the country, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The new investment houses law also left out the requirement
that all directors of an investment house must be Filipino
citizens, providing foreign investors a free hand in sinking their
fund.
</P>
<P>
The law enables the government to find a new source of foreign
exchange outside of the traditional sources provided by the
millions of overseas filipino workers, exports and foreign
investments in other sectors, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The second measure regulates the organization and operation of
non-stock savings and loan associations in order to make them more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
The law authorizes the monetary board of the central bank to
have direct control and supervision over the establishment of
non-stock savings and loan associations.
</P>
<P>
The law also prohibits lending to non-members of such savings
and loan associations in order to protect their members from the
unscrupulous practices of some officers.
</P>
<P>
Ramos hopes that the law will increase the country's savings
rate by encouraging the formation of more savings and loan
associations in both private and government offices.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines ranks lowest among the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations in terms of savings. The country's current savings
rate is 19 percent of its gross national product (GNP), far behind
Malaysia's 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> HK To Host International Investment Funds Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The 11th International
Investment Funds Conference will be held here between on October
27-28, in recognition of Hong Kong's importance as a regional fund
management center.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the conference is held in Asia outside
Japan, according to the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association
(HKIFA), host of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA said the conference will be attended by 55 senior
representatives from about 25 investment funds associations from
all over the world, which together represent about seven trillion
US dollars in collective investment funds.
</P>
<P>
The private event will provide them a forum to share
information on the commercial and regulatory development of the
industry in their respective countries and to discuss issues of
common concern, said the HKIFA.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the largest fund management center within Asia
(outside Japan), in terms of asset size and the number of fund
managers. As of the end of December 1996, total assets managed by
HKIFA members in Hong Kong amounted to 101 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for Hong Kong to be chosen to host the event is
that international investment funds associations are keen to know
about the implications of Hong Kong's return to China for local
economy and for Hong Kong's involvement in the development of a
funds management industry in China's interior areas, according to
the HKIFA.
</P>
<P>
Closely following the conference is a one-day seminar in
Beijing on October 30, co-organized by the People's Bank of China
and the HKIFA. Officials from the bank and the China Securities
Regulatory Commission will be invited to update participants on
the latest development of the fund management and securities
industries in China's interior areas.

By the end of September, Hong Kong has set up 5,293 companies,
with a direct investment of 10.64 billion US dollars. Hong Kong is
the biggest source of overseas investment in Beijing.

surveillance and provocative sorties over cities and towns in
northern and southern Iraq from October 1 to 15, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoun requested the U.N. chief to intervene to stop the

DPRK's side.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Summit Meeting to Discuss Currency Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today that the informal summit meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) scheduled for December in Kuala
Lumpur will focus on the current currency problem in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ramos agreed with a proposal by ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit
Singh to make the currency problem as a top item in the agenda of
the meeting when they met at the Presidential Palace today.
</P>
<P>
"I can foresee we will be having serious discussions on the
currency problem," Ramos was quoted as saying during the meeting,
according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also raised the idea of setting up a common fund and
facility for ASEAN members in the wake of the depreciation of
local currencies to finance the massive infrastructure
requirements of less-developed economies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Singh told Ramos that he would send a memorandum to Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on the idea of a common fund and
facility.
</P>
<P>
Singh said there are already initiatives among the private
sector members of ASEAN to set up a fund to finance the
infrastructure requirements of Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who has just concluded a visit to the newly-admitted
ASEAN members of Myanmar and Laos, said the Philippines is
enhancing its political, economic and social ties with these
countries to speed up their inclusion into the mainstream of
development in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Ramos and Singh also discussed the need to dismantle
"destructive competition" among ASEAN members, said Philippine
Presidential Adviser for Foreign Affairs Apolinario Lozada, who
also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ramos also said the Philippines is willing
to assist in the holding of elections in Cambodia next year.
</P>
<P>
Lozada said Ramos supports the idea but only if Cambodia will
directly ask for help.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, if they ask us to assist them again. ASEAN would be
interested to lend assistance to them in the 1998 elections,"
Lozada quoted Ramos as saying.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Recruiting Finnish Support for EU Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian Foreign Minister
Algirdas Saudargas has been here for three days to seek Finland's
support for its early entry into the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Saudargas, who arrived on Sunday and would leave today, hoped
the EU reconsider its list of first wave of countries eligible for
the negotiations leading to the grant of EU memberships.
</P>
<P>
His government would be satisfied if Lithuania is added onto
the list at the EU's Luxembourg summit scheduled for December, he
reportedly told his Finnish counterpart Tarja Halonen.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania and Russia are scheduled to sign a border treaty in
Moscow next week, the top Lithuanian diplomat noted, adding the
event could help qualify his country for the EU bid.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Halonen reportedly said the EU's planned eastward
expansion could proceed with some compromises.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, she said all countries applying for EU membership
could be invited to the meeting early next year, when countries
eligible for membership talks are to be decided.
</P>
<P>
By this way, and through fund-raising efforts to prepare for
their individual EU bid, nations not on the "first wave" list
could have better chances to join the alliance, Halonen said.
</P>
<P>
The EU's June Summit in Amsterdam produced a "first wave" list
for its enlargement into Central European and Baltic Sea nations,
which included Estonia but excluded Lithuania and Latvia.
</P>
<P>
The list has caused an outcry from Lithuania and Latvia, which
are also Baltic nations as Estonia.
</P>
<P>
Among Nordic nations, while Finland favors to include Estonia
in the "first wave," Sweden and Denmark are inclined to have all
the three Baltic nations put on the list.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen to Consider Meeting Opposition Members in Exile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen is considering to meet members of his political
opposition now in exile abroad, a parliament member said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, said Son Chhai, who himself just returned to
Cambodia, would take place under informal circumstances and the
topics would include the general elections scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
When he proposed a "family meeting" with Cambodian politicians
staying outside the country, Hun Sen acknowledged it as a good
idea and promised to take it into consideration, Son Chhai said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Son Chhai said Hun Sen during a
recent meeting with him agreed to cancel October 28 as the
deadline for parliament members staying overseas to return home.
</P>
<P>
The the co-prime minister also promised to keep posts for
senior cabinet members and secretaries of state in exile, he said.
</P>
<P>
Son Chhai, of Son Sann's Khmer Buddhist Liberal Democratic
Party, was one of the parliament members who fled the country in
early July, and he returned to this Cambodian capital on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he also met King Norodom Sihanouk and
President of the National Assembly Chea Sim.
</P>
<P>
He added that the proposed meeting was hailed by Norodom
Sihanouk, who offered to preside over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The king also recommended Second Deputy President of the
National Assembly Son Sou Ber and Second Deputy Prime Minister Sar
Kheng to serve as chief representatives for the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Tensions among Cambodia's coalition government, formed after
United Nations-monitored elections in 1993, climaxed in early July
when troops loyal to different sides broke into armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
During the conflict, a group of Cambodia's political leaders,
including Prince Norodom Ranariddh, escaped from the country.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Transported From Kazakhstan to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A batch of 1,700 tons of crude
oil transported from Kazakhstan arrived in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region today, as part of practices of
Sino-Kazakh cooperation in oil development.
</P>
<P>
The batch of crude oil is the first of its kind, that is
produced by the China Oil and Gas Corp. at the Aktyubinsk Oilfield
in Kazakhstan. The Chinese company bought 60 percent of the shares
of the oilfield.
</P>
<P>
During the fourth quarter of this year 150,000 to 200,000 tons
of crude oil will be transported from the oilfield to China, and
an estimated five million tons for the following two years.
</P>
<P>
The joint effort of the two countries is expected to lift the
annual crude oil output of the oilfield, which has an estimated
oil reserve of 130 million tons, from the current 2.6 million tons
to over five million tons within the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
The two nations have also agreed to explore for other oil
deposits in Kazakhstan, and will lay a 3,000-km oil pipeline from
that country to Xinjiang and another oil pipeline to northern
Iran.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Goes Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
climbed up to 10.4 billion U.S. dollars in August, the worst
showing in seven months, the Commerce Department reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
The department said the worse-than-expected showing represented
a 3.4 percent increase from a revised July deficit of 10 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports edged up a 0.2 percent to some 77.96 billion dollars,
led by the first gain in sales of the U.S. farm products this year.
</P>
<P>
But imports moved up by a 0.6 percent to a record high of 88.32
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The volume of crude oil hit an all-time high of 282.5 million
barrels in August with the total value of crude oil shipments
rising to 4.79 billion dollars. The price per barrel was up to
16.94 dollars as compared to 16.50 dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
The overall trade imbalance of 10.4 billion dollars was the
largest deficit since an 11.6 billion dollar gap in January.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the gap between the country's exports and
imports is running at an annual rate of 114 billion dollars, even
worse than the eight-year high of 111 billion dollars set last
year.

<HEADLINE> LDP Proposes Economic Stimulus Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) today proposed a package of economic stimulus
measures, which include the promotion of deregulation, the Kyodo
News service reported.
</P>
<P>
The package, approved by the LDP's General Council, consists of
four pillars -- deregulation, promotion of real estate
transactions, relief measures for small and medium-sized
businesses and reform of the taxation system.
</P>
<P>
Deregulation measures include allowing long-distance and
international telephone companies to set rates freely without
government approval, which is aimed at boosting demand in the
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
The package contains proposals for possible future measures,
such as using the government's fiscal investment and loan program
to create private-sector demand, encouraging people to purchase
second houses, and studying preferential tax treatment for
education, social welfare and housing, LDP Policy Research Council
Chairman Taku Yamasaki told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage the sale of land and housing, the LDP
called for the introduction of a leasehold system and a temporary
increase in special housing loans extended by the state-run
Housing Loan Corp.
</P>
<P>
The LDP also proposed introducing a system which requires land
transactions to be reported to the government after the
transactions are concluded, instead of the current system which
requires advance registration, in line with the National Land Use
Planning Law.
</P>
<P>
Yamasaki said the LDP worked out the set of measures as the
"first step" to allay growing public concern and uncertainty over
the economy.
</P>
<P>
The party also urged efforts to suspend or abolish the land
value tax and expand tax breaks for houses purchased with loans.
</P>
<P>
Japanese business leaders by and large reacted favorably to the
package, saying it covers most of what is needed, Kyodo said in a
related story.

BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing witnessed a record
daily temperature of 29.2 degrees centigrade yesterday, the
highest temperature on record for the day since 1940, according to
the Beijing Meteorological Observatory.
</P>
<P>
Residents grasped the rare opportunity to wear T-shirts for
perhaps the last time this year.
</P>
<P>
"I should have brought a refrigerator to sell cold drinks and
ice cream," said one elderly woman selling newspapers on downtown
Wangfujing Street.
</P>
<P>
Experts explained that a high pressure area controlling Asia
brought the unseasonably warm weather to the city.
</P>
<P>
"A cold air mass moving through the area was too weak to cause
a substantial drop in temperatures, but nonetheless did blow
clouds away and intensified the sunshine," according to an expert
from the Beijing Meteorological Observatory.
</P>
<P>
The city's daily temperatures have hovered at around 18 degrees
centigrade since Oct.16, with the previous high of 20.6 degrees
centigrade recorded on Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
"The normal temperature for this time of year is at around 11
degrees centigrade," according to the expert.
</P>
<P>
No trends can be predicted from the temporary weather
abnormality, said the expert, adding that no unfavorable
influences on health and agriculture have as yet been detected.
</P>
<P>
The observatory forecasts strong cold front will move through
the capital tomorrow night, with temperatures dropping by some 10
degrees centigrade.

<HEADLINE> Prospects for S. Africa-China Coop Fine: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming
establishment of diplomatic ties between South Africa and China
will help promote bilateral trade and industrial cooperation, a
senior government official said today.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects (for bilateral cooperation) are good," Alec Erwin,
South Africa's trade and industry minister told Xinhua after
opening this year's South Africa International Trade Exhibition
(SAITEX) at the National Exhibition Center here.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that cooperation between the two countries are
developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The five-day show which is the biggest trade event in Africa
attracted about 1,000 exhibitors from more than 50 countries and
territories, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
It covers a wide range of products, from manufacturing and
engineering products, mining technology, telecommunications,
information technology to chemicals, medical products, food and
textiles etc.
</P>
<P>
Some 84 companies from the People's Republic of China
participated in the fair.
</P>
<P>
Germany has the largest presence in the international fair
with German made products in a pavilion.
</P>
<P>
This year's show also features the massive participation of
African businesses. SAITEX '98 may see more African participants
as the 14-member Southern African Development Community (SADC)
has decided that all its members will participate in 1998's
SAITEX.
</P>
<P>
Besides South Africa, SADC groups countries including Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
South Africa' plastics industry steal the limelight at the
show with a "show within the show" -- Plastics Africa.
</P>
<P>
Besides major economic powers in the world, the show also
attracted countries of the Indian Ocean rim, South America,
Middle East and Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The first SAITEX was held in 1993 when the world community
lifted economic sanctions against South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Since then the numbers of exhibitors and visitors of the show
have grown steadily.
</P>
<P>
The number of exhibitors grew from 450 in 1993 to 1,500 in
1996 and the number of visitors have stabilized at an estimated
30,000 every year, with some 4,000 of them being foreigners, a
SAITEX press release said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa benefited much from the annual trading event.
Erwin said in the 1996 opening ceremony that the exhibition was
the nation's premier marketing vehicle and an excellent platform
for growing international relationships, investment
opportunities, joint venture partnerships and increased South
African export.
</P>
<P>
Many South African businesses have used the annual exhibition
as their launch pad into the export and import arenas, and
subsequently as their prime marketing vehicle to increase and
maintain new markets, a press release said.

<HEADLINE> State Councillor Speaks on Poverty Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Chen Junsheng
today urged the Agricultural Development Bank of China to improve
its work on the extension and management of credits for poverty
relief.
</P>
<P>
It is an arduous task to basically solve the problem of
enabling the poverty-stricken population in the rural areas to
have enough to eat and wear by the end of this century, Chen said
at a meeting on credits for poverty elimination sponsored by the
bank.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the objective, the central government this year has
raised the line of bank credits for poverty reduction to 15.3
billion yuan, an increase of 4.5 billion yuan from last year.
</P>
<P>
China has pledged to basically eliminate rural poverty by the
end of this century. Currently 65 million rural Chinese still do
not have the most basic necessities for living.
</P>
<P>
Bank loans for poverty reduction should primarily target areas
such as cultivation, breeding and processing of agricultural
produce and sideline products, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural development bank, one of China's three
policy-oriented banks founded in 1994, oversees the extension and
management of loan portfolios for poverty reduction.

<HEADLINE> ADB: Impact of S.E. Asian Crisis to Persist in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
warned today that the impact of currency and financial crisis in
Southeast Asia will persist in 1998 and the region's economic
growth will slow down further.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here at a two-day workshop on Asia's
economic outlook, the Manila-based bank said the crisis, which
started in July in Thailand and spread to other economies, are
still unfolding and its impact is likely to persist during 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the crisis, interest rates had to be raised
to high levels in several economies, particularly in the
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The governments of these economies announced the postponement
and review of large infrastructure, it added.
</P>
<P>
"It was hoped that these measures will improve the fiscal
position and restore investors' confidence in the economy," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The estimated gross domestic product (GDP) rate of the region
for 1997 is estimated to decelerate from 7.4 percent in 1996 to
between 4.9 percent and 5.7 percent in 1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the forecast growth rate range for 1998 is
between 4 percent and 5.5 percent, and for 1999 it is between 5.2
percent and 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, the report said, the estimated range of GDP
growth rate for 1997 is from 6.2 percent to 7.6 percent, as strong
growth in investment expenditure is likely to support this level
of growth.
</P>
<P>
But the present economic crisis may worsen the country's GDP
growth rate in 1998 and the range of growth forecast for 1998 is
from 5.2 percent to 7 percent, while that for 1999 is from 5.7
percent to 7 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
For Malaysia, the report said, the estimated GDP growth rate
for 1997 is still robust, ranging between 7.1 percent and 7.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The current financial and currency crisis will negatively
impact 1998 GDP growth rate. The forecast growth range for 1998 is
between 5.1 percent and 6.4 percent and for 1999 between 6.1
percent and 8 percent," it said.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the report said, the economy is expected to
grow by 5.4 and 5.6 percent for 1997, and 5 percent to 7 percent
for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the economic situation in Thailand, the report said the
fiscal and monetary stringencies under the reform program are
likely to keep the country's GDP growth rate low.
</P>
<P>
The range of the GDP growth rate range for 1997 has been
estimated between 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent, and for 1998, 2
percent to 2.5 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
"There are possibilities of improvement in 1999," the report
added.
</P>
<P>
On the inflation issue in Southeast Asia, the report said that
due to the on-going crisis, inflation in the region will rise from
6.6 percent in 1996 to 9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, large economies in the region have been suffering
from labor shortage at all skill levels, particularly managerial
and technically trained manpower. This is likely to exacerbate
inflationary pressure in the future," it said.
</P>
<P>
Taking these factors into account, the inflation rate has been
forecast at 11.4 percent for 1998 and 9.1 percent for 1999, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economic Slowdown to Continue in Years, Says ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Currency and financial market
turmoils in Southeast Asia, rising interest rates, weak domestic
demand and infrastructure related shortages are among reasons
behind the declining economic growth in Asia, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) said today.
</P>
<P>
In a report entitled "Recent Macro-economic Developments and
Short-term Growth Prospects for the Developing Asian Economies,"
the ADB said the average real gross domestic product (GDP) of
developing Asian economies has recorded a small deceleration in
the recent past.
</P>
<P>
"From 8.2 percent in 1995, it decelerated to 7.5 percent in
1996. As for the present, a great deal of uncertainty has been
created since July 1997 by the financial and currency crises in
four Southeast Asian economies, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Philippines, and Thailand," said the report, which was released at
a two-day workshop on Asia's economic outlook which opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, a cautious range of plausible GDP growth
rates over 1997 can be estimated and it could range between 6.1
percent on the lower side and 7 percent on the upper side.
</P>
<P>
"A good deal of impact of the current crises will be felt in
the immediate future. It should influence the economic performance
in 1998 and even in 1999," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the GDP growth rate range for 1998 has been forecast
between 5.3 percent and 6.2 percent while that for 1999 between
6.1 percent and 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said there are several reasons behind the declining
economy in Asia, including weak domestic demand in some economies,
weak external sector in the others and rising interest rates,
currency and financial market turmoils.
</P>
<P>
But the reasons for the economic slowdown in the region vary
from economy to economy, it said, adding that inflexible exchange
rate systems, skill and infrastructure related shortages and slow
paces of structure reforms were the other "contributory factors."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the GDP growth rate in the newly
industrializing economies -- China's Hong Kong and Taiwan, South
Korea and Singapore -- weakened in 1996, and will slip further
from 7.5 percent in 1996 to 6.1 percent in 1997, but could recover
to 6.4 percent over 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
In China, the report said, the GDP is expected to grow by 9.8
percent this year, exceeding the government target of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The projected level of GDP growth (in China) for 1998 is 10
percent and is forecast to stay at the same level in 1999," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the on-going financial and currency crisis, the
estimated GDP growth rate for Southeast Asia in 1997 is estimated
to range between 4.9 percent and 5.7 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the crises is likely to persist during 1998. The
forecast growth rate range for 1998 is between 4 percent and 5.5
percent, and for 1999 it is between 5.2 percent and 6.3 percent,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
On the economic prospect for South Asia, the report said the
economies in the sub-region share numerous common developments and
challenges, which include conducting wide-ranging economic reforms
and overcoming various infrastructure bottle-necks.
</P>
<P>
The estimated GDP growth rate for 1997 is 6.2 percent, and with
further implementation of their different reform packages and
improvement in infrastructure, South Asian economies are forecast
to grow at the average rate of 6.5 percent in 1998 and 7 percent
in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October (Xinhua) -- A senior CPC official has called
for greater efforts to study the guidelines of the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Deng Xiaoping
Theory.
</P>
<P>
The 15th CPC National Congress, held last month, ended with
success, unity and victory, according to Ding Guangen, member of
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. Ding made the
remarks during a national workshop on studying the spirit of the
Party congress.
</P>

guidelines of the 15th CPC national congress, and to focus the
power of people from all ethnic nationalities on objectives set
forth during the congress, said Ding, who also serves as head of
the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We should seek to scale new heights in studying Maxism,
Lennism, Mao Zedong Thought, with particular emphasis on Deng
Xiaoping Theory," said Ding. "It is imperative to advance the
great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as
we approach the new century"
</P>
<P>
The banner of the Deng Xiaoping Theory must be held high and
all aspects of work must be guided by the theory, according to
Ding.
</P>
<P>
"We must be sober-minded and resolute concerning the issue in
order to fulfil all tasks set forth by the 15th CPC National
Congress," Ding said.

<P>
The pioneering cooperative project launched by CIPG and Yale
University Press in 1990 is the first of its kind in the history
of Sino-US joint publishing, according to CIPG Director Yang
Quanzheng. Yang made the remarks during today's inaugural ceremony
in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
"The project, which is highly academic in nature and
unprecedented in scale, covers wide-ranging subjects and offers
excellent printing and binding quality," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Experts are trying to present the rich legacy of Chinese
culture to overseas readers in familiar languages and forms of
expression. Their goal is to ensure the series will be part of the
overall cultural wealth of all mankind, said Yang, adding that
related efforts will make a due contribution to world peace and to
building bridges for mutual understanding between people from
different countries.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from China, the United States, France, Italy, Sweden,
Great Britain, Germany, Norway, Holland, Russia, Thailand and
Japan are currently working on the remaining volumes.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that Chinese President Jiang Zemin will visit the
United States next week. He said the compilers of the "Culture and
Civilization of China" series feel they have contributed to mutual
understanding between people in China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
John Ryden, director of Yale University Press, said his
organization has committed extensive resources to the long-term
effort in hope that future generations "will some day attain and
cherish an understanding that is currently lacking between people
in China and the United States."
</P>
<P>
"I hope the series will constitute a university without walls,
wherein the best scholars and teachers come together in the pages
of the volumes to share their learning and understanding of China
with us, and with our children and grandchildren," said Ryden, who
travelled from the United States to attend today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
James Cahill, director of US-China Book Publication Project and
executive editor of the "Culture and Civilization of China"
series, noted that the contributions Chinese culture has made to
mankind's great cultural, philosophical, literary and artistic
achievements are immeasurable.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this unprecedented publishing effort is part of a
far broader historical tendency towards a more equitable and
culturally diverse world," said Cahill.

<HEADLINE> ADB Warns of Larger Current Account Deficit in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
today warned that over-investment is leading to a larger current
account deficit in Asia this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
In a report released at a two-day workshop on Asia's economic
outlook here, the bank said the current account deficit for Asia
worsened during 1996, soaring from 25 billion U.S. dollars to 45
billion dollars in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The level of deficit for 1997 is expected to increase to 47
billion dollars, about 1.6 percent of the region's gross domestic
product (GDP), it said.
</P>
<P>
"A sharp spurt in the current account deficit of the Republic
of Korea and higher rates of investment by some Asian economies
were two of the key driving forces behind the spurt in current
account deficits," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Given the high rates of investment, it said, little improvement
is expected in the current account deficit in the region.
</P>
<P>
The projected level of deficits for developing Asia in 1998 is
52 billion dollars," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said over-investment, which led to the creation of
over-capacity in some key sectors, was also responsible for
growing over-heating problems in some Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement in the current account deficit situation
in the Republic of Korea and China, and reduction in the deficit
in South Asia, the region's deficit is projected to fall to 42
billion dollars in 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On the region's inflation, the report said the financial and
currency crisis in Southeast Asia raised the sub-region's
inflation rates, which in turn affected the regional averages.
</P>
<P>
The average consumer price inflation for 1997 has been
estimated at 7.8 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Given the present set of economic problems, major improvement
(in inflation) is not expected during the next two years," the
report said. "It is expected to worsen in 1998 to 8.7 percent. The
forecast level of inflation for 1999 is 7.8 percent," it said.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Head Calls for Balance in Assessing African Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Rubens Ricupero, secretary
general of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
today called for a balanced approach both in assessment and
solution to Africa's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Caution rather than complacency is warranted as cyclical while
transitory factors have played an important role in the recent
economic upturn in Africa, Ricupero told the ongoing annual
session of the Board of the UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
After many years of stagnation and decline, Africa has
registered three successive years, beginning in 1994, of improved
economic performance, engendering much optimism, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, there is no reason to underrate difficulties
still laying ahead.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural development is a key component of the economic
growth in Africa, he said. But, the green revolution, which had
helped bring about food security in other regions, could not
easily be replicated in the African continent due to problems
related to climate and soil.
</P>
<P>
After a few years of improved weather conditions in Africa,
agriculture could suffer a setback this year, especially in
sub-Saharan Africa, owing to the abnormal weather phenomenon known
as "El Nino," he said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, because of their geographic locations, African
countries had not benefited from the "flying geese" pattern, as
had Asian developing countries from spill-overs from neighboring
rapidly-growing economies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ricupero saw a growing willingness to take up the
challenge of African development, which were demonstrated by
initiatives taken by the United Nations, the European Union,
Japan, the United States, and political commitments expressed by
the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations at its Denver
Summit.
</P>
<P>
Some efforts must be made to set a pattern and to coordinate
those various initiatives, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) has retained steady economic growth and social stability
since its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the success to the highly effective leadership of
the regional government and the concerted efforts of Hong Kong
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during a meeting with Hong Kong
representatives attending a seminar on cooperation between
Beijing, the Chinese capital, and the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Jiang voiced pleasure with the HKSAR's new appearance and
vigorous advancement. He pointed to this year as an "extraordinary
year" during which the Chinese government has resumed the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and the Chinese Communist Party
successfully held its 15th national congress which mapped out the
overall strategy for China's future reform and development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president extended a warm welcome to Hong Kong
representatives attending the seminar. He said their presence will
be of great significance for enhancing economic cooperation
between Beijing and Hong Kong, and noted that the seminar will
inevitably promote ties between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Beijing and the HKSAR will explore
practical and effective forms of cooperation with a view to
achieving common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong business tycoon Li Ka Shing noted that the 15th CPC
congress has created new opportunities for China's reform and
opening, and will further boost the confidence of people in the
HKSAR concerning China's future and region's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said the "one country, two systems" formula is working
smoothly in Hong Kong, and has evoked positive comments which will
help uplift China's position in the world.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin, who also serves as secretary of CPC
Beijing Municipal Committee, and Liao Hui, director of the State
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, also attended the
meeting.

of its troops stationed in Senegal over the next two years but
the French military capacity of intervention will remain the

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israel, Jordan to Build Joint Tourism Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel is gearing up to
restore warm relationship with Jordan in the aftermath of its
failed attempt to assassinate a Hamas leader, through a series of
joint tourism and water projects.
</P>
<P>
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and other senior
officials will visit Jordan in the next few days to discuss
setting up joint ventures to promote tourism and water development
in the Jordan Valley bordering the two countries, Israel Radio
said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local media revealed that Israeli and Jordanian
businessmen have conducted preliminary talks on a plan to set up a
joint tourism and commercial center in the Red Sea coast.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the proposed site would straddle their
southern borders and include Israel's Red Sea resort Eilat and its
adjacent Jordanian resort Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian and Israeli investors want to build at the site
hotels, a casino, restaurants, a convention center, and duty-free
shops. The parties are also talking about joint investment in
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is currently being worked out by the two sides. If
the project is executed, Jordanian and Israeli businesses will
operate the site, while paying royalties to the respective
governments.
</P>
<P>
In a related development in Israel's efforts to remedy ties
with Jordan, Israeli Transport Ministry announced Monday that
Israel and Jordan are to begin on November 5 trial joint use of
Aqaba Airport, which is eventually slated to become a joint
international airport serving both countries.
</P>
<P>
Talks on opening the Aqaba Airport have been conducted for
many years without reaching result. But in the wake of the Israeli
intelligence fiasco in Amman, Israeli government became eager to
accelerate the talks.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Israel and Jordan have signed an agreement to
establish free trade zones in the Jordan valley. The U.S. agreed
to grant tax-free status to goods manufactured in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, trade between Israel and Jordan has
picked up. In 1996, bilateral trade totaled 13.8 million
U.S. dollars and in the first six months of this year, two-way
trade amounted to 12.7 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> China, US Jointly Publish Book on Chinese Culture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The largest cooperative
publishing project in history between Chinese and US publishers
reached a milestone today with publication of the work "Three
Thousand Years of Chinese Painting," the inaugural volume in
series introducing Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
Six experts from China and the United States completed the
300,000-word volume, which includes over 330 pictures and
paintings, over a period of seven years.
</P>
<P>
The work is the first volume of the series entitled "Culture
and Civilization of China" which was jointly initiated by the
China International Publishing Group (CIPG) and Yale University
Press of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The volume elaborates on the origin and styles of Chinese
painting, as well as a number of Chinese painters who's works have
lived over the past 3,000-plus years. The volume focuses on art
treasures found in private collections and large museums and
galleries around the world, with many of the works housed in the
Palace Museum in Beijing. The volume, which is published in
Chinese, English and French, will be available around the world.
</P>
<P>
The paintings, which are considered to be of great artistic
value, have been handed down over many generations, according to
Nie Chongzheng, one of the six compilers who works in the Palace
Museum.
</P>
<P>
Nie pointed to the fact that numerous paintings dating to the
Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties are available
today, and noted that the compilers have selected works rarely
seen by the general public. Paintings dating to the Qing Dynasty
include works by foreigners who served Chinese emperors during the
period, as well as imperial painters and folk artists.
</P>
<P>
The "Culture and Civilization of China" will consist of three
volumes -- an album of paintings, translated versions of Chinese
classics, and a treatise on Chinese philosophy. The series will
cover 100-odd topics, and will display the excellence of Chinese
culture to people around the world.
</P>
<P>
The compilers note that the series will provide authoritative
references for universities outside China offering courses on
Chinese culture.

BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan issue and Sino-US
nuclear cooperation are on the list of topics to be discussed
during President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States later
this month.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang, speaking at

issue has always been the most sensitive and crucial issue in
Sino-US relations. The two countries established diplomatic
relations only after the issue was properly addressed.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the direction in the evolution of bilateral relations
will to a large extent depend on the attitude the US adopts and
the actions it takes on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
China has noticed that the US has recently reiterated its
stance against "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and against
Taiwan joining the United Nations, he said. The US has also
stressed that there is only one China in the world and that Taiwan
is an inseparable part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that China sincerely hopes that the US will
continue to strictly abide by the spirit and principles of the
three joint communiques signed by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Shen responded to a question about nuclear cooperation between
China and foreign countries by pointing out that the Chinese
Government sincerely hopes that China and the US will reach
agreement in this regard during ongoing consultations. China
sincerely hopes that the two sides will make progress on the issue
during President Jiang Zemin's visit to the US, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the great potential for cooperation between the
two countries in the field of nuclear power. Shen noted that China
has a huge market for nuclear energy, while the US has advanced
nuclear technology.

<HEADLINE> Rain Boosts Australian Wheat Production Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Rain falling on the
South-eastern plain of Australia has bumped up wheat production
forecasts by almost 1.5 million tons, the Australian government's
chief commodity adviser announced today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
(ABARE) also lifted its total winter crop production forecasts by
three million tons.
</P>
<P>
But ABARE Acting Executive Director Stephen Beare warned that
although downpours in September and early October had boosted
yield prospects, more rain was still needed in Victoria, South
Australia (SA) and New South Wales (NSW), all main wheat producing
areas.
</P>
<P>
"Total Australian winter crop production in 1997/98 is forecast
to be about 28 million tons with Australian wheat and barley
production in 1997/98 forecast to be 17.6 million tons and 5.5
million tons respectively," Beare said in the ABARE October Crop
Report issued today.

<P>
This compares with the previous estimates of about 16.2 million
tons for wheat.
</P>
<P>
Although the timing of the harvest was expected to be slightly
late in most regions, crops would still be gathered in November
and December.
</P>
<P>
But the report noted: "The Bureau of Meteorology's latest
medium term outlook for the period from October to December still
indicates that below average rainfall is the most likely scenario
for crop-growing regions in Victoria, SA and southern NSW.
</P>
<P>
Although forecast production was still 23 percent down on last
year, it was one percent higher than the five year average and 18
percent more than the previous estimate.

<HEADLINE> Talks on S. Leone's Crisis to Begin in Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A high powered military
government delegation from Sierra Leone left here for neighboring
Guinea today for talks with the ECOWAS committee of five to seek
a solution to the political crisis in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The delegation which includes representatives of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) is led by the junta's Foreign
Secretary Paolo Bangura.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the talks which would start Wednesday
will also include United States Ambassador in Sierra Leone John
Hirsch and the newly appointed United Nations envoy to Sierra
Leone, Ugandan-born Francis Okello.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the Foreign Ministry in Freetown, the
Junta delegation will press for the release from detention in
Nigeria of RUF leader Foday Sankoh to join the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Junta spokesman Allieu Kamara said in an interview with Xinhua
today, ''we are eager to talk to everyone and every organization
to find a peaceful solution to the problem but the truth is that
nobody has bothered to know our feelings since the coup.''
</P>
<P>
''Asking us to step down is completely irrelevant. We should
be judged by the peace which we have achieved by getting the
rebels out of the bush and ending the six year long civil war,''
Kamara said.
</P>
<P>
A 25-man delegation of church leaders in Sierra Leone will
also attend the talks as observers.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Council of Churches in Sierra Leone
(CCSL) Alimamy Koroma said, ''we shall also hold private meetings
in Conakry with ECOWAS ministers as well as Guinean government
officials.''
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea and Liberia are named by
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to
represent it in talks with the military junta which staged a coup
to oust elected President Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Initial talks broke down in July after junta leader Major
Johnny Paul Koroma declared that he would return democratic rule
to Sierra Leone in four years' time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, military sources here said the Nigerian contingent
in West African Peace-keeping Force known as ECOMOG based at Jui,
13 miles east of the capital on Monday evening flew white flags
to signify that a cease-fire is in place.
</P>
<P>
Jui has been the focus of bitter fighting between the
Nigerians and Sierra Leoneans for over a week and the outcome as
to which group had the upper hand remains disputed.
</P>
<P>
One source said the cease-fire will remain in place for the
duration of the Conakry talks.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS committee of five wants to force the junta to step
down and reinstate the legitimate government of Kabbah through
the talks.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests US Violations of Its Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has protested to the
United Nations against the United States' continued violations of
its air space, Iraq's official news agency INA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi permanent representative to the U.N. Security Council
Nezar Hamdoun has delivered a letter to U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan, protesting that U.S. aircraft have made 1,588
surveillance and provocative sorties over cities and towns in
northern and southern Iraq from October 1 to 15, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoun requested the U.N. chief to intervene to stop the
U.S. acts which he said pose a threat to the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Iraq. He branded the U.S. actions as a
"blatant" violations of the U.N. Charter and international laws.
</P>
<P>
He also said that these acts only serve to intimidate civilians
and damage public as well as private property.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been protesting against U.S. and British aircraft's
breaches of its air space since 1991. Recently, its complaints
focused on the U.S. especially after the U.S. aircraft carrier
"Nimitz" arrived in the gulf region in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said recently that the
U.S. is tightening enforcement of a no-fly zone over southern Iraq
and warned that Iraq will "bear the consequences" if its warplanes
continue to violate the ban.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones over southern and northern Iraq were set up
after the 1991 Gulf War to prevent Iraqi government forces from
attacking rebel Shiite Muslims and Kurds.

<HEADLINE> Manila and Muslim Rebels Agree to Stick to Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and a
major Muslim rebel group today agreed to abide by an earlier
preliminary truce accord and continue to push through their
exploratory peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The commitment came during an emergency meeting held in
Cotabato city, capital of southern Maguindanao province, between
negotiators from the government and the separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called to defuse mounting tension near the
MILF's biggest stronghold, Camp Abubakar, in Maguindanao, where
the military and the rebels have been massing for a possible
outbreak of conflict these days.
</P>
<P>
In a report to President Fidel Ramos, Orlando Soriano, chairman
of the government peace panel, said the subcommittees from the two
sides on the general cessation of hostilities expressed their
"continuing adherence to the spirit and intent" of the truce they
signed on July 18, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed that recent tension in the area would
not affect the ongoing peace negotiations and that the seventh
round of peace talks will be held as scheduled on November 12-13
in Marawi city, southern Lanao del Sur province.
</P>
<P>
Soriano said the two sides accepted the commitment made Monday
by the MILF Supreme Islamic Court that there will be no execution
in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed to refer the attack at the Army's Sixth
Infantry Division's headquarters in Camp Siongco, in Maguindanao
on October 14 to an independent fact-finding committee for
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Soriano said both sides are closely monitoring the situation in
the area to ease tension, especially in Maguindanao and its
adjacent provinces.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the government panel also assured the MILF
that the government forces will return to their previous positions
in order to help ease the tension in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Army's Sixth Infantry Division built up its troops in the
areas near the MILF's Camp Abubakar days after last week's attack
on the division's headquarters, during which two Arab terrorists
and three soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
The military blamed the raid on the MILF, but the charge was
vehemently denied by the latter.
</P>
<P>
The MILF accused the military of provocation by augmenting its
presence and vowed to mobilize 12,000 fighters to counter any
military offensive against Camp Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The military denied that it will storm Camp Abubakar, saying
the troop movement is part of its measures to protect residents
from terrorists and to safeguard the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the MILF said it did not recognize the
Philippines' constitution, and ordered the execution of two people
whom a rebel court found guilty of murder. The executions were
carried out before 2,000 people in a village.
</P>
<P>
Boasting a membership of more than 20,000, the MILF is
currently the largest anti-government force in the country.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique May Revise Agreement With US Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government is
negotiating with Enron, a US company, on the possibility of
revising an agreement which offers the company an exclusive right
in tapping and selling the natural gas in Pande, in
Mozambique's central province of Sofala.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Noticias today quoted John Kachamila,
Mozambican Minister of Mining and Energy, as making the statement
on Monday in New York where he is now visiting.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique signed an agreement at the end of 1994 with Enron
to give the latter the right to extract natural gas in the
country starting from 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, Kachamila said, the project has been postponed for
many times owing mainly to the fact that the U.S. company failed
to find the market.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the agreement which gives Enron the exclusive right
has hampered Mozambique to find other partners given the current
situation, thus causing a great loss to the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister hoped that the ongoing negotiations in Maputo
could lead to substitution plans or other partners. It is
predicted that the term of "exclusive right" to the US company in
the agreement might be revised.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the Pande mine has a natural gas reserve
of 2,500 billion cubic meters. According to the previous plan,
the mine was to provide gas to South Africa or a projected iron
and steel plant near the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border. But so far,
nothing has come out of it.

<HEADLINE> Britain Wants Sierra Leone's Military Regime out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain reminded the military
government of Sierra Leone on Monday that it enjoys no backing
from any sector of the international society and warned that it
should quit while it still could.
</P>
<P>
"The military junta can be clear that there is no government
to whom it can look for support in the region, any more than in
the wider world," British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd was
quoted by Nigerian media as saying in London.
</P>
<P>
Apparently commenting on Wednesday's expected talk between the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and Freetown,
Lloyd expressed the hope that junta led by Major Johnny Kromah is
serious this time.
</P>
<P>
The first such talks collapsed in July and led to sanctions
against Freetown first by the ECOWAS and then backed by the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The message to them, and let me make this absolutely clear,
must be to get out while the possibility of doing so still
remains", he said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall continue to work for the return of democratically
elected government in Freetown, with its mandate to govern for
the benefit of all Sierra Leoneans, not just the few," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, media reports said today that about 10,000 people
have fled Freetown, amid continued bombing of certain sectors of
the city by the ECOWAS peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) and clashes
between the ECOMOG and Kromah's soldiers.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian Minister for
Industry John Moore welcomed today the decision by Hong Kong-based
company Dascom Holdings Ltd, to establish its regional
headquarters in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The new headquarters, to be located on the Gold Coast of east
Australia's Queensland state, will be responsible for research and
development, marketing and software support activities which were
previously undertaken at the company's U.S. operations in Santa
Cruz, California.
</P>
<P>
The company has committed to investment in Australia worth 65
million U.S. dollars over the next five years, the minister said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that Dascom chose Australia for its headquarters,
despite strong competition from Singapore," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
"Key factors in the decision were the quality of the Australian
workforce and our excellent telecommunications infrastructure," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Dascom specializes in the research and development,
manufacture, marketing, distribution and servicing of information
technology-related products and services.
</P>
<P>
Dascom, which produces printers, develops software and provides
system integration and hardware services, is based in Hong Kong
and employs more than 3,000 people internationally, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of Dascom's total revenue (392 million U.S.
dollars in 1996) is from China, where it is the largest supplier
of computer printers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are now more than 350 international companies with
regional headquarters or regional management operations in
Australia," the minister added.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
weaker today, as players took stock ahead of this week's key
quarterly inflation figures.
</P>
<P>
The data are expected to signal inflationary pressures remain
weak and could reignite speculation of an easing of monetary
policy by the Reserve Bank of Australia in the short term.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 72.84 U.S. cents, down from
73.03 previously.

"It has been fairly quiet in terms of movement but we have seen
some good two-way interest today," said ANZ Investment Bank head
of foreign exchange sales John Reedyk.
</P>
<P>
He expected the currency would trade quietly ahead of the
inflation data.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia's next meeting to consider
monetary policy is scheduled for November 4.

SHANGHAI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medalist Sui
Xinmei of Shanghai won the women's shot put gold at the Eighth
National Games by beating former world champion Huang Zhihong by
one centimeter here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sui, 32, took the gold with a throw of 20.25 meters in her
farewell competition.
</P>
<P>
Huang, also 32, won the silver with 0.01 meter behind, followed
by 38-year-old Asian record holder Li Meisu of Hebei with 19.46
meters.
</P>
<P>
"All of our three have done the utmost," said the Atlanta
Olympic silver medalist. "There should be no regret if I lost."
</P>
<P>
The three over-30s veterans have dominated the women's shot put
since the middle of the 1980s.

Huang of Zhejiang won the silver in the Barcelona Games and
took the gold at the World Championships in Stuggart in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"It was very hard for three of us to win the top three places,"
said Sui. "I think Huang and Li will also retire after the Games.
It's for the young athletes to shoulder the task for China."

<HEADLINE> South Pacific Commission Renamed: Australian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The 50 year-old South Pacific
Commission (SPC) has made a decision to change its name to the
Pacific Community, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Downer, chairman of the 37th South Pacific Conference involving
26 SPC members, said the name change was largely motivated by the
fact that several of the community's members now came from north
of the equator.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference was hosted by Australia on October
19-21 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the commission, Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
The conference issued a document titled "the Canberra
Declaration on Social and Economic Development", which lists such
issues as population growth, education, the spread of HIV/AIDS and
the need to use forest and fishery resources in a sustainable
manner as the major challenges facing the region.
</P>
<P>
Bob Dun, director-general of the commission, said the name
change did not signal the creation of a political and economic
bloc similar to the European Community.
</P>
<P>
"The South Pacific Commission is really a technical
organization," Dun told a news conference in Canberra, adding the
South Pacific Forum is a political body.
</P>
<P>
The organization now has 26 members, including 22 island
countries and territories and four of the six original
metropolitan countries which set up the commission in 1947:
Australia, New Zealand, France and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The commission has played an important role in promoting social
and economic development in the region and could continue to do so
in the future, Downer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the conference welcome back the
United Kingdom, which announced yesterday its intention to rejoin
the SPC in 1998. The United Kingdom left the organization at the
end of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Newspaper Calls for Timely Doha Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 21 (Xinhua) -- An influential Kuwaiti
newspaper today called for timely holding of the controversial
Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit scheduled in
mid-November in the Qatari capital of Doha.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Arab Times said in an editorial written by
Editor-in-Chief Ahmed Al-Jarallah that "Qatar is fulfilling its
international obligations and I fail to understand why it should
bear the brunt of criticism and political vilification."
</P>
<P>
Several Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates had announced their intention to boycott the
conference because of the involvement of Israel which they accuse
of being responsible for the breakdown of Mideast peace talks in
March.
</P>
<P>
However Al-Jarallah said the conference is aimed at attracting
foreign capital to the region to create new job opportunities and
set the pace for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of attending the economic conference in Doha should
be viewed from a purely economic angle based on the outcome of the
three earlier conferences," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "Arabs should not use the Doha economic conference as a
tool to apply pressure on Israel," adding that "applying pressure
on Israel can not be achieved by weakening Arab unity and
integrity."
</P>
<P>
"This issue should not be politically associated with the
arduous peace negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Doha summit is the fourth of its kind following
the previous ones in Casablanca, Morocco; Amman, Jordan and
Cairo, Egypt. All the three conferences were attended by Arab
states, Israel and their major trade partners in the
industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
But the deadlocked Middle East peace process has soured the
atmosphere for the forthcoming summit.

LHASA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Smoke from the giant incense
burner on the Johkang Monastery Square breaks the dawn of Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Early-morning devotees of Buddha, wearing strings of beads and
carrying their prayer wheels, swarm into circumambulation paths
around Bargor Street, the Johkang Monastery and the Potala Palace.
</P>
<P>
In the annual pilgrimage, followers in throngs from faraway
pastoral areas, arrive at their sacred site of Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Buddhists in the plateau region go on pilgrimages
with the whole family at least once a year. Some pious ones
prostrate themselves on the ground respectfully with each step,
seemingly measuring the road with their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Dagwa Toinzhub, however, disagrees with the ancient tradition
of full prostration.
</P>
<P>
"Respect for Sakyamuni shouldn't rigidly adhere to a single
form," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can decide what we should do and when we should go for
paying religious homage to the Buddha," said Dagwa, clad in the
white tweed and classical Buddhist outfits with a bead string and
a prayer wheel.
</P>
<P>
"Our village leaders only warned us against holding up the
right farming seasons," he said.

<P>
Tibetan farmers and herdsmen can show their religious piety
even without reaching Lhasa, the regional capital. The government
of the Tibet Autonomous Region has opened to the public some 1,700
temples and other religious sites throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
"I have a lamasery next to the door, and sutra chanting of
neighboring lamas often drifts into my house," said Purpu Zholma,
a farmer from Quxu County.
</P>
<P>
However, the nomadic Buddhists in Ngari Prefecture have no
regular religious sites because of their lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
"The roving-around life disqualifies us from building temples,"
said Ngaga, a nomad who takes Buddhist texts with him and asks
religious instructions from wandering lamas.
</P>
<P>
The farmers in Gerze County, also in Ngari, find their favorite
way for Buddhist respect by setting up a white pagoda every year
after holding a routine religious ritual. Until now, 14 white
pagodas have been in their area.
</P>
<P>
For most of the Tibetan Buddhists, divine spirit is
everywhere. Any common mountain, stone, lake or tree can be
linked with religious belief of local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Stone heaps hung with prayer banners and auspicious scarves
throughout Tibet might be symbolic dwellings of the holy Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Almost every family has its own shrine to Buddha. Cedan Zhouga,
who lives in suburban Lhasa, makes offerings to a newly installed
Buddha of Longevity in her house.
</P>
<P>
Apart from going for circumambulation, the Tibetan woman spends
much time in praying inside the house.
</P>
<P>
As time goes by, Tibetans still cannot part with daily
religious rituals during birth, marriage, death and other events.
</P>
<P>
But people there also acknowledged that religious influence in
farming and other works fades out gradually.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people are cherishing new and scientific
technologies in farming now," Cedan Zhouga said.

MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi arrived here this afternoon for a two-day state visit with
the aim of enhancing Italy's economic and trade relations with the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who flew in from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, was
met by Philippine Vice President Joseph Estrada and Foreign
Minister Domingo Siazon at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival, Prodi proceeded to the Philippine
presidential palace, where he will meet with President Fidel Ramos
and other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will reportedly focus their talks on exploring
ways to improve bilateral trade which reached nearly 400 million
U.S. dollars, relatively small compared to Italy's trade with
other Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to discuss the welfare of the more than
60,000 Filipino workers in Italy, and measures to increase
investment in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Italy has been an active supporter in the Philippine
development efforts through its official development assistance
which amounted to nearly 150 million U.S. dollars from 1986 to
1996.
</P>
<P>
Manila is the third leg of Prodi's four-nation Asian swing

LUSAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A poverty eradication focal
unit has been established in Zambia's Ministry of Community
Development and Social Services to manage the poverty eradication
program for the period between 1998 and the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a micro credit national summit on Monday, Deputy
Finance Minister Godfrey Simasiku said that the government will
increase the budgetary allocations for the social sector
development, but public service will have to be reduced to
guarantee the the sucess of the poverty eradication program.
</P>
<P>
He said that eradication of poverty would only be achieved by
rapid economic growth for which investment is of great
importance.
</P>
<P>
Simasiku emphasized that investments by the private sector, at
the micro and small scale, medium-sized and large level, hold the
key to sustained increase in production, incomes and employment.
</P>
<P>
poverty has beset the Zambian government for the past decades
and hampered the country's social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, with a territory of 750000 square kilometers and a
population of 10 million, is one of the 43 underdeveloped
countries in the world.

About 85 percent of the population live under poverty line
while 75 percent of the Zambians are in a state of absolute
poverty.

<HEADLINE> First Sea-Bed Antarctic Rock Sample Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A multinational scientific
team has recovered the first rock sample from deep beneath the
Antarctic ocean bed in a bid to reveal what happened in the frozen
continent 30-100 million years ago, an Australian earth scientist
on the team said today.
</P>
<P>
Ken Woolfe from James Cook University in Australia's northern
Queensland state said 51 scientists from six countries were
involved in the research.
</P>
<P>
James Cook University is the only Australian signatory to the
International Cape Roberts Project involving the research on the
Antarctic which got underway earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"My own work will involve looking at the description of the
rocks and interpreting the environment in which they were formed,"
Woolfe was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the scientists were excited by the project because
nothing was known about what happened in the Antarctic when the
ice sheet was first forming.
</P>
<P>
"We think we'll find there was a time when there was no ice at
all in the Antarctic. We don't know how it occurred or when it
occurred," he said.
</P>
<P>
By being able to understand the past, scientists would be
better able to predict the future and understand how the Antarctic
would react to global warming, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If all the ice in the Antarctic melted at once, sea levels all
over the Earth would rise by 60 meters," he said.
</P>
<P>
Woolfe said the research, the largest ever scientific project
undertaken in the Antarctic, was fraught with potential logistical
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
"What we've basically done is putting a drilling rig on the sea
ice, then drilled through the ice and water and then finally 400
meters into the seabed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we have to have exactly the right conditions, which really
only gives us about eight to 10 weeks to work in."
</P>
<P>
He said the weather had to be cold enough to keep the ice
stable yet not so cold that it made the steel of the 20-tonne
drilling rig brittle.
</P>
<P>
Violent storms which could fracture the ice and potentially
plunge the rig into the ocean posed another risk for the
researchers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the high risks involved, the research team lives at
a camp 10 kilometers from the drilling site and members are flown
to the rig by helicopter to work on 12-hour shifts in minus 21
Celsius centigrade conditions.
</P>
<P>
Besides the scientists, 20 drilling and support staff from
Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Italy, Germany and
Britain are involved in the project which will continue drilling
until the end of November and then resume next summer.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Runners Break World Record in 5,000 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese women runners,
including two new proteges of coach Ma Junren, broke the world
record in the 5,000 meters in the group one heat of the Chinese
National Games here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ma's disciples Dong Yanmei and Jiang Bo of Liaoning province,
clocked 14:31.27 and 14:31.30 respectively for the top two places,
while Liu Shixiang of Shandong came in third in 14:32.33.
</P>
<P>
All the three runners surpassed the world record of 14:36.45
set up by Fernanda Ribeiro of Portugal in Hechtel, Belgium on July
22, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Dong Yanmei, 17, made her first impact on Sunday when she
threated the world record of 29:31.78 by timing in 30:38.09 in
winning the 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 20-year-old Jiang Bo clocked three minutes 50.98
seconds to take the women's 1,500 meters title, only 0.52 seconds
shy of the world record of 3:50.46 set by Qu Yunxia four years ago
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
But super coach Ma was not satisfied with the results. "They
could have ran faster," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
"With the record broken, all world records in the women's long
distance events are held by the Chinese," Ma said. "That's a glory
for all the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
The women's 10,000m and 3,000m records were all held by Ma's
former disciple Wang Junxia, who broke away in 1994 and won the
5,000m gold in the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Qu Yunxia, who is still under the charge of Ma, was the record
holder in the 1,500m event.
</P>
<P>
Qu was expected by Ma to beat her own world mark last week, but
she fell to the track with 300m left and finished only an eighth
place.
</P>
<P>
In the group two heat, Ma's other runners swept the top three
places but failed to break the world record.
</P>
<P>
"I urged them to speed up before the last three laps, but they
didn't understand my hand gestures," Ma said on the stands.
</P>
<P>
"All the three in group two should beat the world mark. I had
such a plan prior to the competition," he sighed. "What a pity!"
</P>
<P>
Coach Ma acknowledged that his new runners are still young and
still on the way to whet up their prowess, saying "they lack
expierence. They are too young."
</P>
<P>
However, he believed that his proteges will get mature very
soon. "I want to assure all the Chinese people that my runners can
win at least three gold medals in the 2,000 Sydney Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
The coach also denounced the rumors that Chinese runners used
banned drugs to enhance their performances.
</P>
<P>
"That's the rumours created by the Western media. They are
good at producing drug experts, not me," said the angry Ma.
</P>
<P>
"It was these Western countries that invented the performance
enhancing drugs, but they put them on the banned list when they
found the drugs were out of date."
</P>
<P>
"I welcome them to test my runners at any time. They can find
all my athletes are innocent, then they can shut up and remove the
bias against the Chinese athletes," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The women's 5,000m finals will be held on Wednesday afternoon.
Ma believed his women army can break the world record again.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Closer to Aviation Accord: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
Authority (PNA) have made headway in reaching an aviation accord
over the Gaza airport following Monday's high-level talks, a
report said today.
</P>
<P>
Local English daily The Jerusalem Post today quoted Israeli
sources as saying that the progress was made at a three-sided
meeting among Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, chief PNA
negotiator Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and U.S. envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
The accord reportedly comprises three main categories: entry
into Israeli-controlled air space, customs procedures, and
security arrangements on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Since the airport, called by the PNA as Gaza International
Airport, is built in Dahaniya at the southern end of Gaza Strip,
the bilateral compact also would have to relate to flights by
commercial aircrafts through adjacent Egyptian air space, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and PNA assessments of the Monday talks indicated that
progress was made toward enabling PNA President Yasser Arafat's
helicopter to use Dahaniya airport. The airport's runway is also
expected to be available to his private jet soon.
</P>
<P>
Levy helped improve the atmosphere by suggesting that Israel
is ready to make concession on the hotly disputed issue of
settlement expansion. He said that only "necessary minimum"
settlment construction would continue, indicating that Israel
might agree to a time-out of settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The PNA preferred to separate the specific airport
arrangements for Arafat and his family from other terms of the
embryonic accord. Levy sought a "package deal," which would
encompass the crucial security aspects of the airport's
operations.
</P>
<P>
But there are no indications if the two sides have narrowed
their dispute over the issue of security control in the
airport. Israel has maintained that it should be granted security
presence in all entries into the airport, while the PNA tries to
limit Israel's control.
</P>
<P>
Another main objective in Monday's talks was to evaluate the
work of their nine joint committees. The committee on
people-to-people exchanges reportedly has come up with several
interesting projects, including an education program for the
inculcation of the Hebrew and Arabic languages and an proposal
for playing a soccer game by Israeli and Palestinian teams either
in Gaza or the West Bank city Jericho.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Israel's further troop redeployments in the
West Bank, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat insisted that there
would be no holding back of the redeployments. He called for the
U.S. involvement in deciding the scope of further pullouts to end
unilateral Israeli actions.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Abbass' upbeat mood, PNA spokesman Nabil Abu
Rudeineh, who joined the Monday meeting, said "nothing was
achieved and nothing was implemented." But he praised Ross for
making "good efforts" in order to achieve results from his new
shuttle mission which began on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ross held his second round of talks Monday separately with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PNA leader Arafat,
and the third round of talks with the two leaders are to be held
today.

<HEADLINE> Visa to Lay Foundation for China's Bank Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners are now able to
withdraw Chinese currency from more than 1,000 ATMs in Shanghai by
using their Visa cards, a service that should be available in many
other cities by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
 "To provide Visa cardholders with the same service in China
as in other places of the world is one objective of Visa
International's development in the country," said Lee Leehun,
vice-president of Visa International and chief representative to
China. "Helping the development of China's bank card service is
another aim."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Lee said that China's stable
economic development means the country has been transformed from a
potential market to a real one. The change offers tremendous
opportunities for cooperation between China and other countries,
Lee said, setting the stage for the increased use of Visa as an
advanced means of financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
Lee expressed the hope that China and the United States would
continue to strengthen their ties of economic cooperation which
would help U.S.-based Visa International to realize its goals in

Since Visa entered the Chinese market in 1989, it has offered
technological support and marketing expertise to its 10 Chinese
member banks.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996 Visa -- together with Chinese banks,
businesses and universities -- had issued 1,190 cards.
</P>
<P>
Commercial Bank of China, Construction Bank of China, Bank of
China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) have also
issued one million inter-link cards in accordance with the
international standards set by Visa.
</P>
<P>
Lee cited the potential for development of the credit card
industry in China. Sustained development of the economy and
computerized finance makes it necessary to upgrade the means of
payment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank card market in China is immature and Visa's Chinese
partners lack experience, Lee said, but he praised banks in China
for their initiative and strong sense of competition.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's attention to the development of
finance will also guarantee the smooth advancement of Visa's
cooperation with China, he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Withhold Investigation on Kim Dae Jung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean prosecutors said
today they will suspend the inquiry into slush funds allegedly
held by opposition presidential hopeful Kim Dae Jung until after
the December election.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor-general Kim Tae Joung said an investigation on the
leading presidential candidate just two months before the
election, especially innocent of the past circumstance of
political fund, is feared to cause a serious division among the
people.
</P>
<P>
"And it is technically impossible to complete the investigation
before the election," he said at a hastily-called press conference.
</P>
<P>
The ruling New Korea Party (NKP) last Friday filed complaints
with the prosecution against the opposition National Congress for
New Politics (NCNP) leader Kim Dae Jung on charges of bribery, tax
evasion and libel and demanded an immediate probe.
</P>
<P>
The NKP charged that Kim had taken bribes amounting to at least
13 billion won (14.44 million U.S. dollars) from business groups
and having evaded taxes by stashing over 100 billion won (111.11
million dollars) in secret funds in bank accounts of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the prosecutors' decision on suspending
the investigation would be a heavy blow to the NKP, whose
presidential candidate Lee Hoi Chang is continuously in the third
place in various opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
But if the election process, in which candidates had spent
money like water, has not improved, then the prosecution would
immediately launch an investigation, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
"In that case, the focus of our investigation will not only be
past political funds but the funds of all presidential candidates
including the president-elect," the top prosecutor said.

<HEADLINE> Further Improvement of Sino-US Economic Ties Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
need to work together to further tap the potential of the
bilateral economic and trade cooperation, a senior Chinese
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, vice minister of China's State Planning Commission
and the leader of a 24-member economic and trade delegation, said
that both China and the United States have tremendously benefited
by the development of bilateral trade ties which still have broad
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Zeng made these remarks at a dinner hosted in his honor by the
Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and the Atlantic Richfield
Corporation (ARCO), one of the largest U.S. oil company.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is committed to further opening its market,
increasing imports from the United States and making efforts to
reform foreign trade system and improving investment environment.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that the United States will ease its restrictions
on technology exports and financial credit to China, remove
artificial obstacles against the entry of American goods into the
Chinese market, stop the annual review of the most-favored-nation
status for China and deal properly with the issue of China's
accession into the World Trade Organization," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Before the dinner, the China National Offshore Oil Company
(CNOOC) and ARCO signed an agreement on cooperation in gas
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that in addition to this agreement, the Chinese
delegation will sign a series of contracts with their American
partners on purchasing a total of 4 billion U.S. dollar worth of
airplanes, power generation equipment, crude oil and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's visit demonstrates the sincerity and
willingness of the Chinese government and businessmen to further
strengthen bilateral economic and trade ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng told the American businessmen that the United States is
now one of the biggest foreign investor in China, with 23,200
projects and 15.7 billion dollars in place.
</P>
<P>
He cited ARCO, Intel and Mcdonald's as examples of the
successful U.S. businesses operational in China. In fact, about
200 companies in the Fortune 500 have their presence in the
dynamic and increasingly open China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official said that the United States could have
more market shares in China's future development.
</P>
<P>
Urging more American businessmen to seek trade and investment
opportunities in China, he said, "I'm sure they will find a vast
and promising space for development."
</P>
<P>
The high-ranking Chinese delegation including four ministers
and three vice ministers arrived Sunday in Los Angeles, the first
leg of their U.S. business tour.

<HEADLINE> Monkey-faced Eagles Discovered in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Eight monkey-faced eagles,
designated as class-1 birds under State protection, have been
discovered in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The eagles, with golden feathers and sunken eyes, are so named
because of their facial resemblance to monkeys.
</P>
<P>
Four immature eagles were found by an employee from the Matian
Orchard in Congren County, Jiangxi Province. They were released to
the wild in early April this year after being fed and cared for by
employees of the orchard for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
The released eagles have attracted four companions to come and
cry on the trees in front of the orchard every dusk, workers say,
and they co-exist with the poultry at the orchard.
</P>
<P>
Late last April a wounded monkey-faced eagle was found and
nursed to health by Huang Risheng, director of the Matian Orchard.
</P>
<P>
During their work, Huang and his fellow workers have been
credited with saving numerous wild animals and helping preserve
the local environment.

LUANDA, October 21 (Xinhua) --Portuguese Minister of Economy

two sides so as to promote bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Portugal would like to find a strategic way to solve the debt
issue, Mateus noted. Meanwhile, he said, his country wishes to

enterprises could operate in Angola in a way different from other
countries and to play a bigger role in the development of Angolan
economy.

<P>
LHASA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Cering Bazhoin describes herself
as a pious Buddhist who goes about her daily work of
circumambulating, swinging a prayer-wheel and chanting a universal
mantra.
</P>
<P>
"Going for circumambulation around the Potala Palace is my
first daily must after geting up at seven," said the
61-year-old retiree, who lives about two kilometers from one of
the oldest temples in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"I spend two hours in circling the palace twice," she said, "In
addition, I must pray in my home shrine to Buddha and add butter
into Buddha lamps before sleeping."
</P>
<P>
"I pray for the peace and health of my family," said
Bazhoin, dressed in her traditional Tibet garments.
</P>
<P>
With six members of an extended family, she said she revels in
daily happiness. She retired from a wool factory in Lhasa 10 years
ago. Her husband worked in a carpet factory. One son is a Tibetan
medical worker, while the other works as a policeman. Her daughter
works in a hotel and her grandson studies in a primary school.
</P>
<P>
The family mixes Tibetan tradition and modern life. A
refrigerator, a color TV and a cassette recorder, together with
Tibetan sofa cushion and cabinets are their favorite possessions.
</P>
<P>
"We have an average monthly income of more than 3,000 yuan
(about 360 US. dollars), among the middle level of living
standards in Lhasa," she said.
</P>
<P>
In earlier years, a heavy work load and family chores squeezed
religious routines out of her daily life, Bazhoin said. As the
only Buddhist in the family, she shows her piety by
circumambulation (ceremonial walking).
</P>
<P>
"All the family members have no negative view about my belief,
needless to say that other people would poke their noses into my
business," Bazhoin said.

<HEADLINE> High-Powered Debtors Cause Closure of Zambia Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Ministers, senior leaders from
the ruling Movement for Multi-Democracy (MMD) and some opposition
leaders have led to the closure of Zambia's Prudence
Bank, a leading independent newspaper The Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a list of debtors who are "part of the
reason" for the downfall of the embattled bank as saying five
government ministers, deputy ministers and several MMD cadres
owed the bank about 1.45 billion Kwacha (1.1 million US Dollars)
through their individual companies.
</P>
<P>
The money, said the paper, was given as loans between 1995 and
1996 but Prudence Bank's Chairman Ravi Devalia did not confirm
whether or not the loans have been serviced.
</P>
<P>
While opposition leaders owed the bank 16 billion Kwacha (12.5
million dollars), the paper also quoted unnamed bank sources as
saying that another reason for the bank's collapse is its huge
overdraft with the Bank of Zambia, the country's central bank,
about 11 billion Kwacha (7.6 million dollars) which has not been
serviced.
</P>
<P>
The bank was closed for business last Saturday for
"unsatisfactory" compliance with the directives of the central
bank to improve its management.

She said China's registered trademarks had increased from
32,000 in 1979 to 640,000 today, including 80,000 foreign

China ranks among the top 10 in the number of registered
trademarks. The U.S. is first with 20,000 trademarks followed by
Japan, the Republic of Korea and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Horticulture Exports Go up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's horticultural
growers expect to earn over 1.6 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (128
million U.S. dollars) in exports this season, a 14 percent
increase from last year, The Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citrus will contribute the highest tonnage of exports at
35,000 tons followed by 17,000 tons of flowers and 12,000 tons of
fresh produce.
</P>
<P>
Last year farmers exported 25,000 tons of citrus, 13,000 tons
of flowers and 9,000 tons of fresh produce.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Heri, director of the Horticultural Promotion Council
said in an interview on Monday that the industry's main objective
was to consolidate the European Union market while diversifying
into other areas.
</P>
<P>
"We have every intention to diversify into other strategic
markets such as the Middle East, Far East, United States and
Australia," Heri said, adding that some growers had already
started supplying these countries.
</P>
<P>
The director attributed the rise to an increase in the number
of farmers turning to horticulture because the industry is not
affected by drought.
</P>
<P>
The industry also intends to venture more into value adding
programs by investing more in processing and improving quality
products, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Spend $200m on Electric Supply Facelift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Electric Supply
Corporation (ZESCO) expects to spend about 200 million U.S.
Dollars to rehabilitate its ailing infrastructure throughout the
country, the weekly Financial Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project, funded by the World Bank and several other
donors, has identified potential financiers and is expected to
run up to a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
A document on Power Rehabilitation Project (PRP) said the
project consists of 16 projects covering the rehabilitation and
refurbishment of hydro power stations and their transmission
system rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Once the works are completed, it is expected that ZESCO will
be supplying electricity to customers with the required quality
and efficiency through reliable transmission system as all the
hydro plants, which made Zambia become self-sufficient in power
in 1974, are expected to run at full capacity.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1994, the now dissolved energy council found that
some of ZESCO's infrastructure was in a deplorable state.
</P>
<P>
Most of the equipment was established 30 years ago and
required massive overhauling while the corporation had by then
been incurring losses for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Thus the PRP was launched in 1994 to address these
requirements to bring the hydro-plants to the designed operation
level and extend the economic life of the assets.
</P>
<P>
Most of the funding is expected to be provided by foreign
financial institutions including Swedish International
Development Association and European Investment Bank, although
some of them have yet to confirm their pledges while others have
only been identified as possible financiers.

opportunities in accordance with the principles and rules of a

LHASA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- At 3 p.m. on Oct. 15, a Tibetan
girl lined up punctually outside the region's prison to bring her
incarcerated elder brother some butter tea and cooked beef.
</P>
<P>
Another 300 relatives of other prisoners carried food and

convenience," said warden Losang Gailai, who said that the
regional government poured 1.2 million yuan (about 144,000
U.S. dollars) into the newly completed visitors center.

<HEADLINE> Battle for Advertizing Budget Intensifies in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A fierce fight for advertizing
budget is beginning to take shape in Kenya with the electronic
media becoming the emerging winner, the East African
Standard report today.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the advertizing agency McCaan Erickson indicate
that out of a total advertizing budget of about 33 million U.S.
Dollars last year, 55 percent went to electronic media including
television and radio.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that most major advertizers were now beginning
to shift their advertizing to the electronic media, adding that
the figure for the electronic media was expected to reach 70
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the three daily newspapers in the East African
country have about 20 percent of the total advertizing budget with
magazines having only 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the print media has skyrocketed, said the paper,
adding that although there are three daily and three weekly
national newspapers, it is estimated that there are a hundred or
so magazines of all stripes in the country.
</P>
<P>
This trend augurs badly for newspapers but more so for
magazines which rely on advertizing to make up for small
circulation runs, the daily paper noted.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Alters Foreign Exchange Trading Band </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of the
Philippines (BAP) today began to implement a new foreign exchange
trading band system, with new benchmarks, wider bands when an
initial band is breached.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the BAP will use a uniform benchmark
based on the weighted average peso-dollar rate in the previous
trading day's afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
The initial trading band will remain at 2 percent. But after
the peso fluctuates over 2 percent, a second band will be set at 3
percent, and in the event of another breach, a third at 4 percent,
according to local television reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the length of trading recess period has been set at
a fixed 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous three-tiered volatility band, if the initial
band was breached, the trading would be suspended and the band
would be narrowed down to 1 percent upon the resumption of
trading. The length of the recess had varied from 15 minutes to
one hour.
</P>
<P>
The old band system used the weighted average exchange rate of
the previous day's trading as a reference rate.
</P>
<P>
BAP officials explained that the changes in the volatility band
were minimal and were meant to make the rules simpler.
</P>
<P>
The BAP reimposed the volatility band on October 7 at the
Philippine Dealing System, the official currency market overseen
by the BAP, to curb sharp trading fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso, a victim of the Southeast Asian currency
turmoil, has been battered since its de facto devaluation on July
11, and has since fallen by nearly 30 percent.

</P>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will help to
supplement the International Monetary Fund (IMF) efforts to
restore confidence in Indonesia's economy, the Prime Minister's
Office said in a statement here today.
</P>
<P>
It said Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong agreed to give
such support during a meeting with Indonesian President Soeharto
in Jakarta this morning.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two leaders discussed the regional
economic turbulence and particularly its impact on Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Goh arrived in Jakarta Monday night on a 24-hour working visit.
Observers here noted that Goh's visit came at a time when the
Indonesian government is engaged in crucial discussions with the
IMF and the World Bank on the terms of a multi-billion-dollar
package to stabilize the Indonesian rupiah, which has lost almost
50 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the
beginning of the currency crisis in early July of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian currency was trading at 3,633 rupiah to the
greenback at the close of the foreign exchange market on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said that during their meeting,
Soeharto briefed Goh on the state of Indonesia's problems, the
measures Indonesia has taken and those it is presently
considering. He also updated Goh on the on-going discussions with
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Goh agreed with what the World Bank had said, that Indonesia's
fundamentals are sound. He also noted that the effective
market-oriented policies and actions by Indonesia since the crisis
began would help it overcome the present problems.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Goh is of the view that loss of
investors' confidence is a significant factor contributing to the
weak rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The priority now is to restore that confidence. A successful
conclusion to the IMF discussions and prompt implementation of an
agreed package is the key, the Singapore prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said the two leaders directed their
ministers to work out ways to implement today's decision, but gave
no details.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the upcoming APEC (Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation) Leaders' Meeting in Vancouver, Canada, and
the Informal ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations)
Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
They hold that the correct response to the regional currency
crisis is to accelerate the trade and investment liberalization
program launched by the APEC Leaders in Bogor, Indonesia, in 1994.

</P>
<P>
The meeting between the European Union and the Southern

<HEADLINE> Trade Barriers Removal Urged in East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A removal of trade
barriers among Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda has been urged at the
ongoing annual meeting of national authorizing officers held here
in the Tanzanian capital.
</P>
<P>
East African countries should eliminate trade barriers among
them to hasten economic development in the region, said Raphael
Mollel, Principal Secretary in the Tanzanian Ministry for
Finance, when he addressed the meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mollel noted that although most of the countries in the region
have embarked on economic reforms and adjustment, there are still
trade rigidities to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the need for greater regional economic
cooperation and integration, and closer ties to provide the
optimal environment for global trade liberalization through the
reduction of trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
On other hindrances on economic development, Mollel said, "We
need to continue improving on our infrastructure to facilitate
closer and more efficient exchange of goods and services."
</P>
<P>
The secretary further said peace and security is still a
problem hindering fast flow of goods and services in the region,
noting insecurity affects production in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
Mollel called upon the regional indicative program to address
the problems, including the shortage of water and erratic power
supply in the region.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting is expected to review the progress
achieved in the promotion of economic and social integration,
especially in trade, industry, transport and communication among
the east African countries.

<HEADLINE> India's Edible Oils Imports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- With the expectation of about
200,000 tons of edible oils imports in October, the country's
total import of edible oils during the season of November
96-October 97, may reach 1.75 million tons, up 35 percent than the
previous year, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Total imports of edible oils during the period of November 96
to September 97 already reached 1.54.7 million tons. The highest
imports of edible oils during the current season was recorded at
224,000 tons in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
The indigenous production of edible oils as per the latest
estimates has increased from 6.55 million tons in 1995-96 to 6.7
million tons in 1996-97. But the demand has also been increasing
at a faster rate due to growth in population, thus the widening of
the demand-supply gap.
</P>

Total requirement of edible oils is now estimated at 7.532
million tons, showing a shortfall of 832,000 tons, the same

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Expand Rice Fields to Boost Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government plans
to expand the country's rice fields to 7.5 to 8 million hectares
in order to boost rice production in 1998, a government official
said.
</P>
<P>
Rice production must be increased next year because this year's
target of 52 million tons is unlikely to be reached due to the
long drought, Djafr Hafsah from the Ministry of Agriculture said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
For 1997, the country's rice fields occupied a total area of 7
million hectares.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, an additional 500,000 or 1 million hectares for
next year is reasonable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said up to July this year, 46,438 hectares
of rice fields across the country suffered from drought. Of these
fields, 4,133 hectares could not be harvested at all.
</P>
<P>
By early August, the rice fields hit by drought had increased
to 112,889 hectares, of which 5,870 hectares would produce no
harvest.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture earlier predicted that rice fields
affected by drought throughout the country this year will cover no
less than 217,550 hectares, of which 15,964 would produce no
crops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Logistics Agency head Reddu Amang said
Monday that the government is not yet thinking of importing rice
but considers such action as a possible option, especially if no
rain falls within the next few months.

DHAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- the World Bank (WB) will provide
150 million U.S. dollars to Bangladesh to combat arsenic toxicity
in ground water that has affected about half of the country's
population in 43 districts, the government sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Wb made the offer last week to finance the "Bangladesh:
Arsenic Mitigation-Water Supply Project" spread over five years.
</P>
<P>
The project will cover 6,300 villages and 90 municipalities. It
will assess their arsenic problems and provide alternative water
supply schemes to 3,300 villages and 11 municipalities, strengthen
the national and local health care system to diagnose arsenic
poisoning and assist patients, make coordinated efforts to study
and survey the arsenic problems and strengthen institutional
capacity at the levels of the local government and government
agencies, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The bank prepared a draft of the project responding to the
request of the Bangladeshi government to provide financial
assistance to increase safe water supply.
</P>
<P>
An aide-memoir of the project has already been submitted to the
Bangladeshi government, which was prepared by the bank team of
experts who have already visited Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The nine-member team in its report observed that up to 43,000
villages and municipalities were presently or could be in future
at risk while up to 21,500 villages needed assistance which
required funds worth 150 million dollars, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Ask US to Lift Import Quotas on Garments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will request the
United States to withdraw its quota restrictions on imports of
Bangladesh's ready-made garments (RMG), said a senior government
official.
</P>
<P>
"We'll try our best so that we can export our ready-made
garments without any restriction to the American market," Commerce
and Industries Minister Tofael Ahmed Monday told a group of
garment businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the request would be raised when top U.S.
leaders, including President Bill Clinton, visit the country in
the near future. But the minister did not mention the accurate
time of the visit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is now the largest export market for Bangladesh's
garments, which earned a total of 3.1 billion U.S. dollars in
export income in fiscal 1997. Bangladesh is the fifth largest
apparel supplier of the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
"We have the potential to export more to the U.S. market,"
Tofael said, adding that the government wants to raise garment
export income to 10 billion dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has fixed an export income target of 5
billion dollars for the current 1997-98 fiscal and the exports
marked a rise of 23.8 percent in the first two months.
</P>
<P>
The present generalized system of preference (GSP), a 12.5
percent duty exemption facility for exports from poor countries,
would expire on December 31, 1998. "But I am sure and confident it
would be renewed up to 2004," said the minister.

national news agency BSS said today.
</P>
<P>
An EDC monthly journal published recently in Canada said
Bangladesh offers great opportunities for industrialized countries
like Canada to invest in some key sectors of the economy like
exploration of hydrocarbons power and telecommunications, the BSS
said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the country to foreign capital and accelerating
privatization represents enormous policy change for the
Bangladeshi government, the journal said, adding "it is only the
beginning."
</P>
<P>
The journal quoted Ottawa's mission in Dhaka as saying,
"Canada's exports to Bangladesh will find good opportunities in
oil and gas exploration, power, telecommunications and equipment
supply."
</P>
<P>
"Not only Bangladesh has some significant oil and gas reserves,
but also the country's move toward infrastructure expansion is
creating opportunities," the mission said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government's freeing of the power sector for
private participation and the opening of railway, paper and pulp
in the private sector also offers tremendous opportunities, the
journal added.
</P>
<P>
The journal said the "time is right for Canadian exporters to
pursue business in certain areas within Bangladesh."
</P>
<P>
In the past, Canadian firms have done business in Bangladesh in
areas such as oil and gas exploration, while others have been
pursuing opportunities in sectors ranging from telecommunications
to power.
</P>
<P>
The EDC has been actively monitoring Bangladesh as a potential
market for three years now, the journal said, adding that
representatives from Canada have visited Bangladesh to get first
hand knowledge about the opportunities available.
</P>
<P>
The EDC is now actively seeking to establish relationship and
has already established strong connections with several clients in
Bangladesh, the journal said.

<HEADLINE> Tanker Captains Arrested for Collision in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The captains of the two oil
tankers involved in last Wednesday's collision, which caused
Singapore's worst ever oil spill, have been arrested, the Straits
Times reported today, citing the Maritime and Port Authority of
Singapore (MPA) officials as disclosing.
</P>
<P>
MPA Director General Chen Tze Penn was quoted as saying that
the MPA had reason to believe that the captains "had committed
seizable offenses". But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The arrested were Jan Sokolowski, a Polish national, who
captained the Thai-registered Orapin Global, and the captain of
the Cyprus-flagged Evoikos, Michael Chalkitis, a Greek.
</P>
<P>
The MPA official also revealed that the very large crude
carrier Orapin Global, which carried no cargo at the time of
collision, had cut into the wrong lane and was facing oncoming
traffic when it overtook another vessel in the Singapore Straits
minutes before the collision.
</P>
<P>
The official confirmed that the Thai-registered vessel was
warned three times, the last time six minutes before colliding
with the Evoikos near the boundary which separates east- and
west-bound shipping lanes in the Straits.
</P>
<P>
Although investigations were still going on, he said,
congestion and a lack of visibility can be ruled out for the
visibility at the time of collision was reported to be eight
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to estimate how much it would cost to
clean up the spill or comment on the size of claims, but said the
people who caused the pollution will pay for the operation.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the collision, an estimated total of 25,000 tons
of marine fuel oil was spilt into the Straits, the worst oil spill
Singapore ever suffered.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Uncertainty Sends Baht, Bourse Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The uncertainty of the Thai
government has caused a tailspin in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to events over the weekend, the Thai currency, baht,
tumbled to a new low of 38.15 per U.S. dollar and the stock market
fell 16.13 points to close at 509.51 Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya announced that he
would resign and would not join the reshuffled government. Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh revoked a petrol and diesel oil tax
increase only three days after it was announced by Thanong last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday night, leaders of the six coalition government
parties decided that the entire cabinet would resign in two days
to give Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh a free hand to carry
out a sweeping cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
More negotiations are needed among coalition parties, in
particular between the two largest parties, i.e., Prime Minister
Chavalit's New Aspiration Party and former prime minister
Chatichai Choonhavan's Chart Pattana Party. The latter reportedly
wants full control of the finance, industry, agriculture, commerce
and communications portfolios.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle is expected to be announced by this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, anger and frustration at the government, especially
the prime minister, are mounting.
</P>
<P>
Today thousands of people are scheduled to hold demonstrations
outside the Government House, following a similar one Monday on
Silom Road, a financial street.
</P>
<P>
The protesters held placards condemning lay-offs, rising prices
and poor economic performance, and blamed the prime minister for
economic mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks many local newspapers are carrying
reports or comments urging the prime minister to resign to make
way for more capable persons.

<P>
KIEV, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), as an institution "not over yet," should endeavor to
maintain equal economic and political conditions within its scope.
</P>
<P>
Dorosheko, Director of the Foreign Policy Bureau of the
Presidential Office of Ukraine, expressed here today the position
of Ukraine toward the upcoming CIS summit, which is scheduled to
open in Kishinev, the capital of Moldova, on October 22-23.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine is one of the founders of CIS, but the country did not
sign the CIS Charter. It does have the right to participate in
discussions at meetings held by CIS and exert pressure on CIS,"
Dorosheko said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the summit "would relax trade
conditions between CIS nations, including Russia" as well as
conditions on Ukraine's goods transiting the Russian border.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Ukraine and Moldova are scheduled to hold talks on the
Pridnestr River issue, the Ukrainian Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian delegation will only endorse those documents that
"do not violate the interests of Ukraine," Dorosheko noted.

<P>
VIENNA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations-sponsored
third round of talks on East Timor began today at Krumbach castle
in southern Austria.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five participants, including the U.N. representative for
East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, and officials from Portugal and
Indonesia, are attending the four-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Jamsheed Marker, the talks, which do not involve
political issues, are only supplemental to negotiations between the
Portugese and Indonesian governments.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was under Portugal's colonial rule for 400 years.
Indonesia, which incorporated the territory in 1976 as its 27th
province, claims that East Timor is part of the islands nation.
However, Portugal is pushing for a referendum to determine the
territory's future.
</P>
<P>
Talks under U.N. auspices to find an internationally acceptable
solution to the situation were initiated in 1983 by the then U.N.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges U.S., Other Countries to Pay Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- United Nations (UN)
Secretary-General Kofi Annan today said the U.N. faces a
serious financial crunch unless the United States and other
countries pay their debts to the world body.
</P>
<P>
"We can face a serious financial crunch, but I hope it will not
come to that," he told a news conference in Chicago when asked how
the U.N. Secretariat could continue its operations without debts
being paid.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. owes about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars to the United
Nations. The U.S. Congress has been considering paying part
of Washington's debt but with conditions, including a reduction in
the U.S. share of the world body's annual regular budget.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who was in Chicago to talk to business and civic
leaders, told reporters that polls show the U.S. public supports
the United Nations, but "somehow it doesn't get translated into
votes in Washington."
</P>
<P>
In this world, he said, there are problems that "no one
country, no matter how powerful, can solve alone."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the World Trade Center in Chicago, Annan also noted
that the biggest share of the U.N. budget and its personnel are
devoted to "the lower profile work of helping countries to create
jobs and raise their standards of living."
</P>
<P>
However, 80 percent of the private capital that flows to
developing countries "goes to just 12 countries. Only 5 percent
goes to Africa. Nearly 50 developing countries are not attracting
any foreign capital at all," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
"If developing countries are unable to join the new world of
international trade and investment, the cause of development will
suffer. And if development suffers, so will international peace
Germanyand security," he affirmed.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong will hold bilateral
talks here today to discuss several issues regarding the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other related
matters, officials sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Goh and a team of senior officials arrived here Monday for a
two-day working visit as part of regular consultations among
regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Monday, a statement from Goh's office said, "The prime minister
will hold discussion with President Soeharto on regional currency
problem, the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
leaders' meeting and the informal ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur."
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government did not announce Goh's visit earlier,
and no officials were available for comment.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has confirmed his presence at the APEC summit in
Vancouver, Canada in November. The ASEAN informal summit will be
held early in December in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto called on ASEAN members on September 1 to establish a
common safety networks system to deal with possible monetary
upheavals in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah and other regional currencies have been
under speculative attacks since the devaluation of the Thai baht
in July. The rupiah has depreciated 35 percent against the U.S.
dollar since early July
</P>
<P>
The baht has depreciated 29 percent, the Philippine peso 26
percent and the Malaysian ringgit 21 percent. Thailand was forced
to seek emergency aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and IMF officials are still negotiating ways to deal
with the crisis following Soeharto's decision to seek possible
support from the world body including fresh money.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebels to Discuss Tension in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from the Philippine
government and the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
will meet today to defuse the latest wave of tension in the
southern Philippines, local television reports said.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been building in southern Mindanao Island these
days as the military strengthened troops near the MILF's main
headquarters, Camp Abubakar, in Maguindanao province in central
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
To defuse the renewed tension, the government's subcommittee on
cessation of hostilities and the MILF will hold an emergency
meeting in Cotabato city, capital of Maguindanao, later today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the meeting was hastily called Monday
afternoon following reports of intensifying tension near the
rebels' stronghold. Peace panels from the government and the MILF
were originally scheduled to resume talks on November 12-13.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman confirmed Monday that the Army's Sixth
Infantry Division has deployed more troops in the towns of Barira,
Buldon and Matanog near Camp Abubakar. But he denied the troop
movement was aimed at attacking the camp.
</P>
<P>
The MILF reportedly has put its forces on full alert for any
likely military attack and set up artillery batteries in the camp.
</P>
<P>
The mounting tension has forced hundreds of families to flee
the area near Camp Abubakar for fear of a flare-up of war between
the MILF and the military.
</P>
<P>
The troop deployment near the rebel camp is believed to be in
retaliation for last week's suicide attack on the Army's Sixth
Infantry Division headquarters in Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
During the raid last Tuesday, two alleged Arab terrorists shot
dead three soldiers and wounded several others before they
themselves were killed. The military blamed the MILF for the
attack and the latter strongly denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter group of the larger Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is currently the largest anti-government
force in the country, with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the extremist Abu Sayyaf are the two remaining
Muslim groups still fighting the government for a separate Islamic
state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF signed a comprehensive peace agreement with the
government in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began peace talks early this year,
and reached a preliminary ceasefire in July. But the two sides
have so far failed to agree on truce principles, and clashes
between them occur from time to time.

<P>
DHAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has finalized a
five-year export-import policy and will soon announce it, said
sources from the Ministry of Commerce and Industries today.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made by Bangladeshi Minister of Commerce and
Industries Tofael Ahmed while inaugurating a branch of Uttara Bank
in capital city Dhaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
The five-year export-import policy would benefit the business
community as they would get confidence about export-import
business, and the government policy is concerned for a longer
period, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the settlement of the Generalized System of
Preference issue with the European Union (EU), the minister said
that Bangladesh now was able to export 33 percent more garments to
the EU than before. The frozen food export dispute with the EU
would also be settled soon, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Bangladesh has immense economic
potential, and all should work together and place economic
activities above politics. "A national consensus is necessary on
this issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The present government has laid the foundation for foreign
investment in Bangladesh, and a large number of investors were now
coming to invest in the country, the minister noted.

HOHHOT, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Guo Jing, a student from the
Industrial University of Inner Mongolia, donated 420 yuan (about
50 U.S. dollars) to the Hope Project to help a school dropout
resume education.
</P>
<P>
"Though the amount is not so big, I do expect it to change the
life of a child," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
In northern China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, the
impoverished population still tops 2.2 million. Thousands of
children drop out every year because of poverty and more than
1,000 primary schools have no permanent houses or are poorly
equipped.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the Hope Project, a nationwide educational drive
launched in 1991 in the region, more than 80 "Hope" primary
schools have been established and 40,000 dropouts have resumed
their education. Contributors from China and abroad have donated
20 million yuan, said Chen Jianli, deputy secretary-general of the
Inner Mongolia Youth and Children Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
"Over 20 years ago my sister was still a teenager, and she had
to leave school to support the family. I have always been sorry
for her and wish to help a poor girl have education," said Li
Hongwu, a soldier from the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The foundation still has much to do, said Chen, the youth fund
official, who plans to raise 6 million yuan annually to help 6,000
dropouts in the coming three years.

</P>
<P>
The decree said the official movement ceremony will be held on

<P>
The city of Akmola, close to the country's main economic areas,
is the most appropriate city to serve as the future capital of
Kazakhstan, the president said while addressing the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Akmola, 1,000 kilometers north of Alma-Ata, has a population of
300,000. Since the parliament made the decision to move its
capital to Akmola, the city authorities have begun to speed up the
construction process.
</P>
<P>
At present, the office buildings for the parliament and the

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-thousand animals have been
returned to the wild with the help of animal conservationists in
eastern China's Anhui Province. Twenty of the returned animals are
rare species under state protection.
</P>
<P>
Anhui Province has a large wild-animal populace, including 54
species of protected animals such as Chinese alligators and
white-flag dolphins, according to experts. Hunting and killing of
the animals for markets and restaurants have greatly reduced their
numbers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the province has prohibited the illegal killing and
trade in protected species. Forty markets and 1,000 restaurants
have been penalized, according to official sources. Animals
recovered from these markets and restaurants were among those
returned to the wild.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have emphasized the "efficient protection,
continuous use and scientific management" of resources for
protected species and have conducted investigations. Recently, the
government has studied beasts, birds and reptiles in the
mountainous area in southern Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
An overall survey of wildlife in the province will be conducted
in next January.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Privatize Enterprises Through Intermediaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian cabinet today
approved a list of 66 enterprises to be privatized through
international investment intermediaries, which is part of the
government's 1998 privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Alexander
Bozhkov told reporters that the 66 enterprises include five
metallurgical plants, 10 machine-building plants including
military industrial enterprises, four chemical plants and seven
travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
The National Electricity Company and the Balkancar Holding are

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Moves to Ease Liquidity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the central
bank, reduced its minimum reserve requirements for commercial
banks from 5 percent to 3 percent Monday afternoon in a bid to
help balance the supply and demand for dollar in the market.
</P>
<P>
It also reopened its short-term securities (SBPU) and made a 1
percent across the board reduction in Bank Indonesia certificate
(SBI) with a view to loosening restrictions on monetary liquidity.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that this new policy will provide additional
liquidity in terms of foreign currency (dollar) in the money
market, and in a significant amount," Bank Indonesia Deputy
Governor Paul Soetopo said last night.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah (the national currency) continued to weaken against
the U.S. dollar because the dollar supply in the domestic market
was much less than demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
SBPU is short-term securities used by the central bank to
inject liquidity into the market. The SBPU's reopening, which was
temporarily suspended on July 24 this year, will be made in phases
and in accordance with monetary policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minimum reserve requirement is the amount of foreign
exchange required to be held by Indonesian banks. It is also
required to be deposited at the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"The 2 percent reduction in reserve requirements," he said,
"means that there will be approximately 850 million U.S. dollars
more in terms of liquidity on the money market. Hopefully this
will lessen pressure on the rupiah."
</P>
<P>
"With the reduction of the minimum reserve requirement, banks
may use their dollars where needed," he said. "However, they must
be used for productive, not speculative purposes."
</P>
<P>
SBI is short-term rupiah-denominated obligations issued by the
central bank to drain excess liquidity from the market.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor said the overnight SBI rate will be reduced
from 15 percent to 14 percent while that of two to six day SBI
will be reduced from 16 percent to 15 percent. One week SBI will
decrease from 17 percent to 16 percent, with the two-week rate
falling from 19 percent to 18 percent. The rate for one month SBI
will decrease from 21 percent to 20 percent, two month SBI from 20
percent to 19 percent and three month SBI from 19 percent to 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
The cut was the fifth reduction in SBI rates since the central
bank hiked the rates almost threefold in August in a bid to check
the fall of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah has dropped about 50 percent against
the U.S. dollar since the beginning of this year, making the
currency the worst hit in the monetary crisis in Southeast Asian
nations.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Signals Changing Attitude Toward IMF, WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A leading government think-tank in
Ukraine proposes to limit the country's cooperation with foreign
lenders, signaling a potential change in Ukraine's attitude toward
international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government's ties with international financial institutions
is named as a key danger in the country's economic security.
</P>
<P>
The observation is made in a report titled Economic Security of
Ukraine, which was unveiled recently by the National Institute for
Strategic Studies (NISS), an agency under the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The report argues that accords with foreign lenders places
inappropriate and harmful burdens on the Ukrainian economy and
"prevents the country from pursuing independent policies and
seeking internal resources for financing economic reforms."
</P>
<P>
It suggested that the Ukrainian government should have the
final say in the wording of memorandum agreements with
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report emerged at a time of strained relations between the
Ukrainian government and its foreign creditors. After failing to
secure a loan of 2.5 billion dollars from the IMF in July because
of its failure to hit economic targets, the Ukrainian government
has also been denied for the time being the second and third
batches of a 542-million-dollar stand-by credit by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the World Bank recently announced that it may end
funding for three of its projects in Ukraine, denying Kiev another
400 million dollars on credits.
</P>
<P>
Observers here speculate that Ukraine, currently among the
largest recipients of both IMF and World Bank assistance, may have
changed its attitude toward cooperation with the two institutions
after successful negotiations to issue bonds on the European and
Japanese security markets.

BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials are cracking
down on counterfeit products, seizing goods valued at 43.5 million
yuan (about 5.24 million US dollars) last month, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Province Launches Anti-poverty Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
province, one of China's poorest areas, has begun a four-year
campaign to wipe out poverty by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
"The economic priority will be given to poverty relief and
development this year, to lift 12 counties with a combined
population of 1.7 million people out of poor conditions," Governor
Wu Yixia said at a recent working meeting.
</P>
<P>
The province has already helped 3.7 million people rise above
the poverty line in the last three years. In the next four years,
10,000 government officials will be assigned to assist 5,000 poor
villages each year.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou will provide 150 million yuan in loans and 30,000 tons
of chemical fertilizers this year to 48 counties. Some 85 percent
of its poverty relief funds and loans will be used for grain
self-sufficiency projects and cottage industries.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has set up a railway company in cooperation with the
Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Coal Industry to invest
nearly 3 billion yuan in constructing the first provincial
railway. The railway will help tap coal resources in the western
mountain areas of the province.
</P>
<P>
Other highway and railway projects are under way to improve
local living conditions and to encourage investment.

ROME, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Investment in Italy this year is
picking up and in line with the general trend in the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The economic think-tank Isco predicted recently that
industrial investment by the end of this year should be up 0.6
percent in volume, compared to the 5.2 percent drop recorded in

Isco data for the EU saw a 5 percent increase in capital
investment in 1997 compared to a 2 percent increase in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Indications are positive overall for this year," Isco said.
"Investments in large and medium-sized enterprises will climb,
respectively 5.6 percent and 0.4 percent in real terms, while
investments in small firms will decline by 5.4 percent."
</P>
<P>
Isco forecasts a 28.6 percent increase in the volume of
investment in the steel industry, and a 8.2 percent increase in
the food sector.
</P>
<P>
Base products and consumer goods, the two leading sectors, saw
declines of 5.6 percent and 3.4 percent respectively in

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Track Down 30 Suspects Through Interpol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 20 (Xinhua) - At the request of the Bulgarian
authorities 30 Bulgarians have been included in the wanted list to
be extradited, the National Interpol Bureau told Bulgarska
Telegrafna Agentsia today.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four of them are undergoing investigative proceedings
and the other six have been declared guilty.
</P>
<P>
Interpol is also trying to capture 16 other Bulgarians, some of
whom will face charges of gross embezzlements if brought back to
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Under the European Convention on Extradition the term of
extradition is 18 days plus additional 22 days. The Bulgarians at
large go mainly to other parts of Europe, Interpol said.
</P>
<P>
Requested by other countries, some 800 persons are wanted by
the National Interpol Bureau for crimes such as murders, armed
robberies, car thefts, gross embezzlement and terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
However, not all of them are on this country's territory with
about 10 percent of them missing, the Sofia Bureau of Interpol
said.
</P>
<P>
Car theft has been rampant in this country, with 10,254 cars on
Interpol's wanted list by October 13.
</P>
<P>
While in 1990-1992 car thieves used to set up purely Bulgarian
gangs, now they cooperate with criminal gangs in Western European
countries, an Interpol expert said.
</P>
<P>
There are three main rings in Bulgaria engaged in smuggling the
stolen cars from Western Europe and Northern America via Bulgaria
to the countries in the Middle East and South-West Asia and the
republics of the former Soviet Union, or selling them in
Bulgaria.

<HEADLINE> Tension Building in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Tension is mounting in the
southern Philippine island of Mindanao as the military built up
troops near a major camp of the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families have left the area near the MILF's biggest
bastion, Camp Abubakar, in Maguindanao province, to escape a
possible conflict between the MILF and the military, local
newspaper Today said.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the MIIF has boosted its defense of the camp and
set up artillery batteries to counter any military offensives, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The troop deployment near the rebel camp is believed to be in
retaliation for last week's suicide attack on the Army's Sixth
Infantry Division headquarters in Maguindanao, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
During the attack last Tuesday, two alleged Arab terrorists
shot dead three soldiers and wounded several others before they
themselves were killed. The military blamed the attack on the MILF
which strongly denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Muhamad al-Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for
military affairs, as accusing the military of wanting to provoke
the rebels. "We are already prepared for a possible outbreak of
war in Mindanao," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the military has denied it is massing for an attack on the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star quoted Maj. Gen. Raul Urgello, commander of
the Sixth Infantry Division, as saying the movement of his troops
was partly a normal redeployment of forces and partly a measure to
increase security following the terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter group of the larger Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is currently the largest anti-government
force in the country, with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the extremist Abu Sayyaf are the two remaining
Muslim rebel groups still fighting the government for a separate
Islamic state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF signed a comprehensive peace agreement with the
government in September 1996.

<HEADLINE> HK Bank Conducts Foreign Exchange Course in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation is conducting a bill and foreign exchange
course here for Myanmar personnel to meet the need of banking
operations in the light of increasing foreign trade of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The five-day course, jointly sponsored by the Central Bank of
Myanmar and the Hong Kong bank, was opened Monday, providing
training for two dozen Myanmar officials and bill checkers from
state-owned and private banks, local newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth time for the Hong Kong bank to conduct such
course in Myanmar since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, one of the 48
foreign banks, opened its representative office in Myanmar in
February 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition to six state-owned banks, there has been 25 other
private banks allowed to operate banking businesses since Myanmar
reformed its financial management system to keep in line with the
market-oriented economy introduced in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Of the private banks in the country, seven are permitted to
handle foreign exchange transactions, especially at the time when
Myanmar's foreign trade is expanding year by year following
liberalization of the country's internal and external trade
activities.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's foreign trade
volume in the 1996-97 fiscal year ending March totaled 2.76
billion U.S. dollars, of which export came to 873.3 million
dollars with import valued at 1.89 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Weakened Baht Boosts Export Value in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The depreciation of the baht
caused the value of Thailand's exports in August to jump 29.4
percent over the same month last year to 156 billion baht (4.4
billion U.S. dollars), according to the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, based on the ratio of 25.88 baht to the U.S. dollar
before the baht was floated in July, exports in August grew just
3.1 percent, Commerce Ministers Narongchai was quoted today by
local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of the year, exports totaled 1,000
billion baht (28.5 billion dollars), up 9.7 percent year-on-year,
while imports dropped 2.2 percent to 1,220 billion baht (34.8
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Industrial exports in August rose 27.4 percent to 99 billion
baht (2.8 billion dollars), accounting for 63.4 percent of all
exports. agricultural exports increased 12.3 percent to 22 billion
baht (628 million dollars) and agro-industrial exports rose 24
percent to 12 billion baht (342 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Narongchai said he was optimistic that exports in the last
quarter this year would meet or surpass the projection of 10
percent growth.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Disarmament in Middle East: Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Mohamed El Baradei, the
designate director-general of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), said today there is a possibility of achieving
nuclear disarmament in the Middle East, if the peace process is
resumed in the region.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that Israel is ready to give up its
nuclear deterrent after it makes extensive peace and security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA was making efforts to work out a measure of extensive
international nuclear examination.
</P>
<P>
El Baradei is to become director-general of the IAEA on
December 1.
</P>
<P>
He said that when Arabian countries asked Israel to take part
in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Israel
raised as a condition the achievement of the extensive peaceful
treaty. "We hope that the Middle East will become a non-nuclear
weapon region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The agency, established in 1957 in accordance with a decision
of the United Nations General Assembly, has 144 members. Its main
objectives are to enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to
peace, health and prosperity throughout the world and to ensure
that assistance provided by it is not used in such a way as to
further military purposes.
</P>
<P>
Hans Blix, the current IAEA director-general, claimed today at
the press conference that the greenhouse effect would be dealt
with by the development and utility of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
If the developing countries only depended on coal and oil to
meet their increasing energy demands, the greenhouse effect would
be aggravated, Blix stressed.

<HEADLINE> Awareness on Sleep Disorders Needed: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 20 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 95 percent of
sleep disorders remain undiagnosed and many cause serious
problems, a U.S. organization said today.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based U.S. National Sleep Foundation (NSF) said
through a wire service that as many as 63 million Americans had
levels of sleepness known to be hazardous, and possibly indicative
of an undiagnosed sleep disorder.
</P>
<P>
It said there are 80 different sleep disorders, but physicians
receive little training in sleep.
</P>
<P>
NSF unvealed this in conjunction with a meeting on the subject
in Dublin, Ireland, this week.
</P>
<P>
NSF lists some of the sleep disorders such as insomnia, i.e.
difficulties in falling asleep, sleep apnea, a breathing-related
sleep disorder and narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by sudden
sleep attacks.
</P>
<P>
Few know that sleep also causes problems, NSF said. It quoted a
British survey as saying that about ten percent of crashes involve
sleepness.
</P>
<P>
It has been found that sleep problems are implicated in
accidents in the workplace, impaired physical and mental health,
difficulties with concentration and productivity and problems with
work, family and social relationships.
</P>
<P>
NSF wants to work with researchers in other countries to raise
public awareness on sleep disorders and sleepness problems by
laying foundation to establish similar organizations.

<HEADLINE> Peres Inaugurates Peace Center to Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Prime
Minister and leading peace architect Shimon Peres inaugurated
here today a peace center aimed at contributing to the Middle
East peace through promoting regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 political leaders, businessmen and scholars from
over 30 countries attended the ceremony held here to mark the
opening of the Peres Center for Peace.
</P>
<P>
Among the dignitaries were former United States Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa,
U.S. peace coordinator Dennis Ross, European Union peace envoy
Miguel Moratinos and Speaker of Palestinian Council Ahmed Queria
(Abu Ala).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Peres thanked the participants for
coming to show their responsibility and support to the peace
center and the peace process. He stressed that the real peace in
the Middle East could only be achieved through organizing all
efforts and support by all responsible parties that support the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman expressed optimism that peace
would be finally achieved in the Middle East, so that everyone
in the region would live in a flourish and peaceful place in the
21 century.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Moussa praised the inauguration of the peace
center as "a very important event" at a time when the Middle East
peace process is at a crucial junction. He said the opening of
the center sent out a message that the peace process has just
begun and it relies on the assistance from all parties for
protection.
</P>
<P>
Moussa echoed Peres' view that peace would only be deeply
rooted in the Middle East through cooperations in various areas
such as industry, agriculture and technology.
</P>
<P>
Ross expressed his concern about the current slowdown in the
peace process due to the huge gap between Israel and the
Palestinian side, saying a long road is ahead for achieving the
success. He added that it needed a new definition of peace in
order to move forward.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, leading mediator in the Israeli-Arab peace
progress, paid tributes to Peres for his contribution to peace
and hailed the peace center for focusing directly on the
economic progess, which he said is a very important sphere of
the peace process. He called for Israel to halt settlement
activities and the Palestinian side to fight terrorism in order
to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Abu Ala conveyed a message from Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat to wish the center a success. He said
peace is not limited and needs all dimensions in order to achieve
real peace.
</P>
<P>
He listed three conditions for moving forward the peace
process, including Israel's implementing the signed peace
agreements, heeding both sides' concerns and avoid unilateral
steps to preempt the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Peres accompanied Christopher and other
participants to the ceremony on the Rabin Square in Tel Aviv to
lay flowers at the monument to remember former Labor prime
minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by a radical Jew in
November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Leah Rabin, Rabin's widow, said in a speech that peace in the
region was irresversable despite the murder of his husband who
sacrificed his life for peace. "Peace in the Middle East is,
despite all, a reality which cannot be destroyed and which will
eventually reach its final goal," she said.
</P>
<P>
The peace center, a non-governmental and non-profit
organization, will develop and implement a strategy that focuses
on economic, cultural and social processes in Middle East.
</P>
<P>
This approach is integral to the initiatives of the center
which will establish viable frameworks for cooperation among the
peoples of the region through projects in industry, agriculture,
social development and education.
</P>
<P>
The long list of its International Board of Governors
comprises many former world leaders, including former United
Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali, former United
States President Jimmy Carter, former Soviet Union leader Mihail
Gorbachev, current French Prime Minister Leonis Jospine.

<HEADLINE> Jordan-Gulf Ties Improved, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has succeeded in
mending ties with neighbors which went soured during the 1991 Gulf
War, said Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh today.
</P>
<P>
The country's relations with most Gulf countries have been
greatly improved, Tarawneh who just concluded a two-day visit to
Bahrain during the weekend, was quoted by the Bahraini News Agency
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jordan offended the Gulf states for siding with Iraq during the
Gulf War in 1991. After the war, which ended with the liberation
of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation, Jordan distanced itself from Iraq
and gradually repaired its ties with neighbors, including Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian leaders or senior officials have visited the Gulf
countries, except Kuwait, in a bid to revamp their ties.
</P>
<P>
Though Amman's relationship with Kuwait is still kept cool, the
Jordanian foreign minister said that it has gone back to a right
track and "begun to step ahead positively."
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh said air traffic and postal services between the two
countries have been resumed. Investment and trade situation has
also been improved.
</P>
<P>
He said that Amman is ready to open its embassy in Kuwait again,
which was closed in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuwaiti embassy in Amman keeps open while the Jordanian
Embassy in Kuwait remains closed. But We are completely ready to
open it at any time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tarawneh described Jordan's relationship with Iraq
as "good." A bilateral trade protocol is still effective.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Women's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
had always attached great importance to the development of women,
making equality between men and women a basic national policy for
social development, Chinese delegate Li Sangu stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and
Cultural) at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly, Li
sangu said during the past two years since the Fourth World
Conference on Women, governments had made great efforts in the
implementation of the follow-up action by formulating
comprehensive strategic plans or programses of action.
</P>
<P>
Li said the relevant agencies of the UN system had also adopted
many resolutions setting forth specific measures and medium-term
plans. The work of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all
policies and programses of the UN system was getting onto the
right track.
</P>
<P>
Li said however, some substantial commitments still remained in
paper, and various plans were yet to be materialized. The
international community and governments should continue to make
endeavors to achieve desired objectives at an early date.
</P>
<P>
She said poverty was a major problem confronting the world
today. Due to the serious shortages of funds and technology,
developing countries found it difficult to eliminate poverty
through their own efforts. Only through the enhancement of
international co-operation and the fulfillment of the 0.7%
official development assistance target, would it be possible to do
something really essential for women by helping developing
countries to strengthen their ability to fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
she said China had accorded great priority to the
implementation of the follow-up to the Conference by strengthening
of the national machine for the advancement of women. Apart from
the National Working Committee on Women and Children of the State
Council, governmental organizations had also been established in
thirty provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities as well as in
prefectures and cities under their jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Li Sangu said on the basis of the national programse for the
development of women, Chinese government formulated local
development programses for women, to be incorporated in their
overall plans for economic and social development, so that the
implementation of the Platform for Action could be secured in
terms of human, material and financial resources.
</P>
<P>
Li said many Chinese governmental departments had drawn
specific targets and measures in areas of poverty alleviation for
women, women in decision-making, women's education, employment and
health care, More important, sufficient resources would be put
into the implementation.
</P>
<P>
She said China would, as always, in a spirit of supporting UN
work, actively participate in international cooperation for the
development of women, so as to make its share of contribution
towards the advancement of women throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank Urges Lower Taxes, Deductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank Bundesbank
today proposed "substantially" lowering taxes and deductions to
promote the net wages of German workers in efforts to boost
domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
It rejected a recent requirement by Metalworkers Union leader
Klaus Zwickel for big increases in wages, saying moderate wage
developments should continue for several more years.
</P>
<P>
A lasting improvement in purchasing power cannot be achieved at
the negotiating table, but through an increase in competitive
jobs, according to the Bundesbank's monthly report for October.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank pointed out that increasing taxes and deductions
had been bringing down workers' net wages, from accounting for
55.8 percent of the gross wages in 1991 to 52.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Notably, employers were meanwhile being hit by higher social
welfare insurance costs, it said. Employers' contributions rose from
18.5 percent of gross wage levels in 1991 to 19.8 percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> IBM Confident in Doing Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 20 (Xinhua) -- IBM, the world's leading
information technology company with a revenue of 76 billion U.S.
dollars, is eagerly expanding business in emerging markets and
confident in doing business in China.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by its vice president for emerging markets
George L. Corsilia at a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
"IBM's biggest changes in the last few years are the
implementation of new strategies to find emerging technologies and
emerging markets," he said while receiving Xinhua correspondents
at his office in Somers, some 150 km north of New York.
</P>
<P>
Corsilia, a veteran serving IBM for the last 26 years, admires
chairman and chief executive officer Louis V. Gerstner, Jr for his
foresight and courage in promoting the new strategies since he
took the leadership in 1993.
</P>
<P>
IBM, which has spread its operations in 150 countries with
240,000 employees, now spends some 5 billion dollars yearly in
research and development.
</P>
<P>
"As far as parts are concerned, we have competitors, but there
are few of them who have such integrated technologies as ours to
compete with us," Corsilia added.
</P>
<P>
"We aim at bringing total I/T (information technology)
solutions and full values to customers, with networking, hardware,
software, services etc," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The company pays great importance to emerging markets as the
world's major portion of population lives there and they generate
higher economic growths and higher increases in U.S. exports than
the developed.
</P>
<P>
Corsilia who also overseas IBM markets in India and Southeast
Asia, said IBM's sales in China have expanded by about 50 percent
annually in the last three years, making China IBM's most grown
market abroad.
</P>
<P>
IBM's first mid-size computer came into China in 1979. It
became a wholly-owned foreign company in China in 1990. Now it has
nine joint ventures and eight subsidiaries in major cities of
China, with a total investment of 96 million U.S.dollars at the
end of July 1996.
</P>
<P>
Its products and services have penetrated into a wide range of
sectors, including financing and banking, securities and
insurance, trade and distribution, education and health, railways
and airlines and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Its employees in China have soared from 200 in 1992 to 1,600
today.
</P>
<P>
"My experience told me that both we and the Chinese Government
are serious in doing business on a long-term basis," Corsilia
said.
</P>
<P>
His assistant, IBM's chief representative in China Peter Jen
provided Xinhua correspondents with the following statistics:
</P>
<P>
-- the number of local managers rose from 5 percent in 1992 to
50 percent in 1996;
</P>
<P>
-- the first IBM research center outside the United States was
set in China in 1995;
</P>
<P>
-- IBM has donated some 25 million dollars in equipment to 28
Chinese universities to help them meet teaching and research
needs;
</P>
<P>
-- IBM purchases of products made by it own, joint ventures
with other foreign partners and local vendors have increased from
29 million U.S dollars in 1993 to 500 million U.S dollars in 1996
with projection to further rise this year.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident in doing business in China. It's easier, not
harder to do business there," Corsilia reiterated, saying that "We
do not see any parts of the environment whether political or
economic that have us very worried, or risks that we have to
take."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientist Says Engineered Tissue Works Like New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. researcher today said
that tissue engineering, the new technology named a decade ago, is
starting to transform the way patients with flesh wounds are being
healed.
</P>
<P>
The tissue engineering goes further than skin grafts and could
prove a boon to patients with gaping wounds and sores that do not
heal, William Eaglstein of the University of Miami School of
Medicine told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Two tissue engineering therapies have been tested on a large
scale for chronic wounds and are awaiting Food and Drug
Administration approval," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Both of them contain living cells. One starts as a mesh of
absorbable surgical suture which is actually what surgeons and
dermatologists use to sew the skin."
</P>
<P>
"The tissue which grows from the skin cells is laid down over
the ulcer and the bioengineered tissue begins to heal," Eaglstein
said.
</P>
<P>
However, researchers still do not understand exactly how the
method worked.
</P>
<P>
Eaglstein said,"We have reason to believe it heals by
stimulating the host tissue. We think that the tissue-engineered
skin isn't really even there at the end."

<HEADLINE> Panel to Recommend Managed Care Health Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Americans unhappy with
managed care would have a series of new guarantees proposed in a
bill of rights that a presidential advisory commission is expected
to recommend this week.
</P>
<P>
The commission includes representatives of both the managed
care industry and consumer groups, and it is hoped the work will
lay the foundation for future federal laws.
</P>
<P>
However, some consumer rights advocates say the bill of rights
in its present form, doesn't go far enough, and they are
considering a dissenting report if the commission does not expand
it. But there are also people more optimistic about it.
</P>
<P>
While states have approved many bills dealing with managed care
health plans, Congress has passed just one measure, guaranteeing a
woman 48 hours in the hospital after childbirth.
</P>
<P>
But that bill opened the way to lots of proposed legislation
regulating health maintenance organization business. That, in
turn, caused some to worry that Congress would go too far,
regulating health care "body part by body part."
</P>
<P>
After six months of work, the commission is set to propose
rights that, for the most part, deal with the big picture.
</P>
<P>
Members of the commission hope Clinton will propose the bill of
rights as legislation, but its chances in Congress are unclear.

<HEADLINE> Brittan, Tung on EU-HK Cooperation in Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- European Commission
Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan and Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee-Hwa today
promised a bright future for European Union-Hong Kong cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that both the EU and Hong Kong have experienced
unparalleled periods of change and yet the partnership between the
EU and Hong Kong showcased continuity of cooperation principles,
policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
The senior commission official made the remark at the inaugural
plenary meeting of the EU/HK and HK/EU Business Cooperation
Committees, set up as channels for long-range dialogue between
senior business people from the two economic communities.
</P>
<P>
The visiting HKSAR chief said in his keynote speech at the
meeting that Hong Kong is moving forward with pride and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
"Pride in that we are now reunited with the motherland and have
become masters of our destiny; confidence in that we can and will
make our city an even better place going forward," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong people are continuing, after the July 1 handover,
to strive hard for an even more successful and prosperous future.
"Our economy continues to grow; our financial foundation remains
solid; our society remains pluralistic; and our politicians
continue to debate openly on all the topical issues," the SAR
chief executive reassured the delegates.
</P>
<P>
Both Brittan and Tung described the formation of the business
cooperation committees as a milestone in the expansion of EU/Hong
Kong business relationship.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the committees, comprised of chairmen and chief
executive officers of major companies in both regions, is to
promote and expand trade, investment and understanding between the
two business communities.
</P>
<P>
Members of the committees agreed that the inauguration of the
committees was timely since both Hong Kong and the European Union
are at the start of their respective new economic eras.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, following its return to Chinese sovereignty, is
expected to play a key role in the development of the mainland's
economy while the European Union is embracing the new
opportunities brought by an expanding membership and the
introduction of economic and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The next biennial meeting will be held in Hong Kong and the
European group of delegates will then move on for a high-level
visit to Beijing, according to co-chairmen Peter Sutherland and
Victor Fung.

ATHENS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece said today that it
refused to share the Aegean Sea with its neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on press reports and rumors about the "dividing up"
of the Aegean, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
that it was not possible to talk about such things.

He said that Turkey's policy appeared to be aimed at
maintaining the climate of tension in relations between the two
countries.

When asked if there was a possibility of a serious incident in
the Aegean, Reppas said that when one examines all the facts, one
can not but consider all the possibilities."
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Admiral Joseph Lopez, Commander-in-Chief of allied
forces in southern Europe, said recently that the information and
indications he had received so far did not lead him to the
conclusion that a serious incident was imminent in the Aegean.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Commonwealth's Intention to Appoint Envoys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today welcomed the
intention of Russia and the commonwealth to appoint their own
special envoys on Cyprus, which was announced recently.
</P>
<P>
This stance of Cyprus was voiced by government spokesman
Manolis Christofides at his daily press briefing today.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government welcomes these initiatives, said the
spokesman, noting that "we attach special importance to the fact
that Russian President Boris Yeltsin considers it necessary to
appoint his personal emissary to deal with the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Christofides also hailed the Commonwealth's initiative to
appoint a special representative for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Commonwealth Emeka Anyaoku told the
BBC World Service Question Time Sunday that his group would
appoint a special representative for Cyprus "to convey the
general feeling in the Commonwealth on the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
"All these give us a picture of the increased international
interest in Cyprus and we hope their involvement and action will
be effective so that a Cyprus solution could be reached," said
Christofides.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, the European Union, the United States,
Britain and some other countries have appointed their special
envoys dealing with the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over
the northern third following a failed coup by Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Security Council Welcomes Positive Actions by Croatian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today adopted a presidential statement,
welcoming several positive actions taken by the government of
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the Security Council welcomed the
developments including the recent agreements relating to the
education, progress in the reintegration of the judiciary, moves
towards recognition of pensioner service, assistance to the local
governments and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The council also expressed its satisfaction over the increased
cooperation with the International Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia and it expected the government of Croatia to continue
to build upon these positive steps and accelerate its efforts in
order to fully complete these initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The council welcomed the recent establishment by the government
of Croatia of a program for national reconciliation. But it said
that there were still many outstanding areas and issues of
contention and non-compliance, which required further, urgent
actions from the government of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated its call to the government of Croatia to curb
media attacks on ethnic groups. The council also underlined the
importance of the removal of all legal and administrative
barriers, thus allowing the accelerated voluntary two-way return
of the displaced persons, including their right to choose to live
in the region, as well as the return of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
It called upon the government of Croatia to give immediate
effect to the recent decisions of the Constitutional Court
regarding the Law on the Temporary Takeover and Administration of
Specified Property, and to take further actions to promote the
safe return of owers to their homes and the resolution of the
issue of lost tenancy rights.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed its concern about the behavior
of some officers of the Transitional Police Force, and urged full
cooperation with the United Nations Transitional Administration
for Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) in improving the performance of this
force.
</P>
<P>
The council welcomed the close cooperation between the UNTAES
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
in expanding the long-term mission of the OSCE in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The council shared the assessment of the secretary-general that
there was sufficient time for Croatia to comply fully with its
obligations and commitments before January 15, 1998 and urged the
government of Croatia to double its efforts in the time remaining.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Names New Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. top long-distance
phone company AT&AMP;T announced today that it has chosen Michael
Armstrong as its new chairman.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, former head of Hughes Electronics, succeeds chief
executive and chairman Robert Allen who is resigning amid
shareholders' dissatisfaction. AT&AMP;T is a 53 billion U.S.
dollar firm.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after reports of fierce competition in
the U.S. telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T's rival MCI has stood as the target of an eye-catching
takeover bid among British Telecommunications Inc. and two other
local companies, namely GTE and WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
WorldCom came up with the highest offer of 30 billion dollars
to acquire MCI which has not yet made its decision on whom it
chooses to marry.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say a merger between MCI, the nation's second largest
long-distance provider, and GTE, the U.S. second biggest local
service company, or WorldCom, number 4 in the long-distance range,
will strengthen their positions against AT&AMP;T.

<HEADLINE> Experts Meet on African Information Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A two-day expert group
meeting on the implementation of African information society
initiative (AISI) opened at the United Nations Conference Center
here today.
</P>
<P>
The experts meeting is the first one under the umbrella of the
African Technical Advisory Committee (ATAC), mandated by the
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) conference of
ministers responsible for economic and social development and
planning in May 1996 to advise on AISI programs and projects and
to evaluate results.
</P>
<P>
The ECA was charged by the ministers in 1996 to lead the AISI,
working in coordination with UN and other agency partners and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The AISI is a framework for the establishment of a
development-serving information and communications infrastructure
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, experts will review ATAC's terms
of reference, report on AISI implementation to date, discuss an
ECA framework for AISI implementation, brainstorm possible
methodologies for AISI project support and approval, and debate
the role of ATAC in resource mobilization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the ECA, the two-day expert meeting
will be followed by a 3-day regional coordination meeting of
partners in promoting information technology for development in
Africa which will be held here from October 22 to 24.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting will focus on how ECA can build and
strengthen partnerships to further the aims and objectives of the
AISI.
</P>
<P>
Participants will report on-going and planned projects and
programs to promote information and communications technology in
Africa, and consolidate the 1997-1998 partners in information and
communication technologies in Africa (PICTA) work program,
according to the ECA.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President: Purchase of Russian Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides today dismissed reports that the purchase of
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles has been canceled
after U.S. intervention.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here before his departure for
Edinburgh, Britain to attend the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting, Clerides said the reports have categorically
been dismissed by Russian Ambassador to Cyprus Georgi Mouratov.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that when the ambassador was informed of the
reports, he described them as "mid-summer night's dream."
</P>
<P>
The president was commenting on reports published in the
latest issue of American magazine Military Procurement
International (MPI) and cited by the Greek service of BBC
today.
</P>
<P>
The magazine reported that "the U.S. has obtained agreement
from (Russian) President Boris Yeltsin to renounce the Russian
contract for the sale of advanced S-300 surface-to-air
missiles."
</P>
<P>
MPI quoted its sources as saying "the U.S. threatened to
reduce or cut off its substantial aid to Russia unless it agreed
to terminate the contract."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government decided early this year to buy Russian
surface-to-air S-300 missiles, expected to be deployed in
mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to launch a preemptive strike if the
missiles are deployed on the island. The United States and some
other western countries also opposed the Cyprus decision.
</P>
<P>
But the Cypriot government has repeatedly said that it would
not deploy the missiles if there is sufficient progress toward a
settlement or an agreement on the demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the 37 percent of the island in the wake of
a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> US Experts to Assess DPRK's Food Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. seven-member expert
team is going to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
to assess the food needs there under an agreement between the two
countries, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first U.S. assessments team and the goal is to get
us new information, new assessments and new understanding of the
problems," State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. expert team will travel through the DPRK from October
25 to November 4. The State Department and the Agency for
International Development and the Centers for Disease Control are
among the agencies represented, Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
This could be a step toward more U.S. food aid to the DPRK,
analysts said here. But some U.S. officials said more monitors
would be needed if the United States decided to increase its
contribution.
</P>
<P>
"We will not provide assistance unless there is effective
monitoring," said Leonard Rogers, an administrator with the Agency
for International Development, who will head the seven-member
expert team to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"We have always regarded monitoring as crucial to the program,"
Rubin said. "The more people understand what's going on there, the
more willing people will be to try to help them."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army Fires Laser at Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said today that
the U.S. Army fired a ground-based laser at a U.S. Air Force
satellite, a controversial test that critics fear would spark a
world space-based weapons race.
</P>
<P>
The experiment was conducted on Friday evening at White Sands
Missile Range, New Mexico. It involved the Army's Mid-Infrared
Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL). Two powerful beams, one lasting
less than one second duration and the other about 10 seconds, were
fired, a Pentagon spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Air Force Lt. Col. Bob Potter, a Pentagon spokesman, said the
results of the test-firing are still being evaluated, but the
initial indications are that the test was successful.
</P>
<P>
The test followed two failures earlier this month. The Army
canceled a test on October 4 and 6 because of weather conditions
and technical problems.
</P>
<P>
The laser, built by TRW, is an offshoot of the Reagan
administration's Strategic Defense Initiative. It has been fired
into space many times, but never at a satellite. It generates
energy from chemicals and the beam is invisible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
The test marks for the first time the United States has fired a
high-powered laser at a satellite in orbit.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Pentagon's claim that the experiment was designed
to test the vulnerability of satellites to enemy attack, critics
say the experiment would be seen by other nations as an invitation
to develop their own anti-satellite lasers.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government, which was informed of the test, has
previously expressed concerns about the test as constituting a
potential threat to Russian satellites.

CAIRO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Helicopters of the Egyptian
Armed Forces today ferried relief supplies to the stranded
villagers in South Sinai who have been stricken by seasonal
rains, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Third Field Army flew sorties of helicopters to carry
food, blankets, medical supplies and water to the three villages

The total inhabitants of the area, including Bedouins and
workers of companies operating in the area, number more than

Elements of the Third Army are reconnoitering the area to see
if there are other places that might need relief.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains in Egypt's eastern coast and Sinai peninsula
during the last four days have left at least four people dead and
a dozen injured.
</P>

<HEADLINE> LSE Launches New Alutomated Trading System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The London Stock Exchange(LSE)
LSE formally launched its new order-driven electronic trading
system Monday following six previous rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
The new system, known as the Stock Exchange Electronic Trading
Service, or SETS, also labelled Big Bang Two, was inaugurated
early this morning by Chancellor Gordon Brown.
</P>
<P>
It will bring the biggest changes to the London stock market
since the Big Bang reforms of 1986, which first moved trading off
the exchange floor and on to computer screens.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, orders are entered on a central electronic
order book, and automatically executed when buyers and sellers
match.
</P>
<P>
With the old quote-driven trading system, marketmakers quoted
prices on a central exchange screen but deals were struck
separately over the telephone after negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Initially the new method only applies to the FTSE 100 index of
leading stocks, but is expected to roll out to the next 250 shares
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the new system will ensure that the London
market maintains its position as one of the world's leading equity
markets and is able to cope with the growing volume of shares now
being traded.
</P>
<P>
It was reported today that the exchange was "quite happy" with
the performance of the new system so far.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Economy Recovering: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-
Salam Majali said today that the economy would emerge from the
shadow of the 1991 Gulf War and return to normal next year.
</P>
<P>
The economy would grow at a rate of 6 percent this year,
marking an improvement over the around 5.5 percent average for the
last few years, Majali told local officials of the southern Aglun
Governorate on an inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate had been at 16.1 percent for 1992 before
recession set in as the impact of the Gulf War damaged the
economic pillars for Jordan -- foreign aid, tourism and remittance
from expatriates. Western donors denied aid to Jordan for its
siding with Iraq during the war.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian currency, Dinar is in its best shape in 15 years
and the Central Bank of Jordan has a relatively comfortable
reserve of 1.5 billion dinars (about 2.1 billion U.S. dollars),
the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government's recipe for a full recovery is a set of reform
measures to increase exports, curb imports, uplift income level
and step up privatization, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the steps, designed by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), would enable private sectors to do business
free from monopoly, cut red-tape and pick up in a competitive
climate.
</P>
<P>
The IMF-prescribed 10-year economic restructuring program is
due to end next year.

<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair told visiting Gwerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl that
Britain would not try to undermine the European Monetary Union
(EMU), even if London decides to stay out of the EMU.
</P>
<P>
During the informal talks between the two leaders at Blair's
official residence northwest of London, Blair was quoted by a
Downing Street spokeswoman as reaffirming that it was unlikely
that Britain would join the single European currency at its launch
on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair reassured Kohl that the British would not impede
its European Union partners from going ahead with the EMU project
by saying, "We would not seek to undermine or sabotage others who
were pressing ahead with EMU."
</P>
<P>
On Britain' EU presidency in the first half of next year, Blair
said that Britain would use its six-month rotating presidency
"constructively".
</P>
<P>
Blair also expressed satisfaction over the Anglo-German
relations with his spokeswoman saying, "The Prime Minister
believes Anglo-German relations are excellent and that Britain and
Germany can work together on a number of shared European
objectives."
</P>
<P>
Apart from the single currency, the two leaders spent five
hours on discussing plans to reduce unemployment across the
15-nation bloc, British plans for its EU presidency, defence and
aerospace, and the political situation in both Britain and
Germany.

LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all ended down Monday, depressed by a likely delay in the UK's
entry into European Monetary Union (EMU) which was coincided with
the London market's launching of its new automated trading system.

<P>
The FTSE 100 index on the London market had a roller- coaster
day as the new order-driven trading system got under way after
hints from Chancellor Gordon Brown that the UK will not join EMU

<P>
More than 21 billion pounds (34 billion U.S. dollars) were
wiped off the value of leading shares at one stage as the FTSE
fell by 118 points and City pundits dubbed it "Brown Monday".
</P>
<P>
The index steadied to close at 5,211.0, a drop of 60.1 points
as investors breathed a sigh of relief as the feared market crash
failed to materialise.
</P>
<P>
German shares recovered some losses but still ended lower, with
the DAX-30 index closed at 4,040.75, down 20.75 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that indications that Britain may not be among the
EMU first wave entries continued to exert downward pressure on
European markets.

CAIRO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti official said here
today that the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners of war held by Iraq had
blocked the way of normalizing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq continued to claim that it had no Kuwaiti POWs, but facts
belied such claim as about 600 Kuwaiti POWs were held in Iraq,
said Ibrahim al-Shahin, deputy chairman of the Kuwaiti committee
on POWs held by Iraq, following his meeting with Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid.
</P>
<P>
"It remains the most sticking after Baghdad recognized Kuwait's
sovereignty over its land and agreed to pay UN-imposed damages,"
said al-Shahin.
</P>
<P>
Settling this humanitarian issue would help clear the Arab
atmosphere and open the way to the normalization of Kuwaiti-Iraqi
relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait severed its ties with Iraq after Iraqi troops invaded
the neighbor in 1990.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Respect Mandela but Disagree with Libya Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States, while
repeating its criticism of South African President Nelson
Mandela's planned trip to Libya, said on Monday that he still is
highly respected here.
</P>
<P>
"We have the highest possible respect for President Mandela,"
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he reaffirmed U.S. disappointment over Mandela's plans to
visit Libya on Wednesday on his way to a Commonwealth summit in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Mandela accused earlier U.S. criticism over his
Libyan trip of smacking "arrogance".
</P>
<P>
How could the United States have the "arrogance to dictate"
where South African leaders should go or who their friends should
be, Mandela was reported to make the remarks at a banquet.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has been unwavering in his friendship for Libya based
on that country's support for the anti-apartheid struggle in South
Africa over the years.
</P>
<P>
Libya was reported to call the U.S. criticism "despicable
interference in the internal affairs of independent countries."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United States said Mandela's visit to Libya
would violate an international ban on air travel to and from
Libya. But Mandela was said to make the trip by car from Tunisia
in order not to run afoul of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
And Rubin thus said: "This isn't a question of violating
sanctions."
