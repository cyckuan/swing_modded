<HEADLINE> Chinese and Portuguese Leaders Meet before Macao Handover (Details Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Zhu Rongji met here this evening with Portuguese
President Jorge Sampaio and Prime Minister Antonio Guterres
shortly before the Macao handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said that Premier Zhu Rongji and he himself are
both very glad to meet with President Sampaio and Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres at this historically significant moment, the
transfer of power in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Our joint hosting of the Macao handover ceremony signifies our
friendly cooperation on the question of Macao and it also embodies
the great importance we attach to developing Sino-Portuguese
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said the satisfactory settlement of the Macao
question is a result of the mutual cooperation of the two
countries and is in the fundamental interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
After Macao returns to China, the Chinese central government
will firmly implement the policy of "one country, two systems" and
faithfully carry out the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR), Jiang said. Macao's cultural
features and the role of Macao as a bridge to further Sino-
Portuguese and Sino-European relations and increase bilateral
economic and cultural exchanges will also be maintained, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking positively of the development of Sino-Portuguese
relations during the past several years, Jiang said China is
willing to take the smooth settlement of the Macao question as a
new starting point and make joint efforts with the Portuguese side
to expand cooperation in all fields so as to achieve an all-round
and healthy development in Sino-Portuguese relations in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Portugal is expected to take the place of Finland as the next
rotating presiding country of the European Union in the first half
of 2000, Jiang said. "China is ready to work together with
Portugal to further Sino-EU relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Sampaio said that both Portuguese and Chinese
governments have attached great importance to various kinds of
work concerning Macao's transition and the transfer of power there
since the two governments signed the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration, and that today's fruitful results should be
attributed to the fact that leaders from both sides could view the
growth of Sino-Portuguese relations from a strategic perspective.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits between Chinese and Portuguese leaders
has played an important role in the smooth transfer of power in
Macao, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio noted that the Portuguese government fully understands
the significance of a smooth return of Macao to China, which marks
the end of an era and the beginning of a new era.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese government has full confidence in the future of
the Macao SAR, and Macao will surely become an example for
implementing the principle of "one country, two systems", Sampaio
said.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen,
Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Chi Haotian,
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, and the MSAR chief
executive Edmund Ho Hau Wah.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing Portuguese Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira was
also present.

<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Amidst the strains of their red
five-star national anthem, champagne, fireworks and tears too, the
Chinese, who make up one-fifth of the world's population, are
spending a sleepless night to greet Macao's return to the
motherland, and celebrating the upcoming new millennium ahead of
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Toward the midnight of December 19, when Chinese and Portuguese
presidents, Jiang Zemin and Jorge Sampaio, led their respective
government delegations onto the venue for Macao's power handover
ceremony, and the celebration activities reached a climax at the
very beginning.
</P>
<P>
The appearance of Zhuo Lin, in her black evening dress, also
drew long and warm applauses from the attendants. She is widow of
the late Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping who put forward the "
one country systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), who has led China's first SAR for 2
years, sat by her side.
</P>
<P>
The venue for the handover ceremony locates along a section of
the coast of the South China Sea where European vessels had
cruised centuries ago. There stands a rainbow-shape bridge, a new
symbol of Macao, illuminated in the historic night by the lights
from inside the hall of the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Military bands of the two countries were playing well-selected
musical pieces. The Chinese were playing "Good Days" and "My
Chinese Heart", while the Portuguese a slow Portuguese folk song "
Cancao do Mar", or "Song of Sea", which recalls Portugal's history
of navigation.
</P>
<P>
Days ago, the newly acquainted young armymen of the two
countries had conducted a combined rehearsal and had brief
discussions about music.
</P>
<P>
Light green carpet was laid out on the rostrum, and all the
chairs were also painted soft green, the same as the color of the
flag of the Macao Special Administration Region (SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese first set foot on the Chinese territory, Macao,
in 1553 and gradually occupied the region, and Portugal returned
Macao to China today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a farewell speech which lasted around seven minutes
the handover ceremony, Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio noted
that the Macao Special Administrative Region would be established
on the unique land blending different cultures and styles of
living.

<P>
At the end of his speech, he walked over to Chinese president
Jiang Zemin and firmly shook hands with him.
</P>
<P>
At 23:58 of December 19, the Portuguese national flag, symbol
of a Portuguese navigating pioneer, began to be lowered like a
piece of sail. The flag of the Portuguese Macao Municipal Council
was lowered at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from exactly zero hour, the red five-star Chinese
national flag was hoisted by Zhu Tao, a young and stalwart captain
of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He was also the Chinese
national flag raiser at the Hong Kong handover ceremony and the
ceremony held in Beijing to mark the 50th anniversary of the
founding of New China.
</P>
<P>
"It was my mission," Zhu said after the handover ceremony,
adding that "The changing of flags was the last on the Chinese
territory."
</P>
<P>
The green regional flag of the Macao SAR with the design of a
lotus flower was also hoisted at the same time by a local
policeman. The red and green flags seemed rather attractive in the
spacious and bright hall.
</P>
<P>
Three Portuguese soldiers folded up their lowered national flag
and walked out of the rostrum. The hall was silent except for the
waning sound of their steps and the fluttering sound of China's
national flag and the Macao SAR flag.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese rule over Macao came to an end. "This important
event will be remembered in history forever," Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said at the handover ceremony. In the meantime, he
spoke highly of the friendly consultations between the two
countries in solving the Macao issue.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state stood up and walked briskly toward each
other, holding each other's hands firmly amidst the flashing
lights of cameras.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen minutes after zero hour, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji bid farewell to Jorge Sampaio at the
gate of the handover venue.
</P>
<P>
In about an hour, the Portuguese president and Macao's last
Portuguese governor, Vasco Rocha Vieira, boarded a plane and left
Macao, just days prior to the coming new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak in Qatar on Two-day Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak arrived in Doha, Qatar Sunday on a two-day visit aimed at
tackling the latest developments in the Mideast peace process and
the Gulf situation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who had just concluded his visit to Saudi Arabia and
will end his three-nation Gulf tour in Bahrain, will discuss with
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani the outcome of the
latest round of Syrian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed the peace talks in Washington Wednesday
after a break of nearly four years. Officials from the two
countries were trying to work out a framework for talks on Israel's
pullback from the Golan Heights, security arrangements and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa, who headed their countries' delegations at the
Washington meeting, have agreed to continue talks in the U.S. early
next January.
</P>
<P>
According reports reaching here, Sheikh Hamad and Mubarak are
also likely to touch upon the developments on other tracks in the
Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Middle East peace, the two leaders are also
expected to discuss the future situation in the Gulf, especially
after the adoption of a new U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed on Friday resolution 1284,
which calls for Iraq's cooperation in allowing the return of U.N.
weapons inspectors to Iraq in return for a possible suspension of
the nearly nine-year U.N. sanctions on Iraq. Iraq has refused to
accept the new resolution.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weapons inspections were disrupted last December after
massive U.S.-British air strikes against Iraqi targets.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan on Red Alert to Fight off Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- With the new millennium barely
two weeks away, Jordan went on red alert to beat the millennium bug
problem for computer systems in key sectors and industries like
aviation, banking, power, aviation and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has spent millions of U.S dollars so far and moved
aggressively to fix computers, and no serious disruptions caused by
the millennium bug, popularly known as Y2K, are expected to occur
when the new millennium dawns on the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is one of the forerunners to
announce their full readiness to combat the computer bug, and CAA
Director General Jihad Rsheid said there would be "no Y2K clouds in
Jordanian skies".
</P>
<P>
There was no need, he said, to change any domestic or
international flights for the national flag carrier Royal Jordanian
on the new year day as the CAA is "100 percent" prepared for the
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
The navigation, radar and telecommunications systems had be
successfully updated for the problem and all air and ground
personnel had been trained to prepare for emergencies which might
be caused by the millennium bug, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K is a programming glitch that experts fear will cause
some computers to crash or malfunction when their internal clocks
roll over to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Computers, particularly the old ones, might read the year 2000
as "00" by mistake for 1900 as they were programmed to read only
the last two digits of a year.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications appeared to be another sector under immense
pressure from the Y2K, and the Jordanian Telecom announced almost
all of its network, including every switch board, had been prepared
for the computer bug, and the systems and its customers expect no
disruption when the new millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
There are no apparent signs that customers are drawing money in
panic from local banks as all major banks based in Amman claimed
they are well prepared for the Y2K, including the leading Housing
Bank and Arab Bank.
</P>
<P>
The National Electricity Company promised to the public that
there would be no disruption of power during or after the new year
as it had achieved more than 95 percent readiness for the computer
glitch after preventive measures were taken in the power generation
and distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry claimed hospitals in the kingdom can also
shrug off the computer bug as the ministry had given a "healthy
dose" of anti-bug preparations.
</P>
<P>
The ministry started to look into the Y2K from 1998 and spent
20,000 Jordanian dinars (38,000 dollars) to upgrade 55 key but old-
fashioned computers in the hospital networks in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The water and irrigation ministry said it has also set up a
special team to cope with Y2K-related problems, and emergency plans
had been made to guarantee water supplies to key institutions like
hospitals and health centers for the new year period.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials said all computer-dependent institutions in
the kingdom have made contingency plans or taken measures to ensure
their system are Y2K-compliant, and they expected only minor
damages or disruptions, if any, caused by the millennium bug after
the turn of the century.

masters of their own affairs in the big family of the motherland

future with their hard work and wisdom."

Government of the Macao SAR, and the President of the Legislative
Council, the President of the Court of Final Appeal, the
Procurator-General, members of the Executive Council, members of
the Legislative Council, judges and procurators of the Macao SAR
have been sworn into office and started to perform their sacred
duties.
</P>
<P>
The Central People's Government will give full support to you,
the Chief Executive Mr Ho Hau Wah, and to the work of the SAR
Government under your leadership. It is hoped that all of you will
carry forward Macao compatriots' glorious tradition of loving
China and loving Macao, implement the Basic Law of the Macao SAR
to the letter, conscientiously fulfill your duties and make due
contributions to the maintenance of the long-term stability and
development of Macao, so as to live up to the ardent expectations
of your fellow countrymen and Macao inhabitants and be worthy of
the great trust placed in you by history.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return to China and the establishment of the Macao SAR
Government mark the beginning of a new era for Macao when Macao
people administer Macao and Macao enjoys a high degree of autonomy
in accordance with the Basic Law of the Macao SAR under the
guidance of the great concept of "one country, two systems"
initiated by Mr. Deng Xiaoping. This is another historic
achievement made by the Chinese people in their lofty cause of
seeking a complete reunification of their motherland. All Chinese,
at home and overseas, are elated about it.
</P>
<P>
At the threshold of the 21st century, a new chapter has been
opened in Macao's history. I am sure that our Macao compatriots,
who are now the masters of their own affairs in the big family of
the motherland and have their destiny in their own hands, will
create brilliant achievements with their hard work and wisdom.
Macao will have an even more splendid future.
</P>
<P>
Thank you all.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Portuguese National Flag Lowered at Governor's Palace Forever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The last lowering of the
Portuguese national flag at the governor's palace Sunday afternoon,
marked that the last Portuguese Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira
was soon to leave Macao and he would be the last governor in Asia
appointed by Western countries.
</P>
<P>
At 17:00 a smiling and waving governor stepped on the red
carpet laid in the yard of Praia Grande Palace amidst the applause
of civilians and reporters and then turned his head to the
Portuguese national flag flying high above his office building,
standing still and wordless.
</P>
<P>
The last lowering of the Portuguese national flag came minutes
later than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The red and green Portuguese national flag was lowered amidst
the strains of the Portuguese anthem, "The Portuguese", and the
applause of the onlookers, and in front of the outgoing governor
and over 40 Portuguese Macao Government officials. All the lights
in the courtyard were turned on ahead of the normal hours.
</P>
<P>
The flag-lowering at the governor's palace took place at the
same time as that at several other points in Macao, including the
Barrier Gate and the Monte Fortress.
</P>
<P>
A police folded the flag and handed it to the solemn-looking
governor who accepted it with his two hands and put it onto his
left chest. After bowing the crowd, the governor got into his
limousine Mercedes Benz, still holding the flag tightly against
his chest, and left the Portuguese-style palace built in 1875.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from 1616, 127 Portuguese were appointed governors in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
After the governor left, anxious citizens went into the yard,
waving miniature Chinese national flags and Macao Special
Administrative Regional flags and taking commemorative pictures.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing governor was one of the principal Portuguese
officials attending the handover ceremony hours later and
witnessed the last lowering of the Portuguese national flag in
Macao and rising of the Chinese national flag in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Vasco Rocha Vieira held the post as governor for eight years
and saw with his own eyes what had happened in Macao. The governor
said he might come to Macao later as a tourist and do something to
promote the Portuguese-China friendship.

MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- "Unification has always been the
main focus throughout China's history, and national unity, well-
being and prosperity have always constituted goals to which the
Chinese people have aspired tirelessly. Macao's return to China is
an important step in the process of, and great progress towards,

Edmund Ho Hau Wah made the remarks after he took the oath of

Ho called the great concept of "one country, two systems" one
of "ingenious political insight," saying, "It is the basis for

"To implement this principle, it is necessary to adhere firmly

</P>
<P>
He went on to say, "Amidst this celebration, we must remember
that, in the past hundred years or so, the Chinese people have
striven relentlessly to safeguard our nation's territorial
integrity and its dignity. Over the last fifty years, under the
guidance of three generations of leaders headed by Macao Zedong,
Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, the Chinese people have gone from
strength to strength playing an increasingly important role in the
world. This in turn has paved the way for the smooth resolution of
the question of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"With wisdom and foresight, Mr. Deng Xiaoping put forward the
great concept of 'one country, two systems' and solved a
historical problem in a peaceful way. All of this laid a solid
foundation for a smooth transition and continued stability and
prosperity in Macao after its reunification with its motherland."

<HEADLINE> General: Federal Forces Near Full Control of Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces have
nearly assumed full control of the territory of the breakaway
republic of Chechnya, a top general said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The militants are blocked by troops on all sides," said
General Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the General Staff of the Armed
Forces.
</P>
<P>
"We are also in the mountainous part of the republic," the
Interfax news agency quoted the general as saying.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops were situated Sunday in Vedeno, 50 kilometers
south of Grozny, near Kharachoi, in the area of Nozhai-Yurt and
Itum-Kale in the mountains, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, regional capital of the republic, government troops
have reached the district of Khankala and the outskirts of Staraya
Sunzha, Kvashnin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russian military officials have met with
representatives of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, including
members of his cabinet, two deputy prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The discussion was concrete: either they fully accept what
President Boris Yeltsin said in his statement, or not. The rest is
not a subject for negotiation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kvashnin again rejected Western media reports of significant
troop losses in the center of Grozny. "Somebody provoked such
reports on the brink of active operations in the mountains and in
other directions," he said, noting that the militants have
prepared to blow up part of the city using radio-controlled
detonators.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Edmund Ho Hau Wah makes an
inaugural speech after taking an oath of office as the first chief
executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR) at the
Forum, Macao, early this morning. The full text of his speech is
as follows:
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin,Premier Zhu Rongji,distinguished guests,
fellow compatriots and friends,
</P>
<P>
At long last, on this historic day: the twentieth of December
nineteen ninety-nine, Macao has returned to her motherland.
Macao's return to the motherland opens a new page in history. Now,
together with the Chinese people of all nationalities, and sharing
the same national flag as the People's Republic of China, we are
greeting the arrival of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Amidst this celebration, we must remember that, in the past
hundred years or so, the Chinese people have striven relentlessly
to safeguard our nation's territorial integrity and its dignity.
Over the past fifty years, under the guidance of three generations
of leaders headed by Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin,
the Chinese people have gone from strength to strength, playing an
increasingly important role in the world. This in turn has paved
the way for the smooth resolution of the question of Macao. With
wisdom and foresight, Mr. Deng Xiaoping put forward the great
concept of "one country, two systems" and solved a historical
problem in a peaceful way. All of this has laid a solid foundation
for a smooth transition and continued stability and prosperity in
Macao after its reunification with the motherland.
</P>
<P>
China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Macao
under the principle of "one country, two systems" embodies a
concept of ingenious political foresight. It is the basis for
Macao's future development. First of all, we must have a clear
notion of "one country": this means one sovereign state. Then
comes the concept of "two systems" coexisting and prospering
together within this one sovereign state. The Basic Law of the
Macao Special Administrative Region specifies and elucidates the
content of the "one country, two systems" principle. To implement
this principle, it is necessary to adhere firmly to the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Unificaiton has always been the main focus throughout China's
history, and national unity, well-being and prosperity have always
constituted goals to which the Chinese people have aspired
tirelessly. Macao's return to China is an important step in the
process of, and great progress towards, the ultimate reunification
of our motherland.
</P>
<P>
In the same hours this morning, when the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR) was established, it was a deeply
moving and immensely inspiring experience to see the MSAR regional
flag hoisted together with the national flag of the People's
Republic of China, set to the solemn strains of our national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
In hailing this new era for Macao, we also join with all the
peoples of the world in greeting the arrival of the new century.
This is a joyous, proud and glorious moment. We are filled with
hopes for a brighter and better future and imbued with a lofty and
sacred sense of mission and responsibility. As the Chief Executive,
chosen by the people of Macao for the first time, I wish once more
to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Central Government for the
trust placed in me, and to the people of Macao for their support.
In the years to come, I will work tirelessly and resolutely to
uphold and implement the principle of "one country, two systems"
in accordance with the Basic Law, and to lead Macao's 400,000-odd
citizens towards a bright and prosperous future. This shall be my
greatest honor and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
I firmly believe that, as the Macao Special Administrative
Region of the People's Republic of China, Macao will become more
stable, more progressive and prosperous.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
declares the establishment of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (MSAR) in Macao early this morning. Shortly afterwards, the
MSAR Government, which is formed of Macao inhabitants and headed
by Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hau Wah, is sworn into office.
</P>
<P>
Macao has followed Hong Kong to become the second special
administrative region in China, under the concept of "one country,
two systems," a brainchild of the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
At 1:43, the ceremony for the founding of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR) and the swearing-in of the MSAR
Government starts at the Forum, Macao. As China's national anthem
subsides, Jiang Zemin announces, "The Macao Special Administrative
Region of the People's Republic of China is now established." It
arouses thunderous applause in the hall.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, it is Jiang who declared the founding of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The successful
operation of the two-year-old HKSAR has convinced people that
Macao has a bright future.
</P>
<P>
At around 1:50, the swearing-in ceremony for the MSAR
Government begins. Under the supervision of Premier Zhu Rongji,

be loyal to the Macao Special Administrative Region of the
People's Republic of China, fulfill my duties wholeheartedly,
abide by the law, be clean and honest, work hard for the stability
and development of Macao, and be responsible for the Central
People's Government and the Macao Special Administrative Region."

latter'sassumption of office.
</P>
<P>
After that, Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hau Wah supervises the
oath-taking, group by group, of the principal officials of the
MSAR, members of the Executive Council, members of the Legislative
Council, judges and procurators of the MSAR.
</P>
<P>

time, has come into being a democratic political system under the
principles of "one country, two systems", "Macao people
administering Macao," and "a high degree of autonomy" for Macao. (

'one country, two systems' in accordance with the Basic Law, and
to lead Macao's 400,000-odd citizens towards a bright and

</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, standing beneath the Chinese national flag
and the MSAR regional flag and facing a packed hall and hundreds
of millions of TV viewers around the world, makes the pledge at a
ceremony for the establishment of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (MSAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the
inauguration of the MSAR government.
</P>
<P>
Macao has returned to the embrace of its motherland, under the
principles of "once country, two systems", "Macao people
administering Macao", and "a high degree of autonomy" for Macao.
</P>
<P>
The hall of the Forum, where the ceremony is held, is decorated
with hundreds of potted flowers and filled with a festive
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
As Ho takes an oath of office, Jiang Zemin, the Chinese
president who has just declared the founding of the MSAR, gazes at
this 44-year old top official of the MSAR. Premier Zhu Rongji
stands at the side supervising the swearing-in.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese landed on the Macao Peninsula 446 years ago, and
during the 150-year long Portuguese rule, Portugal had sent 127
governors and deprived local Chinese inhabitants of the right to
participate in administration.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the advent of the new century, Macao people have made
Ho their top official.
</P>
<P>
Ho's life experience so far is said to be a mirror of the past
of Macao. He left home for schooling as a child, returned home to
revive the business of his family as a young man and became a
social dignitary in his middle age.
</P>
<P>
The first chief executive of the MSAR, raising his right hand,
swears to "uphold the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, be loyal
to the People's Republic of China and its Macao Special
Administrative Region, fulfill my duties wholeheartedly, abide by
the law, and be responsible for the Central People's Government
and the Macao Special Administrative Region."
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji announces that the central government gives
full support to Ho and the MSAR Government under his leadership.
The establishment of the MSAR marks Macao's entrance into a new
era under the principles of "one country, two systems", "Macao
people administering Macao", and "a high degree of autonomy" for
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Macao people have placed high hopes on Ho Hau Wah, whom they
have chosen to lead the MSAR government. Ho has said that his
policy guideline is to rectify the security sector, restructure
the economy, be clean and create harmony among local people.
</P>
<P>
With support from the central government and strong backing from
the Macao people, Chief Executive Ho Hau Wah is expected to
succeed in bringing a stable and prosperous Macao into the next
century.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Celebrates Macao's Return to Motherland (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- At zero hour today, the five-
star national flag of the People's Republic of China began rising
over Macao together with the regional flag of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
This symbolizes the Chinese government's resumption of the
exercise of its sovereignty over Macao and represents another
monument erecting on the road to the country's complete
reunification.
</P>
<P>
A few seconds earlier, the national flag of Portugal and the
flag of the Macao Municipal Council were lowered.
</P>
<P>
The handover ceremony was held in a glass-enclosed building by
the Cultural Center of Macao. As the military band struck up the
strains of the national anthem of the People's Republic of China,
2,500 people, including ranking Chinese and foreign officials,
representatives of international organizations, members of the
delegation from China's interior area attending the Macao return
celebration activities, representatives of overseas Chinese and
foreigners of Chinese origin, as well as personalities of all
walks of life from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao stood in solemnity
to witness this historical moment.
</P>
<P>
Macao, including the Macao Peninsula, Taipa Island and Coloane
Island, has been part of the Chinese territory since ancient times.
After mid 16th century, Macao had gradually been occupied by
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Today, Macao has returned to the embrace of the motherland
after more than four centuries of sufferings, thus putting an end
to foreign colonial rule and opening a new page in the history of
the Chinese nation. This divine land was permeated with an
atmosphere of jubilation.
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese capital of Beijing, 30,000 people braved the
freezing temperature to attend a grand gala on the Tiananmen
Square, featuring dragon and lion dancing and rounds of dazzling
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
At the moment when the countdown clock, which has been ticking
off the minutes in front of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution
and the Museum of Chinese History for 594 days, hit zero, the
immense jubilant crowd on the square burst into thunderous cheers
and applause.
</P>
<P>
Fu Lei, a student at prestigious Beijing University, said, "
Macao's return to the motherland has now come true. We should
redouble our efforts to invigorate China and make the motherland
even more prosperous and glorious in the new century."

BAGHDAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 Iraqi children
and elderly people died during last month of different diseases and
malnutrition as a result of the U.N. sanctions, Iraq's Health
Ministry statistics showed.
</P>
<P>

elderly since the imposition of the embargo till last November

<TEXT>
<P>
The 26 descendants of Wen Yiduo, the late author of the well-
known poem "Song of Seven Sons," gathered at a suburban home at
hours earlier to greet the return of Macao. In the poem, Wen
compared Macao, Hong Kong and five other Chinese cities occupied
by Western powers to sons compelled to leave their mother.
</P>
<P>
Wen Lipeng, son of late writer Wen Yiduo, said, "The return of
Macao to the motherland is a joyous occasion for both the country
and our family. I'm very happy that my father's long-cherished
wish has come true. I hope my father will realize this and share
our happiness in Heaven."
</P>
<P>
Large-scale evening parties and theatrical performances were
held at a square by the Bund in Shanghai, along the Haihe River in
Tianjin and Jialing River in Chongqing, and in Dr. Sun Yat-sen
Memorial Hall Square in Guangzhou and other cities.
</P>
<P>
The city of Zhuhai, which borders Macao, hosted a grand
performance to honor Macao's return to the motherland. The ruins
of St. Paul's Cathedral, a landmark of Macao, and the statue of a
fishing girl situated by sea, a symbol of Zhuhai, indicating the
close relationship between the two cities, were projected as a
setting at the backdrop of stage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 100 overseas Chinese or foreigners of
Chinese origin joined residents of Guang'an in southwest China's
Sichuan Province to observe Macao's return at the former residence
of late leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese-American surnamed Yuan said, "the formula of 'one
country, two systems' set forth by Deng has contributed to world
peace and development. I came to Deng's hometown on the day of
Macao's return to cherish the memory of this great man."
</P>
<P>
East China's Fujian Province, the principal ancestral home of
people in Macao, has seen a flurry of celebration activities in
major cities which were bedecked with flowers, national flags and
colorful lights.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhenze, a man of Taiwan origin, said, "I came to Xiamen
with my parents at the age of seven, but I didn't return to Taiwan
to meet my dear ones until 1993. Hong Kong and Macao have now
returned to the embrace of the motherland in succession. As a
senior citizen, I feel all more bitterness for being far away from
home, and thirst for the day when the whole of China is reunited."
</P>
<P>
The first Chief Executive of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR), Edmund Ho Hau Wah, said he is confident that Macao
will become a place China can be proud of after its return.
</P>
<P>
Noting that "what Hong Kong has done over the past two and a
half years proves that the concept of 'one country, two systems'
is correct," Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR,
said that there are reasons to believe that governing Macao by the
people of Macao will surely be crowned with a complete success.

<HEADLINE> South Lebanon Army Soldiers Seek Asylum in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 19 (Xinhua) - Members of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) and their families on Sunday petitioned
Israeli High Court of Justice for political asylum in Israel,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
They said that Lebanese Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrillas, who
are fighting to end Israel's occupation, had issued death sentences
for 3,000 SLA members and their 14,000 relatives.
</P>
<P>
The SLA claimed if they remain in Lebanon after the planed
Israeli pullout from the so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon
along the borders with Israel next July, their lives would be in
great danger.
</P>
<P>
They asked for asylum in Israel because Israel is obliged to
ensure their safety after they helped defend Israeli towns and
villages in Galilee region of north Israel in the last decade, the
SLA said.
</P>
<P>
Israel declared a "security zone" in south Lebanon in 1985 with
the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks. The SLA militia were trained and armed by
Israel to help it patrol the border zone.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office last July, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has promised to withdrawal Israel Defense Forces from south Lebanon
within one year regardless of negotiations with Syria, the main
power-broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel's largest newspaper Yediot Aharonot said Sunday that
Israel has issued tenders for large-scale construction projects
along the international border, preparing for its New Horizon plan
for the evacuation form south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Beijingers Brave Cold Night Celebrating Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of lights and
brilliant displays of fireworks blazed Tiananmen Square in the
Chinese capital, where 30,000 jubilant Beijing residents braved
freezing temperatures Sunday night to celebrate Macao's return to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
A grand gala themed "Hello, Macao" was held at the 440,000-
square-meter square at midnight Sunday, with little more than ten
days to go before the start of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
A giant red artificial lotus flower, the emblem of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR), bloomed on a stage at the
east side of the square. A huge digital countdown clock ticked
down the remaining minutes before Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
In the bitter wind, Chinese performers staged traditional
dragon and lion dances to the deafening accompaniment of gongs and
drums at the square.
</P>
<P>
Tiananmen Square at the heart of Beijing witnessed major events
in China's modern history. This year alone, two grand celebrations
have been held on the newly-renovated square, one for the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic in October,
and the other for Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
Only two years ago, jubilant Chinese people celebrated the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland at the world's largest
square.
</P>
<P>
Yang Hongji, a well-known baritone, and 100 primary school
students sang songs composed specially for the return of Macao.
Yang said that all of Chinese are looking forward to China's
complete reunification.
</P>
<P>
"We could not enjoy today's happiness if there had not been
great achievements over the past five decades, especially in the
20 years of reform and opening up," said Yang, who also took part
in the celebration for new China's 50th birthday on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Music and dance came to a halt as the countdown clock ticked
out the last ten seconds till midnight, when the crowd chanted
down to zero in unison.
</P>
<P>
Two huge TV screens aired the live broadcast of the handover
ceremony held in Macao some 2,000 km away. When the national flag
was hoisted and national anthem played, celebrants cheered,
applauded, laughed and cried.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yue, a professor from Qinghua University, who celebrated
the return of Hong Kong right here two years ago, led his students
to Tiananmen Square again to welcome Macao back in the fold of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
"The colonial rule has ended in China and Asia, and we can hold
our heads high and feel proud," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Waving the national flag and the Macao SAR flag, Fu Lei, a
student from Beijing University, said China will step into the
21st century with a new image after the return of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The 16-meter-high digital clock, which has been counting the
minutes until Macao's return for the past 594 days, will be housed
in the Museum of the Chinese Revolution together with other 3,000
items representing China's 100-year evolution from poverty and
weakness to wealth and power, said Xu Qing, one of the designers
of the countdown board.
</P>
<P>
Standing under the board, Xu Chunyu, an employee at Beijing
Huitian Hotel, whose grandfather is living in Taiwan, said the
issues of Hong Kong and Macao have been successfully solved under
the principle of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to the early solution of the Taiwan
issue and the complete reunification of China," she said.

<HEADLINE> Wrap-up: China Resumes Sovereignty over Macao (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- With the Portuguese national
flag lowered and the red five-star Chinese national flag hoisted
in Macao, the Chinese government resumed the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao and China made another significant stride
forward in the great cause of the country's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from zero hour today, the red five-star national flag,
in the company of the green regional flag of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) with the design of lotus, was hoisted
at the venue for Macao's power handover ceremony. A while ago, the
Portuguese national flag and the flag of the Portuguese Macao
Municipal Council had been lowered.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has resumed the exercise of sovereignty
over Macao, and Macao has entered a brand-new era in its
development," Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced after the
change of the flags.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people are confident and capable of
an early settlement of the Taiwan question and the complete
national reunification," Jiang also stressed.
</P>
<P>
The venue is located along the coast of the South China Sea.
The sea waters, on which European vessels cruised centuries ago,
was lit up in the historic night today. Inside the venue, solemn
honor guards, orderly military bands and high flagpoles attracted
large numbers of cameras.
</P>
<P>
At 23:42 last night, Chinese and Portuguese representatives
went up the rostrum and sat at the front row. All present stood up
and gave a warm applause.
</P>
<P>
Through this solemn ceremony, Portugal would return Macao to
the People's Republic of China, Sampaio said in his speech.
</P>
<P>
The final agreement reached on the status of Macao fully
demonstrated the down-to-earth attitude and wisdom of both
countries in resolving problems through peaceful means, he said.

Portuguese first stepped onto Macao in 1553 and gradually
occupied the region. China and Portugal signed a joint declaration
in 1987 which stipulates that Portugal returns Macao to China.
</P>
<P>
The first chief executive-designate of Macao SAR Edmund Ho Hau
Wah and the first chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR Tung Chee
Hwa experienced this historic moment. Hong Kong has maintained its
stability and prospeerity since its return to the motherland in
1997.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of the concept of 'one country, two
systems' in Hong Kong and Macao has played and will continue to
play an important exemplary role for our eventual settlement of
the Taiwan question," Chinese President Jiang Zemin said in his
seven-minute speech at the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
While the concept of "one country two systems" was mentioned,
Zhuo Lin took out a handkerchief to wipe off the tears in her eyes.
Zhuo, seated at the rostrum, is the widow of the late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping who put forward the concept of "one country,
two systems."
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China and Portugal "have worked together in
conformity with the historical trend of the times and brought
about the smooth transition and transfer of power of Macao."
</P>
<P>
After Macao's return, the Chinese Government will unswervingly
implement the policies of "one country, two systems", "Macao
people governing Macao" and a high degree of autonomy, Jiang
reiterated.
</P>
<P>
"After the return of Macao, the economic interests of all
countries and regions in Macao will be protected in accordance
with the law," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The handover ceremony lasted about 35 minutes, ending the
centuries-old occupation and rule by westerners in the whole of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the countries and regions with investment and
trade interests in Macao will continue to work for the stability
and development of Macao," the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,500 journalists from around the world came to
Macao to cover the historic event.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,500 Chinese and foreign dignities, representatives of
international organizations, guests from Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan, and representatives of overseas China and foreigners of
Chinese origin were present at the handover ceremony.

<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A hush fell over the jubilant
crowd braving bitter winds at Tiananmen Square as they eyed the
countdown board for Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
As digital clock clicked to 23:59:50 Sunday night, the 30,000
people intoned the final ten-second count amid the deafening
pounding of gongs and drums.
</P>
<P>
"Macao is home!" they cheered wildly as they reached zero.
</P>
<P>
With Macao officially back in the fold of the motherland, the
Chinese national anthem boomed out over the square. Two big-screen
TV sets at the two sides of the main stage aired the ceremonies
from Macao live, causing some people to turn misty-eyed at the
sight of the five-star red national flag and the flag of the Macao
Special Administrative Region rising at the venue of the handover
ceremony in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Fireworks arced over the sky as the joyful people were dancing.

<HEADLINE> China Port City Tianjin Celebrates Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of people
gathered Sunday evening at a colorfully decorated square in north
China's port city Tianjin, celebrating Macao's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
At 11:30 p.m., the thunderous pounding of gongs and drums
kicked off a gala full of flying dragons, flowers, artificial
lotuses, and songs. Giant neon-lit boxes flashed the Chinese
characters for "Remember History," "Return to the Motherland," and
"Better Future."
</P>
<P>
Little did people realize that among the joyful dancers was a
man diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianquan said when he learned that a big party would be
held in Tianjin to celebrate Macao's return, he asked organizers
to let him take part in the dancing team.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so excited about Macao's return, I have almost forgotten
my personal suffering," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Yan, a member of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions,
said that performers had been rehearsing long hours every day to
ensure the success of the celebration party.
</P>
<P>
Although Tianjin is distant from Macao, the two cities have a
special relationship in history. In 1601, Jesuit priest Matteo
Ricci, of Mazzarino, Italy, came from Macao to Beijing, via
Tianjin, to spread religious beliefs and western technology.
</P>
<P>
Today, the relationship between Tianjin and Macao is even
closer. By the end of October this year, Macao businessmen had set
up 127 projects in Tianjin with a total investment of 189 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
These days, Macao Road in Tianjin, less than 200 meters long,
is a special area where people come to take pictures, perform
dances, sing, and recite poems in tribute to Macao's historic
return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Li Yueying, a woman living on the road, said she will go to
Macao to meet her younger brother who has lived there for decades.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yucheng and his wife Zu Junying, who also live on Macao Road,
have made 99 seals inscribed with the character "return" and
mailed a piece of paper printed with the seals to the Chief
Executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region Ho Hau Wah.
</P>
<P>
With just ten seconds to go until the official return of Macao
at midnight, the crowd on the square chanted the final countdown
in unison, and broke into cheers of "Macao is home!" after hitting
zero. At the stroke of midnight, fireworks filled the sky.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Fortify Role of Equity Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing an award ceremony of Karachi Stock Exchange,
Musharraf unfolded a capital market development agenda, which will
"ensure protection to small investors,", according to the official
Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Under the "capital market reforms" plan, the role of equity
market is being strengthened as "a vital source of financing,"
protection is to be given to the interest of small investors and
the standard of corporate governance is to be raised.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said the Securities and Exchange Commission of
Pakistan has been directed to finalize the "hostile takeover"law
rules and submit them to the cabinet by March 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The rules for "disclosure of information" for the corporate
sector will also be worked out and a plan for setting up a
National Clearing System for bourses will be submitted by June
2000.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive also said his government will take measures
to develop infrastructure and modernize the stock exchanges of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that only seven percent of the population is presently
participating in the equity market and there is no room for small
investors.
</P>
<P>
"Room for small investors must be created in the equity market,
" he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the privatization program of the government,
Musharraf said that objectives are to broaden and deepen the
equity market with maximum participation of the bourses in
privatization of state units.
</P>
<P>
He said that privatization of units through the stock exchanges
would also give impetus to the capital market.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Musharraf announced an ambitious economic
revival plan, which targets at building a self-reliant economy out
of the debt-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The stock market welcomed the plan with the 100-index of the
Karachi Stock Exchange rising about seven percent during the three
trading days after the announcement to touch the year's high.

Beijing residents in elegant dress participated in the bash.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of actors were carrying four huge dragon figures, each
more than 30 meters long, weaving across the 1,300-square-meter
stage covered with white clouds formations made by more actresses.
</P>
<P>
Actors in other parts of the square performed traditional
dances, dressed as 200 smaller dragons and 100 majestic lions.
</P>
<P>
Vocalists presented songs including "Spirit of the Lotus" and "
Hello, Macao," which were specially composed for the return of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
As the digital countdown reached zero, two big-screen TVs on
the square aired the live broadcast of the handover ceremony in
Macao, showing the flag-raising of the national flag and the flag
of the Macao Special Administrative Region to the tune of the
Chinese national anthem.
</P>
<P>
The second round of fireworks illuminated the sky. People waved
flags and sang "In Praise of the Motherland," celebrating the
happy occasion on Tiananmen Square, which two years ago witnessed
the return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is home, and Macao is home again. Happy events took
place one after another," said Yang Yue, a professor from the
Qinghua University. "We are expecting the complete national
reunification now."
</P>
<P>
Fu Lei, a Beijing University student, could not hide his
excitement: "The colonial rule has finally come to an end in the
Chinese territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, I think people could not feel proud and elated
if their country was not strong and powerful. We should strive to
do more to reinvigorate our country," Fu said.

Traffic patrols were beefed up especially during the rush hour
before the "iftar," Muslims' supper at sunset in Ramadan, the
Yemeni News Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Reformist's Lawyer Appeals against Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Mohsen Rahami, the defense
lawyer of the prominent Iranian reformist cleric Abdollah Nouri
announced on Sunday that he has appealed against the verdict issued
by the conservative Special Cleric Court on his client.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporter, Rahimi said that after lengthy debate, he
had managed to convince the Prosecutor General Ayatollah Morteza
Moqtadaie to accept the request and registered the appeal.
</P>
<P>
Moqtadaie told him that he could not intervene with the case
opened at the Special Cleric Court, the Islamic Republic News
Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rahimi said that in the later stages he would file a complaint
with the Supreme Court against the verdict issued on Nouri, former
interior minister and vice president for development and social
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a close ally of moderate Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami, was sentenced last month to five years imprisonment on
charges ranging from publishing anti-religious materials and
sacrilegious articles to insulting the late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Rahimi said that per a law passed by the Iranian Majlis last
year, had the accusations leveled against Nouri been all proved, he
would have been sentenced to a maximum of two-year in prison.
</P>
<P>
The moderates here believed that Nouri's conviction was a step
by the conservatives, who dominate most of the state powers, in an
attempt to deprive him of running for the forthcoming Majlis
elections slated for February 18.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a top vote-winner in the first local council polling in
last February, stepped down in September from his post as chairman
of Tehran City Council in hopes of being elected as the Majlis
speaker.
</P>
<P>
Despite in prison, Nouri registered to run for the sensitive
parliamentary polling, which many believe will create a new
equation of power in the country.
</P>
<P>
Rahami said that the verdict handed down on Nouri was not yet
definitive and would be studied at the appeals court, so he can not
be deprived of running in the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts believed that the conservative-dominated
Guardians Council, which has the right to screen the qualifications
of candidates, would not give him the green light.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Celebrates Macao's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 20 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of south
China's Guangdong Province hosted nine performances from last
night till small hours today to mark the return of Macao to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The national anthem was played at the start of the evening gala
at 10:45 p.m. Sunday, then gongs and drums thundered from the
square where flags and banners waved. People sang and danced, clad
in their holiday best.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,500 people from all walks of life in Guangzhou
gathered at the square in front of the Memorial Hall of Sun Yat-
sen and watched the live broadcast of the handover ceremony in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the televised show, 1,999 balloons were released
and fireworks exploded in the night sky. Senior citizens enjoyed
the rural folk dance Yangko, while young people took a livelier
approach to the music.
</P>
<P>
Su Xuezhang, a 73-year-old man, said, "I danced Yangko at
Tiananmen Square in Beijing when new China was founded on October
1, 1949. Today I celebrate the return of Macao with Yangko in
front of the Memorial Hall of Sun Yat-sen." Sun (1866-1925), was
the founder of the Chinese Kuomintang who inspired the revolution
that overthrew the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Huang Dongmiao, an official in charge of the Sun Yat-sen
Memorial Hall, said, "It is of great significance to mark the
return of Macao here. Sun Yat-sen would be pleased to learn that
Hong Kong and Macao have returned to China."

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Center Celebrates Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- About 4,000 people from all
walks in Shanghai, China's leading financial center, gathered in
the downtown area here to celebrate the return of Macao to the
motherland on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ju, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee and secretary of the Shanghai
Municipal Committee of the CPC, attended the rally.
</P>
<P>
On the Bund, the city's waterfront famous for its European-
style buildings once the headquarters of foreign banks, a
brilliant outdoor concert was held to mark this historic moment
for the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
As the Peking Opera titled "Great China" was staged, some Macao
people in Shanghai excitedly waved banners bearing characters
which read "So nice to come home!"
</P>
<P>
In front of a countdown board, which was unveiled 150 days ago
by Edmund Ho Hau Wah, the first chief executive of the Macao
Special Administrative Region, many joyful people converged,
waiting for the number on the board to turn to zero.
</P>
<P>
Most residents, however, chose to stay at home and watch live
broadcast of the grand handover ceremony held in Macao.
</P>
<P>
As the bridgehead of China's commercial and trade sectors,
Shanghai has established close economic ties with Macao.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 36,700 Shanghai tourists went to Macao in
the first ten months of this year, accounting for more than 40
percent of all the overseas travels by Shanghai people.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of its return to the motherland, Macao, adjacent to
the south China city of Zhuhai in south China, has become a hot
tourist destination for the people of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Macao's picturesque aspects have made it a first-choice for
Shanghai people looking for a place to welcome in the new century,
and Shanghai travel agencies have been busy arranging tour groups
to Macao on December 30 and 31, according to one local source.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Parliamentary Voting Ends, Election Declared Valid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 19 (Xinhua) -- With polling stations closed
their doors Sunday in the westernmost region of Kaliningrad,
Russian voters have finished casting their ballots in the election
of a new lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to initial statistics, voter turnout across the
country, which covers 11 time zones, has far exceeded the barrier
of 25 percent, which makes the election valid under the law.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 60 percent of the 107 million
eligible voters have been to the polls, with 100 percent turnout
reported in two villages in the easternmost region of Chukot and
the Tula Oblast south of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma has 450 members. Voters elect half of the Duma
members by casting a vote for a specific party listed on the
ballot; these 225 seats are then divided among the qualifying
parties by proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
The other 225 Duma members are elected individually from
electoral districts. Each of Russia's 89 constituent units has at
least one electoral district. As federal troops are in the middle
of an offensive against rebels in Chechnya, the Duma seat for that
electoral district will be left vacant.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, when
casting their votes in Moscow, expressed the hope that the
election would produce a new State Duma that is more cooperative
with the Kremlin and the government.
</P>
<P>
"Russia needs the kind of Duma that will get down to business,
make laws rather than politicize," Yeltsin said after casting his
own vote in western Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Putin, for his part, said he hoped the new lower house "will be
a legislative body which we can work with in a friendly way, and
be able to resolve the problems of the country effectively."
</P>
<P>
Although 26 political parties and blocs competed in the
elections, only four of them are expected to comfortably clear the
threshold of 5 percent of the votes needed to enter the State Duma,
which has a normal term of four years.
</P>
<P>
They are the Communist Party, the Fatherland-All Russia
movement, the Unity Party and the Yabloko party.
</P>
<P>
The Communists, with their sound grassroots structures and
better organization, are expected to grab the most votes, possibly
as high as 30 percent, while the pro-Kremlin Unity is expected to
finish second.
</P>
<P>
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov was confident that his party
would remain a major force in the new chamber. His party occupies
157 seats in the outgoing State Duma.
</P>
<P>
"We are in no doubt that we will be first," he told reporters
as he left a polling station in central Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Fatherland-All Russia, led by former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, had appeared certain to
end first in the elections just months ago, but its popularity was
dented following a frenzied media campaign against it.
</P>
<P>
Unity, a new bloc under the popular Emergencies Minister Sergei
Shoigu, saw its rating shoot up in recent weeks amid favorable
media coverage and support by the Kremlin and Prime Minister Putin.
</P>
<P>
Putin is now the most popular political figure in Russia
following the government's resolute militant actions against
rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The assault, now in its third month, was launched after Chechen
rebels' armed incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a series
of terrorist bombings, also blamed on Chechen militants, that
killed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Other parties that could break the 5 percent hurdle are the
Union of Right-Wing Forces, ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky
's Zhirinovsky Bloc, and Our Home Is Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Duma elections are widely seen as a dress rehearsal for
next summer's presidential election, when Yeltsin will have to
stand down after two terms in office.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Putin, Primakov and Zhirinovsky have all announced
their plans to join the presidential race, scheduled for June next
year.
</P>
<P>
They will have to ponder their next moves after their
performances in the Sunday elections are out. While preliminary
results will be available at around 10:00 local time (0700 GMT)
Monday, the final figures will not be published until about 10
days later.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Set up Powerful Banking Watchdog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Banking Regulatory and
Supervision Board, a powerful watchdog agency, will be formed under
the amended Turkish banking legislation, which took effect Sunday.
</P>
<P>
President Suleyman Demirel endorsed the legislation Sunday
following the parliament's approval on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The board will start operation by August 31, 2000 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News reported that the new legislation empowers
the regulatory board to impose recovery plan for troubled banks, or
suspend or take over them.
</P>
<P>
Islamic banks must be switched into conventional banking or
liquidate in two years, and their deposits will not be covered
under state guarantee, the legislation said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's six Islamic banks currently do non-interest banking.
The amendments ban them from lending to any particular borrower
more than 75 percent of their total net assets as of December 31,
2000. That ratio will be gradually reduced to 25 percent at the end
of 2006.

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready to Accept Private and Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from the
Central Bank of Iran (CBI) on Sunday voiced the country's readiness
to accept applications by private and international banks
interested to begin activities in the Iranian free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
The CBI Director General in Charge of Supervision and Banking
Affairs Nasser Yousefi-kia told the Islamic Republic News Agency
that private and international banks can submit their applications
to the management authorities of the Iranian free trade zones,
which if approved, will then be sent to the CBI.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign and private banks' operations can be either
geared to foreign or Iranian currency rial and engaging in foreign
operations has to be compatible with existing international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Banks that are engaged in rial operations have to operate
without charging interest, he said, but these banks can handle all
the foreign exchange services including opening deposits, line of
credits and issuing foreign currency drafts.
</P>
<P>
"With restrictions imposed on banking system in Iran, many of
the banking services pertaining to import-exports are conducted in
neighboring countries," the official said, but with the initiation
of these activities in the free trade zones, many of operations can
be handled within the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with facilities in the free trade zones, Iranian
businessmen can have better access to the world markets and any
banking profits will also be incurred to the country.
</P>
<P>
Yousefi-kia said that legally, the banks active in the free
trade zones are considered as Iranian banks.
</P>
<P>
But as far as banking operations are concerned, they are
independent and in line with banking laws of the free trade zones
and they can conduct business with their inland counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He believed that foreign banks, due to their transfer of capital
into the free trade zones and their effect on domestic banking
system, will be dynamic.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of international bank branches in the
free trade zones, millions of dollars will be poured into the
zones, which facilitates Iran's banking system operations and will
be a catalyst in improving productivity in the banking system, he
said.

it is hard for him to say the exact timetable for the two sides to

the United States will be going into a period of presidential

<HEADLINE> Ivanov Rejects Plan for International Conference on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Sunday rejected a proposed plan to hold an international
conference on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
He said the idea, put forward by acting Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Chairman and Norwegian
Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, "is not likely to be viable or
feasible because it was conceived out of touch with reality."
</P>
<P>
"Why should a conference be held with leaders in the North
Caucasus, in particular those of Daghestan, Ingushetia and North
Ossetia, when all of them are members of the (Russian) Federation
Council and can discuss in that body any issues pertaining to the
situation in that region?" the Interfax news agency quoted Ivanov
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Federation Council is the upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
There has been mounting pressure from the West on Russia's
military campaign against rebels in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The offensives, now in the third month, were launched following
Chechen rebels' armed incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a
spate of terrorist bombings, also blamed on Chechen militants,
which killed more than 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian
cities.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has brushed aside Western criticism of the actions in
Chechnya, saying it is its internal affair.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is not the kind of country that can be addressed in the
language of ultimatums and threats," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"One can say confidently that as the anti-terrorist operation
in Chechnya is brought to completion and more efforts are made to
restore peaceful life in that republic, Russia may expect
opposition on the part of the West to give way to active
cooperation," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
According to General Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the General
Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, federal troops have nearly
assumed full control of the territory of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>

said Sunday, adding that federal forces are also pounding rebels
in the southern mountainous parts of Chechnya.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi said here Sunday that the return of Macao to China
is a great victory of China's "One Country, Two Systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks at a reception hosted by
the Chinese Embassy to Mozambique to celebrate the return of Macao
to China.
</P>
<P>
"One Country, Two Systems" policy was first successfully
applied in Hong Kong in 1997 and it will certainly be applicable
for Taiwan, Mocumbi noted.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Mozambican government, the prime minister came
to the Chinese embassy to watch the live broadcast of Macao
handover ceremony. Mocumbi said that he was as happy as the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
From December 20, China officially resumes the excercise of
sovereignty of Macao after more than 150 years of the Portuguese
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said that China and Portugal have set up a good example
for the world by resolving the issue of Macao through
negotiations. And he hoped that the friendship and cooperation
between the governments and peoples of the two countries will be
further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Chinese Ambassador to Maputo Shao Guanfu
said the the return of Macao to the motherland is another step
forward towards the full reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 people including Mozambican officials, diplomats and
representatives of the Chinese living in the southern African
country, attended the celebration.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Legislative Council Passes Reunification Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The First Legislative Council of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) held its first
plenary meeting here in the wee hours of December 20 and passed
the Macao Reunification Law right after the founding of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
This was the first law that the SAR Legislative Council has
passed. It guarantees a smooth operation of the Macao SAR
government since its establishment.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the legislature began at 3:15 this morning
in the new office building of the Legislative Council with
participation of its 23 members.
</P>
<P>
Susana Chou, president of the Legislative Council, presided
over the meeting. Prior to voting on the Macao Reunification Law,
14 legislators made short speeches and expressed confidence in the
future of Macao.
</P>
<P>
All the legislators then voted for the draft of the Macao
Reunification Law. Chou announced the law consisting of 17
articles and five appendices was passed.
</P>
<P>
The law makes clear the principles and specific measures in
adopting the former laws of the Macao SAR as well as rules in
interpreting legal terms and expressions. The law confirms the
continuity of public administration, human administration, public
behaviors, documents, and legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
It also recognizes the validity and effectiveness of all
actions performed by the SAR government and the chief executive,
and legislative council, the independent committee recommending
judges, and the chief procurator in accordance with the Basic Law
of the Macao SAR and other effective laws before December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, the SAR chief executive, will sign and order
to promulgate the law later today.
</P>
<P>
The SAR legislature had completed deliberations on the drafts
of 11 laws vital for the smooth operation of the Macao SAR, as
well as rules of debate for the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
According to the Macao Basic Law, the Macao SAR Legislative
Council is the law-making body of the Macao SAR, which enjoys a
high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The 23-member First Legislative Council of the Macao SAR was
formed at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
The first Legislative Council meeting was held immediately
after the establishment of the Macao SAR to avoid a "legal vacuum.

<HEADLINE> Russian Communists to Win Over 110 Seats in Duma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Communist Party,
leading in the Russia's parliamentary elections into the State
Duma, the lower house of the parliament, will win 68 seats by
party proportion and 43 seats in single-mandate constituencies,
said Russian Central Electoral Commission Chairman Alexander
Veshnyakov Monday.
</P>
<P>
With 82.31 percent of all ballots counted, the Communist Party
led by Gennady Zyuganov already won 24.38 percent of the votes for
party tickets at 1400 p.m. Moscow time (1100 a.m. GMT).
</P>
<P>
The pro-Kremlin Unity movement chaired by Sergey Shoigu
follows closely with 23.68 percent, while Fatherland-All Russia
led by ex-premier Yevgeny Primakov collected 12.08 percent and the
Union of Right-Wing Forces headed by former prime minister Sergey
Kirienko won 8.71 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Zhirinovsky Bloc mastered 6.15 percent of the ballots and
Yabloko bloc led by Grigory Yavlinsky wrapped up the party list
with 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
At least 3.36 percent of voters cast against all the parties.
</P>
<P>
The inter-regional Unity movement is expected to win 66 seats
in the voting for party lists and nearly 10 seats in single-seat
constituencies, and the Fatherland-All Russia bloc by early
accounts is poised to win 33 seats in the voting for party tickets
while 29 of its candidates are leading in single-seat
constituencies, Veshnyakov said.
</P>
<P>
The Union of Right Forces is likely to win 24 and five seats
respectively, and Yabloko -- 17 and five seats respectively, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Zhirinovsky Bloc will have 17 of its own candidates on the
federal list in the Duma. But unlike other parties that have
overcome the 5 percent barrier needed to be represented in
parliament, it does not lead in any single-seat constituency,
according to Veshnyakov.
</P>
<P>
He didn't expect the final results to be different by more
than a tenth of one percent from what he announced, added
Veshnyakov.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Urges Restoration of Arab Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh has said that Yemen supports all efforts aimed at restoring
Arab solidarity, which he described as a pressing national need in
confronting all challenges.
</P>
<P>
Yemen calls for the convention of an Arab summit to examine all
issues concerning the Arab world, to seek ways and means to
overcome differences and forge future common Arab action in
establishing sound inter-Arab relations, said Saleh.
</P>
<P>
Such inter-Arab ties should be based on mutual respect, non-
interference in the internal affairs of other countries,
cooperation, integration and the achievement of supreme Arab
interests, said the president in an interview with the Al Thawra
daily.
</P>
<P>
The convention of such an Arab summit constituted a pressing
necessity in dealing with present and future issues as the world
was at the threshold of a new century, the daily quoted Saleh as
saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world, he said, ought to be prepared for new challenges
and changes by realizing solidarity, consolidating common positions
and achieving integration in all fields, said the president.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the reports on Yemen's mediation between
rival Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Parliament Speaker
Hassan al-Turabi were absolutely unfounded.
</P>
<P>
No one, he said, has asked Yemen for such mediation. He
described the dissolution of the Sudanese parliament and the
imposition of a state of emergency in Sudan as Sudan's internal
affairs. He stressed that Yemen supports maintaining Sudan's unity,
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
On the resumption of the Syria-Israel talks and Yemen's stance
on the Middle East peace process, Saleh said Yemen supports the
ongoing efforts for achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the
region, based on the restoration of Arab legitimate rights and the
return of occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
He considered the talks between Syria and Israel which were held
in Washington on December 15 and 16 as a good move and a new
endeavour in peace-making.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yemen supports Syrians in their efforts to regain
their rights and lands in the Golan Heights which was captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the United States and the international community
to exercise further pressure on Israel to ensure that the
resumption of the Israel-Syrian talks would not harm negotiations
on other tracks.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The suicidal bombing at the
ruling People's Alliance (PA)'s last election rally on Saturday
night only added another smear of blood to President Chandrika
Kumaratunga's reelection campaign for the December 21 voting.
</P>
<P>
The bomb explosion, which killed 21 people and wounded 84
others including the president herself, was believed to be the
extension of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamils Eelam's (
LTTE) bloody counter-offensive to retrieve its lost ground in the
north.
</P>
<P>
Under the aegis of seeking a fresh mandate to resolve the 16-
year-old ethnic conflicts, President Kumaratunga called the
election to be held about a year ahead of the previously scheduled
November next year.
</P>
<P>
It is blood and flesh on the battlefield that mark Kumaratunga'
s reelection campaign from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
A string of military defeats in the northern Wanni region early
last month stripped the government of a vast area which had taken
the army more than two years to capture, weakening Kumaratunga's
chance of winning the election.
</P>
<P>
Blood and violence are not unfamiliar with Mrs. Kumaratunga
whose father and husband were all assassinated by political rivals.
</P>
<P>
Chandrika Kumaratunga, 54-year-old, came from a prominent
political family and married the film star-turned-politician
Vijaya Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
Her father S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, founder of Sri Lanka Freedom
Party (SLFP), took office as the prime minister in 1956 but was
assassinated by a Buddhist monk on September 26, 1959.
</P>
<P>
Then her mother, Sirimavo Bandaranaike took over the post and
became the world's first woman prime minister in July 1960. Mrs.
Bandaranaike served as prime minister for the 1960-1965 and 1970-
1977 terms. She is now serving her third term in her daughter's
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga's husband was also shot dead by a leftist rebel on
February 16, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Kumaratunga then fled the country with her two children,
Yasodara and Vimukthi to London, serving as a research fellow with
the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, she returned home and became the chief organizer of
the SLFP for the Attanagalla Electorate.
</P>
<P>
Following the formation of the People's Alliance coalition
centered around the SLFP, Kumaratunga flexed her political muscles
by being elected as the chief minister in the crucial Western
Provincial Council in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
Riding on the victory, she led the People's Alliance to victory
in the parliamentary election in August 1994 and later succeeded
in becoming Sri Lanka's first woman president in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
A few months after Kumaratunga's victory in the 1994
presidential election, peace talks between the government and the
LTTE collapsed and hostilities resumed.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Mrs. Kumaratunga followed a war-for-peace solution
to the ethnic problem. While the government troops were
successfully pushing the LTTE out of their traditional bastion of
the northern Jaffna peninsula by 1996, she initiated a devolution
package to give more power to the regions including one dominated
by ethnic Tamils.
</P>
<P>
However, both measures have failed to produce much success.
Besides the recent military defeats, her devolution plan has so
far failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament
due to the opposition of UNP.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Holds Celebration Rally for Macao's Return (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital's
celebration rally for Macao's return was held here this evening at
Capital Stadium, highlighted by an important speech from President
Jiang Zemin to mark the historic occasion.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the audience of more than 10,000 that "the return of
Macao opens up a new era in the history of Macao. From today on,
our compatriots in Macao will truly become the masters of that
land."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the ever-thriving modernization drive on the
mainland is bound to continuously inject new vitality into Macao's
development. And the people on the mainland will forever be the
strong backing behind the Macao compatriots on their way."
</P>
<P>
The stadium was festively adorned for the evening, with nine
huge red lanterns hung over the VIP seats, in front of which 1,999
bouquets of China roses dotted a big board carrying the logo of
Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
On either side of the rostrum were two slogans, one reading "
Macao's tomorrow will be better," and the other, "the motherland's
tomorrow will be better."
</P>
<P>
Six huge Chinese characters, written by President Jiang, which
represented the theme of the gathering -- "Celebrating Macao's
Return," were seen against the backdrop, which featured impressive
designs. One of them was a 1,200-square-meter Chinese painting
named after Mao Zedong's famous verse "Our Motherland So Rich in
Beauty."
</P>
<P>
The curtain was raised at 7:35 p.m. as a chorus of 1,600
singers kicked off the elaborate event, jointly sponsored by the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, the National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, the State Council, the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee and the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing, Li
Lanqing and other senior Party and government leaders were in
attendance.

<P>
Beijing Mayor Liu Qi formally opened the rally at 8 p.m. Then
the national flag was hoisted in the stadium as the audience rose
and sang the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang said Macao's return "is another great
event for the Chinese nation following the return of Hong Kong and
another important milestone in our march toward national
reunification."
</P>
<P>
"Today, Macao has victoriously returned to China, as new China
is confidently marching towards prosperity and strength. This
historic change fully testifies to the great strength of present-
day China and its people," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that the great concept of "one country, two
systems" proposed by late Deng Xiaoping is the sole correct
guideline for resolving the Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan issues,
and hence for achieving the complete reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
The president pledged that the central government will
unswervingly implement the policies of "one country, two systems,"
"the Macao people administering Macao" and a high degree of
autonomy for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), which
was established at the wee hours today.
</P>
<P>
"The Macao SAR will retain its current social system, economic
structure, way of life and the bulk of its existing laws," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the central government "will firmly support the Chief
Executive and the Government of the Macao Special Administrative
Region in their efforts to administer Macao according to law. And
we will do all we can to fully protect the rights and freedoms of
the Macao residents bestowed on them by the Basic Law. The
interests of foreign investors in Macao will be lawfully protected.
"
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that compatriots and other people from
various circles in Macao will, with their talents and wisdom, be
able to create an even better future for Macao," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, all patriotic compatriots at home
and abroad and all far-sighted people in the world have seen, from
the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao, that the "one country,
two systems" policy is most appropriate and correct and is the
best approach for solving the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
To achieve complete national reunification in accordance with
the "one China" principle is the shared aspiration of all the
Chinese people including the Taiwan compatriots, and an inevitable
historical trend which no force on earth can ever resist, he
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the hope that "the Taiwan authorities will not
go against the tide of history, erect obstacles to the development
of the cross-Straits ties or act against the fundamental interests
of the Taiwan compatriots and the entire Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people will not tolerate any
attempt to split China," Jiang warned.

in the performance, which expressed the Chinese people's rejoicing
for the return of Macao and moved many viewers to tears.
</P>
<P>
The rally ended with a rendition of the song "Singing in Praise
of the Motherland" performed by singers in traditional costumes of
China's 56 ethnic groups. Meanwhile China's national emblem and

<HEADLINE> Profiles of Major Candidates for Sri Lankan Presidential Election (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan main opposition
United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremesinghe believed
that patient negotiation is the only assured way to end the 16-
year ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe, chief rival of President Chandrika Kumaratunga
for the December 21 presidential election, said once elected he
would open talks with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) and establish an interim council in the Tamil-
dominated northeast in opposition to Kumaratunga's devolution
package to solve the ethnic problem.
</P>
<P>
He planned to create a conducive atmosphere by sending food and
medicine to regions held by the LTTE, lift military restrictions
on fishing and farming and stop the harassment of Tamil civilians.
</P>
<P>
When the election was first called about a year ahead of
schedule, Wickremesinghe was perceived as having little chance of
winning, but now he was gaining his winning margin.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe, 50, has promised not only to bring peace to the
war-torn island country, but also make it investment attractive.
</P>
<P>
Born to a well-known family of press barons, he started his
political career at an early age of 28 when he entered Parliament
in the 1977 general election and subsequently was appointed as
deputy minister of foreign affairs by his uncle, the first
executive president of Sri Lanka Junius R. Jayewardene.
</P>
<P>
In February 1989, Wickremesinghe was promoted by president
Ranasinghe Premadasa as leader of the House after serving as
minister of education, of industries and of youth respectively.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe reached his political climax in 1993 by being
appointed as the prime minister after the assassination of
president Premadasa.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen months later he lost the general election to
Kumaratunga's People's Alliance coalition in August, 1994. From
then on, he has been leader of the opposition in Parliament and
UNP leader, preparing his return to power.

Seven Canadian oilfield workers and one American were freed

<HEADLINE> Over 1 Million Israelis Below Poverty Line: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 1 million Israelis,
almost half of them children, were living beneath the poverty line
at the end of 1998, Israeli National Insurance Institute (NII)
revealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NII, Israel's official social security organization,
published its annual report on poverty Monday morning, a month
later than originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Responding to this report, governing Coalition whip Ophir Pines-
Paz said the deteriorating poverty situation is the evil
consequence of the former Netanyahu government's social policy.
</P>
<P>
He added that the current government is making efforts to change
the situation and the next report will be more positive.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on a survey of incomes by Israeli Central
Bureau of Statistics and unemployment payments by the NII, has
aroused special interest this year because conflicting figures have
been published over the last few months by different organizations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government welfare agencies revealed last month that one
in every four Israeli children is living below the poverty line, a
four-fold increase within 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Union of Local Authorities also published a report
last month, which said that some 135,000 Israelis are suffering
from hunger.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Banking
Council advised jittery customers on Monday not to withdraw
savings from their accounts over the coming New Year period as
there is no reason to fear the Year 2000 computer problem (Y2K).
</P>
<P>
The council said the fear about Y2K rather than the effects of
the millennium bug could cause a crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the Year 2000 rollover there would be no shortage of
cash as the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has put in place a
contingency plan that could triple the normal December demand for
notes and coins.
</P>
<P>
With the crime rate high in South Africa it would be safer for
consumers to leave their savings in banks, the council said.
</P>
<P>
South African banks would ensure that their auto-tellers were
properly serviced and stocked so that they don't run out of cash.
</P>
<P>
South African banks have been preparing for Y2K since 1996 and
have allocated large budgets to ensure they are Y2K ready, the
council said.

TEHRAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry

Damascus' stand on "the liberation of the entire Golan Heights,"
the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.

Meanwhile, the Iranian conservative daily Tehran Times on Monday

Damascus should keep in mind two important issues while

Arab lands including South Lebanon, the daily said.

Referring to the Palestinian issue, the spokesman said that

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan
al-Bashir has stressed his full support for the Egyptian-Libyan
initiative aimed at helping realize peace in his country, Egypt's
Al Ahram daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Arabic-language newspaper on Sunday in
the Sudanese capital Khartoum, al-Bashir said he endeavors to
implement the initiative but leader of the opposition Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA) was trying to impede it and hinder
reconciliation efforts.
</P>
<P>
He called on members of the Sudanese opposition parties to
return home to participate in a national political dialog to
formulate the future of the country.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed early this year a five-point peace plan
calling for permanent cease fire between the government and the
SPLA, and a peace conference to seek national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The government and the Muslim opposition parties have accepted
the proposal but the SPLA has expressed reservation over the plan.
The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for
southern states.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir also justified his decisions to dissolve the National
Assembly (parliament) and announce a three-month state of
emergency, accusing former Speaker of the parliament Hassan Abdulla
al Turabi of failing to take into consideration the critical
conditions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The dissolved parliament had been seeking to make constitutional
amendments aimed at stripping the president of powers to appoint
ministers and state governors
</P>
<P>
The decisions were also prompted by Sudan's internal problems,
including the civil war in the south, and the United States'
attitude which jeopardizes Sudan's integrity, he said, adding
Washington has appropriated 400 million U.S. dollars to back the
SPLA.
</P>
<P>
The steps were designed to beef up democracy, he said.

BAGHDAD, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's National Assembly

The U.N. Security Council last Friday adopted a new
comprehensive policy on Iraq with 11 votes for and four
abstentions. China, Russia, France and Malaysia abstained from
voting.
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls for the formation of a new arms control
body - the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission
(UNMOVIC) - in Iraq to replace UNSCOM (the U.N. Special Commission)
in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It also offers Iraq with ambiguous terms the chance to have the
crippling economic sanctions suspended if it cooperates with the
arms inspectors in all aspects and makes progress on key
disarmament tasks to be defined by the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"The new resolution unveils the U.S. and British control over
the Security Council," said the statement, confirming the
Assembly's firm stance in rejecting the resolution and calling for
an immediate lifting of the embargo and non-interference in Iraq's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating its support for Iraq's leadership, the
parliament said the resolution "does not meet Iraq's needs and
demands for lifting the embargo off its people especially after
Iraq has met all its commitments toward relevant U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The parliament called upon the Arab and world parliaments to
side with Iraq in calling for the removal of sanctions imposed
following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Return of Macao A Milestone in China's Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Monday welcomed the return of Macao to China, saying the event
marks a major milestone in China's ultimate reunification.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Xinhua, Yeltsin said Macao, now a
special administrative region of China, will usher in a new epoch
of progress, as has been demonstrated by the vigorous development
witnessed in Hong Kong after its return to China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed profound satisfaction with his recent visit
to Beijing and the second informal summit with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The summit represented a major step in deepening the
substantial cooperation between the two countries, he said, noting
the major development in bilateral relations, especially the final
solution to the delimitation of their common borders.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of both countries reiterated their resolve to work
together to establish a multi-polar world order and their
opposition to the imposition of a unipolar system on the
international community, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia and China should expand their cooperation to
ensure the world's strategic stability, an area where the two
countries share the same stand.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he and President Jiang both believe the role of
the United Nations and the U.N. Security Council should not be
weakened and that it is of paramount importance to prevent
attempts that defy the widely accepted norms of international law.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries would work together in the defense of
their common stand on pressing international problems and in
fighting international terrorism, separatism and other forms of
extremism.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin again stressed Moscow's appreciation of China's full
support for Russian actions in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
He said the outcome of the Beijing summit indicated that the
Russian-Chinese strategic partnership of equality and trust has
practically taken shape.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will visit Beijing in the
first half of the next year to discuss a wide range of issues in
bilateral economic cooperation with the Chinese side, Yeltsin said.

TIRANA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign Minister
Paskal Milo said Sunday that his country will stick to the "one
China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Milo, who just returned from a recent China trip with
President Rexhep Mejdani, told Xinhua that Taiwan was one of the
major issues they discussed with the Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said the Albanian side reiterated to China its stance of
recognizing only one China -- the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are some voices in support of Taiwan in
Albania, he stressed that they only reflect the opinion of a small
number of people, and never represent the position of the
government.
</P>
<P>
He added Tirana would follow its traditional stance and make no
change to its policy.
</P>
<P>
During his very successful and fruitful trip, he said, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, Li Peng, and Premier Zhu Rongji made
clear China's willingness to develop Sino-Albanian relations on
the basis of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The foundation for bilateral relations was further consolidated
by the visit and cooperation in various fields, especially in
economy, will be further enhanced, said the foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's First Deep Water Oil Field to Yield in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to join the league of
deep offshore oil producers in the world when the nation's first
deep water oil field begins production in the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The project of "Bonga" oil field is being executed by Shell
Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO) at a cost of
2.7 billion U.S. dollars, The Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
SNEPCO said that the "Bonga" oil field is located 120
kilometers off the coast of the oil-producing Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
The oil field which has a reserve of 600 million barrels will
produce some 200,000 barrels of crude oil and 150 million standard
cubic feet of natural gas per day, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
Managing director of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group Phil Watts was
quoted as saying that the project would help to establish Nigeria
as a major player in the global energy sector.
</P>
<P>
"It shows our commitment to Nigeria as one of the world's key
energy producing countries," he said, adding that the new
production would be of great benefit to Shell, its partners and
the people of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Macao Chief Executive Meets Press on 1st Day of Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Edmund Ho Hau Wah, who was sworn
in as the first Chief Executive of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR) early this morning, held a press
conference today, expressing his views on a number of key issues.
</P>
<P>
On the People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrison troops who
arrived here today, Ho said, "It is normal for the Macao residents
to welcome the stationing of garrison troops in Macao." He added
that "psychologically, they feel the stationing of troops can
improve local public security."
</P>
<P>
"We encourage people to think so," he said. "But the troops
will not interfere in the local affairs of the Macao SAR and will
only help the Macao SAR government maintain public order and
combat disasters when they are requested by the MSAR government to
do so."  .
</P>
<P>
"The MSAR government will strictly abide by the MSAR Basic Law,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
The MSAR government will strengthen its consultation channels
and keep close contacts with the media so that they can fully play
their role as a bridge linking the government and the communities,
Ho said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed thanks to the media present at the press
conference. The transfer of power of Macao from Portugal to China
at Sunday midnight drew some 3,500 journalists.
</P>
<P>
"We shall implement the principle of 'one country, two systems',
'Macao people running Macao' and a high degree of autonomy in
Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We've already drawn up effective plans to deal with public
security problems in Macao," he said. "I believe public security
in Macao will improve very soon."
</P>
<P>
The MSAR chief executive also pledged to increase financing for
combating crime.
</P>
<P>
He said he planned to visit Portugal in May next year. The
visit will be arranged through proper channels, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that there has not been any government decision on
extending the monopoly contracts of the gaming industry in Macao.
</P>
<P>
He said within the next two to three months, the SAR government
will set up an independent panel with international expertise to
study the existing problems and the future development of the
gaming industry in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will make relevant policies based on results
of the study by the independent panel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from monopoly contracts of the gaming industry
accounted for over 40 percent of the total revenues of the
Portuguese Macao government before Macao's return to China.
</P>
<P>
He said exchanges and cooperation between Macao and Taiwan in
tourism, trade and culture will have positive influence on the
political relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question at a press conference concerning the
exchanges between Macao and Taiwan in the future, Ho said such
exchanges will be conducted mainly in the sectors of tourism,
trade and culture, and the MSAR encourages exchanges in these
fields.
</P>
<P>
He said exchanges between Macao and Taiwan so far are mainly in
immigration affairs and are handled by their immigration offices.

<HEADLINE> Approver Says Sharif Ordered No Landing of Musharraf Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former director general of Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority
Aminullah Chaudhry, in his sealed statement presented and opened
Monday before an anti-terrorism court in Karachi, said Sharif
first asked for the flight schedule on October 12.
</P>
<P>
"He came on the line and asked me if I was aware of the flight
details of the return of Chief of the Army Staff General Pervaiz
Musharraf," said Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
"He asked me to ascertain them and ordered that under no
circumstances the flight should be allowed to land anywhere in
Pakistan," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif has been facing charges of attempted murder and
hijacking connecting with the alleged attempt to divert the
Pakistan International Airline plane, which was carrying General
Musharraf back from Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry was first charged together with the deposed prime
minister and others but then became approver after he, according
to the court, confessed the crimes of Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry said in his statement that after receiving orders from
Sharif he soon ordered closure of the Karachi airport.
</P>
<P>
"At 18:20 hours (approximately) I was again informed by my
staff that prime minister Mian Nawaz Sharif wishes to speak to me.
The line operator from the Prime Minister's House again connected
me to the prime minister who inquired about the details of the
flight. I told him that it was PK-805 scheduled to reach Karachi
at 18:55 hours."
</P>
<P>
"He repeated his earlier instructions very firmly that the
flight should not be allowed to land anywhere in Pakistan and
should be diverted to any place in the Middle East other than
Dubai. He ordered immediate implementation of his directive,"
Chaudhry said.
</P>
<P>
He said he then asked Yousaf Abbas, the chief operator office
of Karachi airport, not to disclose the reason for the closure of
the airport as the pilot may attempt to land somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with the prime minister's direction, Yousaf
Abbas was further directed to ask the flight PK-805 to proceed to
Abu Dhabi or Muscat," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The pilot was also to be told that ... they could go outside
Pakistan at their own risk as we could not tell him which place to
land in Pakistan," it said.
</P>
<P>
The real development on October 12 was that the plane managed
to land in Karachi with fuel for seven minutes' flight left after
the army took control of the airport and General Musharraf then
dashed to the capital of Islamabad, where Sharif had been under
house arrest by the army, and announced the dismissal of the
government.
</P>
<P>
An army officer in Karachi last month raised the charges
against Sharif and his close allies and sent the deposed prime
minister onto the court. However, Sharif has denied the charge,
saying they were fabricated against him.

<HEADLINE> NPC Decides on Additional Laws to Be Implemented in Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature
decided today to add two more national laws and a legal
explanation to those applying to the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
At its ongoing 13th session here, the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) approved a decision adding
additional national laws to the Third Annex of the Basic Law of
the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that excepting those listed in the
Third Annex, the national laws are not to be applied in the Macao
SAR.
</P>
<P>
However, it provides that the NPC Standing Committee may add or
remove laws that are listed in the Annex after consulting its
Macao SAR Basic Law Committee and the government of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Third Annex of the Basic Law, which was approved in 1993,
now contains a total of eight national laws ranging from national
defense to foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, the NPC Standing Committee approved a law on
China's special economic zones and continental shelf, and in June
1999, the Macao SAR Garrison Law was approved.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee for the Macao SAR has suggested to
the NPC Standing Committee that the two laws should be
incorporated into the Third Annex.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the explanation of the implementation of the
Chinese Nationality Law in Macao, which was approved by the NPC
Standing Committee in December 1998, constitutes part of the
Nationality Law, and should be implemented along with the law, the
NPC decided.

<HEADLINE> Parliamentary Group of Sudanese Ruling Party Contests                 President's Decrees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The parliamentary group of the
ruling National Congress Party has decided to file a case before
the Constitutional Tribunal to nullify the recent decrees of
President Omar al-Bashir to dissolve the National Assembly
(parliament) and impose a three-month state of emergency throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Sudanese daily "Alwan" quoted a statement by the group,
composed of legislators from the party, as saying that it does not
agree to the president's decisions.
</P>
<P>
The group, headed by sacked parliament speaker Hassan Abdulla al
Turabi, said the Constitution stipulated that the emergency decree
must be approved by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir is the chairman of the ruling National Congress Party
and al Turabi is the secretary general of the party.
</P>
<P>
The dissolved parliament had insisted on probing the
constitutional amendments aimed at stripping the president of the
powers to appoint ministers and state governors.

<HEADLINE> No Progress in Israeli-Palestinian Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiating teams held another session of final-status talks in the
West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday, but no progress has been
made.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Palestinian negotiating team Yasser Abed Rabbo
told reporters after the session that the settlement issue was the
main topic for the Monday session, but the two sides could not
reach an agreement on settlement expansions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rabbo urged the United States to intervene in order
to help move the final-status talks forward.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks have not proceeded smoothly since
November when Israel announced issuance of new tenders for building
new houses for settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side refused to discuss other issues than the
settlement, urging Israel to halt immediately the settlement
expansions in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who cancelled a planned
meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday in the West
Bank city of Jericho, said that he will hold talks with Arafat
later this week.
</P>
<P>
To move the final-status talks forward, Barak promised last
month to freeze the issuing of new tenders. But this is far from
satisfactory to the Palestinians since it does not halt settlement
constructions in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that some 5,000 homes for settlers are
under construction in the West Bank, and close to 3,000 more are
approved.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli peace group Peace Now gave higher numbers, claiming
that close to 7,000 units are currently under construction and 3,
000 to 4,000 more have been approved by Israel's Housing Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A Israeli government source said Sunday that Barak plans to move
toward the Palestinians on the issue of settlement constructions
and is willing to consider a total building freeze until the
framework agreement on final-status is reached in next February.
</P>
<P>
Barak is to discuss this issue with Arafat when the two meet
this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- All Chinese people are and will
be proud of today when the Chinese government resumed the exercise
of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR), Macao people have become masters of their own
destiny. For the Chinese people, it marks a big step forward in
their strife for the reunification of their country.
</P>
<P>
Recent history has brought much sorrow and humiliation to the
Chinese nation. Foreign countries, taking advantage of China's
weakness, grabbed pieces of Chinese territory. Many heroes tried
hard -- often at the cost of their lives -- to find a way to save
the country, but they failed.
</P>
<P>
History chose the Communist Party of China. After 28 years of
strenuous struggles, Mao Zedong proclaimed to the world in 1949
that the Chinese people had stood up. Now, 50 years later, Macao
has returned to its motherland two years after Hong Kong did.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the 20th century, the then Chinese
government negotiated many times with the British and the
Portuguese governments requesting to take back Hong Kong and Macao,
but was turned down every time.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping told
former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: "It must be made
clear that China will take back Hong Kong in 1997."
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Chinese people began to change with the
founding of New China. With the growth of China's national
strength and its rising international status, the Chinese
government put the questions of Hong Kong and Macao on its agenda
after the late 1970s. This coincided with the beginning of
economic reforms and opening to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is not a simple coincidence. Rather, it was a
historic choice made by the Chinese people who have regained
confidence and self-respect, toward the reunification of their
motherland. Soon after, the architect of China's opening and
reform, Deng Xiaoping, put forward the principle of "one country,
two systems" for settling the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
When Hong Kong returned to China in 1997, quite a few people
doubted whether the principle of "one country, two systems" could
be successfully implemented in Hong Kong. Now, two years later,
the success of the principles of "one country, two systems", "Hong
Kong people running Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy for
Hong Kong has fully verified its soundness, feasibility and
viability.

<P>
China's quest for reunification has won understanding from all
unbiased people in the world. Many political dignitaries from all
over the world attending Macao's handover ceremony highly
appreciate the flexible and pragmatic attitude that Chinese
leaders have taken in dealing with issues left over by history,
and their outstanding contribution to the international community.
</P>
<P>
They hold that China's policies for the settlement of the Hong
Kong and Macao questions have provided an excellent model for
other countries to peacefully resolve issues left over by history.
</P>
<P>
When the Chinese people cheer with smiles and applause, they
are not entirely free of concerns and worries. After the return of
Macao, people are turning their eyes beyond the Taiwan Strait --
where lies the final leg of China's reunification march.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have said on many occasions that settlement of
the question of Taiwan cannot be delayed indefinitely. Now comes
the turn of the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the principle of "one country, two systems" has taken
the fundamental interests of Taiwan compatriots into full
consideration, satisfying their wish for peace and maintenance of
the status quo. After the reunification, Taiwan can enjoy policies
that are even more flexible than those for Hong Kong and Macao.
Taiwan, for example, can keep its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui is going the other way. He has talked about "
special state-to-state relationship" between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait. The divergence between the two sides no longer
concerns social system or democracy but whether or not China
should be splitted. Naturally, Lee's splittist act has been firmly
opposed by the Chinese people.

<P>
It's clear that Hong Kong people are now masters of their own
destiny, fully enjoy democratic rights and care from their
motherland.
</P>
<P>
In addition, under the principles of "one country, two systems",
"Hong Kong people running Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy,
the HKSAR managed to minimize the adverse effect of the Asian
financial crisis and further reinforced its status as an
international financial center.
</P>
<P>
The two economic take-offs in the history of Macao were also
backed by the motherland. In the 16th and 17th centuries, as
China's only foreign trade port, Macao developed from a small
fishing village to the largest commercial center in the Far East.
In recent years Macao has been a bridge for the mainland of China
to communicate with the outside world, bringing Macao the second "
golden time" of economic development.
</P>
<P>
It is foreseeable that a reunited Chinese nation will be even
stronger, and will be able to vitalize Taiwan's economic
development, enabling Taiwan compatriots to enjoy the honor and
dignity of being citizens of a great nation.
</P>
<P>
The first rays of the new millennium are on the horizon, and
the Chinese nation is facing a good opportunity of reuniting the
country. President Jiang Zemin said at the grand gathering marking
the establishment of the Macao SAR: "The successful implementation
of the 'one country, two systems' principle in Hong Kong and Macao
will give a positive push to the early settlement of the Taiwan
question."
</P>
<P>
It's delightful to see that the viability of the principle of "
one country, two systems" has increasingly been recognized by
Taiwan compatriots. There is reason to believe that it won't be
long for China to achieve its reunification.

HONG KONG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's provisional
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for September-November 1999
was 6.1 percent and the provisional underemployment rate was 3
percent, according to the latest labor force statistics released
Monday by the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
For August-October 1999, the seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate was confirmed to be the same as the previously released
provisional figures of 6.2 percent while the underemployment rate
was revised upward to 3.2 percent from the provisional figure of 3.
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"For the seventh month in a row the Labor Department's job
placement figures have registered an increase," Philip Chok,
deputy secretary for education and manpower, said at a press
briefing Monday.
</P>
<P>
Comparing September-November 1999 with August-October 1999,
decreases in the unemployment rate were seen mainly in the hotels,
business services, communications and sanitary services sectors.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, increases were recorded in the decoration
and maintenance, retail trade and manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
As to the underemployment rate, decreases were registered in
the construction, retail trade, manufacturing and restaurants
sectors, more than offsetting the increase in the transport sector.
</P>
<P>
On the tourism front, total visitor arrivals for October
reached 999,000, a growth of 17.1 percent over last year. The
cumulative figure of 8.7 million visitors for the first 10 months

<HEADLINE> Syria Not to Represent Lebanon in Peace Talks: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa said Monday that his country will not represent Lebanon
to negotiate with Israel in the coming peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is an independent country and will represent itself in
the coming peace talks with Israel," al-Sharaa told reporters after
meeting with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa arrived here Monday morning to brief Lebanese
officials on the outcome of the first round talks between Syria and
Israel which were reopened last Wednesday in Washington, the United
States, after almost four years of suspension.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 35,000 troops stationed across Lebanon, is an
undisputed power broker in the country and has strong political
influence, especially in its foreign policy toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria is asking Israel to return its Golan Heights which was
captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war, while Lebanon
is seeking an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa expected the talks on Lebanese track to resume soon,
likely after the second round of the Syrian-Israeli talks which
will take place on January 3 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the fate of Lebanon's anti-Israel Hezbollah,
which was backed by Syria and Iran, the minister said it is an
internal affair of Lebanon and Syria will support Lebanese
government's decision on it.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been spearheading a guerrilla
war in the country trying to drive Israelis out of the country.

BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The experiences of Hong Kong

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Jiang's Speech at the Beijing Rally in Celebration of Macao's Return (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
the speech by Jiang Zemin, president of the People's Republic of
China, at the rally held this evening in Beijing in celebration of
Macao's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Comrades and Friends,
</P>
<P>
Today, with the hoisting of the awe-inspiring Five-Star Red
Flag and the Regional Flag of the Macao Special Administrative
Region in Macao, the Government of China has resumed the exercise
of sovereignty over Macao and the Macao Special Administrative
Region of the People's Republic of China is officially established.
This is another great event for the Chinese nation following the
return of Hong Kong and another important milestone in our march
towards the national reunification. The return of Macao is a
result of the protracted tenacious struggle and hard work, a glory
and pride of the socialist motherland and the entire Chinese
nation and also a great victory of the world cause for justice and
progress.
</P>
<P>
At this exciting moment, we can not but think of comrades Mao
Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and other proletariat revolutionaries of the
elder generation. It has also revived our profound memory of all
martyrs and other revolutionaries who had bravely devoted all
their lives to the emancipation of the nation, well-being of the
people and the reunification and prosperity of the motherland. We
will forever remember what they have done for the country and the
people.
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao opens up a new era in the history of Macao.
From today on, our compatriots in Macao will truly become the
masters of that land. The ever-thriving modernization drive on the
mainland is bound to inject new vitality into Macao's development
continuously. And the people on the mainland will forever be the
strong backing behind the Macao compatriots on their way.

<P>
Macao's separation from and reunion with the motherland
epitomize the modern history of the Chinese nation. In old days,
Macao gradually fell prey to Portuguese colonial rule against the
background of an old China entrenched in poverty and weakness and
bullied by imperialists. Today, Macao has victoriously returned to
China as new China is confidently marching towards prosperity and
strength. This historic change fully testifies to the great
strength of the present-day China and its people.
</P>
<P>
The great concept of "one country, two systems" proposed by
Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the sole correct guideline for solutions
to the questions of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and hence for
achieving the complete reunification of the motherland. The
successful implementation of the concept in Hong Kong has provided
valuable practical experience for Macao. The Central Government
will unswervingly implement the policies of "one country, two
systems", "the Macao people administering Macao" and a high degree
of autonomy. Macao SAR will retain its current social system,
economic structure, way of life and the bulk of its existing laws.
We will firmly support the Chief Executive and the Government of
the Macao Special Administrative Region in their efforts to
administer Macao according to law. And we will do all we can to
fully protect the rights and freedoms of the Macao residents
bestowed on them by the Basic Law. The interests of foreign
investors in Macao will be lawfully protected. We are confident
that compatriots and other people from various circles in Macao
will, with their talents and wisdom, be able to create an even
better future for Macao.

This particular moment reminds me of a famous poem by the Tang
Poet Wang Wei, the second half of which goes like this: "I know my
brothers would, with dogwood spray in hand, climb up the mountain
and miss me so far away". On this joyous occasion of celebrating
the return of Macao, a great event for the Chinese nation, I am
sure that our compatriots in Taiwan will share the joyful
sentiments of the people in the mainland, Hong Kong and Macao. All
patriotic compatriots at home and abroad and all far-sighted
people in the world have seen, from the smooth return of Hong Kong
and Macao, that the "one country, two systems" policy is most
appropriate and correct and is the best approach to solving the
Taiwan question. To achieve a complete national reunification in
accordance with the "one China" principle is the shared aspiration
of all the Chinese people including the Taiwan compatriots, and an
inevitable historical trend which no force on earth can ever
resist. It is our hope that the Taiwan authorities will not go
against the tide of history, erect obstacles to the development of
the cross-Straits ties or act against the fundamental interests of
the Taiwan compatriots and the entire Chinese nation. The Chinese
Government and people will never tolerate any attempt to split
China. We have both the determination and the ability to resolve
the Taiwan question at an early date and accomplish the great
cause of reunifying our motherland in accordance with the
principles of "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two
systems".

<P>
MANILA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Rebel attacks in the
Philippines over the past 10 months have affected the life of more
than 300,000 civilians all over the country, Philippine News
Agency (PNA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted Army Chief Voltaire Gazmin as saying that
residents in Carmen, Mindanao, suffered the most when 300,000
civilians were forced to evacuate due to the attacks launched by
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Gazmin said rebel attacks "have only sowed fear and terror in
the lives of the citizenry and have slowed down the economic
growth and development of the countryside."
</P>
<P>
Gazmin challenged the NPA and MILF to give up the use of
violence as a means to further their atrocities.

Since new China emerged from the horizon in the East like a
rising sun, earthshaking changes have taken place against all the
vicissitudes. The Chinese people with their destiny in their own
hands have worked hard under the leadership of the Communist Party
of China, embarked on the broad road of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics and are building brilliant prospects for
an all-round rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
History tells us that in order to stand firm on our own among
all nations of the world, we Chinese nation must adopt a global
perspective, adhere to the principle of advancing with the times,
self-reliance and hard work, and brace up for progress and
prosperity, so as to constantly build on China's economic strength,
national defense and cohesiveness. In face of intense competition
in the contemporary world, there is either progress or retrogress.
We must assess the trends in the world and envisage the future of
our country with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng
Xiaoping Theory in particular, never deviate from the reality of
China, unswervingly keep to our own road and carry the socialist
reform and socialist modernization through to the end so as to
constantly open up new vistas for China's development and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The bell is ringing for the advent of the 21st century.
Political multipolarity and economic globalization are the two
major trends in the future world. We are faced with not only grim
challenges, but also rare development opportunities. Both
challenges and opportunities are testing our wits and strength.
The Chinese people of all ethnic groups should rally around the
Communist Party of China more closely and work in unison and in a
pioneering spirit so as to build China into a modern socialist
state with a high degree of prosperity, democracy and civilization
and to make new and greater contribution to the noble cause of
peace and progress for mankind!

<HEADLINE> Angola Protests at French Asylum to Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government
protested on Monday against the French government's intention to
offer asylum to the high-ranking Angolan rebel official Isaias
Samakuva.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government said in a statement that Samakuva has no
 qualifications to benefit from the status, because he is one of
the principal activists of rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"We protest because he bears a part in the nucleus (of the
UNITA leadership) which promotes the war in Angola," the official
news agency Angop quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Samakuva, ex-chief of the UNITA delegation in the joint
commission for peace process in Angola created by the Lusaka
Protocol, is now living in Lisbon and regarded as the UNITA
representative in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eugenio Manuvakola, head of the Renovated Commission
of UNITA consisting of former members of the rebel group, said
that if France grants Samakuva political asylum, it will violate
the sanctions imposed by the United Nations against the Angolan
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader also stressed the importance for the
French government to consider its economic interests in Angola and
keep cooperative and friendly relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> No Decision on Extending Gaming Monopoly Contracts: Ho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- There is still no government
decision on extending the monopoly contracts of the gaming
industry in Macao at present, the newly sworn-in chief executive
of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) told a press
conference here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a reporter on whether the Macao SAR government,
which was established early this morning, will extend the existing
monopoly contracts of the gaming industry beyond the year of 2001,
Ho Hau Wah said that the SAR government has not made any decision
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said within the next two to three months, the SAR government
will set up an independent panel with international expertise to
study the existing problems and the future development of the
gaming industry in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will make relevant policies based on results
of the study by the independent panel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from monopoly contracts of the gaming industry
accounted for over 40 percent of the total revenues of the
Portuguese Macao government before Macao's return to China at
midnight on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Paraders Hail Macao's Return to Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 Macao residents
launched the largest ever parade today in Macao to mark Macao's
return to the motherland at midnight Sunday .
</P>
<P>
The two-hour parade dubbed as "March towards Prosperous Future"
was sponsored by the Executive Committee of the Commission of
Various Sectors of Macao for Celebrating Macao's Return to the
Motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to express his or her best wishes for a bright
future of Macao through participating this parade," said Lau Sin
Peng, deputy director of the executive committee.
</P>
<P>
The paraders were organized into 21 formations and 26
performing squads, driving 24 colorful floats.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 percent of the paraders, Lau said, were local residents
with some at their 70s and the youngest being seven years old. The
rest were Macao-born Portuguese and foreigners. They included
housewives, teachers, workers, business people, monks, priests and
athletes.
</P>
<P>
Some of the paraders gave performances like dragon dances while
others beat gongs and drums amidst the strains of traditional
Chinese and Portuguese music pieces. And the onlookers on both
sides of the 1,999-meter long route designated for the parade
waved miniature Chinese national flags and the regional flags of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"The parade is a full display of pluralism in local culture,"
said Lau, adding that since ancient times, Macao has been a
meeting place for people with different backgrounds and different
cultures.
</P>
<P>
The parade has been a new proof to what the First Chief
Executive Edmund Ho Hau Wah of the Macao SAR said at an earlier
celebration meeting to mark the founding of the Macao SAR, "Macao
is home to citizens of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds
who have coexisted in harmony, and this every special feature will
continue into the new era."

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) troops to be stationed in the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) crossed the Gongbei Control Line, a
gateway linking Macao and the Chinese mainland, at noon today to
take up defense duties for the SAR.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in more than 100 years, the Chinese
government has thus sent its troops to Macao, shortly after it
resumed the exercise of sovereignty here.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Macao Garrison troops, numbering about 500, departed
from their Zhuhai base at 11:18 in the morning. The convoy was
made up of ten armored and 60 other vehicles carrying troops and
military equipment. People in Zhuhai saw them off with flowers and
the beating of drums and gongs.
</P>
<P>
Led by an advance car and a car flying the PLA military ensign,
the headquarters staff and armored and motorized infantry units
first marched into the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
When the advance car crossed the Gongbei Control Line at 12:00
sharp at noon, cheers went up from people on both sides of the
control line. The soldiers and officers, dressed in new uniforms,
saluted to the cheering people.
</P>
<P>
People in Macao lined the streets to welcome the incoming
troops.
</P>
<P>
"The hearts of the Macao people have been linked to their
motherland," said Ms Ho, deputy secretary general of the Macao
Federation of Neighborhood Committees.
</P>
<P>
"When Guangdong's Zhongshan County was liberated in 1949, many
Macao people of Zhongshan origin made a special trip home to greet
the PLA troops. Many of them take the greeting of the PLA twice as
their life's biggest glory," said Ho, who participated in
welcoming the PLA today.

<HEADLINE> American Express Bank Joins MBS Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- American Express Bank
announced here Monday that it would be securitizing a 630 million
HK dollar (80.8 million U.S. dollar) portfolio of prime-based
floating rate residential mortgage loans under the Hong Kong
Mortgage Corporation (HKMC)'s Mortgage-Backed Securitization (MBS)
program.
</P>
<P>
"American Express Bank is proud to be the first international
bank to participate in the program. The transaction supports the
efforts of American Express Bank to expand its consumer business,
especially mortgages, in Hong Kong," said Alan Tsang, general
manager of the personal financial services of the American Express
Bank, Hong Kong, at the signing ceremony on the program.
</P>
<P>
"The MBS issue concluded today with the American Express Bank
serves to further confirm the positive reception of our MBS
program by the banking community," said Peter Pang, chief
executive officer of the HKMC.
</P>
<P>
The HKMC intends to arrange regular MBS issues under the
program, which is important in building liquidity for the
secondary mortgage market, and plans to arrange MBS of 3 billion
to 4 billion HK dollars (385 to 513 million U.S. dollars) next
year, said Pang.
</P>
<P>
"Dao Heng Bank, the investor of our inaugural MBS issue, and
American Express Bank both intend to sell part of their MBS
portfolio to help create market liquidity for the two issues,"
Pang said.
</P>
<P>
Dao Heng Bank invested 1 billion HK dollars (128 million U.S.
dollars) in the MBS program.
</P>
<P>
The MBS program adopts a back-to-back structure, meaning that
after acquiring the mortgages from a bank, the HKMC will sell the
mortgages pool to a "bankruptcy remote" Special Purpose Company
which will issue MBS back to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The MBS program allows banks to keep a substantial portion of
the cash flow from mortgages while reducing the credit risk and
capital cost and substantially improving the quality of their
mortgage assets, said Pang.

MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief
executive of the newly-established Macao Special Administrative
Region (MSAR), said here today that the MSAR government will turn
to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrison troops only when
problems arise which go beyond his government's handling ability.
</P>

"We will abide by the MSAR Basic Law, and request the central

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Hail Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- All the major newspapers in
Hong Kong on Monday carried front-page stories hailing Macao's
return to China.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong-based Chinese newspaper Wen Wei Po devoted
several pages to covering the handover ceremony in Macao and
speeches made by Chinese and Portuguese leaders.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also carried an editorial describing Macao's
return as "another brilliant milestone in the reunification
process of China." It said the return of Macao demonstrates the
great vitality of China's "one country, two systems" concept.
</P>
<P>
South China Morning Post, one of the major English newspapers
in Hong Kong, said in its front-page story that China's resumption
of the exercise of sovereignty over Macao is a "significant step
toward the early completion of reunification" of China and is "
crucial to the settlement of the Taiwan question."
</P>
<P>
Another English newspaper, Hong Kong Standard, devoted eight
full pages to reporting in detail the handover ceremony and the
arrival of the People's Liberation Army in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Premier Rejects Talks With Pak Military Ruler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Deposed Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif Monday ruled out any possibility of holding
talks with the military government led by General Pervaiz
Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
"Only after withdrawing the hijacking case and restoration of
my government we can hold talks with General Musharraf," leaders
of Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (PML) quoted the former prime
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some senior PML leaders met Sharif at the premises of an anti-
terrorism court in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deposed prime minister directed the party leaders not to
hold talks with the military government. "He said there was no
need to hold talks with the military government and said he was
still the elected prime minister," Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, one of the
PML leaders, said.
</P>
<P>
The idea of holding talks with the military government was
discussed recently at a top-level meeting of the party. Some
leaders were strongly in favor of holding talks with the Musharraf
administration, well-placed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The former ruling party headed by Sharif has said repeatedly
that it does not want confrontation with the military government
after the ouster of Sharif's civilian government on October 12 by
General Musharraf in a bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who is facing hijacking charges before the anti-
terrorism court, Monday challenged the power of the court, saying
it had no jurisdiction to hear the case against him.
</P>
<P>
The former leader of Pakistan and other six co-accused have
been accused of treason, hijacking, attempted murder, criminal
conspiracy and common intent.

<HEADLINE> Casino's First Day after Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Gamblers continued betting on
their fortunes in Macao's ten casinos on the first day following
the transfer of power in Macao, from Portugal to China, at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
At five a.m., clients packed the smoky, dim Casino Lisboa, the
largest gambling venue here.
</P>
<P>
With wall-to-wall carpeted floors, the birdcage-shaped Casino
Lisboa provides gamblers from all over the world with wild
excitement.
</P>
<P>
Half the tables on the ground hall were occupied by gamblers
playing fantan, a Chinese game.
</P>
<P>
Pawnshops surrounding the casino are open round the clock.
</P>
<P>
At ten a.m., more people came into the 11-story building,
which also houses a hotel, with a history of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
People were busy playing hundreds of slot machines in the
casino's arcade.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the ground hall and the arcade, VIP rooms
upstairs were fairly quiet, with men and women in expensive
designer clothes, stacks of chips in front of them, betting big
sums of money.
</P>
<P>
"It's just an ordinary day for the casino," said Ambrose So, a
senior manager with Macao Tourism and Entertainment Company which
has monopolized the local gambling industry for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
No change has occurred in Lisboa, including notices stuck onto
the wall outlawing picture taking and interviewing.
</P>
<P>
To celebrate Macao's return to its motherland, Lisboa made a
float with four giant dices that appeared in the streets around
noon today.
</P>
<P>
At three p.m., young people gathered in Macao's second largest
casino Pelota Basca to bet on soccer games.
</P>
<P>
A local television station broadcast routine greyhound races
in Canidrome.
</P>
<P>
"In the predictable future, gambling will still be a pillar
industry and part of people's life here," So said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chinese government bans gambling on the mainland,
casinos in Macao, a special administrative region of the People's
Republic, constitute a big industry here, providing 40 percent of
revenues to the local government.
</P>
<P>
Among the three most famous gambling places in the world,
Macao attracts eight million global tourists every year, 20 times
its population.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has said that people in Hong Kong and
Macao may keep their lifestyle for 50 years after their return to
China.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The son of Nigerian late
military dictator Sani Abacha has applied for a transfer of his
murder case from Lagos to either Kano or Abuja in the north of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Abacha cited hostility from local residents and
unwillingness of his witness to appear in Lagos or any part of the
southwest as reasons for making the request on Sunday, according
to the Guardian newspaper on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, 29, and four former officers including Sani Abacha's
security chief Hamza al-Mustapha were accused of murdering late
opposition politician Moshood Abiola's wife and standing trial at
a court in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Abiola's wife was shot dead on a Lagos street in June 1996,
three years after her husband was jailed by Abacha for declaring
himself president on the basis of an annulled general election he
was expected to win.
</P>
<P>
Abiola died in prison from a heart attack shortly after
Abacha's death in 1998, which paved the way for the end of 15
years of military rule in Africa's most populous nation.

<HEADLINE> OECD Urges "Sustainable Development" for Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) has called on Turkey to pay
attention to its environment situation so as to ensure "sustainable
development," Turkish Daily News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
An OECD report said that Turkey has made progress in a variety
of fields in the 1990s -- including energy, tourism,
industrialization and transportation, but it needs to maintain
sustainable development that goes hand in hand with social and
environmental progress.
</P>
<P>
The OECD asked Turkey to focus on the control of pollution, the
coordination of economic and tourism policies with its
environmental policy, and the cooperation with international
institutions over environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
It said that Turkey has come closer to reaching European Union
standards but still needs to improve its institutional, investment,
information and economic analysis capabilities in order to achieve
more effective environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
The OECD urged Turkey to implement more deterring punishments to
prevent the violation of environmental codes.

<HEADLINE> WWF Praises China for Success in Protecting Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and
conservation organizations had achieved significant success in
protecting giant pandas, said the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Fears that the panda would not survive long into the new
millennium are disappearing," said the international conservation
organization in a press release. "WWF is confident that the panda
can survive in the wild."
</P>
<P>
Until recently, one of the major threats to the survival of the
panda was the destruction of its forest habitat. A logging ban put
in place last year by the Chinese government has now greatly
reduced the greatest threat to the panda's survival.
</P>
<P>
"This policy had a very positive impact on panda conservation,"
said DR Lu Zhi, Program Officer at WWF's China office. "So there
is good enough reason to say that in the next century if we leave
them alone, if we leave them enough habitat, the species should
survive."
</P>
<P>
In another positive development for the long-term survival of
the panda, WWF said, the Chinese government is working to create "
green corridors" that will link the currently separate panda
habitats.
</P>
<P>
Pandas eat between 15 and 38 kilograms of bamboo per day. In
order to survive they need constant access to good feeding areas.
Fragmentation of panda habitats due to road-building, logging and
expansion of agriculture has prevented pandas from migrating to
new areas with plenty bamboos.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce threats to the Giant Panda even further, WWF
is working with the staff of panda reserves to increase the
effectiveness of anti-poaching patrols and reserve management, WWF
said.
</P>
<P>
It is also working with the local government to ensure that
local people affected by the logging ban have alternative sources
of income so that they do not resort to poaching or illegal
logging.

LONDON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia's fledgling Unity party was on the brink of a
political coup Sunday night as early results in the country's
third parliamentary election of the decade showed it is beating
the Communists in some Far Eastern regions and decisively
defeating the Fatherland-All Russia bloc that was set up as a
direct challenge to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Commission will this week say there is no
evidence to support allegations that the global foreign exchange
industry is in danger of turning into a cartel. But critics say
Brussels misunderstands the nature of the forex markets.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Desmond Llewelyn, 85, the actor who played the gadget-
obsessed Q in 17 Bond films, died Sunday after head-on car crash.
He was returning from a book signing near his home when his car
was involved in the collision.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Unofficial exit polls in Sunday's elections suggested
Russians were giving a powerful vote of confidence to the Prime
Minister, Vladimir Putin, and his policy of punishing Chechenya.
Putin's hopes of succeeding Boris Yeltsin as president next June
have been significantly strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Internet is rapidly becoming a mass medium in Britain,
with more than one in three adults enjoying on-line access either

<HEADLINE> American Express Bank Joins MBS Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- American Express Bank
announced here Monday that it would be securitizing a 630 million
HK dollar (80.8 million U.S. dollar) portfolio of prime-based
floating rate residential mortgage loans under the Hong Kong
Mortgage Corporation (HKMC)'s Mortgage-Backed Securitization (MBS)
program.
</P>
<P>
"American Express Bank is proud to be the first international
bank to participate in the program. The transaction supports the
efforts of American Express Bank to expand its consumer business,
especially mortgages, in Hong Kong," said Alan Tsang, general
manager of the personal financial services of the American Express
Bank, Hong Kong, at the signing ceremony on the program.
</P>
<P>
"The MBS issue concluded today with the American Express Bank
serves to further confirm the positive reception of our MBS
program by the banking community," said Peter Pang, chief
executive officer of the HKMC.
</P>
<P>
The HKMC intends to arrange regular MBS issues under the
program, which is important in building liquidity for the
secondary mortgage market, and plans to arrange MBS of 3 billion
to 4 billion HK dollars (385 to 513 million U.S. dollars) next
year, said Pang.
</P>
<P>
"Dao Heng Bank, the investor of our inaugural MBS issue, and
American Express Bank both intend to sell part of their MBS
portfolio to help create market liquidity for the two issues,"
Pang said.
</P>
<P>
Dao Heng Bank invested 1 billion HK dollars (128 million U.S.
dollars) in the MBS program.
</P>
<P>
The MBS program adopts a back-to-back structure, meaning that
after acquiring the mortgages from a bank, the HKMC will sell the
mortgages pool to a "bankruptcy remote" Special Purpose Company
which will issue MBS back to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The MBS program allows banks to keep a substantial portion of
the cash flow from mortgages while reducing the credit risk and
capital cost and substantially improving the quality of their
mortgage assets, said Pang.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Urge Israel to Buy Airbus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- In a heated battle for the
Israeli air market, the leaders of four major European countries
have urged Israel to buy planes from the European aircraft
manufacturer Airbus, a local daily said Monday.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, German Chancellor Gerhard
Shroeder, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar have written to Prime Minister Ehud Barak
in an effort to persuade him that the Israeli national carrier, El
Al,should buy from Airbus, Haaretz reported.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders decided to get involved in the aircraft deal
after the United States warned Israel to steer clear of Airbus
planes and Rolls-Royce engines, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The row came after El Al decided in October to split an order
for new planes between the U.S. manufacturer Boeing and the
European Airbus Company.
</P>
<P>
This order would end Boeing's 38-year monopoly in the Israeli
air market.
</P>
<P>
During her visit to Israel two weeks ago, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright warned that a move away from purchases of
Boeing Co. aircraft by El Al could raise difficulties when Congress
looks at aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
On December 7, the day when Albright arrived in Israel for the
visit, El Al signed an agreement with Boeing Co. to buy three 777s
for approximately 400 million U.S. dollars, ensuring the order for
Boeing would go through.
</P>
<P>
And on December 6, Israeli Transportation Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai abruptly delayed a final decision on El Al's Airbus
order, saying he wanted to get a second opinion about whether El Al
can afford spending an estimated 460 million U.S. dollars for up to
four Airbus A330s.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said the letters from the four EU leaders were
gentle-worded, without applying any pressure or linking the deal to
future relations between Israel and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Israel has asked for a number of favors from Europe of late,
including Israeli membership of the EU and EU aid in any future
peace deal with Syria and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the four leaders are all involved in the Middle East
peace process.

PARIS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese corporation will make
a significant investment which will create 600 jobs in France's
eastern region of Alsace, said the Agence de Developpement

NAIROBI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
pledged to streamline cargo clearance at the Indian Ocean port
Mombasa in a bid to maintain its status as the most competitive
port in the east Africa.
</P>
<P>
Every effort was being made to ensure that clearance of transit
cargo through the port takes no more than two days, Kenyan
Minister for Information, Transport and Communications Musalia
Mudavadi was quoted as saying by The East African weekly paper.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi also appealed to Kenya Ports Authority and the Kenya
Revenue Authority to speed up their operating procedures.
</P>
<P>
Because of cumbersome documentation, low off-take due to
insufficient trains and other factors, cargo clearance at the port
could take over a week, said Mudavadi.
</P>
<P>
Mombasa port has been serving as a cargo transit point for
landlocked east and central African countries such as Uganda,
Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Go Slow on Farm Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
go slow on its farm liberalization program until the World Trade
Organization (WTO) has come up with clear-cut rules to protect
farmers in developing economies like the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Philippine News Agency quoted Agriculture Secretary Edgardo
Angara as saying on Monday that President Joseph Estrada approved
this proposal during a cabinet meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet approval of this plan came amid the apparent
refusal of certain developed economies to give up their
protectionist policies, in violation of free-trade rules.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that with the future of a new round of
negotiations still uncertain, the Philippines has to shift its
farm liberalization program to low gear.
</P>
<P>
Angara said the Philippines is a staunch advocate of better WTO
protection for producers in developing economies. The recent
collapse of the Seattle talks has "steeled the resolve of the
Estrada administration to fully protect our farmers and other
producers against unfair free-trade practices," he added.
</P>
<P>
With this position favoring local producers, policy-makers now
have to work out a fresh program that would focus more on safety
nets for vulnerable sectors like farmers and fisher folk while at
the same time making them highly competitive in the new global
free trade, Angara said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will also have to fine-tune its
negotiation strategy by advocating more aggressively for
safeguards against the apparent attempts by certain WTO member
economies to unduly protect their farmers and other producers with
subsidies, high tariffs and other measures that distort free trade.

of exercise of sovereignty over Macao is a "significant step
toward the early completion of reunification" of China and is "
crucial to the settlement of the Taiwan question."
</P>
<P>
Another English newspaper, Hong Kong Standard, devoted eight
full pages to reporting in detail the handover ceremony and the
arrival of the People's Liberation Army in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese newspaper Ta Kung Pao carried an editorial hailing
Macao's return and calling for joint efforts to create common
prosperity in the two special administrative regions.
</P>
<P>
The Sun, also a Chinese newspaper, covered the establishment of
the government of the Macao Special Administrative Region. It
described the handover ceremony as "a solemn moment of historic
significance."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Dailies Hail Macao's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Popular Iranian dailies on
Monday hailed the return of Macao to China from the Portuguese
colonial rule as "an end to the colonial era in Asia" and a model
for the reunification of Taiwan with China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
This important event which happened by the end of this century
marked the end of a historical era and the beginning of a new one,
the Persian-language daily Jomhuri Islami (Islamic Republic) said
in an analysis.
</P>
<P>
The return marked the withdrawal of the last European colonist
from Asia and the annihilation of the last footprint of old
colonialism in Asia, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The successful returns of Hong Kong and Macao to China under
the "one country, two systems" formula advocated by late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping indicated that China's mainland will be able
to reunify Taiwan under the same formula, it said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Chinese leaders will spare no efforts in
solving the Taiwan issue in the new century, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Tehran Times said in a report that
the return of Macao marked the passing of the colonial era in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The re-establishment of Chinese rule over the small peninsula
and two islands...means the grand 50-year Chinese plan of national
reunification is two-thirds complete," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the English-language Iran News published an
editorial, praising the Chinese successful "open-door" policy in
the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
After 20 years of open-door policy, China has made progress at a
rate never experienced before in the world history, the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
The desire of all countries to engage China is a sign of Chinese
power and prestige, it said, adding that China's success story
should be closely studied by all those who want to defend their
national interests while achieving economic progress.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Capital Market Y2K Ready for New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian capital
market including market institutions and intermediaries are all
ready to face the rollover to the year 2000, the Securities
Commission (SC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A test run was successfully carried out between the SC Y2K
Command Center (YCC) and SC's regulatees' response centers to
ensure effective and smooth communication between the SC and
constituents during the rollover period, it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The YCC, set up as a precautionary measure for effective event
management during the rollover period, will be fully operational
from December 30, 1999, to January 4, 2000, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The SC, which has prepared for the Y2K issue since 1997, said,
"Measures have already been taken to ensure that the SC, capital
market institutions are Y2K ready."
</P>
<P>
Apart from being Y2K ready, it said, market institutions like
the exchanges, clearing houses, central depository and issuing
houses have completed remediation and rigorous internal testing
and end-to-end industry testing and have in place contingency
plans.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the individual testing of each market
institution's system, several rounds of end-to-end industry tests
between the market institutions, member companies and service
providers have been carried out successfully, it said.
</P>
<P>
The market intermediaries namely stockbroking companies,
futures brokers, asset management companies and unit trust
management have also completed their Y2K programs.
</P>
<P>
The SC said the development of the Capital Market Y2K
Contingency Plan for the worst-possible situations demonstrated
the authorities' prudent planning although it did not expect any
major disruptions to occur.
</P>
<P>
However, as a precautionary measure, December 31, 1999, has
been declared a non-trading day and non-settlement day, in line
with Bank Negara (State Bank) Malaysia's decision and trading will
resume on January 3, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The commission admitted that there are a handful of companies
that are unlikely to complete Y2K remediation in time due to their

financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
"These companies have been placed under business restrictions
by the authorities. Y2K readiness would be one of several
conditions assessed before these restrictions are lifted," it said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Born With Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- "He is so lucky," murmured Wong
Pui Sim, mother of the newborn, upon receiving congratulations
from the midwife on her giving birth to a "Return Baby" at Kiang
Wu Hospital, in the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR), at
0:15 on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The baby boy weighs 3.49 kg and is 49 cm tall. He is the first
infant in the Macao SAR, arriving a quarter of an hour after Macao
returned to China.
</P>
<P>
The baby got his name Lei Ka Hei before its birth. "Ka" means
happiness and "Hei" stands for dawn. The two make "Happy Dawn",
symbolizing Macao after its return to China.
</P>
<P>
The baby was born six days earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he is in a hurry to come to the world with the birth of
the SAR," her mother joked. Regretfully, the father, a traffic
police officer, was not with his wife at the time.
</P>
<P>
"Take care of yourself. I'll come over to you right after my
duty hours," Lei Kee Lam, the husband, had told his anxious wife
on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
Both the mother and the baby have been in good condition.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the boy can do his part for the New Macao," says the
young mother amidst a bombardment of questions from reporters. "
He'd better become a doctor to help the needy."
</P>
<P>
Sun Yat-sen (1866-1925) might laugh from ear to ear, if he were
alive. This revolutionary forerunner who led the Chinese people in
overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, once practiced at Kiang Wu Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Trade Minister Confirms Secret Meeting With Syrian Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Minister of Industry
and Trade Ran Cohen confirmed that he had met with a prominent
Syrian businessman in an effort to establish economic ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But the name of the businessman and other details of the meeting
could not be released for publication, his ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reportedly took place in a hotel in New York, the
United States, following the conclusion of the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was pre-planned and took place prior to the
announcement on December 8 of the resumption of peace talks between
Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told the local daily Haaretz Monday that the meeting dealt
with only trade issues.
</P>
<P>
"This is an attempt to establish a network of initial contacts
between business people from Syria, Lebanon and other Arab
countries," Cohen said, adding the meeting between business people
of those countries was an important step in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the December 8 announcement, Cohen assigned Reuven
Horesh, director-general of his ministry, to head a team from the
ministry that would seek to include economic elements as an
integral part of the peace negotiations and explore economic
relations with Syria following a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Cohen noted that the team's conclusions would be presented to
the Israeli negotiating teams and Prime Minister Ehud Barak in less
than a month.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, the ministry has prepared a study
examining the economic potentials of relations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The main potential of economic links between Israel and Syria
are in the fields of infrastructure development, agriculture,
foodstuffs, textiles and tourism, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Syria is in dire need of industrial and agricultural
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Cocktail Party Held to Celebrate Birth of Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A grand cocktail party was held
here this afternoon to celebrate the return of Macao to China and
the establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR)
of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen spoke at the party and wished
the Macao SAR sustained development and long-term stability.
</P>
<P>
Another long-cherished wish of the Chinese people has come true
with the founding of the MSAR, Qian said. On the same day the MSAR
Basic Law has started to take effect in accordance with a decree
signed by President Jiang Zemin, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government is firmly determined to implement the
principles of "one country, two systems", "Macao people
administering Macao" and "a high degree of autonomy" for Macao, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The MSAR Basic Law will be implemented to the letter, he said.
</P>
<P>
Proposing a toast, Edmund Ho Hau Wah, the newly sworn-in Chief
Executive of the MSAR, said that the return of Macao opened a new
chapter in China's history and is of great significance for the
final reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
The MSAR chief executive also expressed his confidence in the
prosperity and stability of Macao and in the prosperity of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 people attended the party.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Macao Welcomes PLA Troops (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) troops who have just come to station here in the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) received a rousing welcome
from some 30,000 Macao residents when they marched in Macao
streets on their way to their barracks.
</P>
<P>
The PLA troops entered Macao through the Gongbei control
checkpoint at 12:00 at noon today. Macao residents, who lined the
streets on the Macao side of the control line, beat drums and
gongs, set off firecrackers and waved national flags and Macao SAR
flags to greet the PLA soldiers and officers.
</P>
<P>
Although Macao has a population of only 430,000, some 30,000 of
them turned out to welcome the PLA Macao Garrison troops,
demonstrating their joy for Macao's return to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
Macao people have been well known for their great love for
their motherland.
</P>
<P>
"The hearts of the Macao people have always been linked to
their motherland," said Ms Ho, deputy secretary general of the
Macao Federation of Neighborhood Committees.
</P>
<P>
Ho, who participated in welcoming the PLA, said, "We're filled
with joy to see the troops of our own country stationing in Macao.
People can imagine what we felt like under the rule of foreigners.
"
</P>
<P>
The PLA is a symbol of state sovereignty. When they see the
garrison troops on Macao soil, the local people have truly felt
that they have come to the embrace of their motherland.
</P>
<P>
During the liberation of Zhongshan County of south China's
Guangdong Province half a century ago, many Macao residents of
Zhongshan origin made trips home to greet PLA soldiers. Some of
them, who are old now, turned out again to greet the PLA troops,
this time in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"In such an event which makes Macao people feel proud and
joyous, how can we keep away?" said a senior Macao citizen.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Macao Welcomes PLA Troops (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The successful implementation of the "one country, two systems"
principle in Hong Kong in the past two years and the model
behavior of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison there have greatly enhanced
the trust of Macao people in the PLA. This is another reason why
Macao people have so enthusiastically welcomed the PLA.
</P>
<P>
Many Macao people have learned about the moral hight standard
of PLA soldiers rescuing flood victims in the Yangtze valley last
year. They have also seen the strength and dicipline of the PLA
during the military parade past Tiananmen Square on National Day
this year.
</P>
<P>
Anticipation of social stability is another reason Macao people
have extended a warm welcome to the PLA troops.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Macao Garrison is responsible for the defense of the
region, but it will not interfere in any matter that the Macao SAR
shall administer on its own, according to the Garrison Law.
</P>
<P>
However, if there should be a serious security problem or
natural disaster, the PLA Macao Garrison can take action to
exercise such powers as are performed by relevant law enforcers
upon application by the Macao SAR government and approval by the
Central Government.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Garrison is not the police and its responsibilities do
not include the regular maintenance of public security in the
Macao SAR, but Macao people believe that the presence of the PLA
Garrison is a strong deterrent against local mobsters.
</P>
<P>
The temporary barracks of the PLA Macao Garrison is located at
a building in downtown Macao. A big number of Macao residents came
to the site when the PLA troops arrived.
</P>
<P>
Many people said that they are not worried at all about the so-
called "disturbance" by the garrison troops but that they have
been eager for the stationing of PLA troops in Macao for a long
time and believed that the PLA garrison would play an important
role in maintaining social order and stability in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Minister Warns Rising AIDS Infection Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The prevalence rate of HIV,
the virus leading to fatal AIDS, in some parts of Kenya may soon
reach 50 percent, Health Minister Sam Ongeri has warned.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard daily Monday quoted Ongeri as saying
that although the national infection rate is around 14 percent,
some districts like Kisumu in west Kenya are recording an average
of between 20 to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later these areas will be posting 50 percent HIV
prevalence unless people drastically change their behavior and
attitude toward the disease," he said last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was preparing to set up the National
AIDS Council, which would help curb the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The council will be charged with the responsibility of
monitoring the impact of the disease and formulation of effective
control measures, according to Ongeri.
</P>
<P>
Since the first case of AIDS was reported in 1984, the spread
of the disease has showed no signs of abating. The infection rate
shot up from three percent in 1990 to nine percent in 1997.

JERUSALEM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak plans to move toward the
Palestinians on the issue of settlement construction and is willing
to consider a total building freeze until the framework agreement
is reached in February, a government source said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A week and a half before the deadline for passing, Israel's
2000 budget has a shortfall of more than 1 billion shekels (245
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Yosef Kehati, who last month confessed to the murder of his

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Food Crisis Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Food crisis in Tanzania
is intensifying as the national grain stocks have been
progressively depleted and poor harvests are expected in the
coming season.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Tanzania says in its latest report that stocks at
Tanzania's Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) decreased from 122,027
tons recorded at the end of September this year to 107,665 tons in
October, a level representing 71.8 percent of the targeted amount
of 150,000 tons for 1999/2000.
</P>
<P>
Also, the failure of short rains experienced between October
and December this year is predicted to reduce next season's
harvests by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Short rains crop account for at least 25 percent or 400,000
tons of the country's total maize production.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of army-worms recorded in most regions with
Arusha, Morogoro and Kilimanjaro recording the worst cases, also
contributed to the worsening food situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
At least one million Tanzanians are faced with an acute food
shortage due to the prevailing dry spell in several regions of the
country.
</P>
<P>
With many parts of the country requiring emergency relief, the
revised national food supply figures indicate that an estimated
600,000 tons of food will be required to offset the acute deficit
this year through to mid next year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tanzania was forced to import over 550,000 tons of
grain to lessen the food crisis.
</P>
<P>
Following the severe food situation in the last consecutive
years, President Benjamin Mkapa has ordered regional commissioners
to improve the agriculture sector, saying his government was tired
of begging for food.

"We have a duty to prevent the break-down of morals. That is a
very serious offence," he said.

He said the action should serve as a warning to other cinema
operators who may also be showing dirty movies.

<HEADLINE> Gongbei Checkpoint Greets First Group of Macao Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- As the clock ticked off zero
hour today, Wong Chuopei, a 41-year-old driver in Macao, walked
through a customs passage bordering Macao and Zhuhai, becoming the
first Macao resident to enter China's interior area since the
Portuguese-ruled land returned to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"I used to travel to and fro between Macao and the interior
area of China through Gongbei checkpoint frequently. But I feel
quite excited today because Macao has returned to the embrace of
the motherland," said Wong beaming with smiles.
</P>
<P>
Throngs of Macao residents and inlanders gathered at the
Gongbei Customs House to exchange greetings, congratulations and
blessings for the return of Macao.
</P>
<P>
While shaking hands with a Macao resident, Gao Shisen, deputy
head of the checkpoint, said with a sense of pride: "We have
received tens of thousands of compatriots from Macao every day.
But starting today, we receive our dear ones when we greet."
</P>
<P>
Mr. Zhang, a 66-year-old Macao resident, said that though it's
only a few minutes' walk from the Gongbei Checkpoint of Zhuhai to
Barrier Gate of Macao, "people of Macao took more than 400 years
to complete the distance."
</P>
<P>
Macao has been part of the Chinese territory since ancient
times. More than 96 percent of the residents there are Chinese. In
the early 16th century, Portugal entered Macao and gradually
obtained the rule of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government resumed the exercise of its sovereignty
over Macao today. The Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
was founded early this morning and will manage the area in
accordance with the "one country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Chao Ling-chen, a Macao resident returning to the interior
area to visit her relatives, said, "People of Macao will always
remember the historical moment of the handover ceremony, which was
attended by President Jiang Zemin, other ranking Chinese officials
as well as guests all over the world. With the powerful support of
the Central Government, we are sure that Macao will become even
more prosperous after it returns to the motherland."
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao to China was described as another major
great event for the country after the return of Hong Kong in mid
1997. A great number of cities including Beijing, Tianjin,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing have held joyous and colorful
activities to celebrate this historic occasion.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai, which borders Macao, has turned itself a sea of
jubilant people today with fresh flowers, colored buntings and
banners, gorgeous lanterns and dazzling neon lights decorated
everywhere. In the small hours of this morning, outsiders to the
city has found themselves really hard to distinguish it from
illuminated Macao within close reach, which has been permeated
with festivity to mark its return.

ISLAMABAD, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Counsels of the deposed
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Monday challenged the power
of an anti-terrorism court in Karachi, saying it had no
jurisdiction to hear the case against the country's former leader.
</P>
<P>
Defense Counsel Manzoor Malik moved an application saying the
court had no power to hear the charges against Sharif and his co-
accused because they were not brought by a central or provincial

<P>
"The court has no jurisdiction to run this case. I am moving
this application," Malik told the court during the two-hour
hearing.
</P>

He argued that charges against Sharif had been leveled by
police, which he said cannot level treason charges.

<P>
The former prime minister, his brother Shahbaz Sharif and five
other senior officials of the deposed government have been in
detention since a military coup on October 12.

in northwest China, the country's largest cotton producer.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua was told that the local government has set price
guidelines for cotton purchases at 370 yuan per 50 kg this year.

According to a recent economic work conference in Xinjiang,
areas devoted to growing cotton will be cut by 93,000 hectares
down to 870,000 hectares next year to avert oversupply, and
cotton output will be maintained at or above 1.3 billion kg.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has signed contracts with southeast Asian countries,
Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States to export 350
million kg of cotton.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Mud Housing Complex Still in Use (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Nestled in southeast China's
mountainous area in Fujian Province, a multi-story mud housing
complex that has weathered over 600 years is still in use.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing County has the biggest concentration of such earthen
houses, with more than 20,000 of them occupied by locals. The
Tianluokeng buildings, seated on a mountainside 70 km from the
county's downtown center, is a typical example.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 people -- all surnamed Huang -- make up the 105
households in the village. The families live in five three-story
buildings grouped closely together. Each floor of the five
buildings is connected by a corridor.
</P>
<P>
Villager Huang Guolang has completed a genealogy of the Huang
clan which suggests that they are the offsprings of Huang Chao, a
peasant who rose up against the imperial rule of the Tang Dynasty
(618-907). The 56th grandson of the rebel moved his family to the
reclusive place during the Qing Dynasty when it was ruled by
Emperor Kangxi (17th Century).
</P>
<P>
The man said that they are the 23rd generation to live in the
mud village.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists who have inspected the site said that the
circular arrangement of the mud houses reflects the traditional
Chinese notion of harmony. The multiple floors were designed to
separate the living spaces from the household workshops.
</P>
<P>
The most intriguing feature of the architecture, however, is
that the mud is a blend of soil, sticky rice, brown sugar and lime,
and is as solid as rock.

The Huang families use the first floors as kitchens and utility
rooms, the second for storage and the third as bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
An inspection group composed of experts from the United States
and Australia said that they were deeply impressed with the unique
architecture.
</P>
<P>
After conducting an in-depth study of the building process,
building materials, design, geographical surroundings, engraved
designs on the wall, and fire- and water-proofing systems in the
structures, the group agreed that the complex is worthy of being
included on the World Heritage List of historical buildings.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Nanjing County said the application process for
the prestigious list is underway.

<HEADLINE> First Fiber-Optic Cable Starts Service in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The first fiber-optic cable
in Cambodia, which links the country to the Thai border, was put
into operation Friday,Monday's Cambodian Daily quoted officials of
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication as saying.
</P>
<P>
Telephone Organization of Thailand and Cambodia's counterpart
signed an agreement on the start of the operation, an alternative
to the previous satellite international connection.
</P>
<P>
The 608-kilometer-long cable, donated by Germany, costs about
10 million U.S. dollars. Inaugurated in June, it will provide the
foundation for the rapid expansion of telecommunications in the
country and cost less than the satellite operation.
</P>
<P>
It is the first fiber-optic cable built in Cambodia and also
the first step toward creating an information superhighway
connecting the six countries bordering the Mekong River -- China,
Vietnam,Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
At present, only about one out of 100 Cambodians has a
telephone. By 2003, Cambodia will see two of every 100 of its
people have a phone, according to Prime Minister Hun Sen earlier.

<HEADLINE> Companies in Singapore Offer Wide Range of Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Companies in Singapore are
offering a wide range of welfare benefits to attract, retain and
motivate employees to give off their best, said a paper published
Monday by the Singapore Ministry of Manpower.
</P>
<P>
The 12-page paper, entitled "Staff Leave and Welfare Benefits,"
said that apart from the stipulated provision of minimum
employment benefits, namely medical benefits, annual leave, sick
leave and overtime allowance, companies also offer a wide range of
welfare benefits covering marriage leave, paternity leave,
compassionate leave, club membership benefits, holiday and
incentive travel benefits, childcare benefits, stock options and
various loans and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The finding was based on the latest survey on conditions of
employment conducted by the ministry's Manpower Research and
Statistics Department in June among some 3,000 private-sector
establishments each employing at least 25 workers.
</P>
<P>
Among these establishments, 85 percent provided compassionate
leave to their employees, 73 percent offered marriage benefits,
close to 46 percent gave paternity leave benefits and 29 percent
provided free or subsidized meals and transportation, according to
the paper. However, only 1.4 percent of them provided childcare
benefits, 10 percent offered holiday and incentive travel benefits
and club membership benefits, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that the survey found that only 5.2 percent of
companies offered their employees stock option -- the right to buy
a company's equity at an agreed price in the future and only 0.8
percent gave their employees a flexible benefits plan that allows
employees to choose their benefits from a range available.

<HEADLINE> S'pore External Trade Up 19.8 Percent In November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
hit 35.33 billion Singapore dollars (21.03 billion U.S. dollars)
in total volume last month, expanding by 19.8 percent over a year
ago on the heels of a 14.3 percent increase in October, Singapore
Trade Development Board (TDB) said in its monthly bulletin.
</P>
<P>
TDB attributed the robust growth in November to sustained
recovery of regional economies and the strong demand for key
electronic products.
</P>
<P>
In November, non-oil domestic export (NODX) surged up 15.2
percent, oil domestic exports soared up by a hefty 34.0 percent
and non-oil re-exports (NORX), boosted by strong re-exports to the
major Asian economies, rose by 12.8 percent, the first double-
digit increase in 19 months.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports expanded by 21.0 percent in November,
contributed by imports of integrated circuits and cellular phones
and radio phones and signaling healthy manufacturing activities in
the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Among non-oil domestic exports, exports of electronic products
grew by 11.1 percent in November, the first double-digit expansion
in two years. However, domestic exports of disk drives continued
to shrink.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of non-electronic products maintained robust
growth in November, growing by 24.1 percent on the back of the
continued strong demand for pharmaceuticals and intermediate
compounds from the EU and disc media products from Japan.
</P>
<P>
NODX to all top five markets -- the U.S., the EU, Malaysia,
Japan and Hong Kong -- registered positive growth during the month
with the volume to Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong increasing by 25.
6 percent, 29.5 percent and 30.4 percent respectively while that
to the U.S. and the EU registering more moderate increases.

HARBIN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Local residents in Harbin in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province are now able to get
professional advice on how to invest their money at the branches
of the China Industrial and Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
With advice from the bank, one businessman in the city avoided
more than 4,000 yuan (about 480 U.S. dollars) in lost profits by
transferring his account to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Most people have no idea how to deal with the extra money they
are accumulating in increasing amounts. Now they can ask
professionals at the bank about things such as the various kinds
of investments, saving trusts, and other financial instruments.
</P>
<P>
This free service, as a new kind of intermediate business in
China, will someday become a new career, and it will gradually
play an important part in helping people make decisions about
their financial matters, said Fei Tingdong, who is in charge of
the expansion of the bank's consultation services.

MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- "The great motherland will
forever be a strong force behind Macao," Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today, noting that the Central Government is fully
confident in and gives all-out support to the Chief Executive Ho
Hau Wah and the government of Macao Special Administrative Region(
SAR) under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the establishment of the Macao
SAR here this morning, Jiang reiterated that the Central
Government will carry out the policies of "one country, two
systems," "Macao people administrating Macao" and high degree of
autonomy in the Macao SAR and ensure that the social and economic
systems and the life-style of Macao remain basically unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The celebration ceremony, held by the Macao SAR government in
the Macao Forum, drew some 3,000 guests, including members of the
Chinese Central Government Delegation led by Jiang Zemin,
representatives from all walks of life in Macao, Hong Kong and
Taiwan as well as dignitaries from across the world.
</P>
<P>
In the early morning today, the Chinese and Portuguese
governments held the ceremony for the transfer of power of Macao
which was followed by the inauguration ceremony of the Macao SAR
and the swearing-in of the Macao SAR government held by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
When Jiang and the central government delegation, accompanied
by Chief Executive Ho Hau Wah and other principal officials of the
Macao SAR government, walked into the venue for the ceremony at 10:
00, they were accorded a prolonged applause.

<P>
The celebration ceremony began amid the tune of the National
Anthem of China. President Jiang, in his speech, expressed warm
congratulations on the return of Macao to the motherland and the
establishment of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
He said that Macao has been Chinese territory since ancient
times and that the Chinese people fought dauntlessly for the
return of Macao, a sacred territory of China.
</P>
<P>
"Our thriving socialist motherland has been the primary force
behind the epoch-making change in Macao's status," he said. "
Macao's return is also a great victory in the cause of world peace
and justice."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the principle of "one country, two systems"
initiated by late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has pointed out the
right road for the settlement of the questions of Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The successful return of Macao is yet another historic
monument built by the Chinese people on the road to national
reunification following the return of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people will continue with their
efforts to accomplish the great cause of the reunification of the
motherland in line with the policies of "peaceful reunification"
and "one country, two systems," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the successful implementation of "one country, two
systems" in Hong Kong and Macao will give a positive push to the
early settlement of the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Ho Hau Wah, the first Chief Executive of the Macao SAR elected
by local residents, also made a speech.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region
signifies a new era and new identity for the people of Macao. They
will now run their own affairs as masters of their own destiny,"
Ho said.

He said that the continued stability and prosperity of Macao
after the handover and the successful implementation of the "one
country, two systems" principle will have a vital influence on the
cause of reunification in China.
</P>
<P>
"I uphold that it is essential for the Macao SAR government to
implement firmly the Basic Law by carrying out all the policies
and measures in accordance with the fundamental principle of 'one
country, two systems'," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He promises that the Macao SAR government will be open and
democratic and serve the people of Macao wholeheartedly. He held
that the most important tasks facing the Macao SAR government are
to promote economic growth and to protect the safety and stability
of Macao.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, the central government transferred the Land
Fund of the Macao SAR to the SAR government and also presented a
Macao regional flag to the SAR government. Chinese Vice-Premier
Qian Qichen handed the certificate of the Land Fund to Ho Hau Wah
on behalf of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The land fund, which has amounted to 9.995 billion patacas, is
the money that belongs to the Macao SAR government, and had been
kept and managed by the Chinese Delegation of the Sino-Portuguese
Land Group before the establishment of the Macao SAR government
according to  relevant documents of the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The Macao regional flag, a gift from the Central Government,
and a national flag of China, have been sent to the outer space
along with "Shenzhou," China's first spaceship launched on
November 21.

As the list of gifts was announced at the ceremony, photos of
the gifts were shown on two big screens at both sides of the
gathering hall. The lotus sculpture presented by the Central
Government drew warm applause from the audience.
</P>
<P>
Later, artists from all over China presented wonderful
theatrical performances. At the end of the performance, President
Jiang, Vice-Premier Qian and the Chief Executive Ho Hau Wah went
onto the stage to shake hands with the artists.
</P>
<P>
Then Jiang presented the Macao SAR with a calligraphy scroll on
which he wrote: "Ushering in a new era for Macao."

<HEADLINE> 1stlead: Thai Government Wins No-Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The coalition government of
Thailand won a no-confidence vote Monday after a five-day grilling
in a parliament censure debate sponsored by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
A total of 367 legislators participated in the voting. Among
them, 229 voted for the government, with 125 against it. There
were 13 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The six-party coalition enjoys a comfortable majority of 237 in
the 385-member lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day censure debate, the opposition, led by the
New Aspiration Party, focused its attacks on Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda and Interior
Minister Sanan Kachornprasart.
</P>
<P>
Chuan was accused of failing to solve the country's economic
problems after taking office two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, massive non-performing loans carried by state-owned
Krung Thai Bank have provided ammunitions for the opposition's
attack on Tarrin, who was accused of trying to protect his brother,
president of the bank for seven years until January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sanan was bruised by allegations of allowing associates to
escape police investigation for building villas illegally in a
national park.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin and Sanan, key members of the core coalition party, the
Democrat, have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Polls conducted during the censure debate showed that a
majority of Thai people thought the government deserves a chance
to continue in office.
</P>
<P>
But despite their support, people wanted the government to
reshuffle its cabinet, which indicated that the opposition's
attacks caused some real bruises.
</P>
<P>
The opposition had said in the last day of the debate that they
didn't expect much result from the vote.
</P>
<P>
Their goal is to damage the coalition, especially Chuan's
Democrat Party, as much as possible ahead of new elections next
year.
</P>
<P>
The government's term expires in November 2000, which means its
must call a general election before that time.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy to Grow 4-5 percent Next Year: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy is likely to
maintain a growth rate of between four percent and five percent
next year as the economic recovery will continue, the Bangkok Post
Monday quoted some key national economic planners as saying.
</P>
<P>
The trend will build on a four-percent-growth this year, which
has been spurred by an increase of between six percent and 6.5
percent in export earnings, Sansern Wongcha-um, secretary-general
of the National Economic and Social Development Board of Thailand,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The agency predicts inflation of two percent next year, up from
0.4 percent this year, with exports expanding by 6.7 percent in
value.
</P>
<P>
The baht is expected to remain around 38.6 to the dollar for
the next few weeks, strengthening to 37 next year. Improvement in
exports and manufacturing will be helped by the government's
stimulus measures.
</P>
<P>
Sansern said Thailand's economic growth, especially in
agriculture, will depend on regional recovery, particularly trends
in China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing would expand because of export demand. Private
investment would be boosted by funds set up to support small and
medium-sized enterprises. Industrial and agricultural reforms were
needed for Thailand to keep pace with its Asian competitors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chakramon Pasukvanich, the Board of Investment's deputy
secretary-general, said a recent BoI survey of promoted companies
pointed to a recovery of manufacturing. Industrial output in the
first three quarters of this year was up by 63 percent from the
same period last year, with electronics standing out.
</P>
<P>
Some 260,000 vehicles were expected to be sold locally next
year, up from 200,000 this year, with exports reaching 140,000, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The BoI expected total production of vehicles to reach 500,000
in 2001 and 580,000 in 2003, about the same level as in 1996
before the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The BoI expects no new industrial investment next year, only
the expansion of existing capacity. It is targeting investors who
can use Thailand as an export production base.
</P>
<P>
Nipon Poanpongsakorn, vice-president of the Thailand
Development Research Institute, was quoted as saying that the
economy would improve but debt restructuring could impede the
process. Most debt restructuring carried out so far had only
involved extending repayment, rather than acceptance of losses and
lower interest charges. Therefore, risk still exists that loans
could turn bad again.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt to Continue Sell Banks Despite Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's central bank has
said the sale of nationalized banks will continue despite the fact
that regulators and policy makers came under fire from the
opposition during a censure debate in parliament, the Bangkok Post
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand said the sale of Bangkok Metropolitan Bank
and Siam City Bank will continue as planned, with final deals
expected to be concluded over the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused the Chuan Leekpai government of ceding
the country's economic sovereignty to foreign interests during the
five-day parliamentary no-confidence debate which ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government survived the no-confidence vote early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Britain-based HSBC Holdings has been tipped to have the inside
track for Bangkok Metropolitan Bank.
</P>
<P>
For Siam City Bank, bidding and negotiations are centered
around two groups, one led by Newbridge Capital of the United
States and Singaporean bank Capital Tatlee while the other by
Ankar Capital and Development Bank of Singapore (DBS).
</P>
<P>
Newbridge, a private investment firm, took a 51 percent stake
in Korea First Bank of South Korea earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The Development Bank of Singapore, meanwhile, already has a
majority stake in one Thai bank, DBS Thai Danu.
</P>
<P>
Taking over Siam City Bank would give DBS 211 more branches and
loan assets of up to 250 billion baht, supplementing the 110
billion baht and 95 branches already at DBS Thai Danu.
</P>
<P>
But Charles Newton, a managing director of DBS, was quoted as
saying that talk of mergers was still a long way off.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a successful acquisition by DBS would help raise
its presence in the Thai financial market.
</P>
<P>
So far, four foreign banks have bought controlling shares of
four nationalized Thai banks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, ABN Amro of the Netherlands invested heavily in the
Bank of Asia with Standard Chartered Bank taking controlling
shares in the Nakornthon Bank and United Overseas Bank of
Singapore recently taking Radanasin Bank.

<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- China will hold a college
entrance examination on January 19-21 next year as part of the
Ministry of Education's attempt to increase college enrollment.
</P>
<P>
This will mark an epoch-making change in the history of the
country's national college entrance examination system.
</P>
<P>
China has always held the national college entrance examination
on July 7-9, and those who failed July's exam had to wait until
the following July to take it again.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the January exam, thirteen colleges and
universities in Beijing will enroll a total of 4,000 students,
with 1,755 of them from Beijing and more than 2,200 from Anhui
Province in east China, Xinhua was told by the Ministry of
Education.
</P>
<P>
The January examination will be on a par with the one in July.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's New Parliament Speaker Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's 10th
Parliament began sitting here Monday, first reelecting Mohamed
Zahir Ismail as House Speaker for the fifth term.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad proposed his reelection and the
motion was seconded by Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik.
</P>
<P>
The parliament was formed after the November 29 general
election in which the ruling 14-party Barisan Nasional (BN) (
National Front) led by Mahathir won 148 out of the 193 seats in
the present Parliament, and the rest 45 seats are held by the
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Zahir first became speaker on June 14, 1982.
</P>
<P>
The legality of the sitting was questioned by the opposition.
At the outset of the proceedings Monday, opposition bench MP
Fadzil Nor demanded adjournment but Secretary to Parliament
Mohamed Salleh Hassan read out a proclamation by Yang di-Pertuan
Agong (King) Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah on the convening of
the first session.
</P>
<P>
The Budget 2000 was tabled by First Finance Minister Daim
Zainuddin (now finance minister) on October 29 but not approved in
time following the dissolution of parliament on November 11 for
the general election.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told a news conference that Zainuddin will table the
2000 Budget in parliament and it would be debated before being
approved.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the current four-day sitting, only
provisions for the initial two or three months of government
expenditures would be tabled pending the special sitting in
February to pass the budget.
</P>
<P>
"The expenditures need no debating. They only need tabling
before parliament for its approval," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The provisions tabled at Monday's House sitting for first
reading were the Supply Bill 2000 and the Mara Institute of
Technology (Amendment) Bill 1999.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Congo on Long, Rough Trek to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The elapsing year has
witnessed how the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) dragged on, how the first hard-earned glimmering of
hope to end the armed conflict was brought and nearly crushed, and
how the third largest African country trudged wearily on the long
and rough trek to peace.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of the year, the DRC civil war, which had
already sucked in military muscles from Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia on the side of the government, and Rwanda and Uganda on
the side of the rebels, raged on and threatened to spill further.
</P>
<P>
The escalation and prolonging of the war imposed a staggering
burden on the small and fragile economies of the countries
involved and distressing casualties were reported on both sides.
This has sparked loud outcries at domestic, regional and
international levels for ending the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
It was amidst these outcries that emerged two peace agreements
of monumental importance: the Sirte agreement and the Lusaka
cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Sirte agreement was signed in Sirte, Libya on April 18 by
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his DRC counterpart Laurent
Kabila, both going weary of the dragging war, under the brokering
of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. In the accord, the two
presidents agreed in principle to a cease-fire, withdrawal of
foreign troops and deployment of neutral African peacekeeping
forces to help guarantee security of the DRC's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by July 10, when the Kabila administration
and all the five foreign countries militarily involved in the
year-old conflict inked the famous cease-fire accord in Lusaka,
Zambia, bringing the first ray of peace into the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka agreement urged all parties involved to realize
cease-fire and end implacable hostility in the DRC, solve ethnic
problems via national dialogue, disband and disarm the Interahamwe
militiamen and the rebel Allied Democratic Forces which have been
threatening the security of Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting external pressures, both rebel groups-- the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) and the Congolese Liberation
Movement (MLC)-- ratified the Lusaka agreement in August, pushing
the sluggish peace process a big stride forward. In order to
boost the peace efforts, a Joint Military Commission (JMC) was put
in place to monitor its implementation by all the signatories.
</P>
<P>
Regional and continental mediation efforts have played a big
role in bringing the belligerent groups to sit down and iron out
their seemingly irreconcilable differences. Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba, together with former South African President
Nelson Mandela and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, have contributed
unceasingly and enormously to the fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace process, which now seems on the right track,
is nothing short of snags and obstacles.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, Uganda and Rwanda, which are
behind the rebel groups fighting Kabila, began to differ in their
strategies in the battlefield and the RCD, the main rebel group in
the DRC, was split into two rival factions in May due to internal
strife. This development further complicated the nature of the
conflict that each of the players approached with different
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The RCD split gave birth to RCD-Goma and RCD-Kisangani led by
Emile Illunga and Wamba dia Wamba enjoying backing from Kigali
and Kampala respectively. It undoubtedly hampered the peace
process and weakened the Lusaka agreement directly.
</P>
<P>
The growing mistrust between Uganda and Rwanda was believed to
be a key factor causing the armed clashes between their troops in
Kisangani in northeastern DRC on August 14-17, claiming well over
200 lives including those of 38 Ugandan servicemen. Museveni and
his former colleague, Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame met in
Mweye Lodge in western Uganda in its wake and hammered out a truce
to bring the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
But this is by no means the whole story. Recently, Kabila
forces and the MLC rebels spearheaded by Pierre Bemba were engaged
in fresh fighting on three fronts in the northern and central
parts of the country, accusing each other of violating the Lusaka
agreement. At a press conference at Nile Hotel here in November,
Bemba accused Kabila of having violated the cease-fire for more
than 60 times.
</P>
<P>
This fighting, though on and off for a relatively short period,
could crush the cornerstone of the Lusaka cease-fire pact, trigger
immediate resumption of all-out war in the troubled country and
totally shatter the peace process. To curb the threat, a report
has allegedly been submitted to the JMC and an comprehensive
investigation is under way.
</P>
<P>
Although unremitting efforts have been made to revitalize the
almost exhausted peace process, there are so far no signs of an
easy way. To meet the challenge, the regional and international
communities requested that a facilitator be chosen to "tidy up the
mess."
</P>
<P>
The DRC issue is of political, ethnic, religious and cultural
dimensions. Its resolution needs all the stakeholders to
compromise and reconcile for the sake of common good. However, the
prospects for the issue are so bleak at present that no tangible
progress is in sight. The narrow and bumpy road, along which the
DRC is trudging in search of a lasting peace, is set to stretch
into the next century.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) Macao Garrison troops today have begun to undertake the
defense of Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Macao has been Chinese territory since ancient times. Before
the Opium War in 1840, the defense of Macao was a responsibility
of the Chinese government. The governments of Ming (1368-1644) and
Qing (1644-1911) dynasties both stationed troops in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In the early years of Portuguese occupation, Portugal didn't
station any troops in Macao. In order to protect the Portuguese
residing in Macao, the Portuguese themselves organized armed
forces, recruiting soldiers and building defense facilities such
as emplacements and blockhouses.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Portuguese residing in Macao, the
Portuguese government appointed the first governor of Macao in
1623 and authorized him with the power to lead a company and have
its soldiers station in Macao. The expenses of the garrison were
borne by Macao.
</P>
<P>
In the following two centuries, 200 to 300 Portuguese troops
were stationed in Macao.
</P>
<P>
After the Opium War, the number of the Portuguese Macao
Garrison expanded. The Portuguese troops stationed in Macao
exceeded 700 men in 1909, accounting for one percent of the then
local population. The Portuguese Garrison in Macao was expanded to
6,500 men in the latter half of 1950.
</P>
<P>
Portugal began to withdraw its troops stationed in Macao in
1974 and finished withdrawing all its troops by the end of 1975.
</P>
<P>
Macao set up a "militarized" security force to replace the
former Portuguese troops in January 1976. Former military
facilities were mostly handed over to the security force.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution and the Macao SAR Basic Law of
the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government
will be responsible for the defense of Macao after its return to
China on December 20, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales On Rise in Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Growth in rural markets and
retail shopping, especially for winter clothing, gave Beijing
consumer sales a lucrative lift of 8.8 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The city's retail turnover totaled 11.26 billion yuan (1.36
billion U.S. dollars) in November, an increase over September and
October, today's English Newspaper China Daily cited sources from
the Beijing Municipal Statistics Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that real growth after deducting price
elements was 10.7 percent and this increase was attributed to
clothing sales and the effect of promotions in the capital's major
department stores.
</P>
<P>
Garment sales rose by 15.9 percent to 1.46 billion yuan (176
million U.S. dollars) in November, sustaining the positive trend
of October. Winter apparel such as leather, cashmere sweater
pushed up the November figure, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunication facilities, jewelry, stationery, and basic
household goods also drove up consumer spending. But many
groceries just sat on the shelf last month. Food sales rang up 3.
11 billion yuan (375 million U.S. dollars) in November, 3.2
percent lower than in October and among the slowest growth of all
consumer good.
</P>
<P>
To make up for the food slump, Beijing's rural markets
continued to outpace more urbanized ones last months, rising 14.5
percent in turnover to 1.64 billion yuan (198 million U.S. dollars)
. City markets showed an increase of 7.9 percent to 9.62 billion
yuan (1.16 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Booming trade and improved transportation caused the rural
markets growth, the city statistics bureau sources said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the manufacturing industry realized 700 million
yuan (84 million U.S. dollars) of the retail sale volume in
November, up 27 percent on an monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the growth was fueled by the restructuring of
the city's industries, especially high-tech industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of a
speech made by Chief Executive Ho Hau Wah at the Ceremony Marking
the Establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region on 20
December, 1999:
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin,
</P>
<P>
Distinguished State Leaders,
</P>
<P>
Honored Guests,
</P>
<P>
Fellow Citizens of Macao, and
</P>
<P>
Friends,
</P>
<P>
Today, the twentieth of December 1999, marks the official
establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao
SAR) and the realization of Mr. Deng Xiaoping's innovative concept
of "One Country, Two Systems". This is a great day of rejoicing
for each and every member of the Chinese nation, including the 400,
000-odd people of Macao whose love for this place is imbued with a
strong sense of belonging.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Macao SAR signifies a new era and new
identity for the people of Macao. They will now run their own
affairs as masters of their own destiny. This fills me with a
tremendous sense of anticipation and honor at a time when I am
called upon to serve Macao with a lofty and sacred sense of
mission and responsibility. On this joyous occasion, we wish to
express our heartfelt gratitude to our state leaders, headed by
President Jiang Zemin, for their guidance and contribution to
Macao's smooth transition and to the successful establishment of
the Macao SAR's government. We also wish to thank all our
distinguished guests for being with us here today, witnessing and
sharing with us this glorious and inspiring historic moment. The
success we can see in Macao today is due, in the final analysis,
to the achievements of Macao's hard-working population over past
generations. The smooth return of Macao to our motherland has also
been achieved thanks to the concerted efforts of Macao's people,
their love for Macao and for our motherland. I sincerely hope that
we shall unite in our commitment and persevere in creating a
better, brighter future for all.

<P>
The Macao SAR government is deeply concerned with the current
economic and employment situation in Macao. Economic recovery and
growth are the key to ensuring a higher level of employment and
giving full play to the potential of its workforce. Consequently,
one of the most important tasks facing the Macao SAR government is
to remove obstacles to economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, we can only expect steady economic growth and
prosperity when there is peace and order in the community. The
Macao SAR government is determined and confident that it has the
ability and powers to address this issue. I maintain that our
crackdown on crime should be raised to the political level. We
shall mobilize the whole government and public resources to
protect the safety and stability of Macao in accordance with the
law and our policies.
</P>
<P>
History has taught us that a country can achieve continuous
progress when it opens up and carries out reforms; indeed it
stagnates when it fails to do so. The same holds true for Macao:
we must open up and introduce reforms. Macao needs to establish
extensive contacts, close cooperation and business relations with
other parts of the world, and attract foreign investment, human
resources, technology and concepts while carrying out on-going
internal improvements and maximizing positive local factors, in
order to progress and create new opportunities. Inevitably Macao
will become more closely bound up with Hong Kong and the Pearl
River Delta region. Regular coordination of major infrastructure
projects at the mouth of the Pearl River is beneficial to Macao's
long-term economic prospects.

The Macao SAR government will strive, in the spirit of putting
people first, to serve the people of Macao wholeheartedly. As the
first Chief Executive of the Macao SAR, I am determined to work
relentlessly in establishing, during my term of office, a highly
efficient, transparent and accountable public administrative
system that genuinely reflects the concept of "Macao people
running Macao". The principal officials of the Macao SAR, who were
sworn in just a few hours ago, have a profound understanding and
personal knowledge of Macao society. Moreover, they all share a
deep sense of mission and commitment, and the enthusiasm and
determination to devote themselves to Macao. Patriotic, young and
promising, and full of drive, they are capable of effecting
vigorous changes and creating bright new prospects for Macao.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, I have complete confidence in the existing
public service, whose quality, on average, is even better than
before. I cherish great hopes that these public servants will
continue to perform their duties well and serve the Macao SAR
government with loyalty and dedication.

<P>
The Macao SAR government will strive to be open and democratic.
We will, through various effective channels of consultation, reach
out to the widest possible range of citizens and listen to their
views. We shall maintain close contacts and boost communication
with the media, increase administrative transparency and subject
ourselves to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
After a long separation from the motherland, Macao is now
returning with many characteristics and attributes that have not
originated in traditional Chinese culture. Macao is home to
citizens of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds who have
coexisted in harmony, and this very special feature will continue
into the new era. Ethnic and social harmony will facilitate
various forms of cooperation, economic development, the rule of
law, and the fostering of a democratic and progressive society.
</P>
<P>
By looking to the origins and characteristics of China's
ancient civilization, we shall strengthen our national identity
and foster patriotic ideals. Inherent to the policy of "Macao
people running Macao" and "a high degree of autonomy", we are duty-
bound to combine Macao's interests with those of the State. Our
goal is to benefit and achieve prosperity for both China and Macao.
This is certainly the demand placed on us by this new era and
circumstance. Nevertheless, to promote the ideas and opportunities
of the new era, we must keep on learning, innovating and making
progress every day.
</P>
<P>
Macao's greatest advantage has been the strength of unity of
its patriotic people, and their diligence, initiative and
creativity. I have boundless faith in the future of Macao. I am
convinced that the people of Macao will endeavor to create a
brighter, better future for themselves. Most importantly, we
believe in our beloved country, and we believe in the people of
Macao, their fortitude and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
Distinguished guests, fellow citizens,
</P>
<P>
At this moment, I share with you great excitement and joy. I
also see clearly the heavy tasks that lie ahead. Macao's
prosperity depends on our country's care and support, and the
concerted efforts of the Macao SAR government and citizens, as
well as the concern and help of our friends from around the world.
I shall, as always, do my utmost to attain our goal. Together with
our 400,000-odd fellow citizens we shall work together to greet
and embrace the new century and the new millennium. Together we
shall build a Macao that can enjoy continued progress and
prosperity and offer every citizen a fulfilling and happy life.
</P>
<P>
I invite you to join me in wishing our great motherland
thriving prosperity!
</P>
<P>
I invite you to join me in wishing our beloved Macao a bright
and successful future!

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Macao Land Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 10 billion patacas
worth of land fund of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
was transferred to the Macao SAR government here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen handed the certificate of the
land fund to Edmund Ho Hau Wah, the first Chief Executive of the
Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions of Annex II of the Sino-Portuguese
Joint Declaration, signed in Beijing on April 13, 1987, all income
obtained by the Portuguese Macao government from granting new
leases and renewing leases shall, after deduction of the average
cost of land production, be shared equally between the Portuguese
Macao government and the future Macao Special Administrative
Region government. This is how the land fund comes about.
</P>
<P>
The land fund is the money that belongs to the Macao SAR
government, and had been kept and managed by the Chinese
Delegation of the Sino-Portuguese Land Group before the
establishment of the Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
At present, the total land fund of the Macao SAR includes two
parts: the land income that belongs to the Macao SAR government
and all the earnings from the deposits and investments by using
the land income.
</P>
<P>
From the entry into force of the Joint Declaration on January
15, 1988 up to the end of November of 1999, the land fund,
received from the Portuguese side, had amounted to more than 6.7
billion Macao pataca.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Delegation of the land group was entrusted to
manage the fund on behalf of the Macao SAR government. Over the
past 12 years, the Chinese side has all along well managed the
fund, seeking high profits and avoiding risks in a bid to bring
about the greatest profits at a lower cost. As a result, the land
fund enjoys an aggregate return rate of 40 percent.

<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) Garrison Troops to be stationed in the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) are leaving Zhuhai for Macao, amid a
rousing send-off from the people of Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Macao Garrison is established in accordance with the
late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two
systems," the Chinese Constitution, the Basic Law of the Macao SAR,
and a decree of the Central Military Commission (CMC).
</P>
<P>
It is the second contingent of PLA troops to be sent to station
in a special administrative region, following the Hong Kong SAR
Garrison troops.
</P>
<P>
As a symbol of China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao, the PLA Macao Garrison was formed in
Zhuhai last April in accordance with the need of Macao SAR's
defense, and the principles of maintaining a capable and moderate
number of troops.
</P>
<P>
The Garrison, with most of its soldiers from the ground force,
also includes a small number of navy and air force officers to
handle related affairs. The Garrison is equipped with weapons
necessary for defense purposes in the Macao SAR, mainly light arms.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its basic function of defending Macao SAR, the
Garrison can assist the Macao SAR government in maintaining social
order and rescuing disaster victims upon application by the SAR
government and approval by the Central People's Government.
</P>
<P>
The officers and men in the Garrison must abide by national
laws and the Macao SAR laws at the same time. Expenses of the
Garrison will be borne by the Central People's Government.

December 20, 1999 is an auspicious day for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said in an article that Macao's return to the
motherland represents an end to the tarnishing of the dignity of
the Chinese people, an end to colonial rule over Chinese soil and
the establishment of a new era for Macao.
</P>
<P>
"As China regained Hong Kong from the British in 1997, it (
Macao's return to China) is an important step for the unification
with the motherland," it said.

<P>
The paper expressed the confidence that the future of Macao
will be brilliant together with the economic development of
motherland China.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Myanmar Foreign Minister U
Win Aung also expressed the confidence that the policy of "one
country, two systems" will be successfully implemented in Macao as
it has been in Hong Kong.

marine businesses would be further developed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today reiterated that after the Chinese Government resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over Macao, the existing capitalist system
in Macao will continue to be practiced, the current social and
economic systems will remain unchanged, and so will the life-style.
The laws will remain basically unchanged and the right of private
ownership will be protected by law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Ceremony in Celebration of the Establishment of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) held this
morning, Jiang said that as a special administrative region of
China, Macao will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as provided for
in the Basic Law of the Macao SAR, such as executive, legislative
and independent judicial power, including that of final
adjudication, except in foreign and defense affairs which are the
responsibilities of the Central People's Government.
</P>
<P>
The interests of the inhabitants of Portuguese descent in Macao
will be protected by law, and their customs and cultural
traditions will be respected, he said. There are many foreigners
living in Macao. Macao SAR will continue to be their home where
they can live and work in peace and contentment. In tomorrow's
Macao, all the residents, irrespective of their race and color,
will have opportunities to compete as equals, and everyone will
enjoy the rights and freedoms as guaranteed by law.
</P>
<P>
After the Chinese Government resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao, he said, the Macao SAR will remain a free
port and a separate customs territory. Using the name of "Macao,
China", it may on its own maintain and develop economic relations
with states and regions and relevant international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Macao SAR will continue to have independent finances and
practice an independent taxation system. The Central Government
will not levy taxes on Macao. The Macao SAR will on its own decide
policies, in accordance with the law, in the fields such as the
economy, trade, finance and money, education, medical and health
services, science and technology, culture and religion, and also
decide policies on tourism and recreation in the light of its
local overall interests. The economic and trade activities and the
investment interests of states and regions in Macao will be
protected in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Central Government's policies and principles
regarding Macao and all the provisions of the Basic Law of the
Macao SAR fully conform to the fundamental interests of the
country, including Macao, benefit investors of all countries and
are the basic guarantee for Macao's long-term stable development.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law is the law of a constitutional nature for Macao
and also a law for the whole nation. Not only Macao should observe
the law, but the whole nation should observe it as well. The
departments of the Central Government and the local authorities
across the country will not, and will not be allowed to, interfere
in the affairs which should be administered by the Macao SAR on
its own as provided for in the Basic Law, he stressed.

<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Central Government of China
is fully confident in and gives all-out support to the Chief
Executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the

Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the Ceremony in Celebration of the
Establishment of the Macao SAR here this morning, Jiang said that
Macao compatriots have played an important role both in the
struggles waged by the Chinese people for national liberation and
in China's modernization drive. They have been actively involved
in affairs in the transitional period and made valuable
contributions to the smooth return of Macao to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that they will carry forward the glorious
tradition of loving the country and loving Macao and make even
greater contributions to maintaining long-term stability and
development of Macao and safeguarding the fundamental interests of
the country and the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The great motherland will forever be a strong force behind
Macao, he said. Since the founding of New China, the people on the
mainland have always cared for and supported the stability and
development of Macao. The ties between Macao and the mainland have
been growing ever closer. After its return, Macao will continue to
strengthen its role as an important bridge linking China and other
countries and regions and as a window open to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"A stable social environment is a primary condition for
economic growth and a happy life for the people," he stressed. "
The Central Government will resolutely support all the necessary
measures the Macao SAR Government adopts for the maintenance of
social stability in Macao."
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that with the support of the Central Government
and the 1.2 billion people in China, the people in Macao under the
leadership of the Macao SAR Government will work harder in a
pioneering spirit and go on making progress so as to build a
better future for Macao," he said.

of Mr. Deng Xiaoping. It was he who initiated the principle of "
one country, two systems" with great political vision and
extraordinary wisdom, pointing out the right road for the
settlement of the questions of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. The
successful return of Macao is yet another historic monument built
by the Chinese people on the road to national reunification
following the return of Hong Kong.

Macao has been Chinese territory since ancient times. The
Chinese people fought dauntlessly for the return of Macao, a
sacred territory of the motherland. Although Macao was long
separated from the motherland, the bond of flesh and blood and the
overall national interests have always linked our Macao
compatriots closely with the people of the rest of the country.
Our thriving socialist motherland has been the primary force
behind the epoch-making change in Macao's status. Macao's return
is also a great victory in the cause of world peace and justice.
It proves once again that no force on earth will stop the
historical trend to the progress of mankind.
</P>
<P>
The Governments of China and Portugal have settled the question
of Macao through negotiations. This political decision is a wise
move that conforms to the needs of the times. Here I would like to
thank all the people both in and out of the Portuguese Government
who have made efforts for the settlement of the Macao question.
The successful settlement of the Macao question has provided a new
historical starting point from where the friendship between the
Chinese and Portuguese people will grow further in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
After the Chinese Government resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao, the existing capitalist system in Macao
will continue to be practiced, the current social and economic
systems will remain unchanged, and so will the life-style. The
laws will remain basically unchanged and the right of private
ownership will be protected by law. As a special administrative
region of the People's Republic of China, Macao will enjoy a high
degree of autonomy as provided for in the Basic Law of the Macao
SAR, such as executive, legislative and independent judicial power,
including that of final adjudication, except in foreign and
defense affairs which are the responsibilities of the Central
People's Government. The interests of the inhabitants of
Portuguese descent in Macao will be protected by law, and their
customs and cultural traditions will be respected. There are many
foreigners living in Macao. Macao SAR will continue to be their
home where they can live and work in peace and contentment. In
tomorrow's Macao, all the resident, irrespective of their race and
color, will have opportunities to compete as equals, and everyone
will enjoy the rights and freedoms as guaranteed by law.

<P>
The Central Government's policies and principles regarding
Macao and all the provisions of the Basic Law of the Macao SAR
fully conform to the fundamental interests of the country,
including Macao, benefit investors of all countries and are the
basic guarantee for Macao's long-term stable development. This
Basic Law is a law of constitutional nature for Macao and also a
law for the whole nation. Not only Macao should observe the law,
but the whole nation should observe it as well. The departments of
the Central Government and the local authorities across the
country will not, and will not be allowed to, interfere in the
affairs which should be administered by the Macao SAR on its own
as provided for by the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
I wish to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Ho Hau Wah,
the first Chief Executive of Macao SAR, who has been sworn into
office today. The Central Government is fully confident in and
gives all-out support to the Chief Executive and the SAR
Government under his leadership.

<P>
Our Macao compatriots have played an important role both in the
struggles waged by the Chinese people for national liberation and
in China's modernization drive. They have been actively involved
in affairs in the transitional period and made valuable
contributions to the smooth return of Macao to the motherland. We
firmly believe that they will carry forward the glorious tradition
of loving the country and loving Macao and make even greater
contributions to maintaining long-term stability and development
of Macao and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the country
and the nation.
</P>
<P>
The great motherland will forever be a strong force behind
Macao. Since the founding of New China, the people on the mainland
have always cared for and supported the stability and development
of Macao. The ties between Macao and the mainland have been
growing ever closer. After its return, Macao will continue to
strengthen its role as an important bridge linking China and other
countries and regions and as a window open to the outside world. A
stable social environment is a primary condition for economic
growth and a happy life for the people. The Central Government
will resolutely support all the necessary measures the Macao SAR
Government adopts for the maintenance of social stability in Macao.
I am confident that with the support of the Central Government and
the 1.2 billion people in China, the people in Macao under the
leadership of the Macao SAR Government will work harder in a
pioneering spirit and go on making progress so as to build a
better future for Macao.
</P>
<P>
The first rays of the 21st century are on the horizon. The
Chinese Government and people will continue with their efforts to
accomplish the great cause of the reunification of the motherland
in line with the policies of "peaceful reunification" and "one
country, two systems". The successful implementation of "one
country, two systems" in Hong Kong and Macao will give a positive
push to the early settlement of the Taiwan question. The Chinese
people of all ethnic groups and all patriots who support national
reunification and care for China's reconstruction will work in
concerted efforts and contribute to turning China into a strong,
prosperous, democratic and culturally advanced modern country and
bringing about the great reunification of the Chinese nation. The
world of tomorrow should be one of lasting peace and common
progress and prosperity of all countries. The Chinese people are
ready to work unremittingly with the people of other countries for
a beautiful future of the world.

Thank you.

<HEADLINE> China to Benefit from Macao's Ties with Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Industries in south China are
being urged to take advantage of Macao's special relationship with
Europe to get into markets there, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Macao has close trade relations with the European Union (EU).
It has an easy access to global market information from 250
information centers in the EU, receives financial aid from the EU
and enjoys low tariff rates for its exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guanghan, an expert with the Guangzhou-based Zhongshan
University's Hong Kong and Macao research institute, is quoted as
urging businesses in south China's Guangdong Province to form
joint ventures with their Macao counterparts, as co-operation
between Guangdong and Macao moves to a government level from today,
with Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Chen said high-tech enterprises and those producing high value-
added products should, in particular, move in this direction. This
is likely to give them greater access to breakthroughs in science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
"Many foreign countries impose fewer restrictions on Macao
concerning its introduction of the world's high and new
technologies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Macao's manufacturing industry has been dominated by garments
and textiles, Chen said, adding this withering sector has been
exerting pressure on the development of Macao's economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
However, the time would soon be ripe for high-tech enterprises
in Guangdong to join forces with more of Macao's enterprises, he
said. Reversely, Macao's preferential policies for domestic
enterprises should help the province's high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Yue He, an economics teacher at Guangzhou-based Jinan
University, said that Guangdong and Macao should pay more
attention to the service trade to help improve co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Macao's tertiary industry institutions, including those related
to banking, labor exports, tourism and consultation, may set up
more branches in the province and vice versa, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that closer links in the industry will help to pave a
smooth way for healthy cooperation.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed in Clash in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were
killed and 10 others injured during a clash which broke out on
Sunday in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, Antara
news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted several victims treated later at a local
hospital as saying that the incident broke out when they were
riding on a passenger car and a crowd was blocking the road.
</P>
<P>
The crowd attacked them and security personnel also opened fire,
the victims said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Amir Latuconsina, a member of the Maluku Awareness
Forum, said the incident occurred after a passenger car overturned
in Kota Jawa, Ambon.
</P>
<P>
Antara said most of those killed sustained gunshots in the head,
chest and back, while those injured suffered gunshots from
security personnel and wounds after being stabbed by the crowd
with knives.
</P>
<P>
A number of houses and the passenger car were set on fire
during the incident.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and other parts of Maluku province have witnessed a year-
long communal conflict which has claimed the lives of at least 670
people.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 207 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.

<HEADLINE> Airport Expansion to Help Xi'an Take Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Plans for an expansion of Xi'
an Xianyang International Airport have been approved by the
Shaanxi provincial government and the State Civil Aviation
Administration, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an airport official named Lian Tao as
saying that the decision, taken at the weekend, means construction
may start early next year.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project estimated to cost 1.289 billion yuan (155.
3 million U.S. dollars) will include a 52,000-sq-m long lounge
building with other facilities such as car parks and viaducts
covering a further 190,000 square meters, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The expansion to be completed by 2002 and open in early 2003,
will enable an annual handling capacity of 7.5 million people and
130,000 tons of goods, which will meet the requirements in 2010,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The airport was put into operation in 1991 and since then more
than 50 flight routes have been opened, linking the city to more
than 70 destinations both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, is one of the most
popular tourist destinations in China and the largest city in
northwest China. The airport is playing an increasingly important
role in local economic development.
</P>
<P>
"In the past nine years, the airport's passenger handling
capacity has increased by 18.2 percent every year, with its goods
handling capacity rising by 16.2 percent a year," Lian said.
</P>
<P>
The passenger capacity this year has surpassed 3 million with
the number of passengers in the waiting lobbies in the busiest
hour topping 1.800, which is far more than the designed capacity.

<HEADLINE> Greece Considers Bigger Professional Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece was considering to
expand its professional armed forces and reduce the length of
military service due to the drop in the number of recruits
eligible each year for compulsory service, Greek Defense Minister
Akis Tsohatzopoulos said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki,
Tsohatzopoulos said that Greece must take immediate, systematic
measures, not by increasing military service but by finding a way
for the armed forces' needs to be met by using a larger chunk of
the professional military, and that better use could then be made
of the shorter-term military service component.
</P>
<P>
Such a decision would be possibly taken next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
A factor being studied in connection with the restructuring was
the impact on the armed forces of Greece's aging population, which
already had lowered the number of recruits eligible each year for
compulsory military service.
</P>
<P>
Young recruits reporting for service in Greece has fallen to 80,
000 annually from 100,000-120,000 in the past.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Improve Irrigation in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank-aided program aimed
at upgrading irrigation systems in the central part of Shaanxi
Province in northwest China has now been implemented.
</P>
<P>
The total investment for the program reached 200 million US
dollars, half from World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The program covers the upgrading of low-yield farmland and
basic water-control facilities on Central Shaanxi Plain, which now
boasts more than 600,000 hectares of farmland and grain output
accounting for one-third of the province's total. However, due to
weak irrigation conditions, the farmland on the central Shaanxi
plain has been suffering from drought.
</P>
<P>
When the program is completed in 2004, water control facilities
on the plain will increase the supply by 387 million cubic meters
of water annually, adding and improving more than 250,000 hectares
of arable land and raising the annual grain output in the
irrigated area by over 20 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security
Council chief Sandy Berger Sunday called on Americans to be "
vigilant" against potential terrorist attacks at home and abroad
over the New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
"This is a period of heightened risk of terrorist actions
involving Americans," said Berger on CBS's "Face the Nation"
program. "I would say Americans should be vigilant as they go
about their plans for the New Year."
</P>
<P>
Berger asked people to report suspicious packages or
activities to the police and to take extra care when traveling
abroad during the New Year period. The U.S. State Department
previously issued a terrorism alert for U.S. travelers.
</P>
<P>
Berger, also national security adviser to President Bill
Clinton, said that authorities still were seeking to determine
whether an Algerian arrested Saturday for allegedly bringing 100
pounds of bomb-making explosives into Washington state was part of
a terrorist network.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley clashed Sunday over
issues such as health care, education and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised debate, the two rivals for the
Democratic presidential nomination, avoided specific proposals on
how to ensure the future of Social Security, a thorny problem for
the candidates.
</P>
<P>
In sharp exchanges of words, Gore and Bradley charged that one
another's proposals would hurt the poor and fail to help many of
the nation's 44 million uninsured get health insurance.
</P>
<P>
On education, Bradley challenged Gore's refusal to consider
education vouchers, saying ongoing experimental programs to test
the idea of giving parents tax money would help them finance
private schools.
</P>
<P>
Gore said his opposition was firm. "If you drain the money away
from the public schools for private vouchers, then that hurts the
public schools."
</P>
<P>
Both candidates said they wanted to preserve Social Security
and Medicare benefits without raising the retirement age, but
neither would be specific about how to prevent an expected cash
shortfall in the programs as the Baby Boom generation ages.
