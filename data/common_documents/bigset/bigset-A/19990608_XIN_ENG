<HEADLINE> Chief UN Weapons Inspector to Join U.S. Think Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, Executive
Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, will
join the Council on Foreign Relations on July 5, 1999, the New
York-based think tank announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The think tank said Butler will join the Council
as a diplomat in residence.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who was appointed as head of UNSCOM on July 1, 1997,
said he will leave the post after his contract with the United
Nations expires by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Butler and his staff have not gone back to Iraq to resume
their work since they withdrew from the country last December
when the U.S. and Britain launched four-day military strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has vowed not to cooperate with Butler and his UNSCOM
any longer since the military strikes.
</P>
<P>
Butler has been under attack from Russia, France and China, three
of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
There are initiatives which suggest that UNSCOM be replaced by
a new institution and no agreement has been reached by the
Security Council which has been sharply divided on its policy
towards Iraq since the U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Council on Foreign Relations, founded in 1921, is a
national nonpartisan membership organization and think tank
dedicated to fostering America's understanding of other nations
through study and debate.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Speaks Highly of Ties With Morocco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming Egyptian-Moroccan Higher
Committee meetings in Rabat is a demonstration of the strong ties
binding the two Arab countries, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is
due to start a two-day visit to Morocco on Tuesday, during which
Mubarak and Moroccan King Hassan II will co-chair the meetings of
the higher committee to seek ways of promoting the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also review issues concerning the Arab
world, Moussa said, adding that high on the summit's agenda would
be the Mideast peace process and the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries support the Palestinians' right to establish an
independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital. King Hassan
II chairs the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
The higher committee is expected to tackle a report by the
Egyptian-Moroccan Business Council about proposals on setting up
joint ventures and upgrading the annual trade volume to 200
million dollars in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries stood at 33 million
dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Several pacts are expected to be sealed during the meetings,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported. The pacts cover
cooperation in the areas of crime fighting, industry, oil, air
transport, farming, health and animal husbandry.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Support to Assess Lanadmine in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Monday that it will
support a mission, to be led by the United Nations Mine Action
Services (UNMAS), to assess the impact of landmines on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"There have been reports coming from refugees that landmines
have been deployed in Kosovo by the Yugoslav military, endangering
the lives of those still there and those who are leaving," said
Canadian International Cooperation Minister Diane Marleau.
</P>
<P>
"We have to look to the future, and address without delay, the
mine action priorities for Kosovo to ensure, when the time comes,
the safe return of the refugees. Reconstruction and peace-building
are linked to mine action," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, policy-makers and field experts hired by
UNMAS will assess the situation and identify priority areas for
mine action. A victim assistance program will also be implemented.
</P>
<P>
This initiative will be funded by Canada and Belgium, making
this the first joint effort on landmines between the two
countries. Each country will contribute 75,000 Canadian
dollars(51,000 U.S. dollars) towards this six-month mission.

<HEADLINE> Pre-Dynastic Site Unearthed in Northern Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian archaeologists have
unearthed an important site that could alter the accepted time
frame of the unification of Pharaonic Egypt, the chief Egyptian
archaeologist said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gaballah Ali Gaballah, secretary general of the Supreme Council
of Antiquities, told reporters that the site is near the Nile
Delta town of Simbillawein, about 100 kilometers north of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Terming the discovery as "exciting and very significant,"
Gaballah said the site includes a cemetery and huge quantities of
artifacts dating back 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
He said four months of work at the site have so far yielded
artifacts from both the pre-dynastic and early dynastic
periods. Among the pieces discovered are burial items, engraved
pottery, cylindrical seals and inscriptions, said Gaballah.
</P>
<P>
A cemetery including some 100 tombs - probably belonging to the
first and second dynasties - was also uncovered at the site, which
was buried under farmland.
</P>
<P>
Gaballah said the findings at Simbillawein might indicate that
the unification of Egypt occurred earlier than believed.
</P>
<P>
Scholars of ancient Egypt maintain that the country was
originally divided into two hostile states. They credit King
Menes, one of the last pre-dynastic kings, with unifying Upper and
Lower Egypt and launching the Pharaonic civilization, which lasted
3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Gaballah said two other sites discovered near Simbillawein are
expected to give a "more coherent picture" of the time frame of
the first Egyptian state.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists believe Simbillawein, like the rest of the
Delta, may be preserving an enormous wealth of antiquities beneath
its fertile land.
</P>
<P>
Gaballah did not say how the Egyptian archaeologists came to
find the site. Other experts have said a farmer plowing his field
informed the government after finding some artifacts.

<HEADLINE> SADC Urged to Deal with Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Monday challenged member
countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to
quickly update their computer systems to avert the impending
economic and development catastrophe associated with the year 2000
(Y2K) millenium bug.
</P>
<P>
Dismus Kalingeme, Zambian Deputy Minister of Communications and
 Transport, urged the SADC members to put in place contingency
measures to avoid the catastrophe in critical areas such as
agriculture, public utilities and transport.
</P>
<P>
Services such as electricity, telecommunications, petroleum
products, railway and air transport systems are regionally
inter-linked, he said at the third SADC Y2K National Coordinators
Meeting opened here Monday .
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister called for compliance of all interdependent
systems and management of the likely risks of potential failure
with appropriate contingency measures.
</P>
<P>
Non-compliance could jeopardize efforts to positively transform
the respective economies and stifle sustainable growth in the
sub-region, said Kalingeme.
</P>
<P>
He said there is little time remaining to the deadline of
December 31, 1999, hence, the need for SADC countries to adopt and
use information and communication technology.
</P>
<P>
He warned that failure to address the Y2K problem could risk
SADC members being excluded from the information age.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being attended by national task force
coordinators from SADC members and other agencies.

<HEADLINE> SADC Allied Forces to Continue Presence in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said Monday that the allied forces of SADC (Southern African
Development Community) will continue their presence in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) until peace is restored in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the summit of SADC allied forces
here in Harare, Mugabe castigated Rwanda's unilateral ceasefire
declaration, describing it as a "gimmick".
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the announcement by Rwanda on the unilateral
declaration of ceasefire or a truce. We examined the situation
and established that the unilateral declaration was false and
deceptive to the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is need to continue seeking for peace in the DRC. The
allied forces are ready as long as the other side is ready for
peace. If they want to continue their act of aggression, we are
ready for them and they will never win this war," the president
reassured.
</P>
<P>
"We would rather have peaceful negotiations. The announcement
by Rwanda was a gimmick. We are prepared to go on for as long as
the DRC needs to regain its sovereignty," Mugabe noted.
</P>
<P>
The summit was attended by Namibian President Sam Nujoma,
Angolan President Eduardo Jose dos Santos and Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
DRC President Laurent Kabila failed to attend the meeting for
reasons not disclosed but was represented by his Foreign Minister
Abdoulaye Ndombasi and Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo.
</P>
<P>
The summit focused mainly on Rwanda's declaration, which was
announced a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The DRC has said the announcement was a way of allowing Rwandan
troops to regroup and receive reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has already signed a ceasefire deal with Kabila in Libya
and its troops have started pulling out.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, together with Angola, Namibia and Chad sent troops to
the DRC when rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda launched an attack
on Kabila's troops last August.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Fish Production Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The fish production of Angola, one
of the major fish producers in Africa, was 202,900 tons last year,
down by 16.1 percent from that of the previous year, Angola's
Ministry of Fisheries revealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the ministry blamed the reduction on the
decrease of catch on the part of foreign fleets, which was, in the
case of 1998, 45,780 tons, merely 41 percent of that in 1997 .
</P>
<P>
Therefore, despite the increase of production by domestic
fishing ships, which had been up by eight percent to 157,148 tons,
the total production was in a downward trend.
</P>
<P>
Although the report did not give explanation for the sharp
decrease of production by foreign ships, officials from the
ministry disclosed that the faltering peace process in the
southern African country was the major factor.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that every year, the country is entitled to a
total of 850,000 tons of fish resources which have commercial
catch value.
</P>
<P>
Angola currently has fishing cooperation agreements with the
European Union and Russia. Countries such as the Republic of
Korea and Kuwait also have fishing ships in the country.

The two sides are continuing efforts to hold a five-way summit
including Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians to
coordinate and forge a unified Arab stand on the coming stage of
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the PNA stressed that a just, comprehensive and
lasting peace in the Middle East is a must, which requires
Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Regional peace will not be realized unless the Palestinians'
legitimate rights to self-determination and establishment of their
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital are secured, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt renewed support for the Palestinians' rights to
self-determination and an independent state.

<P>
Egypt and the PNA called on Israel's new government under Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak, leader of the moderate Labor Party, to
implement the agreements signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak ousted hard-line Likud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in Israel's May 17 elections. He has pledged to push forward the
peace talks with the Palestinians and resume negotiations with
Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for Political Flexibility in Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania Monday called on
African countries to develop a culture of political flexibility in
dealing with conflicts that has been perplexing the continent for
dozens of years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Conference on Conflict Management and Peace
Keeping in Africa held in northern town of Arusha, Tanzanian Vice
President Omar Ali Juma said a government should take initiative
for dialog with other parties whenever signs of a conflict emerge.
</P>
<P>
"That should not be considered as sign of weakness," Juma said
in his opening address. "On the contrary, a government which is
ready to talk with its adversaries is strong and confident in its
institutions."
</P>
<P>
He told the delegates which include defense ministers and
chiefs of armed forces from eastern and southern Africa that it
should be avoided to present ready made solutions and taking sides
in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"No amount of good will from a third party can replace the
voluntary decision by those involved to resolve their differences
peacefully," he added.
</P>
<P>
Juma urged African leaders to establish the democratic system
of governing which guarantees the people's right to elect the
leadership of their favor.
</P>
<P>
"Lust for power, arrogance and selfishness, corruption and
poverty are among others that lead to conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Juma raised concern with the peace keeping forces in Africa and
 elsewhere in the world, saying they are sometimes compelled to
resort to combat when they do not have a mandate to do it.
</P>
<P>
"The international community needs to define clearly the role
of peace keeping force in conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian vice-president also strongly decried the use of
children in conflicts as the practice definitely defeats any
attempt at creating a culture of peace among African youths.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Juma called upon African leaders to give support to the
Lusaka peace process because comprehensive dialog is the only way
out of this impasse.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Yugoslavia Waiting For UNSC Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Both Yugoslavia and NATO are
waiting for a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution
which is being scrutinized in Bonn by Group of Eight foreign
ministers after talks between NATO and Yugoslavia generals broke
down early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters here on Monday that
the alliance "very much want a U.N. Security Council resolution".
"We want it as soon as possible, we are redoubling our efforts in
that direction and that is why there is going to be this meeting
of the G8 in Bonn today," he said.
</P>
<P>
The G8 foreign ministers from the United States, Canada,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia are holding a
meeting in Bonn to hammer out a draft text of a UNSC resolution on
Kosovo crisis, which Britain said Russia is resisting because
Russia's Balkan envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin was accused by his
political rivals of selling his country's interests during his
shuttle diplomatic effort over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Now the main rub is that the NATO allies insist on
international presence in Kosovo with NATO at its core, but Russia
has its own proposal, according to U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin, who is accompanying U.S. Secretary of State Albright
in Boon, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said that some progress was being made but
"extremely difficult issue remained", such as the establishment of
a civil presence after a Serb pullout from Kosovo, the southern
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. President Bill Clinton has reportedly phoned
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in an apparant bid to ease
Russia's concerns over the Kosovo settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Trey Cate said in Macedonia earlier that one of
main sticking points in weekend talks between the alliance and
Yugoslav military commanders was "that the Serbs want a Security
Council resolution passed" before NATO troops enter into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said NATO was happy with the way things had
gone. "There are still some military arrangements to be made," he
said, adding that "NATO stands ready to continue the talks
whenever they are required and needed".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shea said at NATO headquarters in Brussels that the
talks "have not been broken off, they have been suspended, but we
are ready to resume at any time".
</P>
<P>
Shea told reporters that the Yugoslav authorities presented
proposals that "simply failed to guarantee the safe return of the
refugees, the protection of all of the people of Kosovo and the
complete withdrawal of the Serb forces, and that was not
acceptable".
</P>
<P>
Some analysts here believe, it is important that a UNSC
resolution to be acceptable for both sides should be voted as soon
as possible to pave the way for political settlement in the
war-torn Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Kenya Meet on Border Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ethio-Kenyan border
administrators committee began its annual meeting Monday in
Nazareth town, some 90 km southeast of the Ethiopian capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Maurice S.M. Makhanu,
head of the Kenyan delegation and provincial commissioner of the
North Eastern Province, said at the opening of the two-day meeting
that the two east African neighbors enjoy long standing friendly
relations which they maintain through joint annual discussions.
</P>
<P>
However, he said some areas along the border of the two
countries have since recently witnessed destructive moves by
anti-peace elements, and added that 10 of the 11 terrorists of the
Oromo Liberation Front found destabilizing peace inside Kenya have
been brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
Alemeseged Gebreamlak, vice police commissioner and head of the
 Ethiopian delegation, suggested that the two countries should
intensify joint efforts to do away with anti-peace activities
along their common border.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries should maintain friendly relations
and strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The 19-member Kenyan delegation, which consists officials from
the ministry of defense, immigration, police and customs office of
the east African country, arrived here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A protocol is expected to be signed between the two countries
at the conclusion of the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
A similar Ethiopian delegation will visit Kenya before the end
of this year for a meeting on border relations.

<P>
ATHENS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said Monday that despite the complications in the talks
between the military representatives of NATO and Yugoslavia in
Macedonia, there was no impasse and peace was on the way.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a government meeting chaired by Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis, Papandreou said that technical matters
were the focus of the talks in Macedonia while the seven Western
countries and Russia, known as the Group of Eight, were discussing
the details of a U.N. resolution on the issue in Bonn, Germany,
and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaar was holding contacts with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Greek people believed that despite the minor difficulties
in the negotiations, peace was coming, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the collapse of the two-day negotiations between NATO and
Yugoslav military officials in Macedonia, NATO threatened Monday
that it would intensify its air campaign against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Tanzania to Link up Railway Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government is to put up
a railway line linking Tanzania, which runs from Isaka to Kigali,
Vincent Biruta, Rwandan Minister of Public Service, Transport and
Communication, told the Rwanda News Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The railway line construction is aimed at reducing goods which
can be transported by vehicles from Mombasa (Kenyan port) and
Dar-es-Salaam (Tanzanian capital) that had become an effect on the
Rwandan economy due to an increase in the prices of the
commodities," Biruta indicated.
</P>
<P>
"The railway running from Isaka to Kigali is 480 km. However,
funds to put up the construction are not yet assessed," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We found out that it would be cheaper, if people used railway
transport from Dar-es-Salaam to Isaka and then off load and load
trucks from Isaka to Kigali. The railway line will reduce the
transport burden for Rwanda," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Tanzanian government agreed to
remove the transit bonds that was formerly charged on transit
goods through Tanzania to Rwanda, especially sugar.
</P>
<P>
"The Tanzanian Revenue Authority Chiefs had increased taxes on
transit goods since early this year which had seriously increased
the transportation cost", Biruta noted.
</P>
<P>
A commission made up of Tanzanian and Rwandan representatives
from the harbor, revenue authority, transport and railway sectors
has just been set up to coordinate in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Angola Worried over Decreasing Humanitarian Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Affected by the current crisis in
the Balkans, the humanitarian assistance to Angola from
international organization has reduced 50 percent, which has
caused great concern on the part of the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Albino Malungo, Angolan Minister of Assistance and Social
Reintegration, complained that many officials of international
organizations previously working in Angola have shifted to Kosovo
or its neighboring regions since NATO launched air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
For instance, said Malungo, the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) has injected large amount of efforts in the
rescue work in Kosovo. However, it is unable to help the one
million hungry refugees in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The current international assistance to Angola only accounts
for 50 percent of their pledges, and they are not willing to offer
more, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angolan government, there are now altogether
over 1.6 million refugees in the southern African country. The
government said it is unable to provide relief to such a large
number of refugees and has to resort to international assistance.
</P>
<P>
The lack of fund and aid has worsened the conditions of the
refugees in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday banned import of food
of European origin following confirmed information that Belgian
poultry is contaminated with dioxin, a deadly chemical.
</P>
<P>
The customs authorities at Cairo International Airport began
applying a decision in this regard taken by the Ministry of Trade
and Supply, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ban applies to birds, poultry, frozen meat and livestock,
eggs, fodder and processed food which have components, such as
chocolate, and cakes, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
A customs official at the airport told the news agency that
Egypt does not import poultry or eggs from Europe or from anywhere
else. The import ban was issued to protect Egyptian consumers, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili said in a
statement Monday that the ban is a temporary measure and will be
lifted when it is established that commodities from Europe are not
contaminated with dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili demanded the European side provide Egypt with all
information as regards the contamination of poultry and some kinds
of meat with the deadly chemical dioxin.

<P>
A statement, issued via his spokesman, said, "The
Secretary-General today expressed deep concern at the deteriorating
humanitarian situation in Angola where the extremely precarious
security situation now requires the distribution of most
humanitarian aid by air, an effort threatened by lack of funding."
</P>
<P>
"If funds are not immediately made available for air
transportation, the entire humanitarian effort will stop and
hundreds of thousands of Angolans will face severe malnutrition,
disease and death," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General appeals for the cooperation of the
Government of Angola and UNITA to allow for access to all those in
need of assistance, and to the international donor community, to
urgently support humanitarian activities in Angola to avoid to
massive human tragedy," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as the U.N. Security Council was meeting
in a closed-door session to hear a briefing on the U.N.
sanctions against Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has accused UNITA, the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, of renegating on a 1994
peace accord that called for disarming its fighters.
</P>
<P>
The southwest African nation plunged back into civil war in
December 1998 in the final breakdown of the peace accord when
the government tried to ferret out UNITA fighters but failed to
capture all the diamond-rich areas they control.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations in February closed down its peacekeeping
operation in Angola. The Angolan Government also forced it to pull
out all its political personnel, who had sought to communicate
with UNITA. U.N. humanitarian personnel remain in the country but
are restricted in their travels.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Increase Oil Production Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Southern Oil Company will
increase its daily crude production to 2.3 million barrels by next
year from the current 1.5 million barrels, said head of the
company on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Southern Oil Company Raffid al-Dubuni told
reporters that his company had started to invest in West of Qurna
oilfield stage one whose daily production will reach 80,000
barrels per day (bpd) by the coming August.
</P>
<P>
Dubuni said earlier that the total reserve of the West of Qurna
oilfield was put around 20 billion barrels. Work in the oilfield
stopped in 1990 following the U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said that his company was also making efforts to increase
the production capacity of the Makman oilfield, part of Rumaila
oilfields, to 50,000 bpd. He did not give its current production
level.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Oil Company is the most important and largest one
among the three major oil companies in Iraq. Northern Oil Company
and Central Oil Company are in charge of the oil fields in the
north and center of the country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed said earlier this
month that his country was planning to increase oil production to
3 million bpd by the end of this year and to more than 3.5 million
bpd by the end of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Oil installations in the south of the country are in dire need
of equipment and spare parts to rehabilitate, said Dubuni.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the U.N. Sanctions Committee is still
holding 57 out of 200 contracts his company signed in the fourth
phase of the oil-for-food program, which expired last November.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was allowed to import 300 million U.S. dollars worth of
oil spare parts in each of the fourth and fifth phase of the
oil-for-food deal to increase its production and export capacity.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British representatives
in the Sanctions Committee of blocking the approval of its
contracts under various flimsy pretexts.

<HEADLINE> Georgian, Abkhaz Sides Meet on Confidence-building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian and Abkhaz
sides had begun their meeting on confidence-building measures in
Istanbul under the chairmanship of the Special Representative of
the U.N. Secretary-General for Georgia, Liviu Bota, U.N. said here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is part of the Geneva process, launched at the
initiative of the Secretary-General and aimed at achieving a
comprehensive settlement of the conflict in Abkhaz, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Participants include the Georgian delegation led by State
Minister Vazha Lordkipanidzc, the Abkhaz delegation led by Sergel
Bagapsh, and representatives of the Russian Federation as
facilitator, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, and the group of friends of the U.N. Secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba was also present at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, the Special Representative noted that
the passing of time alone was not enough to heal wounds, restore
mutual confidence or bring about a solution of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that confidence was not a theoretical construct,
but rather, it was achieved on the basis of the hard
work and the political will of the sides, through concrete
projects that produce material, measurable results.
</P>
<P>
The Special Representative encouraged the members of the
Georgian and Abkhaz delegations to overcome any reservations they
might have and to talk informally with one another and discuss
issues of concern.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai General Motor
Corporation today signed agreements with the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, the China Construction Bank, and the
Shanghai Automobile Group's financial company to provide
installment loans for the purchase of its new Buick saloon cars,

After making an application to the GM's franchise service
centers, potential buyers will receive an answer within seven
working days and the loans needed within another two working days,
and they can leave the procedures with the bank to the service
centers.

<HEADLINE> Primitive Bacteria Could Grow On Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- One of the most tantalizing
questions facing scientists is whether life could exist on Mars.
Now a researcher from the University of Arkansas has found new
evidence that primitive bacteria could survive in the harsh
conditions on the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
According to Monday's Washington Post, Timothy A. Kral tried
to mimic Martian conditions by mixing ash from Hawaiian
volcanoes, which is known to share certain chemical
characteristics found in Martian soil, with carbon dioxide,
hydrogen and various amounts of water in test tubes.
</P>
<P>
Kral then added a very primitive type of bacteria known as
methanogens, which are found deep in the ocean, in Earth's crust
and in cows' stomachs. The microbes don't need oxygen to
survive, existing instead on nitrogen and hydrogen to make
methane.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his research last week at a meeting of the
American Society for Microbiology in Chicago, Kral said that the
bacteria grew in the simulated Martian soil, even when water was
extremely limited, as it is believed to be on Mars.

<HEADLINE> Most Americans Oppose U.S. Involvement in Kosovo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of Americans
believe it was a mistake for the United States to get involved
in the war against Yugoslavia, according to a new Washington
Post survey published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the percentage of Americans critical of
the war has steadily increased, even following the announcement
Thursday that Yugoslavia had accepted NATO's terms for peace.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, 47 percent of people surveyed said it was a
"mistake" for the United States to launch air attacks against
Yugoslavia, up from 40 percent in early April.
</P>
<P>
"We need to extract ourselves from the situation as soon as
we can," said Andy Driver, 37, of Zebulon, North Carolina, who
was interviewed in the survey.
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad decision from the start. I really don't feel
that we should put U.S. military personnel in harm's way for a
European civil war," he said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted just before NATO announced that talks on
the peace plan with Yugoslavia had ended with no agreement, showed
that Americans are sharply divided over the role the U.S.
government is playing in Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than half of those surveyed--48 percent--agreed that
the United States "did the right thing" in getting involved in
the military conflict. That is down from 54 percent in last
month's poll and the first time in a Washington Post survey that
a majority failed to support the U.S. decision to launch the air
campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of those interviewed--48 percent--said they
opposed sending 7000 U.S. ground troops into Kosovo as part of a
NATO peace keeping force once a peace agreement is finalized. 46
percent supported the plan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Province Invites Tenders for 2,100 Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province is
inviting businesses to pitch for over 2,100 projects involving a
total investment of 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today by Zhang Weiwen, the executive
chairman of the organizing committee of the 1999 Zhejiang
Investment and Trade Fair, which opens here Tuesday in the capital
of Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the projects range from
machinery, electronics, medicine and chemicals to infrastructure,
tourism, agriculture, construction materials and many other
sectors, adding that 166 projects would be strongly recommended to
investors.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang boasts one of the most developed regional economies in
China. In 1998, its economic size ranked fourth among all the
Chinese provinces, while its gross domestic product per capita
stood at 1,300 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is also one of the Chinese regions with the strongest non-
state-owned economy. Latest figures show that the province has
over 100,000 private businesses producing 40 percent of its
industrial added value.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the province had approved over 15,500
overseas funded enterprises, with a contracted overseas investment
of 19.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far 48 of the world's top 500 multinational firms have
invested a total of 1.86 billion dollars in machinery, electronics,
petroleum, food, chemicals and other projects in the province.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Situation Improves in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The poverty situation in Bangladesh
is improving as the people under the extreme poverty-line has
declined by 1 percent during the past four years, Muhammad Yunus,
managing director of the Grameen (Rural) Bank, said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very good news for all of us that Bangladesh has made
headway in improving the poverty situation as global people under
extreme poverty-line has increased to 1.5 billion in 1999 from 1.2
billion in 1992," he told the closing session of a two-day
conference on poverty alleviation strategies.
</P>
<P>
Global commitment to reducing poverty by 50 percent by the year
2015 could be achieved through proper and skilled interventions of
the concerned people, said Yunus, who is also the architect of the
Grameen Bank, which was established particularly to distribute
micro-credits to the country's poor to help them eventually
achieve self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
Micro-credit intervention has opened huge opportunities of
self-employment and self-development for millions of people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 126 million people still live under the
poverty line in Bangladesh, one of the world least developed
countries.

<HEADLINE> India Vows to Evict Infiltrators From Kargil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian Army and Air Force
spokesmen said here Monday that the Indian Army was well poised to
soon evict "infiltrators" from the Kargil sector of Kashmir as the
Indian Air Force continued air strikes in the area.
</P>
<P>
The air force spokesman told a press briefing that Indian Air
Force jets pounded positions occupied by the "infiltrators" in
Drass, the Mushkoh valley and areas northwest of Drass.
</P>
<P>
The air force said the air strikes, which started on May 26,
were "successful."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the army Monday continued using artillery,
mortars and direct firing weapons to "degrade the combat potential
of the intruders" in the Kargil sector, inflicting heavy
casualties on them, the army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy exchange of artillery and mortar shelling continued in
Kanzalwan, Keran, Poonch and Nowshera along the Line of Control
and the Indian Army gave an "adequate and effective reply" to the
enemy, the army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At least 221 Pakistani Army regulars have been killed since the
operation began on May 6 while the figure of the Indian
mercenaries killed was still being collated, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Army Monday rejected as "absolutely false" New
Delhi's assertion that the Indian Army killed 221 Pakistani troops
in Kashmir over the past one month. Military spokesman Brigadier
Rashid Qureshi put Pakistan Army casualties during India's
four-week military operation against infiltration in Kargil and
Drass at 20 killed and 12 wounded.
</P>
<P>
In sequel to a recent government decision, Delhi police Monday
prohibited any person in the capital from operating cables,
organizing or showing instigating telecast including that of
Pakistan TV on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
An External Affairs Ministry spokesman told reporters here
Monday that India termed as "extremely dangerous" Pakistan's
persistent efforts in questioning the validity of the Line of
Control along the Kashmir border.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Seeks Strengthened Cooperation With United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia told the United
Nations Monday that it "is fully open" to "regular contacts and
cooperation" with the world body, particularly in the process of
seeking a political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The statement was contained in a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan from Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic, which is being distributed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav foreign minister said, the Yugoslav acceptance of
a peace plan, hammered out by Russian and Western powers, "has
created conditions and a need for regular contacts and cooperation
between the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is fully open to this
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The concretization of the principles of the just-accepted
peace plan calls, no doubt, for the participation of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia in these activities as well, in view of the
fact that the process of the implementation of the United Nations
Security Council resolution will take place in a part of its
sovereign territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that in that sense our representatives will be
enable to present their view on the draft resolution, and that an
appropriate agreement will be concluded later on between the
Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the United
Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The letter came as Russia and seven major Western countries
are preparing a draft resolution to be submitted for approval by
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia, both permanent members of the Security
Council which have veto power on the 15-nation body, are firmly

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Sets Conditions for Indo-Pak Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Caretaker Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said here Monday evening that the talks between
India and Pakistan could be held only on one issue -- how
Islamabad proposes to end its armed intrusion in the Kargil sector
of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast to the nation, he asked Pakistan to "undo" the
armed intrusion. He said that if the stratagem now was that the
intrusion should be used to alter the Line of Control (LOC), the
"proposed talks will end before they have begun."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in his telephone
conversation over the hotline with his Indian counterpart,
Vajpayee, on May 28 proposed to send his foreign minister to New
Delhi for talks with Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant
Singh over the Kargil crisis and Vajpayee accepted the proposal.
Aziz had planned to come to New Delhi on Monday, but India
rejected his proposal saying the date was not convenient for
India, which is expected to find another date for the talks.
</P>
<P>
"India is always open to talks. But the talks must have a
definite, specific purpose. In the present instance, the subject
is one and one alone: the intrusion and how Pakistan proposes to
undo it. To discuss this, our doors are always open and all dates
are convenient to us," Vajpayee said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Pakistan of violating the Simla Agreement and using
force in an attempt to unilaterally alter the LOC.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan side in a joint media briefing by the Foreign
Ministry and the army in Islamabad Monday reiterated an earlier
statement made by Aziz that the LOC was not clearly demarcated and
asked India to stop its continued military action against
"Kashmiri freedom fighters." Pakistan also accused India of being
on a "war path" and alleged that Indian fighter jets once again
dropped bombs on its territory and assaulted its posts across the
Line of Control in Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Blames Malaysia for Leaking Negotiation Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Foreign Ministry
Monday blamed Malaysian officials for the alleged leakage of the
details of secret talks between the two countries and the
distortion of water trading between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore was surprised that Malaysian officials had chosen to
leak details of confidential negotiations still in progress to the
Malaysian press in a distorted form," a spokesman of the ministry
said in a response to inquiries from the press regarding an
article published in the June 5 edition of the Star.
</P>
<P>
"The Malaysians were the ones who had wanted the discussions to
be kept confidential. They seem to have changed their minds," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Star reported that Malaysia has asked Singapore to look
elsewhere for its future water needs after Singapore refused to
budge from its demand that Johor, Malaysia's southern-most state
bordering Singapore, double its water supply to Singapore under a
new 100-year agreement ending in 2161.
</P>
<P>
In his comment, the spokesman warned that if the talks failed
to make as much progress as expected, the blame would be placed on
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing agreements of 1961 and 1962, Johor is bound
to supply 350 million gallons of raw water a day to Singapore
until the year 2061.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Singapore has always told Malaysia
that its request for water beyond 2061 is contingent on Malaysia
satisfying its own water needs first.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore has also proposed that part of our long-term water
requirements could be met by Pahang," another state of Malaysia,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman affirmed that his country would take a
constructive approach at the negotiations and look forward to the
next round, which is to be hosted by Malaysia in June or August.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the two neighbors have met in three rounds of
talks this year for a package to solve problems between the two
countries.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said Monday that NATO should "immediately" stop its air
strikes against Yugoslavia as an essential condition for settling
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The return of refugees at a time when bombings are in progress
is more problematic that before," Stepashin said after a meeting
here his visiting Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin called for a greater role for Bulgaria in the
settlement efforts. "We must sort out problems in our own house,"
the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kostov, for his part, praised Russia's role in drafting the
peace plan, noting that "the return of the (ethnic) Albanian
refugees to their homes in Kosovo is the key to the resolution of
the conflict in the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
Kostov, who arrived here Sunday on a working visit, said
Stepashin had accepted an invitation to visit Bulgaria and that
the two prime ministers had agreed to set up a telephone hotline

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Early results of Indonesia's
general election showed that the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) was temporarily leading in some areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the data issued by the National Election Committee
(PPI) at 22:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Monday, the PDI-P was
leading in the early results of some areas in Jakarta, Surabaya,
Bandung and Batam and the provinces of Central Java, Bali and East
Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Golkar Party was second in some areas and in the
lead in some areas of Central Sulawesi Province.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that most of the final results will come out on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar had ruled Indonesia for 32 years under former
President Soeharto until his forced resignation last year.
</P>
<P>
General Chairman of the Golkar Party Akbar Tanjung Monday said
the party is ready to accept defeat if the people do not support
it anymore.
</P>
<P>
The party chief however expressed his belief that the Golkar
Party will command at least 40 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Monday's parliamentary election will choose 462 members of the
500-seat House of Representatives. The remaining 38 members have
been allotted for the military, whose members do not vote.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia's Commander to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) Antoine Lahd plans to formally announce his
resignation by the end of this month, Lebanese security sources
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lahd, 70, might resign after newly elected Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak forms his government, and then he is likely to
go into temporary exile in Israel while seeking asylum from
France, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Lahd's family has been living in France since he escaped an
assassination attempt in the Israeli-occupied southern Lebanese
town of Marjayoun 10 years ago, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The militia's intelligence chief Akl Hashem might take over the
SLA's top command, according to Al Manar television network of
Lebanon's leading anti-Israeli guerrilla group Hezbollah reported
</P>
<P>
Dozens of senior SLA officers have also applied for asylum in
Sweden and Norway, and hope to leave south Lebanon soon in light of
a possible Israeli withdrawal within a year, a pledge that Barak
has made during his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the 2,500-strong SLA completed its pullout from
Jezzine it has held since 1985, the year when the SLA was
established to help Israel patrol its occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal, widely seen as a prelude to the Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon, was believed to be a result of
Hezbollah's attacks in the past 14 years that killed a total of
150 SLA militiamen and wounded 400 others.
</P>
<P>
Some 203 SLA members have opted to stay in Jezzine, just north
of the Israeli occupied zone, and 145 of them have already
surrendered to the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss has said that all the
militiamen who surrendered will have to stand trial on charges of
collaborating with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine clerics and lawmakers have set up committees to ensure
that former and current SLA members are given a fair deal by the
government.
</P>
<P>
But the defectors fear they will be given harsh punishment
including the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Lahd and his senior officials have been sentenced to death in
absentia by Lebanese courts.

<HEADLINE> India Continues to Bomb LoC Area: Pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Monday that Indian
aircraft pounded the areas close to the Line of Control (LoC) in
Kashmir with rockets and bombs over the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"Two bombs fell on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control
but no damage was done," Brigadier Rashid Qureshi, director
general of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) of Pakistan,
told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"There has been air activity by India on and near the LoC," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that there has also been artillery fire on Pakistani
positions opposite to the Kargil-Drass sector. "India shelled some
six kilometers deep into the Pakistani side of the LoC."
</P>
<P>
Qureshi said Indian forces also tried to move toward Pakistani
positions at two or three points at the LoC. "They were beaten
back with casualties."
</P>
<P>
He said there has been excessive artillery fire by the Indian
side across the LoC over the last one month in the Kargil area.
</P>
<P>
A total of 22 civilians have been killed and 52 wounded on the
Pakistani side opposite to the Kargil area in the month of May as
against seven deaths and 41 injured in the corresponding period
last year, according to the spokesman.
</P>

"It shows there has been twice the number of casualties in May
this year as compared to those in May last year," he said.

<HEADLINE> Women's Human Rights Continue to Be Disregraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (xinhua) -- Women's human rights
continue to be disregarded and violated all over the world
although in different ways and to varying degrees, U.N. Deputy
Secretary-General Frechette Louise said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing on the occasion of commemorating the 20th anniversary
of the adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Discrimination against Women, Frechette said women are still victims
of rape and sexual violence in the home, in war and in other forms
of conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the world's poor, and of its illiterates, are
women. Women continue to earn 75 percent, or less, of every dollar
earned by men, Women are more commonly found in part-time work, in
the informal sector, among the unemployed and the underemployed,"
the Deputy Secretary-General said.
</P>
<P>
"Women's work in subsistence farming and in family enterprises
is ignored in conventional statistics such as gross national
produce, and there are no social security, health or old age
benefiting attached to such work. Women are also deprived of basic
health rights," she said.
</P>
<P>
Frechette said the adoption of the Convention was an essential
step on the way, but true equality for women requires work on many
fronts at once: building political will, creating an enabling
legal environment, raising awareness and practising advocacy.
</P>
<P>
It required programs and projects to level the playing field
for women in their access to resources, and in their opportunities
in public and private life; in politics and the economy, in the
arts and sciences, in sports and in communities, in the school,
the workplace and the home, she said.
</P>
<P>
Frechette added the United Nations is committed to working with
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against women
to achieving the goal of truly equal rights for women everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Adopted in 1979, the Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination against Women is the most comprehensive,
legally binding treaty on women's human rights. It calls on
States parties to take appropriate measures to ensure women's
civil, political, economic and cultural rights and legal
equality.

<HEADLINE> Rahanwein Resistance Army Takes Baidoa Town in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA) Monday claimed that the RRA forces had captured the town of
Baidoa, 245 kms southwest of Somali capital Mogadishu, from the
forces of faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the RRA, Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh, said in
Mogadishu that his forces are now still chasing the fleeing
militiamen of Aidid in the bush surrounding Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an official press statement issued here Monday,
the office of Aidid declared that they lost Baidoa Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that Aidid's forces in Baidoa were
attacked by what they called forces from Tigre of Ethiopia who
according to them shelled the town indiscriminately and massacred
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Radio of the Aidid's faction also said that the Tigre troops,
who earlier captured the towns of Dolow, Bulo Hawo, Luq and
several other towns in Gedo region, are now further advancing
towards the airport of Ballidogleh, the only tarmac airport which
is only 90 kms south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Ballidogleh, the largest air defensive airport for the late
regime, airport is a major source of revenue for Aidid's faction.
</P>
<P>
But the RRA denied forces from Ethiopia were fighting
alongside with its fighters.
</P>
<P>
However, civilians who fled Baidoa confirmed Monday morning
that the fighters on the RRA side were using more than 60 battle
wagons including anti-aircraft machine guns mounted with
binoculars.
</P>
<P>
An independent source confirmed that more than 20 battle wagons
 belonging to Aidid's faction were either destroyed or captured.
</P>
<P>
A man who fled Baidoa said he has seen eight of Aidid's battle
wagons blazing at the southern entrance of Baidoa town.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, travelers who reached Mogadishu Monday afternoon said
that Aidid's forces using dozens of battle wagons are now
regrouping in Bur Hakaba town, about 30 kms south of Baidoa town
on the way to Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The statement of the Aidid's office also said the extent of
damage and casualties are beyond count.
</P>
<P>
However, militia sources said that 23 of Aidid's fighters are
confirmed dead, while many more are still missing.
</P>
<P>
More wounded militiamen from Aidid's faction had been pouring
into the treatment centers of south Mogadishu since Sunday
especially increasing in number at night.
</P>
<P>
A driver, who escaped the fighting in Baidoa but lost his
civilian Land cruiser to the RRA fighters, said that it was the
most serious attack the RRA fighters had ever launched on the
militia bases of Aidid in the town.
</P>
<P>
One of the wounded militiamen also said the attacking men were
more than 500. The heavily-armed men, who launched their
offensive from every corner, especially concentrated their attack
in the heart of the town, thus separating Aidid's militiamen who
were based on both ends of the town.
</P>
<P>
The wounded man, who asked not to be named, said that he could
not mention the identity of the men attacking Baidoa, but he said
this could not have been done by the RRA alone.

<HEADLINE> Cease-fire in Congo (K) Beneficial to Uganda: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Cessation of hostilities and a
practical cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
will be good to everyone involved in the 10-month-long armed
conflict, an official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
said here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zia Ebrahim-Zadeh, IMF resident representative in Uganda, told
reporters in Bank of Uganda that the cease of war in the DRC will
be "a relief" to all parties including Uganda obviously.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the loss brought by the war, the IMF official
said:"The war in Congo is very difficult to assess in terms of
trade. I don't have the figures as to the volume of trade between
Uganda and the eastern part of Congo."
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire would undoubtedly help Uganda economically, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is reported to have spent 2.2 percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP) on defense, well above the limit of 1.9
percent, prompting the IMF to delay its disbursement of 18 million
U.S. dollars to the east African country.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said that in the coming budget to be released
on June 10 of this year, the defense spending will be reduced to
120 million dollars, a decrease by about 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's involvement in the war in the DRC is often blamed for
the soaring defense spending and the faltering financial sector.

<HEADLINE> Iran Congratulates Lebanon for Jezzine Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Monday extended a telegram to Lebanese Prime Minister
Salim Hoss to congratulate the return of Jezzine to Lebanon,
Lebanese National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) last Thursday
completed its unilateral withdrawal from Jezzine it has held since
1985, the year the militia was established to help Israel patrol
its occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that the SLA militia left Jezzine, a
onetime largest Christian town in south Lebanon, amid Hezbollah
guerrillas' continued attacks.
</P>
<P>
The 2500-strong SLA suffered heavy casualties in the past 14
years with a total of 150 militiamen killed and 400 others wounded
by Hezbolla guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also delivered a similar congratulation message to
Saayed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, which is spearheading a guerrilla war to oust the
Israeli occupation forces and SLA out of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 2 tons of illicit drugs were
seized in Iran's northeastern province of Khorasan last week,
Bahram Noruzi, the provincial commander of the Iranian security
forces announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Noruzi said that
the drugs were confiscated in armed clashes with 15 traffickers in
the vicinity of the city Torbat Heydarieh.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that his forces have so far conducted 63
operations and confiscated 11.3 tons of narcotics, including 1.9
tons of morphine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
In these operations, 39 of bandits were killed, seven injured,
1,746 smugglers were arrested, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Puts bin Laden, Kopp on Most-Wanted List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation on Monday put alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden and
abortion foe James Kopp on its ten most wanted list.
</P>
<P>
Saudi-born bin Laden has been indicted in the United States for
allegedly masterminding the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania in August 1998, which killed more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
After the embassy bombings, the United States launched cruise
missile attacks against camps used by bin Laden's group in eastern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The United States also bombed a chemical plant in Sudan. But
because there was no evidence to show that the plant had produced
ingredients for nerve gas, which the United States alleged had
been supplied to bin Laden, Washington has to do compensation for
the plant's losses for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Kopp is wanted for allegedly killing Barnett Slepian, a doctor
who performed abortions, at Slepian's home in Amherst, New York,
on Oct. 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden and Kopp replace two Libyans, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Mergahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah on the FBI list. The two
Libyans were accused of bombing a Pan Am flight on Dec. 21, 1988,
killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
They were taken off the list after Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi agreed in April to hand them over for trial in the
Netherlands as a neutral venue.

<HEADLINE> Wreckage of U.S. Crash Plane Moved into Hangar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The broken fuselage of an
American Airlines plane which crash-landed was carefully removed
Monday from the riverbank where it came to rest and trucked to a
hangar for what could be months of detailed examination.
</P>
<P>
Flight 1420 with 145 passengers and crew aboard landed in a
storm on June 1, then skidded off the end of the runway, broke
apart and caught fire, killing nine people including the pilot and
injuring 83 others at the Little Rock National Airport in Arkansas
State of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Four tarpulin-covered tractor-trailers carried the pieces of
the plane from the south bank of the Arkansas River Monday morning
to a private hangar across the airport grounds, where crews began
unloading them. The wreckage could remain in the hangar up to a
year.
</P>
<P>
Members of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
have focused on two key questions in the first days of their probe
-- whether an incoming thunderstorm contributed to the crash and
whether two systems for slowing the plane on landing worked and
were operated properly.
</P>
<P>
The NTSB has said that all evidence to far was preliminary and
must be carefully checked against other facts still to emerge.
</P>
<P>
Removing the wreckage from the crash site gives investigators
their first chance at recovering on board computers that could
disclose whether the plane's spoilers, reverse thrusters and
braking systems were functioning properly when the crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have recovered and are analyzing the plane's
flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder and have
interviewed witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The crash of the McDonnell Douglas Super 80 was the first fatal
accident in U.S. commercial air traffic in more than two years.

ATHENS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said Monday that all arrangements regarding
implementation of the Kosovo peace agreement must be operational
immediately and comprehensively under U.N. responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He said that the deployment of the multinational peacekeeping
force and the withdrawal of Serb forces must take place
simultaneously so as to prevent a vacuum, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The multinational peacekeeping force must be under unified
command on the basis of particular geographic sections of separate
administration, he said, adding that Greece would send a brigade,
about 800 men, including an engineering and a medical corps
battalion.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos said that permission for the transit of NATO
forces through northern Greece for Kosovo would be given in the
next few days when technical issues were ironed out for immediate
implementation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it would be the responsibility of the
international security force to disarm the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the European Union (EU), the U.S. and
international organizations to bolster the Balkan region's
security and provide sizeable amounts of economic aid for its
stabilization.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Pledges to Continue Democratic Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- President-in-waiting Thabo
Mbeki Monday night accepted the final results of South Africa's
second all-race election and promised to keep on the democratic
process.
</P>
<P>
"There is nobody who can seek to change this system to take
away from people this right to govern," he said after the final
result were announced in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was making an impromptu address at the Independent
Electoral Commission's operations center in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He said the election was held in favor of its people being
freely able to say what they thought.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the government I want to say many, many thanks
(to the IEC) ," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also praised the political parties for their role in the
elections and the government officials who voluntarily helped to
ensure the elections ran smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary South Africans who had come out in their millions to
vote were also lauded.
</P>
<P>
"We need to say many, many thanks to the millions and millions
of our people, who said they, too, are the bedrock on which rests
this democratic system," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki jokingly indicated that Inkatha Freedom Party leader and
current Home Affairs Minister, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, was set to be
offered another cabinet position, as widely speculated in the
media.
</P>
<P>
"Let me take him out of the IFP and put him into government,"
Mbeki said when inviting Buthelezi up on the stage with him to
accept the election results on behalf of the government.
</P>
<P>
"I get into all sorts of problems with the things I say, (but)
I say them nevertheless."
</P>
<P>
Cornered by journalists on his way into the center, Buthelezi
said the possibility of becoming deputy president had not been
discussed with him.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would consider taking up the position if
offered it, Buthelezi answered: "That is like saying if you were
offered a box of chocolates, would you eat them?"
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said the IFP would abide by an earlier decision to
rule in coalition with the African National Congress in
KwaZulu-Natal.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Set up Panels on Angola Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday said that it looks forward to the appointment of members of
expert panels on sanctions against Angolan rebels' illegal trade
in diamonds and fuel to finance armed conflicts in the southwest
African country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council, Ismaila Baboucaar-Blaise Jagne of Gambia, said,
"Council members look forward both to the appointment of the
members of the expert panels established by the Security Council
resolution."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the 15-member Security Council met in
a closed-door session to hear briefing by Canadian Ambassador
Robert Fowler, who is also chairman of the Security Council's
Angola sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council received a briefing today from Ambassador
Fowler on his recent visit to the central and southern Africa as
chairman of the Sanctions Committee," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members warmly welcomed the briefing and indeed the
report, and expressed strong support for the work undertaken by
Ambassador Fowler and the energy and application that is being
brought to bear on the critically important issue of rendering
sanctions against UNITA more effective," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The recommendations, which Council members received today for
the first time, will be further discussed by the Sanctions
Committee," the statement said, adding that the Security Council
looks forward to Fowler's proposed visit to Europe in July.
</P>
<P>
Beginning May 10, Fowler made a 18-day visit in Africa, which
took him to South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola itself.
</P>
<P>
Fowler is expected to set up two panels of experts for a period
of six months, U.N. officials said. One will investigating the
illegal trade in diamonds and fuel by the rebel National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and how it manages its
finances, and the other will probe how the rebels are getting
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has accused UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi,
of renegating on a 1994 peace accord that calls for disarming its
fighters.
</P>
<P>
Angola plunged back into a civil war in December 1998 in the
final breakdown of the peace accord when the Angolan Government
tried to ferret out UNITA fighters, but failed to capture all the
diamond-rich areas under the rebel control.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations in February closed down its peacekeeping
operations in Angola. The Angolan Government also forced it to
pull out all its political personnel, who had sought to
communicate with UNITA. U.N. humanitarian personnel remain in the
country, but largely unable to get access to all refugees in need
of their assistance, due to deteriorating security situation in
the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator McCain Pulls Out of Party Straw Poll Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Arizona Senator John McCain
has announced that he will not compete in a high-profile straw
poll the Republican Party is running this summer, a report of the
Associated Press said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are planning the straw poll on August 14, and
expect 12,000 activists to show up and cast ballots in a test of
organizational strength likely to get heavy attention.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator McCain won't be among those competing for
backing, said spokesman Howard Opinsky.
</P>
<P>
"We have a strategy that's moving us forward at our own
timetable," Opinsky said. "We are not yielding any state to
anyone."
</P>
<P>
So far, eleven Republicans have announced their intention to
run for the White House, including Governor George W. Bush of
Texas, former Chairman of the U.S. Red Cross Committee Elizabeth
Dole, former Vice President Dan Quayle, former Governor of
Tennessee Lamar Alexander, commentator Pat Buchanan and publisher
Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
Polls show that George W. Bush holds a significant lead among
the candidates, followed at a distance by Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
Aides to George W. Bush said they were still mulling their
tactics for the straw poll, as Bush prepared for his initial
campaign swing this weekend.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing to study our options," said Bush spokesman
Eric Woolson.
</P>
<P>
MaCain's move comes as many of the Republican campaigns begin
to focus on the straw poll, hoping to use the event to demonstrate
they've built the ability to deliver supporters.
</P>
<P>
"I think the straw poll will be a significant test of
strength," said commentator Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
"It will measure not only the strength of organization, but who
has done the best in a short period of time. The straw poll, while
not decisive, is certainly important," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa's ANC One Seat Shy of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP) won 38 seats (up from seven in 1994)
and will return to parliament as the official opposition. The
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which confounded pollsters by coming
in third with 34 seats, was likely to be co-opted into the Thabo
Mbeki cabinet.
</P>
<P>
IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi was expected to be offered the
deputy presidency while a cabinet post was also mooted for the
party's deputy chairman, Ben Ngubane.
</P>
<P>
The once all-powerful New National Party (NNP), which in less
than a decade has seen its power diluted from ruling party to
junior partner in the government of national unity, further to
official opposition, has now been relegated to a minor opposition
role with 28 seats.
</P>
<P>
The United Democratic Movement, which fought its maiden
election, arrives in parliament with 14 seats, while the African
Christian Democratic Party has increased its 1994 count from two
to six seats.
</P>
<P>
The Pan Africanist Congress, the United Christian Democratic
Party and the Freedom Front will occupy three seats each, followed
by the Federal Alliance with two.
</P>
<P>
Azanian People's Organization, the Minority Front and the
Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging will be represented by one seat each.
A total of 15.9 million, or 89.28 percent of potential voters,
cast their ballots on June 2.
</P>
<P>
A euphoric IEC chairwoman, Brigalia Bam, said political parties
believed the commission had done a good job in running the polls.
</P>
<P>
"They think we are wonderful, and think we have done a good
job," she said before presenting Mbeki with a certified copy of
the election results.
</P>
<P>
Bam said all South Africans could be proud of the June 2
election, which 96 percent of respondents in a poll described as
free and fair.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the results, president-in-waiting Thabo Mbeki pledged
that democracy was in South Africa to stay.
</P>
<P>
"There is nobody who can seek to change this system, to take
away from people this right to govern," he said. Mbeki also
praised political parties for their conduct in the elections.
</P>
<P>
He thanked ordinary South Africans who had come out in their
millions to vote. Mbeki jokingly indicated that Buthelezi was set

election results on behalf of the government. Buthelezi said the
IFP would abide by an earlier decision to rule in coalition with
the African National Congress in KwaZulu- Natal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ANC indicated it would open talks with the NNP
in the Western Cape, in a bid to form a coalition government in
the province.
</P>
<P>
In both provinces, none of the parties have an absolute
majority and would have to govern in coalition with others.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet's Lawyers Won't Appeal UK's Extradition Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet's lawyers decided on Monday they will not return to the
High Court to ask for a judicial review of Home Secretary Jack
Straw's decision to allow extradition proceedings against him.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the High Court refused ten days ago
to grant the lawyers permission to challenge Straw's decision when
Justice Ognall said the challenge would simply hold up proceedings
and would benefit neither side.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to apply for permission to the full court.
The committal proceedings will go on as anticipated," said Michael
Caplan, a lawyer for the 83-year-old retired general.
</P>
<P>
The next phase of this long legal battle is scheduled to take
place in September when Pinochet, who was arrested in a London
hospital last October and is now under house arrest in a mansion
on the suburb of London, will face hearings on charges of torture
and conspiracy to torture.
</P>
<P>
Gen Pinochet's lawyers had previously questioned whether any
extradition crimes, offences which could be tried in both Spain
and Britain, would survive from the original extradition request.
</P>
<P>
On 24 March, the House of Lords, Britain's highest court,
drastically reduced the number and range of charges against
Pinochet, ruling that Pinochet could not be extradited for
tortures committed in Chile before December 1988, when the
International Torture Convention became binding on Spain, the UK
and Chile.
</P>
<P>
They did however rule that he did not enjoy blanket immunity
from arrest and extradition for crimes allegedly committed while
he was head of state.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, who first demanded
extradition for crimes allegedly committed during Pinochet's
1973-90 rule in Chile, then lodged a list of additional torture
allegations relating to incidents after December 1988.
</P>
<P>
Last week, at a hearing to set a date for the extradition
hearings, the high court ordered that the charges against Pinochet
should be finalised by 31 August so that any queries could be
lodged by the defence.
</P>
<P>
The full hearing was fixed for 27 September.

<HEADLINE> States of Oregon and New Hampshire lead U.S. in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce Department
said Monday that Oregon and New Hampshire were the two states
enjoying the fastest economic growth among the states in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Department's new report broke down the nation's gross
domestic product, the total output of goods and services, to show
the amount contributed by each state.
</P>
<P>
The total U.S. economy grew in 1997 by 4.3 percent, when
measured in current dollars, but the growth was 3.6 percent when
adjusted for inflation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest state gains in economic output were enjoyed by the
state of Oregon, where the economy increased by 7.6 percent, and
New Hampshire, close behind with a rise of 7.5 percent in its
gross state product. Hawaii was the only state with a drop in
output, declining 0.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new figures of the report showed the state with the biggest
economy remained California, where total output measured 1.03
trillion dollars in 1997, or 12.7 percent of the national total of
8.1 trillion dollars in the output of goods and services measured
in current dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Department said four other states with large shares of the
national gross domestic product were New York, 8 percent of the
national total; Texas, 7.4 percent; Illinois, 4.9 percent, and
Florida, which accounts for 4.7 percent of total GDP.
</P>
<P>
These five largest state economies, taken together, account for
40 percent of the nation's economy. The five with the smallest
economies, each measuring 0.2 percent of the total, were Montana,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
After Oregon and New Hampshire, the states that enjoyed the
fastest growth in their gross state product for 1997 were Texas,
up 6.8 percent; Arizona, up 6.7 percent and Colorado, with a 6.5
percent increase in output measured in current dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other states below the national increase of 4.3 percent, were
Alaska, up only 0.4 percent; North Dakota, up 0.6 percent; West
Virginia, up 0.9 percent; and South Dakota, with a 1.7 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
The state report is produced by the Commerce Department's
Bureau of Economic Analysis. While the government produces an
estimate of national GDP growth the month after the quarter ends,
the state data can be produced only with a much longer lag time
because of the difficulty of breaking down output for each state.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- To address the increasing
security problems faced by the United Nations personnel around the
world, the Organization said on Monday it is scheduled to hold its
second summit on the Security and Independence of the
International Civil Service on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The event is organized by the United Nations Staff Council
Standing Committee on the Security and Independence of the
International Civil Service.
</P>
<P>
The summit will focus on the urgent need for governments to
demonstrate in practice their commitment to protect the
international civil servants performing their duties in often
highly difficult and dangerous conditions.
</P>
<P>
Other issues include security training for staff and a
follow-up to the statement of principles issued from the first
summit of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the first-ever summit highlighted the increasingly
hazardous and very often life-threatening conditions in which
international staff have to operate, and offered possible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
Since the first summit a year ago, over 20 united Nations
personnel have been killed. Incidents of kidnapping, arrest,
detention, attack and injury have increased, while the fate of
some 50 staffers detained or missing throughout the world is still
unknown.

<P>
LONDON June 7 (Xinhua) - British Steel has reached a merger
agreement with Dutch steel group Hoogovens, creating the world's
third largest steel producer.
</P>
<P>
The combined company, to be called BSKH, will have a market
capitalisation of 4.7bn US dollars and notch up sales worth 15.1bn
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
British Steel has already confirmed that some jobs will go in
administration, but has declined to specify how many people will
be axed.
</P>
<P>
While workers may be nervous, British Steel shareholders can
look forward to receiving 35p a share as a result of the deal - a
total pay-out of 1.12bn US dollars.
</P>
<P>
British Steel is currently in the process of cutting some
10,000 jobs on the shop floor, but most analysts believe that
likely job losses will come on management level, to weed out
duplicated positions.
</P>
<P>
Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union general secretary
Ken Jackson said: "A merger could bring huge benefits, creating
one of the world's most powerful steel companies but it may also
pose a serious threat to employment security."

<HEADLINE> China Issues New Rules for Commodities Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese State Council today
issued new rules on commodities trading.
</P>
<P>
The new rules include stipulations on the operation of
commodities exchanges and brokerages, the basic principles of
commodities trading, the supervision of the market and penalties.
</P>
<P>
China witnessed a boom of futures trading in the early 1990s
after the government approved experimental business in 1990.
</P>
<P>
But the risk of the market soon became unacceptable because of
over speculations and manipulations, so the government tightened
its control in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, it ordered the closure of 11 commodities exchanges,
allowing the operation of only three exchanges in Shanghai,
Zhengzhou and Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Officials sources here said the issue of the new rules marks
the completion of years of market overhaul and is a milestone in
the history of China's commodities trading legislation.

WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Tuesday that there will be no halt in NATO's bombing
of Yugoslavia until Serb forces begin pulling out of Kosovo
despite the landmark G-8 agreement.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the bombing will continue if there is "any

Kosovo though Russia and the West have agreed on a proposed U.N.
resolution to halt the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"It must be understood that there has to be initiation of
withdrawal of forces on the part of the Serbs," Cohen told
reporters.

"In the event that there is any hesitation on the part of the
Serbs, any delay on their part, that bombing would continue," he

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A maritime oil spill drill was
held today at the mouth of the Huangpu River in Shanghai, the
largest city and one of the busiest ports in China.
</P>
<P>
The drill started at 9:15 a.m. and involved the spill of 50
tons of oil by a 5,000 ton tanker, which was in collision with a
cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
In one and a half hours, the oil spill was cleaned up, using
dams, oil absorbing and diluting materials and coopers, while a
fire-fighting boat monitored the site and four cruisers kept
regular navigation order.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhiyi, head of the Shanghai Maritime Safety Administration,
said the drill was very successful.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Shanghai port is visited by more than 1,
000 vessels a day, with about 10 percent of them carrying
dangerous cargoes, which poses a potential threat to the safety of
the port and its environment.
</P>
<P>
He said the port is now well-prepared for emergency cases
involving oil spills and chemical pollution, as an emergency plan
has been in place since as early as 1986 and has been improved
upon since then.

ATHENS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
Tuesday discussed respectively with his German and Italian
counterparts, Gerhard Shroeder and Massimo D' Alema, the latest
developments in the Kosovo crisis in telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that both Shroeder and D' Alemahe shared his view
that Europe must help overcome any problems which might arise in
the present phase of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Procedural issues and matters of secondary importance must be
overcome, he said, adding that the central issue was for peace to
be secured immediately.
</P>
<P>
While being optimistic about the prospects of the Kosovo
crisis, Simitis said that Greece would contribute to the
implementation of any peace agreement to emerge from ongoing
efforts because Greece wanted peace to prevail in the Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said at a press briefing that only a few issues remained
outstanding in the talks between NATO and Yugoslavia over a peace
agreement for Kosovo.

As for the passage of NATO troops through Greek territory for

United Nations Office of Project Services (UNOPS) entrusted with
removing landmines in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Mayor Bids for Likud Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert
announced his candidacy Tuesday for the Likud leadership, saying
he is the best one to rebuild the right-wing party which suffered
a resounding defeat in the general elections last month.
</P>
<P>
He will compete with Finance Minister Meir Sheetrit and
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who have declared their
candidacies, in the party's internal election scheduled to be
held in three months. Several other Likud members are reportedly
weighing their bids.
</P>
<P>
In the May 17 elections, the Likud lost almost half of its
seats occupying in the last parliament, plunging from 32 to
19 seats in the 15th Knesset, which was inaugurated Monday.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resigned from his
position as the Likud head days after he was crushed in the prime
ministerial race by One Israel leader Ehud Barak. Sharon was
elected temporary leader.
</P>
<P>
In the process of forming a government, Barak appeared to have
abandoned his initial preference of the Likud rather than the
ultra-religious party Shas, which scored a stunning victory by
jumping from 10 seats to 17, as a coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
Sources in One Israel said the Likud is in shambles and will
cause troubles for the coalition rather than provide necessary
support. Also, they said the constituency Shas represents, mostly
Middle East Jews, should not be ignored if Barak intends to heal
the internal rifts in the divided society.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Sarid, leader of the left-wing Meretz party, which
refuses to sit in the same government with Shas, suggested Monday
night to Barak that his party support Barak's government from the
outside, in order to enable Barak to hold coalition negotiations
with Shas.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that Meretz is a natural coalition partner,
Barak did not rejected this suggestion. Sources said he will make
a decision in the next few days in accordance with the progress
in the negotiations with Shas.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was sworn-in as one of the 120 new legislators
Monday, has said he would give up his parliamentary seat when
Barak forms a government.
</P>
<P>
His office did not make comments on media reports Tuesday that
he has signed a contract with a United States agency which would
make him one of the highest-paid speakers in its lecture
circuit.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt to Make National Shrimp Policy Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will make
a national shrimp policy soon for the development of this sector
and to make shrimp a main export commodity of the country,
Fisheries and Livestock Minister A.S.M. Abdur Rab said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rab disclosed this while meeting a delegation led by President
of the Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters Association (BFFEA) Kazi
Shahnewaz here, the national news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A task force comprising representatives from the concerned
ministries and directorates including shrimp producers, processors
and exporters will be formed to supervise, monitor and evaluate
the overall activities of the sector, he told the delegation.
</P>
<P>
The task force will also identify the problems of the sector to
provide necessary suggestions for resolving the problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will take all possible measures to help the
sector maintain ecological balance, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government will also provide maximum assistance to
those shrimp organizations badly affected by last year's
devastating flood, he added.
</P>
<P>
The country's shrimp sector, the second major foreign exchange
earner after the garments sector, is now faced with several
problems.
</P>
<P>
The price fall of around 35 percent in the international market
has already forced the BFFEA into a stockpile of shrimps worth 4
billion taka (about 82.5 million U.S. dollars). Besides, the
shrimp sector has incurred huge losses due to the currency
devaluation in other competitive countries, last year's flood and
the European Union's restrictions on export.
</P>
<P>
The BFFEA chief has urged the government to take steps so that
the sector could compete in the international market.
</P>
<P>
He has also called for the implementation of a report of the
Commerce Ministry's task force to waive penal interest of 3
billion taka (about 61.9 million dollars) on loans borrowed by
producers and exporters of the sector, and demanded that the
government give a 15-percent cash subsidy on export earnings to
cope with the price fall in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh had exported shrimps worth 10.4 billion taka (about
214.4 million dollars) by April this year against the target of 15
billion taka (about 309.3 million dollars) during the July
1998-June 1999 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Siemens to Build Gas-Burning Power Plants in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- German electrical giant Siemens has
signed a 7.3 billion yuan (880 million US dollars) letter of
intent for the building of two gas-burning power plants with
northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
It was inked Monday in this capital of Yunnan Province, which
is hosting the Gansu week of the World Horticulture Exposition.
</P>
<P>
The projects will be jointly financed and the two sides will
operate the 6 billion yuan Lanzhou Power Plant, which will have
four 300 megawatt generating units, using natural gas from
neighboring Qinghai Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides would spend 1.3 billion yuan on the
transformation of the Xigu power plant from coal-burning into gas-
burning.
</P>
<P>
Gansu officials said they expect a remarkable improvement in
the air quality of Lanzhou, the provincial capital, after the new
plants become operational.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern city is now rated by the United Nations as one
of the 10 most polluted cities in the world, as it depends on coal
for its power supply.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they expect Lanzhou to be erased from the "
black list" once the projects are up and running.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Postpones THAAD Missile Test Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military Tuesday
delayed again the eighth test of the Theater High-Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) missile in New Mexico State of the country, the
Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
"The flight test has been delayed because of a commercial power
failure," Pentagon spokeswoman Cheryl Irwin said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's test had been scheduled to go off at 5:00 a.m. (local
time) with the firing of a Hera target missile at which a THAAD
missile was then scheduled to be fired from White Sands missile
Test range in the state. Neither missile was launched.
</P>
<P>
The test, also postponed two weeks ago when a target missile
went out of control, is now expected to be conducted Thursday,
Irwin said.
</P>
<P>
The THAAD is being developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation to
track and collide with attacking enemy warheads in flight.
</P>
<P>
The planned test will be closely watched because of a string of
seven failures. The Clinton administration faces pressure from
Congress to put in place both a system like THAAD against medium-
range missiles as well as an even more ambitious national missile
defense system.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses Briton of Sabotaging Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has accused a Briton working
with a U.N. agency in northern Iraq of carrying out sabotage acts
against the country's agricultural crops.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed Iraqi Agriculture Ministry source said that the
British national tried to spread agriculture pests by planting
their breeding eggs in an area in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said "a Briton called Reed Verbatim had buried in April
boxes filled with breeding eggs of locusts which damage
agricultural crops," the Iraqi News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. office in Baghdad refused to comment on the Iraqi
accusation.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi source said the Briton was working with the
U.N. Office of Project Services (UNOPS) entrusted with removing
landmines in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In April, a vehicle belonging to the UNOPS and carrying several
boxes, entered an area near Khamaqeen, 180 kilometers northeast of
Baghdad, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Reed, who is a leading official at the UNOPS, unloaded these
boxes and buried them in that area," the Iraqi source said.
</P>
<P>
He added that residents in the area later uncovered these
boxes and found out they were containing locusts eggs.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused U.S. and British nationals
working in northern Iraq, particularly those affiliated with
non-governmental organizations, of spying on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Iraq asked the U.N. to replace U.S and
British nationals working with U.N. agencies in central and
southern Iraq with personnel of other nationalities.

Chinese leaders including President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu
Rongji and Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao all inspected the dykes that
protect the 1,080 meters long river section during and after the
unprecedented floods of last year and stressed the importance of
safeguarding this industrial center in central China.
</P>
<P>
The Hanjiang River, the Yangtze's largest tributary, joins it
at Longwangmiao, where the waterway is narrow.
</P>
<P>
A total of 120 million yuan (14.4 million US dollars) has been
spent reinforcing the dykes and upgrading 18 ports at this section
since November last year. The width of the waterway has also been
expanded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wuhan's distant anti-flood bulwark at Jingzhou City
has also been reported as much more able to restrain flooding.
</P>
<P>
It was the most crucial battlefront in fighting the floods last
year. Some 185 million yuan, which was 6 or 7 times more than that
for a normal year, was made available from numerous sources for
repairing the dyke.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shengfu, senior engineer of the Beijing-based State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, said that strengthening
this dyke had meant the largest cash injection of its kind since
the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"There is also a convenient 180 km long road along the dyke now,
which is important for patrolling and transporting materials
during floods," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anti-permeating methods introduced from Germany have been used
at this section to prevent flood water from pouring in through
holes at the foundations of the dyke.

<HEADLINE> One Israel Holds Secret Talks With PNA: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Senior members of the One Israel
party held secret talks recently with officials of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) on ways to move the Mideast peace process
forward, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arranged by Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny,
One Israel's senior members Yossi Beilin and Haim Ramon held
secret talks separately with PNA officials, Israelwire, a local
internet media company said.
</P>
<P>
Beilin and Ramon informed the PNA of the peace policy of One
Israel, headed by Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, and they asked
the PNA to be patient before the Barak-led government could take
actions to move the process forward.
</P>
<P>
Before Barak forms a coalition government, One Israel's
domestic and foreign policies cannot be implemented, so it is
impossible for it to conduct peace talks with the PNA, Beilin and
Ramon reportedly told the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Beilin and Ramon also informed the PNA that their party has
promised to implement all signed agreements. And they asked the
PNA not to conduct anti-Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
Recently, protests and demonstrations against Israel's
settlement expansion activities were held throughout the Israeli
occupied territories and the Palestinian side blamed Barak for not
starting the peace talks with PNA after the May 17 Israeli
elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak has declined to confirm whether such secret talks were
held, but he told the Israeli television Channel Two Monday night
that both Beilin and Ramon have the right to hold such meetings
with the PNA.

<HEADLINE> India Continues Operation in Kargil of Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- India on Tuesday continued its
military operation in Kargil of Kashmir and combat jets of the
Indian Air Force (IAF) bombarded bunkers and supply depots of the
militias in the Mushkoh valley, an army spokesman said here.
</P>
<P>
In the last 24 hours, the troops advanced in all sub-sectors in
the Kargil region, pounding positions held by "infiltrators" in
Drass, Batalik and Turtuk.
</P>
<P>
Since it began the operation on May 26, the Indian army has
lost 63 personnel, while 217 others have been wounded and 14
missing who could have been captured by the Pakistan troops, he
said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the IAF used Mirage-2000 fighter jets for
attacks, an air force spokesman said, "We are using all types of
aircraft that may be necessary for the operations." Previously,
India only used the plane for carrying out reconnaissance and
electronic jamming activities.
</P>
<P>
Indian troops on Tuesday killed six Pakistan army regulars and
wounded 19 others in Turtuk and Batallik in intensified artillery
and mortar shelling. The Indian side lost one officer and two
soldiers, the army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, a high-level meeting chaired by
caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee here Tuesday decided
that while sustaining the process in search for comprehensive
improvement in the relations with Pakistan, India must be prepared
for all "eventualities" in the present "fluid situation." The
meeting was attended by the home minister, defense minister,
external affairs minister and three chiefs of staff.

BONN June 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the G-8 Tuesday
in Cologne reached consensus on the text of U.N. Security Council
draft resolution on Kosovo after two days of discussion.
</P>
<P>
"We finally reached a real breakthrough on the draft U.N.
Security Council resolution ...today is a good day for peace in
Kosovo," said German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer who chaired
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting, Fischer
told reporters that important elements in the draft would be a
NATO cease-fire on the basis of Yugoslav troops' withdrawal and a
safe return of Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said "there may be a small
and symbolic Serb presence but under international supervision."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the commanding structure of the planned 50,000-
strong international Kosovo peacekeeping force (KFOR), U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the troop would be one
with NATO at its core, and it would receive mandates from the NATO.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, difference on this matter between Russia and
the West was removed after Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
accepted the West's demand, according to James Rubin, spokesman
for the U.S. Department of State.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov declined to spell out Russian presence's scale and its
role in the KFOR, saying the problem would be discussed later
after a formal Security Council resolution.

ISLAMABAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Alliance of
Afghanistan has handed over to the Taliban the bodies of 12
Taliban commanders killed in action last week, a senior Alliance
military commander said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Six Taliban prisoners of war (POWs) were also released to the
militia on Monday following earlier declarations by the Alliance
to exchange prisoners of war, General Hussain Anwari, chief
military commander of the Alliance group Harakat-e-Islami said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
Anwari said as most of the prisoners were injured, the Alliance
decided to expedite the transfer of prisoners to the Taliban ahead
of an official exchange program, which would take place under the
auspices of local elder statesmen.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban militia, however, has yet to honor its end of the
agreement by releasing 15 Alliance POWs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwari said the Alliance authorities have continued to retain
two prominent Taliban commanders as POWs in Darre Suf in the
northern Afghan province of Samangan.
</P>
<P>
Mullah Hamid and Mullah Nasser Khan, both originally from
Kandahar, the Taliban headquarters in southern Afghanistan, were
instrumental in the offensives conducted by the Taliban against
the Alliance in Samangan.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin, Yeltsin Exchange Views on Kosovo Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
told his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin via a hotline this
afternoon that NATO is undermining the role of the United Nations
on the Kosovo issue and that it is trying to force its own
solution to the problem on the international community.
</P>
<P>
Jiang replied that the hypocrisy of the U.S.-led NATO has been
fully exposed where it executes its interference with the excuse
of a humanitarian role. He added that NATO's true nature of
hegemony and power politics by bullying the weak is also clear,
and that therefore it has lost the war against Yugoslavia in a
political and moral sense.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president stressed that it is by no means
acceptable that NATO, while continuing its air strikes against
Yugoslavia, wants the UN Security Council to examine relevant
resolutions for the issue.
</P>
<P>
"NATO must stop its military actions immediately," he said, "
And the authority and role of the UN should be fully respected."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "From a long-term perspective a just cause enjoys
abundant support while an unjust cause finds little support. He
who is unjust is doomed to destruction. Those two old Chinese
sayings have been proved true many times in the past."
</P>
<P>
After the end of the Cold War, Jiang said, the multi-
polarization of the world has become an irreversible trend of
history. The United States, on the contrary, is trying to build a
single polar world and engage itself in world hegemony. This is
absolutely unacceptable to people across the world.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Suspends Importation of Poultry Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Tuesday
issued an order to stop all importation of poultry, beef, pork and
their by-products to keep away contaminated meat.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said the move will ensure
the safeguard of the Philippine market from the entry of meat
products coming from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany which
were reported to be contaminated with dioxin, a potent carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
He also warned traders and importers of poultry and meat
products to be on the lookout or refrain from buying products
coming from European countries.
</P>
<P>
Angara said that the Bureau of Customs and animal quarantine
officers at all ports of entry are also ordered to report any
entry in the country of imported meat and poultry products.
</P>
<P>
He said his department is coordinating with other government
agencies in assessing the need to pull out suspect products from
store shelves to protect the consumers from probable
contamination.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Department of Agriculture said that animal fat
used by 14 feed manufacturers in Ghent, Brussels, has been found
contaminated with dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Also found to be contaminated with this potent carcinogen at
700 times the allowable level, were chicken and its by-products,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, eggs and chicken products from 417 farms in
Belgium have been banned in European countries, and about 500
Belgian pig farms face closure, they said.
</P>
<P>
Germany and the Netherlands are also believed to have imported
the tainted feeds, while France is a major buyer of Belgian
poultry products, they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, countries in Europe, North America, the Middle East
and Asia have also taken steps to ban or inspect poultry, eggs,
beef, pork and their by-products.

June of last year.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese medicine doctors were invited to discuss
methods for treating various diseases and to tell people how to
maintain good health. The program covered much of the earth via
satellite and cable.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenkang, China's Health Minister, says that the trend is

modern media have helped and this program was a window on the rest

</P>
<P>
Liu has received piles of letters from all over the world,
giving him greater responsibilities. But, he says he'll work even
harder to repay the audience for their trust and care.
</P>
<P>
The overseas edition of People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, serves overseas Chinese readers and devotes an entire
page to health in Friday's edition and answers questions. The
rapid growth of the Internet has also helped and it is now quite
ordinary to seek treatment on the net.

Traditional Chinese medicine, with its several thousand year
history, is still playing an important role today, Zhang says,
with its acupuncture, moxibustion, and treatment of orthopedic

China has more than 2,500 traditional Chinese medicine
hospitals and about 90 colleges and schools, as well as more than
70 research institutes studying traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Some people travel from far away to be treated in China with
this magic. They have found it difficult, however, to get the
large bundles of Chinese medicine and to take them home to cook
them up. So, some hospitals have decocted the traditional Chinese
medicine and made it into a concentrate so that it is easier for
people from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Cough syrup made from herbal medicines was even chosen to give
to African countries by Li Peng, when he was Premier and important
political figures who have received traditional Chinese medicine
treatments include Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk, and a former
president of the Republic of Korea.
</P>

A Chinese publishing house will release the 30-volume "Materia
Medica of China" this September. It contains information on nearly
9,000 herbal medicines and drugs made from animal materials or
minerals. The set is regarded as the most important work on

Medica", which was compiled during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)
and is still the leading guide to the use of traditional Chinese
medicine.

WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Group of Seven leading industrial democracies and Russia
neared agreement Monday on a draft U.N. Security Council
resolution on the Kosovo crisis, reviving prospects that a peace
settlement could bring the 76-day-old conflict to a halt this week.
</P>
<P>
-- Temperatures reached a record 97 degrees Monday and may well
hit 100 Tuesday, but heat comes and goes around Washington.Much
more distressing, experts say, is that a crackling dryness has set
in remarkably early and shows no sign of letting up soon.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Dobrica Cosic, a former President of Yugoslavia and a
revered figure among Serbian nationalists, said peace in Kosovo
would be illusory, and that fefeat would badly sully Mr. Milosivic
's reputation.
</P>
<P>
-- Final election results in South Africa showed Monday that
the ruling African National Congress was returned to poweer with
even more votes than it won in 1994. But it fell just one seat
short of a two-thirds majority on Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The gun debate on a House panel has led the GOP to propose
banning the sale to minors of violent movies, games and music,
making retailers liable for the content of such products. Some in
the entertainment industry predicted the courts would strike down
any such move.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) Central Committee, said today that China places great
importance on the growth of relations with Zimbabwe in political,
economic, cultural and other areas.
</P>

led by him.
</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said that the
people of the two countries have a deep traditional friendship,
although the two countries are far apart geographically, and that
they have maintained relations of mutual trust no matter how the
international situation changes.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked Zimbabwe for its support for China in the "one
China" and human rights issues.
</P>
<P>

the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory," he said.
</P>
<P>

economic growth, stayed firm with independence, opposed external
interference, and tried hard to seek the development path suited

</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope to boost friendly exchanges between the
two parties and to learn from each other in administering their
respective countries and parties.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Makes up Master Plan for Farm Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has introduced
a strategic master plan with five key elements for 12 key
agricultural products to prepare the country for the new round of
multinational trade talks under the World Trade Organization
(WTO), the Thai News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The master plan, jointly drafted by the ministries of commerce,
industry, agriculture and cooperatives and the Board of
Investment, aims to set up a long-term framework under a central
agency to address agricultural problems, the agency quoted Deputy
Commerce Minister Pravich Ratanapien as saying here.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Business Economics was authorized as the
central agency to oversee the matter, he added.
</P>
<P>
Measures under the plan, effective immediately and running
until the end of 2001, are expected to improve the competitiveness
of the 12 key farm products.
</P>
<P>
They are: rice, maize, tapioca, para rubber, sugarcane, coffee,
palm oil, longans, pineapple, durians, orchids and black tiger
pawns.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture technology, crop varieties and irrigation systems
would also be enhanced under the plan, with the private sector to
be invited to play a greater role in price support programs to
reduce the government burden on farm subsidies, which is also a
contentious issue in the WTO talks, the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
Products currently face problems including low yields, poor
quality, irregular supplies, unstable prices, poor efficiency in
marketing and lack of up-to-date information.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to boost the further development of the products
by highlighting their production, processing, marketing and
credit.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Refuses NATO Command in Kosovo Peacekeeping Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops absolutely will not
accept command of NATO in peacekeeping operation in Kosovo,
President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy for Balkans Viktor
Chernomyrdin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances will Russian troops be subordinated to
NATO command," the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia is considering sending 5,000 to 10,000 troops to take
part in the operation in Kosovo, Chernomyrdin told journalists in
Moscow following his meeting with Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
U.S. defense officials will arrive in Moscow on Wednesday for
talks with the Russian Defense Ministry on every issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian units should be sent to Kosovo in strict compliance
with the country's legislation, Chernomyrdin said. "The Federation
Council has to approve this and only those men who can serve
abroad should be sent."
</P>
<P>
"This will not be cheap. Costs must not be neglected. However,
this is a matter concerning Russia's prestige and our presence in
the Balkans is important," Chernomyrdin added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Tuesday that his ministry is preparing proposals for
Yeltsin on the possible deployment of a Russian military
contingent in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev, who also met with Stepashin, reiterated that "we
will not be under the leadership of NATO."
</P>
<P>
He refuted media reports about differences between the
military and Chernomyrdin. "Write it down -- there are no
differences. Negotiations are under way in the process of which
different opinions naturally arise on how the directives of the
president should be carried out best," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Coffee consumption in China
continues to rise considerably every year and there is a huge
potential market for the product despite the increasingly
diversified range of drinks available.
</P>
<P>
It is projected that coffee consumption in the country will
reach 318,000 packets (one packet equals 60 kg) by year 2000,
doubling that of 1995, which is a huge leap from the measly number
of 23,537 packets in 1990, according to a report carried in Monday
's edition of the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The report says that in the current coffee market, instant
coffee has a 90 percent take up while the more refined roasted
coffee beans still only account for 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Large cities constitute the major market for such coffee. Of
the total, Beijing makes up 30 percent, Shanghai 30 percent,
Guangzhou and Shenzhen 20 percent and other regions 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other cities, coffee consumption is much higher
in Shanghai, where many world famous coffee companies have set up
production bases to tap the Chinese market from a long term and
strategic perspective.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China is also actively engaged in developing its own
coffee growing bases. The coffee produced in southwestern Yunnan
Province has won acclaim from international coffee organizations.

SINGAPORE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy is forecast
to grow at 1.5 percent in 1999 and 2 percent in 2000, with
inflation hovering around zero, according to the Pacific Economic
Outlook (PEO) released Tuesday by the Pacific Economic Cooperation
Council (PECC).
</P>
<P>
While the economy is likely to remain weak this year, the PEO
said, some signs of recovery in the island state are expected by
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The PEO said that the Singapore government, despite external
and uncontrollable factors depressing the economy, has taken
"positive steps to check the slide in economic growth."
</P>
<P>
"Singapore has used this period to make structural changes to
improve the competitiveness of the economy," said the PEO, citing
an example that the government has adopted a comprehensive
cost-cutting package to reduce business costs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government has revised its official forecast for
1999 from the previous negative 1 percent to plus 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Singapore registered an economic growth of 1.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The PEO is an annual two-year forecast of 20 Pacific rim
economies produced by PECC, the only non-governmental body among

<HEADLINE> New Regulation on Passports Issued in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin Municipality in north China
today issued a new regulation on passport applications to favor
employees of private firms who intend to go abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulation, employees from ten local
private firms became the first group of beneficiaries who have a
chance to apply for passports directly under the agreement of
their companies.
</P>
<P>
Before the new regulation, employees from private firms had a
more complicated process to carry out before applying. Because the
files of the employees are kept by special file-keeping companies,
it used to be essential to have an agreement from their file
keepers or the city's business association while filling out
application forms for pre-passport examination and approval.
</P>
<P>
Now, the private firms have the same authority as the state-
owned enterprises in the field. Agreement from these firms on
their employees' applications for passports is valid at relevant
entry and exit administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
Last year, nearly 2,000 people from private firms were issued
passports for business trips abroad.

mainland students studying in Hong Kong stay and work in Hong Kong
after their graduation.
</P>
<P>
Tien said that the Singapore government has assigned 1 billion
U.S. dollars for talents from the Silicon Valley in the United

ISLAMABAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday welcomed India's

</P>
<P>
"We welcome that, after all, the Indians have found it
convenient to respond to our initiative to send Foreign Minister

</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is examining that proposal," the spokesman told

India on Thursday accepted peace talks with Pakistan on Kashmir

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said in a
meeting with Finnish President and EU envoy to Kosovo Martti
Ahtisaari here today that the purposes and principles of the
United Nations Charter are in no way out of date and are in fact
more practical and significant at the end of the Cold War in a
changing world situation.
</P>
<P>
History has shown that only by upholding those purposes and
those principles can the countries of the world enjoy peaceful
coexistence and common development and world peace be maintained
and promoted, he said.
</P>
<P>
When the purposes and principles were contravened or ignored,
he continued, power politics will run wild, world and regional
peace will have no effective guarantee, and the sovereignty and
independence of the world's nations, especially the small and the
weak, will be impaired and the role of the UN will be undermined.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari discussed the latest developments in the political
solution of the Kosovo issue and said that this meeting was very
important because China is a permanent member of the United
Nations Security Council.

HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers at the Hong Kong
airport have seized 2.29 kilograms of suspected No. 4 heroin with
a street value of 1.56 million HK dollars (200,000 U.S. dollars),
the Customs and Excise Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers Monday night arrested a passenger who was
departing for Australia and found that he was in possession of the
drugs, a spokesman for the Department said.

The 29-year-old suspect received a security check by the
Aviation Security Company Limited staff. The security alarm system
was, however, activated.
</P>
<P>
Follow-up investigations by officers of the Customs Airport
Investigation Division led to the seizure of 2.29 kilograms of
high grade heroin from the man. The dangerous drugs were packed
around his body in 37 plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
That was the first drug case detected on passengers departing
for Australia this year, the spokesman said, adding that the
Customs would monitor the situation in order to curb the
trafficking activities.
</P>
<P>
The arrested man will appear at Tsuen Wan Magistracy Wednesday

<HEADLINE> China Opposes U.S. Congress Act on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and people
firmly oppose the so-called Taiwan Security Enhancement Act put
forward by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remarks at a regular press conference this
afternoon when asked to comment on the act proposed by the U.S.
Congress recently.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the act brazenly advocated the enhancement of
the military forces of Taiwan by selling advanced weaponry to the
island including the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system and
submarines, and even by forging direct ties and expanding
cooperation between military forces of the United States and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed act constitutes a gross violation of the three
Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques," she said. "In essence, it is aimed
at offering legal basis through more domestic legislation for U.S.
sales of various sophisticated weapons including TMD to Taiwan and
for strengthening relations and cooperation between the armed
forces of the United States and Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The act will serve to block China's reunification cause by
further interfering in China's internal affairs and creating "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," she added.
</P>
<P>
"It must be pointed out that if the act is passed, it will
boost the arrogance of Taiwan's 'independence forces,' obstruct
the development of the ties across the Taiwan Straits, damage the
peace and stability of the Asian and Pacific region, and lead to
serious consequences in the Sino-U.S. ties," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"China strongly demands the U.S. administration adhere to the
three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques and honor relevant promises,
fully realize the great harm of the act, oppose it in a clear-cut
way, and immediately take effective measures to prevent it from
passage and becoming a law," she noted.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament Witnesses Two Walkouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi parliament witnessed
two walkouts on Tuesday, one by a ruling Awami League (AL)
lawmaker, the other by all members of the major opposition - the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
Kader Siddiqui of the Treasury Bench walked out in protest
against what he termed as denial of the floor. Siddiqui, who has
been criticizing the present AL leadership, wanted to speak on a
point of order on the imposition of a certain section of a law
during a public meeting, which he organized recently and was
disrupted by rival AL activists.
</P>
<P>
The parliament witnessed pandemonium for about 10 minutes when
BNP members of parliament rose to their feet protesting against a
speech by Industries and Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed and later
staged a walkout in protest against what they said violation of
the rules of procedure.
</P>
<P>
Major (Retired) Hafiz Uddin from the BNP, citing some examples
of violation of the rules of procedure, said BNP law-makers on
Monday raised a question relating to the telecast of a statement
of a minister which was expunged by the chair.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the rules of procedure, he said the concerned minister,
not the industries and commerce minister, should have clarified
the matter. Uddin said that in the presence of the state minister
for information, the industries and commerce minister made a
statement on the said matter, which he said was practices beyond
the scope of rules of procedure.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the industries and commerce minister said that
leader of the opposition Begum Khaleda Zia should learn the rules
of procedure and refrain from making any remarks or allegation
against the chair outside the parliament.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Ahmed uttered the words, all BNP members sprung to
their feet in protest.
</P>
<P>
It took the minister almost 10 minutes to complete his speech,
which was punctuated by thumping in appreciation by the Treasury
Bench members as most of his remarks were against the BNP and its
leaders, while all BNP members were seen making noise throughout
the minister's speech.
</P>
<P>
When BNP leader Saifur Rahman was given the floor, he said, "We
are staging a walkout as the rules of procedure are violated."
</P>
<P>
BNP parliamentarians also staged a walkout on Sunday, when the
current session of the country's Seventh Parliament started, to
protest what they said the irrelevant statement of the home
minister regarding police atrocity on BNP leaders and activists in
the capital during a hartal on May 11, The Daily Star newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shah A.S.M. Kibria is expected to place the
national budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal year before the
parliament next Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Asia Pacific Seen on Path to Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Pacific Economic Cooperation
Council (PECC) Tuesday issued its 11th annual Pacific Economic
Outlook (PEO), indicating that the economic crisis in the
Asia-Pacific is over and the region is on the path to recovery.
</P>
<P>
The region will see a 2.6-percent growth in 1999, a distinct
improvement from the 1-percent growth in 1998, according to the
PEO.
</P>
<P>
Most of the economies that either contracted or had slow growth
in 1998 would see a modest pick-up in 1999, while South Korea is
expected to have a "V"-shaped recovery, the PEO said.
</P>
<P>
The outlook is an annual two-year forecast of 20 Pacific-rim
economies by PECC, the only non-governmental body among the three
observers in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
For Indonesia and Hong Kong, however, the PEO predicted further
contractions and it also pointed out that "Japan might edge into
this category."
</P>
<P>
The PEO said the recovery is expected to be led by domestic
consumption and inflation is not seen as a problem.
</P>
<P>
The weighted average Consumer Price Index for 1999 is forecast
to drop almost in half to 2.2 percent, provided that exchange rate
stability is maintained.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payments forecast is mixed: while the smaller
economies will tend toward equilibrium, the increasing surplus of
Japan and the ballooning deficit of the United States are in the
opposite direction, the PEO said.
</P>
<P>
For the year 2000, the PEO foresees a further improvement in
the economic situation, but stressed that the growth figures will
still be significantly below a typical growth year for the region.
</P>
<P>
The PEO identified a number of risks to its forecasts,
including the sharp correction of the U.S. stock market, the
possible U.S. protectionism as a result of the increasing trade
deficit, the Y2K problem, the uncertain direction of the Japanese
economy and political risks in some economies.
</P>
<P>
The PEO cautions that the region's recovery will depend on the
health of its "three-engine growth model," a concept the PEO has
defined on the basis of China, Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The PEO concluded by saying that "if there is a severe
recession in any of these three economies, the region is in
serious trouble."

MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Tuesday
reported that approximately 35,000 liters of oil spillage covering
some 5,000 square meters of the water occurred last Sunday at the
Tayamaan Bay in the northern province of Occidental Mindoro.
</P>
<P>
A report submitted by regional officials said the oil spill was
caused by a damaged power barge owned by the National Power
Corporation (Napocor), which is presently moored at the Tayamaan
pier.
</P>
<P>
Although strong winds caused the destruction of the breather of
the barge, the report said that its condition was further
aggravated by a National Food Authority barge which bumped into
it.
</P>
<P>
Napocor officials are now working out on how to save the
remaining of the 100,000 liters of oil stored at the Napocor
barge.
</P>
<P>
At present, the government has requested the Napocor to
immediately send a boat equipped with skimmer to avoid further
spillage.

<HEADLINE> China Becoming Gateway For Central Asia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The countries of Central Asia
recently started charter flights to northern Chinese port cities
after signing cargo agreements with Lianyungang, a city on the
east coast.
</P>
<P>
analysts say they believe that this will help relieve the
problems that have long limited the economic development of
Central Asia and will make some northern Chinese cities an opening
to the oceans.
</P>
<P>
In interviews with reporters, officials from Kyrgyzstan said
they plan to export energy and minerals to third countries via
northern Chinese ports, while economists of Uzbekistan say that
their country hopes to ship daily-use items through China to cut
costs and increase speed, and Turkmenistan also plans to lay a
natural gas pipeline across China to Japan.
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin, the largest port in northern China, cotton and
minerals from Central Asia are loaded onto ships for Japan and the
Republic of Korea (ROK), while electric appliances and machinery
from East Asia and Southeast Asia are shipped the other way.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1994, Qingdao, a port city in Shandong Province,
had become a transit point for trade with Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
This year, a great number of high-ranking officials,
businessmen, and journalists from Central Asia visited the ports
of Tianjin, Lianyungang, Dalian, and Qinhuangdao and many have set
up trading companies to make good use of these ports.
</P>
<P>
China was connected with Central Asia in antiquity by the Silk
Road and President Jiang Zemin said during an official visit to
Central Asia last year that China is providing those countries
with convenience and will continue to do so in ocean shipping.  (

Central Asia now trades with the ROK, Japan, the United States,
Australia, Thailand, and Malaysia via Chinese ports. It makes the
trip 2,000 km less than overland routes, or 10,000 km less than
the Indian Ocean and Suez Canal route.
</P>
<P>
Kuanysh Sultanov, Kazakhstan's Ambassador to China, told
reporters that Lianyungang is the nearest gateway to the Pacific
Ocean for his country and that Chinese ports will be a lever in
growth in his country's economic strength.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and
Kyrgyzstan are at the juncture of Asia and Europe and are being
considered by the international business community as one of the
world's major supply centers for petroleum and minerals in the
next century. The gradual economic recovery in these countries has
prompted rapid growth in trade with China.
</P>
<P>
As China becomes Central Asia's gateway to the ocean, it will
increase economic cooperation with these countries and intensify
strategic relations as well, according to Li Gang, of the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation's International Economic
Institute.

<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Halting the air strikes against
Yugoslavia is the most urgent task before any political solution
of the Kosovo crisis can be achieved, Foreign Ministry
Spokesperson Zhang Qiyue said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Only by ending military actions against Yugoslavia, can
favorable conditions and an atmosphere for a political solution of
the crisis be created," she said at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
"This will relieve the Yugoslav people of the miseries of war,
and will be helpful to the stability and peace in the Balkan
region, Europe and the world at large."
</P>
<P>
"Martti Ahtisaari, Finnish President and the EU's envoy for the
Kosovo issue, arrived here at noon to brief Chinese leaders on the
latest developments for a peaceful solution of the Kosovo crisis,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that China has always insisted that the
United Nations play a major role in resolving the Kosovo issue.
But before the UN Security Council begins to discuss any draft
resolution on Kosovo, she stressed, NATO should first stop its
military action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, China is waiting to know the final version of the
framework and contents of the relevant peace plan on Kosovo. China
will cast its vote in accordance with its consistent principled
stand," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In resolving the Kosovo issue, the opinions of all sides,
including Yugoslavia, should be taken into consideration," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Takes Measures to Tackle Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been taking
precautionary measures to tackle the year 2000 computer problem
which may occur due to the calendar time-based computer and
electronic systems and may affect computers and electronically
controlled devices all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar set up a National Committee on Y2K Work Program on
January 22 this year with the Minister of Communications, Posts
and Telegraphs as its chairman and officials from ministries and
computer associations and experts as members.
</P>
<P>
The committee then formed three sub-committees on Y2K
awareness, problem identification and solution.
</P>
<P>
On tackling the Y2K problem, Myanmar has also strengthened
consultations and cooperation with foreign countries such as
Japan. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry
offered to help Myanmar by arranging for Japan Overseas
Development Cooperation to collect data on middle and small-scale
computerized companies jointly with the National Committee.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on Y2K under the topics of "First Challenge to
Millennium" was held by the Myanmar Computer Scientists
Association and Myanmar Computer Industries Association.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem will be encountered in military works.
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenge, the Myanmar Defense Services (Army, Navy
and Air Force) Computer Department also sponsored in February a
seminar on the challenges in the field.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Myanmar newspapers, radio and television services are
devoting their articles and discussion programs on facts about Y2K
to educate the public.
</P>
<P>
According to the data on Y2K collected from 37 government
organizations and 21 private banks, Y2K compliance was found in 34
percent of special purpose packages, 56 percent of custom
applications, 47 percent of databases and 20 percent of
electronically controlled embedded systems, while noncompliance
was 22 percent, 33 percent, 34 percent and 8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The findings concluded that Y2K will not be an insurmountable
problem in Myanmar but called for further studies on embedded
systems.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Minister of Communications, Posts and Telegraphs
said that as the country has no large computer networks to speak
of, precautionary measures for the Y2K problem will not be
difficult to be carried out.

<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China Central Television will have
a live broadcast tonight of a program in commemoration of the
three Chinese journalists who were killed in the attack on the
Chinese embassy by US-led NATO missiles a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The program is being sponsored by People's Daily, the Xinhua
News Agency, Guangming Daily, China Central Television, China
Radio International, and the All-China Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 Participants have been rehearsing the 90 minutes
program for 9 days. The director Wang Xiansheng says that "the
everlasting memory, the eternal spirit, the ongoing search for a
brighter future" will be its theme and it will consist mainly of
readings of the journalist-martyrs' news stories, poems in their
honor, and on-the-spot coverage.
</P>
<P>
Chinese correspondents in Belgrade will give their views and
reminiscences via satellite and Chinese overseas will be able to
be in touch with the motherland. Statues of the three journalists
will be seen by the public for the first time on the program, Wang
says.

journalists themselves who make up the bulk of the cast and a song
that journalists composed just for tonight's gathering that will
be sung there.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Think Carefully on Lamb Import Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime Minister
Tim Fischer Tuesday warned U.S. President Bill Clinton of World
Trade Organization (WTO) action if his decision on lamb import
restrictions went against Australia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was expected to make a decision on imposing
restrictions on Australian and New Zealand lamb imports last
Saturday, but the decision has been delayed twice and is now
expected Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Australia's powerful National Farmers' Federation (NFF) said it
had information the decision could be even worse than first
expected, with rumors of a 22 percent tariff on all lamb imports,
not just future imports above the existing trade level.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, as a presidential campaigner, Clinton himself said
"protectionism is just a fancy word for giving up," Fischer, also
trade minister, told the Australian parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"May I respectfully remind the President of the U.S.A. of his
quote and ... if they are going to provide any sort of leadership
they ought to think carefully about this and think again," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said an adverse decision would sour this month's
upcoming APEC negotiations in New Zealand as well as the November
WTO round on new trade liberalization negotiations in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
NFF president Ian Donges told reporters a tariff on all lamb
imports would effectively shut Australia out of a 65 million U.S.
dollar a year marketplace, representing about 10 percent of
Australia's lamb production.
</P>
<P>
He said Australian farmers were also calling for retaliatory
action against U.S. products, although he admitted Australia could
never win a tit-for-tat trade war.

<HEADLINE> Curfew Imposed Upon Nigeria's Major Oil City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's oil-rich Delta State
governor has ordered a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Warri Monday to
curb the rampant violence in the Nigerian oil city.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers could shoot at sight any violators of the curfew,
reported Tuesday's Nigerian Tribune, a major Nigerian daily.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo is to visit the crisis-torn city
within this week to assess damages and seek "lasting peace" in the
region, said Doyin Okupe, an special assistant to the president.
</P>
<P>
Governor Chief James Ibori of Delta State, who signed a
statement Monday announcing the curfew, had briefed the president
on the present crisis, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The president views these developments with grave concern and
has decided to visit the troubled zone personally before the end
of the week," Okupe said.
</P>
<P>
"Thereafter, major government decisions to bring lasting peace
to the area will be announced", he added.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of violence in southern Nigeria's Warri and
surrounding areas has claimed hundreds of lives, making about
300,000 people refugees.
</P>
<P>
Violence continued Monday with at least one people dead and
many houses burnt to ground after unidentified militant youths
took over some major streets in Warri city on sunday.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began weeks ago when militant Ijaw youths torched an
entire Itsekiri village of Aruton in Warri region, killing about
200 people.
</P>
<P>
The Itsekiris then fought back killing more people including
Ijaws and Urhobos suspected to have harbored Ijaw refugees.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees Stable Price Level This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria witnessed a stable price
level in March this year with only an 0.8% increase in its
inflation rate in the month over February, said the Federal Office
of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Tuesday quoted an index
published by Nigerian Federal Office of Statistics as saying that
the composite consumer price index stood at 3395.3 in March, up
from 3370 in February.
</P>
<P>
The rise was as a result of increases in the prices of staples,
foot wear and the cost of vehicle maintenance, said the latest
edition of Statistical News.
</P>
<P>
The prices of Kerosene and edible oil fell in most centers
during the period under review.
</P>
<P>
The average annual rate of rise of consumer retail price or the
 percentage change in the average composite consumer price index
for the 12-month period ending March 1999 was 11.6, which means
that a fixed market basket of goods and services purchased with
100 Naira (about 0.945 US dollar) during the 12-month period
ending March last year sold for 111.6 naira (1.19 U.S. dollar) on
the average during a corresponding period ending March 1999, it
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Anwar Seeks to Strike Out Sodomy Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's High Court Tuesday
decided to hear a motion filed by former Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim and his adopted brother, Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat
Madja, seeking to strike out the sodomy case against them, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Datuk Ariffin Jaka postponed the hearing of the case
again on Tuesday following an application by Attorney-General Tan
Sri Mohtar Abdullah to file an affidavit in reply to the notices
of the motion filed by Anwar and Sukma Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Justice Ariffin Monday allowed the hearing of the case, which
was to begin Monday, to be postponed to Tuesday to enable Anwar
and Sukma to file the notices of motion and to serve them on
Mohtar, who is leading the prosecution team.
</P>
<P>
Mohtar, in applying for the postponement on Tuesday, said that
he needed time to file an affidavit in reply as issues raised by
Anwar and Sukma in their notices of motion were very serious.
</P>
<P>
Mohtar Monday applied to amend, for the second time, the charge
against Anwar, 51, and Sukma, 38. In the amended charge, they are
alleged to have committed carnal intercourse against the order of
nature on Azizan Abu Bakar on a night between January and March
1993 at Tivoli Villa in Jalan Medang Tanduk, Bangsar.
</P>
<P>
They are charged under Section 377B of the Penal Code which
carries a maximum jail term of 20 years and whipping on
conviction.
</P>
<P>
On September 29 last year, when Anwar was produced in court, he
was charged of committing the offense "on a night in May 1994,"
but on May 4 this year, the alleged commission of the offense was
amended to "on a night in May 1992."
</P>
<P>
Sukma faces another charge of abetting Anwar in the commission
of the offense, at the same time and place.
</P>
<P>
Azizan is the former driver of Anwar's wife.
</P>
<P>
Raja Aziz Addruse, who heads a nine-member panel defending
Anwar, objected to the amendment on the ground that such repeated
amendments by the prosecution were improper and unfair to Anwar
and Sukma.
</P>
<P>
Karpal Singh who is defending Sukma said the amendment would
render the notice of alibi already issued to the defense witnesses
null and no longer accurate.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, reported to have received treatment at the Kuala Lumpur
Hospital Monday night, was present in court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to six years' jail on April 14 when he was
found guilty of four charges of corrupt practices in interfering
in police investigations into allegations of sexual misconduct
against him.

Monday inaugurated a reviewing panel responsible for revisiting
former government' s contracts, licenses, appointments and
awards, reported local newspaper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president told the inauguration ceremony of the panel that
he is determined to change the government's image by addressing

perpetuation of corruption in the public sector."
</P>
<P>
He said that the examination of the approvals should be done

fair-play, prudence, and the public interest.

adjustment of money involved, or outright cancellation of these
approvals.
</P>
<P>
The panel will have three months to accomplish its task, and
all governmental agencies have been ordered to give full
cooperation to it.

<HEADLINE> NATO Use of Military Force Against Yugoslavia Is No Small Matter: Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO's brazen use of military force
against Yugoslavia is neither a small matter nor is it an
independent one, but one that has a bearing on the basic question
of what kind of new international order to establish and what to
orient the 21st century to, President Jiang Zemin said during a
meeting here this afternoon with Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, the European Union's envoy to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that since the end of the Cold War, multi-
polarization of the world has become an irreversible historical
trend and the attempt to build a uni-polar world or to establish
hegemony world-wide will constitute a great threat to world peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
China's actions on the Kosovo issue were based on the issue
itself and on the overall interests of the Chinese people and
world peace and stability, and were taken to uphold justice, he
said.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2,500 ethnic groups in the world, Jiang
pointed out, and the majority of the world's countries have many
ethnic groups and China has always believed that all ethnic groups
should be absolutely equal and should live harmoniously with each
other, and that their legitimate rights should be respected and
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
History has shown that ethnic issues are extremely complicated
and sensitive and that external military interference can only
intensify the contradictions and leave long-term hidden troubles
instead of providing a thorough settlement.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari explained to Jiang the latest developments in
reaching a political settlement of the Kosovo issue and said that
it is very important to let China, which is a permanent member of
the UN Security Council, know them.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan also was present during
the meeting.

"We should thank all Indonesians, who along with the security
apparatus, have contributed to the peaceful situation (during
Monday's election). Such condition could only be created with the
support of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we see some imperfections here and there, we should see
them as technical problems -- the lack of facilities,
transportation and skilled staff members," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, he said, is entering democracy and that it is
natural if problems arise in a big-scale election.
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Maarif, earlier
said the armed forces are calling on the people to be prepared in
accepting the election results.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the lead being enjoyed by the Indonesian
Democratic party of Struggle (PDI-P) under the leadership of
Megawati Soekarno Putri, Maarif said the winners should be
welcomed and the losers should hold some self-introspection and
take their defeat good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
Claiming the people have recognized the military's neutrality
during the election, he stressed that the armed forces will not
intervene in the vote count.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results of the general election have been
coming into the Central Election Commission here since Monday
evening, indicating the PDI-P as the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
Out of the national parliament votes counted, the PDI-P led
other parties with 284,623 votes. The National Awakening Party
(PKB) has 182,760 votes, according to a tally issued by the
election commission at 15:45 local time (0845 GMT) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But with more than 100 million votes to count, the results
cannot be considered a reliable trend, and more indicative results
than the small fraction of one percent tallied are not expected to
come in before Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Other early front runners were the ruling Golkar Party with
88,053 votes and the Muslim-based United Development Party (PPP)
with 46,013 votes, followed by the National Mandate Party (PAN)
which had 37,265 votes.
</P>
<P>
Some 112 million voters were registered to take part in the
first elections since former president Soeharto stepped down in
May 1998, but it is still unclear how many had voted Monday.
</P>
<P>
The voters will elect 462 candidates to the 500-seat House of
Representatives (DPR). The remaining 38 members will be reserved
for the military whose members do not vote.

<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is expected to hold a
trade exhibition from July 12 to 17 in Lagos to boost its trade
relations with Nigeria, according to a Daily Times report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted organizers of the exhibition as saying that
at least 47 companies have indicated their interest in
participation.

<P>
Sue Hennings of Exhibition Management Services told the paper
that "the companies are quite excited about going to Nigeria,"
adding response has been very impressive.
</P>
<P>
The planned exhibition is a joint initiative by the South
African departments of foreign affairs, trade and industry, the
Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Nigeria's
Exhibition Management Service.
</P>
<P>
Hennings said that participating companies are involved in

investment treaty between the two major African countries.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Cambodia Can Be Equal Partner Within ASEAN -Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Cambodian scholar said
here Tuesday that Cambodia can be an equal partner within the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) despite its current
low development level compared to other ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
Sorn Samnang, president of the newly reestablished Royal
Academy of Cambodia, told Xinhua in an interview that "our country
can be an equal partner within ASEAN although Cambodia now has low
living standard and the economic recovery has not yet fully
restarted."
</P>
<P>
Samnang is in Singapore for the meeting of the ASEAN Eminent
Persons' Group (EPG). The EPG, endorsed by ASEAN leaders at the
6th ASEAN Summit in Hanoi in December 1998, is made up of
prominent businessmen and intellectuals from ASEAN, and each ASEAN
country has nominated one member to the EPG.
</P>
<P>
The 10 EPG members attended Tuesday's session of the inaugural
meeting, which is devoted to mapping out the ASEAN Vision 2020
adopted by ASEAN leaders.
</P>
<P>
While noting that Cambodia was reduced to a war-torn country as
a result of 30 years of conflict, Samnang said: "Recently we have
national reconciliation and real peace has come back to Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
On the ASEAN Vision 2020, Samnang said Cambodia's admission
into ASEAN is an important step for Cambodia and for ASEAN as
well, as the regional grouping now can make plans for the
development of the whole region consisting of 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
Samnang said it seemed to be difficult for Cambodia to
participate in the process on an equal footing with other ASEAN
members in terms of development because his country still has many
problems.
</P>
<P>
"But we will try our best and make more efforts to rebuild our
country more rapidly," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is social economic disparity among ASEAN
countries. Some countries in the region are in prosperous modern
society which can be compared to developed nations while Cambodia
is now remaining at a stage of the first half of this century
compared to other more developed ASEAN nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Cambodia was a prosperous country in the
region before the war, Samnang said that "we can compete with
other nations in the region in future and become an equal partner
in ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
Asked what proposals he would make at the EPG meeting, Samnang
said the first thing for ASEAN to do is to eradicate poverty and
reduce the social economic disparity among the members of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The next, he said, is that "we should learn from the European
Community and start with the agricultural common market so as to
update the living standard of the people in the region."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot promote development if more people live in poverty,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"After 15 or 20 years we can extend the common program to other
fields," he added.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders adopted the Vision 2020 and the follow-up Hanoi
Plan of Action when they met in Kuala Lumpur and Hanoi. When the
leaders last met in December 1998 in Hanoi, they decided to
establish the EPG and entrust to it the important task of drawing
up fresh perspectives on how to fully realize the objectives of
Vision 2020.
</P>
<P>
Opening the inaugural EPG meeting Tuesday morning, Singapore
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Law S Jayakumar said the Vision
2020 statement spells out the leaders' vision of ASEAN for the
next millennium and it encompasses the political and security,
economic, social, cultural and external dimensions of all ASEAN's
activities and interests.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar also said the Hanoi Plan of Action is an important
document setting out a detailed road map on how to operationalize
Vision 2020.

<HEADLINE> October's Mozambican Elections Impossible: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican presidential and
parliamentary elections will not be held in October this year as
originally scheduled, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Jamisse Taimo, Chairman of the National Electoral Commission,
made the remark here Monday at a voters civil awareness meeting,
attended by governmental institutions, major parties,
non-governmental organizations and religious groups.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper reported Tuesday that the October time
table becomes impossible as parties running the elections will
have to have time for their campaigns after the voters
registration which can not be finished by September 18.
</P>
<P>
But Taimo said that efforts are being made to hold the
elections within this year.
</P>
<P>
It is also said that about 1,930 teams are to be sent
throughout the country to guarantee the smooth going of the
registration, which is expected to attract eight million potential
voters and cost 30 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling Mozambican Liberation Front and the biggest
opposition party, the Mozambican National Resistance party, favor
that elections be held with this year, but the Mozambican National
Resistance party had said that it is not good to hold the
elections in December, the rainy season, during which it will be
hard for some voters to cast their ballots for poor transport.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Improving Small Loan Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC)
recently developed a management system for small loans to poor
farmers so that the loans are better regulated.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural banks and branches will directly issue loans to
poor farmers rather than to poverty-relief associations, which in
turn loan the money to farmers.
</P>
<P>
This form of credit is now commonly used in developing
countries to help poor farmers get out of poverty. It was
introduced into China in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the ABC issued 800 million yuan worth of small loans
to poor farmers in China and helped 1.3 million people get out of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Shangjun, the General Manager of the bank's credit
department, says that there were some problems with small loans in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang further explained that the poverty-relief association, a
government institution providing help for poor farmers, has no
legal person standing and cannot get loans.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that some poverty-relief associations used the
loans for other purpose.

<HEADLINE> Plantations a Growing Source of World Wood: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of the world's
industrial timber supply will come from plantations within 40
years, with the Oceania region sourcing the highest amount from
plantations, a new study has shown.
</P>
<P>
The study, which was released Tuesday by the official
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE)
and Jakko Poyry Consulting, said only 35 percent of timber would
be sourced from plantations next year.
</P>
<P>
But this would grow to 44 percent by 2020 and to 46 percent by
2040.
</P>
<P>
Oceania, where forestry products are sourced mainly from
Australia and New Zealand, currently produces about 55 percent of
its timber from plantations.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to grow to 67 percent by 2040, ahead of South
America on 66 percent and Europe and the former Soviet Union on 55
percent.
</P>
<P>
Plantation production from Oceania is projected to increase by
36 percent between 1994 and 2010, the second largest increase
after Asia on 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
But its overall production as a proportion of world supply is
expected to remain low at about three percent, compared to the 34
percent share of the market that north and central America will
hold by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The report said Oceania could exceed projections for plantation
production if Australia achieves its bid to triple the plantation
area to three million hectare by 2020.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, U.S. to Enter Eighth Round of Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Although there remained few problems
in the Vietnam-U.S. trade talks, these would be difficult to
solve, the Saigon Times Daily reported Tuesday, quoting a
Vietnamese trade official.
</P>
<P>
A Vietnamese trade mission will leave for Washington this week
for the eighth round of talks on a trade agreement with the United
States, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted head of the Vietnamese trade mission Nguyen
Dinh Luong as saying on Monday that the two sides would "tackle
the remaining problems" during the eighth round of Vietnam-U.S.
trade talks.
</P>
<P>
However, these remaining problems would be difficult to solve
since the two countries were still far from agreeing on these,
said Luong who heads the Department for Europe and the Americas
and International Organizations of Vietnam's Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Luong said that he had been appointed to assist Vietnam's Trade
Minister to "heighten the role of this round."
</P>
<P>
The eighth round of the talks will start next Monday and is
expected to last one week.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese delegation, like the one at the last round in
Hanoi last March, comprises some 20 members.
</P>
<P>
At the seventh round of talks, Vietnam and U.S. had outlined a
draft trade pact on the trade in goods and services, intellectual
property, and the development of investment ties, said an official
of Vietnam's Trade Ministry, adding that the 100-page agreement
would be a long-term legal foundation for regulating bilateral
economic and commercial relations.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Companies Open Senior Citizen Care Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- State-owned companies in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guandong Province, are no
longer burdened with the high costs of caring for the elderly, but
are instead establishing profitable care centers for senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Guangchuan Senior Citizens Care Center operated by the
Guangzhou Shipbuilding Plant provides care for retirees and
employment opportunities for laid-off workers. The center opened
in October last year and is currently home to more than 60 senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Five additional state-owned companies in Guangzhou have opened
senior citizens care centers and 16 related centers have opened
throughout Guangdong. Some 850,000 senior citizens over the age of
60 account for 12 percent of the province's total population.
</P>
<P>
Zhuang Chenwen, an official with the municipal social welfare
department, said Guangdong has vast market potential for
commercial senior citizen care centers.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed the pressing need for improved services
and facilities, as well as standardized charges.
</P>
<P>
The city government has drafted a series of measures to boost
the market, including the introduction of business information
services and tax exemptions for senior citizen care centers.

<HEADLINE> Tea Leaf Intake Drops in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaf intake in most tea-growing
areas in Kenya had declined due to unfavorable weather with only
isolated rainfall and low morning and evening temperature, the
Africa Tea Brokers (ATB) has said.
</P>
<P>
A report issued Monday by the ATB said that the cumulative
output figure now stood at 76.57 million kg or 32.39 percent
below the same period last year, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the crop output for last April was
26.3 million kg, a 1.6-percent increase over the same period in
1998, adding that the tea crop levels were below average for the
time of the year.
</P>
<P>
In April, five sales were held in which a total of 385,248
packages were sold, while in the 1998 same period, four sales
were held during which 245,590 packages were sold.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's tea mainly exports to Pakistan, Britain, Egypt, Iran,
Yemen, Sudan and other Middle East countries. Last year the
country exported 264,200 tons of tea, earning some 580 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokeswoman Reiterates China's Resentment over EU Wood Packaging Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue reiterated that China "strongly resents"
the recent European Union (EU) decision targeting at wood
packaging used for Chinese exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
She told a press conference here this afternoon that the
decision could "adversely affect Chinese exports valued at some
seven billion U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
Hu Chusheng, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), has already made an announcement on
the same issue earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed resentment over the EU announcement on June 1,
which instructed member nations to adopt immediate measures to
implement new inspection standards for wood packaging used for
exports from China after June 10.
</P>
<P>
"The EU refrained from notifying or conducting negotiations
with China prior to the announcement," Zhang said, adding that
China strongly resents the unilateral decision, which conflicts
with the guidelines of the bilateral economic and trade
cooperation agreement and adversely affects normal bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
She stressed, the bulk of Chinese export goods set for shipment
in June have arrived at ports, and they could hardly meet the new
EU standards within a grace period of only 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman reiterated that "China has always insisted that
joint negotiations between all parties involved should be used to
resolve bilateral trade disputes and opposed any actions or
measures which adversely impact the normal growth of bilateral
trade."

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Owes $236M to Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government still owes a
record 590.8 billion kwacha (about 236 million U.S. dollars) to
the central bank and other commercial banks by May 14, the latest
statistics from the Bank of Zambia (BOZ) showed.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the government debt represents a rise of 5.8
percent from 558.2 billion kwacha (some 223.2 million dollars)
registered by April 30, Financial Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government usually borrows from the banking system through
the issuance of treasure bills and bonds when it wants to meet its
financing needs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the increased government borrowing from the banking
system is usually a source of concern from the business community
because this leaves little available credit to the private sector
for expansion and investments, it added.
</P>
<P>
The trend also tends to push up interest rates because the
government has to offer a better rate for commercial banks to buy
its bonds and treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
The government's debt with the banking system last year
registered about 563 billion kwacha (about 245 million dollars) by
the December 1998, the newspaper reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 8 (Xinhua) (C A senior official of the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) has
underscored here the importance of training on safety in food
processing sector to improve food quality.
</P>
<P>
UNIDO Country Representative Felix Ugbor said Monday that UNIDO
is supporting a project in seven sub-Saharan countries to improve
safety in food processing including fish, milk, meat, poultry,

In his opening address at a two-day training workshop at the

its food processing sector so that it can compete in the world
markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that one objective of the UNIDO project, entitled the
Application of Quality and Safety Principles to the Food
Processing Sector, is to improve food safety through the training
of legislators.
</P>
<P>
"Such training will provide the law enforcers with means of
implementing food laws and standards to ensure food safety and
increase the level of food quality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another objective is to assist selected pilot enterprises in
each country to upgrade the safety and quality of their food
products through training in safety procedures and quality
management systems.
</P>
<P>
"The third objective is to upgrade the capacity of technical
institutions that assist food enterprises in improving safety and
quality of their products," Ugbor concluded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNIDO donated Monday several laboratory
equipment for food testing worth 10,000 U.S. dollars to TBS.

<P>
NICOSIA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 people took part in an
anti-NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) rally held in
Nicosia Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The rally in central Nicosia was organized by the left-wing
AKEL party, the center-right Democratic Party, the Socialist EDEK
party and other political groups.
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized under the slogan "Stop bombings now
-Give peace a chance."
</P>
<P>
"We want to hope that the criminal bombardments will stop,"
said EDEK party leader Vassos Lyssarides.
</P>
<P>
He said any peace deal in Yugoslavia must safeguard the
country's sovereignty and the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The rally was the latest in a series against NATO's air strikes
on Yugoslavia, a country which most Greek Cypriots regard as a
traditional ally.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has expressed its concern that the
protests were sending the wrong signals abroad.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, deputy government spokesman Spyros
Arotis said the messages that such events are sending abroad "do
not serve but on the contrary pose a threat to the vital
interests of the Republic of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus needs the common foreign and security policy
the European Union is trying to formulate.

WELLINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's economic growth in
the first quarter of this year was 1.8 percent, the strongest
increase since 1994, according to a survey by the National Bank of
New Zealand.

percent, the top annual growth rate for the year among the 14
regions.

The Auckland region's economy appears to be rebounding, with a
2.2 percent increase in economic activity in the first quarter.
Commercial construction remains strong as does both business and
consumer confidence. But its growth rate in the year to March was

<HEADLINE> Kenya Lifts Visa Rule for European Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has waived
visa requirement for European tourists, a major source of
holiday-makers headed for Kenya's beaches and game parks.
</P>
<P>
Tourism and Wildlife Minister Henry Kosgey announced Monday
that only holiday-makers whose stay in Kenya does not exceed a
month will benefit, local newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The visa rule applied to Britain, France, Switzerland, Belgium,
 Luxembourg and the Netherlands, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Kosgey said that the government had received many pleas from
the tourism sector for a review of the visa rule and hoped that
the waiver would attract tourists who plan to participate in
millennium festivities in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the sector to look beyond the traditional
European markets and to diversify its products.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that out of every 10 tourists coming into the
country, eight are from the European Union. The rest of the
markets include America and East Asia. About one million tourists
visited Kenya in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The minister hoped the European Union to release its promised
140 million shillings (about two million U.S. dollars) for the
long-term marketing of Kenya as a preferred tourist destination,
and called for assistance to the Kenya Tourism Board in its
marketing mandate.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Health Minister Karam
Karam has said Lebanon would extend a program of the World Health
Organization (WHO) throughout the country to fight against
tuberculosis (TB), the daily Al Nahar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the luncheon of a regional conference on the
killer disease, Karam said Monday that in the past six years,
there had been a marked decrease in the number of TB cases in the
country, with a total of 690 reported in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Encouraged by these positive findings, the Health Ministry
has decided, in cooperation with the WHO, to extend the Directly
Observed Treatment Short-Course (DOTS) therapy until it covers the
entire country," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
DOTS involves regular supervision of patients, usually over a
six-month period, to ensure their compliance with the drug
therapy, and also allows them to remain at home during their
treatment.
</P>
<P>
"This summer the Health Ministry has extended DOTS to patients
in the southern suburbs of Beirut and to the country's prisons. We
expect to be covering the whole country by the year 2000," the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the Health Ministry has implemented a national
program to fight TB, which consists of complimentary check-ups,
treatment and observation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that TB treatment in Lebanon was 80 percent
successful and the country's TB death rate did not exceed 2
percent.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Waiting for U.S. Decision on Lamb Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is waiting anxiously
for a final decision of the U.S. Administration on the lamb
imports from New Zealand and Australia and worrying about the
outcome unfavorable to the lamb exporters.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand exported 139 million NZ dollars (76 million U.S.
dollars) worth of lamb to the United States in the past year.
Several months ago, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC)
recommended a range of protectionist measures including a tariff
of around 20 percent on all lamb imports on 1998 level and a
quantitative restriction of 52 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has yet to make a final decision on
the ITC proposals.
</P>
<P>
The United States has signaled a further delay in making a
final decision on possible trade restrictions against New Zealand
and Australian lamb, New Zealand Minister for International Trade
Lockwood Smith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Although it's clear that key agencies within the U.S.
administration have taken New Zealand's arguments seriously,
information out of Washington this morning points to continued
intense lobbying by protectionist politicians from the U.S.
Senate, which could damage New Zealand's existing trade access,"
he said in a media release.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand and Australia are continuing to make
representations in Washington, but I'm still worried about the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
"Our trade with the United States is fair, and it would be a
travesty to see the introduction of penalties on our existing
trade," Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Discover Ancient Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists recently
discovered the ruins of the capital of the Shang Dynasty (16th-
11th century B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The archeological team from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS) unearthed the inner and outer city walls, as well
as the sewage system in the ancient capital which thrived some 3,
600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The discovered ruins of a number of temples in the ancient city
of Yanshi located some 30 km from Luoyang in central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Extensive excavation revealed that the palace was roughly
encircled by an earthen wall some 2-3 meters high. The palace,
which covers some 40,000 sq.m., bears a striking resemblance to
Tian'anmen Square in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists also verified at least eight large-scale
foundations for ancient structures. They depicted the earliest
architectural projects in the Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The discovery provides valuable information for studies of
ancient architecture.

<HEADLINE> Seventh Int'l Fatigue Congress Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 scientists from 35
countries and regions attended the opening session of the Seventh
International Fatigue Congress here today.
</P>
<P>
The five-day congress, which is being held in China for the
first time, will focus on the latest developments in fatigue
research and will offer an opportunity for Chinese and foreign
scientists in the field to engage in academic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Fatigue science, which integrates research on materials,
mechanics and mechanisms, has a history of more than 150 years.
Related research is vitally important for ensuring the safety of
aviation, energy, transportation and communications, said Shi
Changxu, an academician with both the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) and the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE).
</P>
<P>
Worldwide statistics indicate that 80 percent of the fatal
accidents involving machinery are the result of fatigue, aging and
cracking of mechanical materials and structures.
</P>
<P>
The congress will feature discussions on wide-ranging subjects,
including fatigue mechanisms for materials and structures, life
span prediction, and applications of fatigue research for the
aeronautics, communications, materials, mechanical and electrical
industries.
</P>
<P>
The triennial International Fatigue Congress has been held in
Sweden, Britain, the United States, Japan, Canada and Germany
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
This year's congress was jointly organized by the Beijing
Institute of Aeronautical Materials, the Shenyang Institute of
Metal Research under the CAS and the China Materials Research
Society.

<HEADLINE> Patience Urged on Biological Control of Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Residents living around the Lake
Victoria in East Africa should be patient on biological method of
removing water weed, a Kenyan agricultural expert has urged.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the beetles against the stubborn hyacinth
has proved effective, said Cyrus Ndiritu, director of Kenya
Agricultural Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The East Africa Standard newspaper Tuesday quoted Ndiritu as
saying that it would take five years to completely control the
weed.
</P>
<P>
The beetles were introduced in the lake about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The impact of biological control method will be fully felt
within the next three years, the director said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rampant spread of the water weed has posed a great danger
to fish, shipping, electricity generation and water quality,
causing enormous economic loss to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The local residents used to cut weed daily to control its
spread but failed. The Kenyan government embarked on biological
measures to control the menace two years ago. The beetles are
able to eat large quantity of weed at a high speed.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Debt Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has said that
it has no alternative but seek debt cancellation because the
current foreign debt stock for the country is unredeemable.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Tuesday quoted Deputy Finance Minister Godfrey
Simasiku as saying here that the debt crisis is growing at an
alarming rate, hence the need to have the multilateral and
bilateral institutions cancel some of the debt, which stands at
6.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that once a significant part of the debt is cancelled,
it will help the government free resources for investment in other
sectors like health and education.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will
hold a meeting in Washington in September this year to discuss the
debt crisis for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs)
including Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambia is among the three countries in the
sub-region to attend a debt cancellation meeting to be held in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Simasiku said the Addis Ababa meeting will attract 26 HIPCs and
discuss the strategy for debt relief.
</P>

U.N. Economic Commission for Africa will be represented at the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa's ANC One Seat Shy of Two-Thirds Majority by Shang Xuqian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's African
National Congress (ANC) was returned to a second term in power
with 266 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly, just one seat
shy of a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
 A total of 12 opposition parties would be represented in
parliament, according to final results of the June 2 general
election released Monday night by the Independent Electoral
Commission (IEC).
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP) won 38 seats (up from seven in 1994)
and will return to parliament as the official opposition. The
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which confounded pollsters by coming
in third with 34 seats, was likely to be co-opted into the Thabo
Mbeki cabinet.
</P>
<P>
IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi was expected to be offered the
deputy presidency while a cabinet post was also mooted for the
party's deputy chairman, Ben Ngubane.
</P>
<P>
The once all-powerful New National Party (NNP), which in less
than a decade has seen its power diluted from ruling party to
junior partner in the government of national unity, further to
official opposition, has now been relegated to a minor opposition
role with 28 seats.
</P>
<P>
The United Democratic Movement, which fought its maiden
election, arrives in parliament with 14 seats, while the African
Christian Democratic Party has increased its 1994 count from two
to six seats.
</P>
<P>
The Pan Africanist Congress, the United Christian Democratic
Party and the Freedom Front will occupy three seats each, followed
by the Federal Alliance with two.
</P>
<P>
Azanian People's Organization, the Minority Front and the
Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging will be represented by one seat each.
A total of 15.9 million, or 89.28 percent of potential voters,
cast their ballots on June 2.
</P>
<P>
A euphoric IEC chairwoman, Brigalia Bam, said political parties
believed the commission had done a good job in running the polls.
</P>
<P>
"They think we are wonderful, and think we have done a good
job," she said before presenting Mbeki with a certified copy of
the election results.
</P>
<P>
Bam said all South Africans could be proud of the June 2
election, which 96 percent of respondents in a poll described as
free and fair.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the results, president-in-waiting Thabo Mbeki pledged
that democracy was in South Africa to stay.
</P>
<P>
"There is nobody who can seek to change this system, to take
away from people this right to govern," he said. Mbeki also
praised political parties for their conduct in the elections.
</P>
<P>
He thanked ordinary South Africans who had come out in their
millions to vote. Mbeki jokingly indicated that Buthelezi was set
to be offered another cabinet position, as widely speculated in
the media.
</P>
<P>
"Let me take him out of the IFP and put him into government,"
Mbeki said, inviting the IFP leader on stage to accept the
election results on behalf of the government. Buthelezi said the
IFP would abide by an earlier decision to rule in coalition with
the African National Congress in KwaZulu- Natal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ANC indicated it would open talks with the NNP
in the Western Cape, in a bid to form a coalition government in
the province.
</P>
<P>
In both provinces, none of the parties have an absolute
majority and would have to govern in coalition with others.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Beat New York 90-78 to Tie 2-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Maybe Larry Bird was wrong. The
Indiana coach said that for the Pacers to win the series, guard
Reggie Miller needed to take more shots. Miller was held to three
field goals, but the Pacers cruised anyway to a 90-78 triumph in
Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals tonight.
</P>
<P>
Center Rik Smits also struggled for Indiana, but Chris Mullin,
Jalen Rose and the Davises led the way to the easiest victory in
the series for either team.
</P>
<P>
Knicks guard Latrell Sprewell made little noise after his
insertion into the starting lineup as the Pacers evened the best-
of-seven series at two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
Rose scored 19 points and Mullin added 18. Rose shot 8-of-14
from the field and scored nine points in the fourth quarter, when
the Pacers fought off a late charge by the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
Mullin, who had been quiet in the first three games of the
series, scored 10 points in the third period, helping Indiana
maintain its 45-32 half-time lead.
</P>
<P>
Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy's decision to start Sprewell
backfired. The explosive swingman was overmatched on defense by
Mullin and took no shots in the first 11 minutes of the fourth
quarter, killing any chance of a comeback. He scored 12 points on
6-of-14 shooting.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers showed their depth as they won despite leading
scorers Miller and Smits combining for zero points in the first
half. Miller finished with 12 and Smits scored just four points,
all in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Indiana improved to 4-1 on the road in the postseason and hosts
Game 5 on Wednesday. Game 6 on Friday in New York.

to a four-year contract. Financial terms were not disclosed, but
the Orlando Sentinel is reporting the deal is worth $8 million.
</P>
<P>
"I am ecstatic to be here," said Rivers, who worked for Turner
Sports as a basketball analyst. "When I looked at all the
organizations around the league, this is where I want to be."
</P>
<P>
Rivers, 37, becomes the second-youngest coach in the NBA, Jeff
Van Gundy of the New York Knicks is also 37, but three months
younger than Rivers.
</P>
<P>
"People ask me why do you want to take this risk and the answer
is this is what I want to do," Rivers said. "Who cares about the
risk, look at the reward."
</P>
<P>
Rivers was regarded by most NBA executives as a strong general
manager or coaching candidate since he retired as a player in 1996.
His savvy as a point guard and intensity on defense made him a
team leader when he played for the Atlanta Hawks, Los Angeles
Clippers, New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs in his 13-year
career.
</P>
<P>
Although Rivers has no experience as a coach, he is confident
in his ability to run the Magic.
</P>
<P>
Magic general manager John Gabriel believes Rivers can have the
same type of success as Indiana coach Larry Bird, who also had no
experience as a coach before he was named to run the Pacers two
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Shine in King's Cup Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. fighters fought their
hearts out before being outpointed by the mighty Cuban team on the
third day of the preliminary round of the 23rd King's Cup Amateur
Boxing tournament here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. boxers fought valiantly, the Cubans were
proved to be too tough for them to beat.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban team won all the seven bouts in Monday's matches.
</P>
<P>
Glenn E Baily, the U.S. head coach, was satisfied with the
performance of the "young and inexperienced" American boys, saying
their opponents are the best amateur boxers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Team B did a fine job by winning six out of
their seven bouts against Kazakhstan, the highlight of which was
Thailand's Suban Pannon's 10-0 victory over Meity Ismailov in the
48 kg class.
</P>
<P>
After the bout, both Asiad gold medalists Suban and Thailand's
Cuban coach Juan Fontanial were convinced that his form would
warrant a place in the final.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Ukraine beat Australia 7-0, with Australia's
trainers threw in the towel on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
Fontanial said he thought the Ukraine team is the second best
team in the tournament, and maybe even capable of beating the
Cubans.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has started searching
in supermarkets and shops for the presence of banned Belgian
products suspected of being contaminated with toxic dioxins, a
local daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eight hundred inspectors have been sent out to Kuwait's five
governorates to inspect supermarkets, cooperatives and shops
dealing with chicken products, Assistant Director of the Kuwait
Municipality Food Department Marzouq Al-Oteibi told the Arab
Times on Monday.
</P>
<P>
All banned Belgian products to be found in markets will be
destroyed, Al-Oteibi said. But he added that "so far we have not
found any banned products manufactured after January 15 this
year."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait on Sunday imposed an indefinite ban on imports of
Belgian chicken and eggs due to risks of dioxin contamination. It
also decided to withdraw all Belgian poultry products from
markets and storage which were produced after January 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry, Kuwait last year imported 12.9 million Kuwaiti
dinars (42.6 million U.S. dollars) worth of Belgian goods.
</P>
<P>
Among those products were frozen poultry, animal feed, milk
powder, beef products, sheep and goat meat, biscuits and
chocolates. No Belgian eggs were imported.

LUANDA -- The fish production of Angola, one of the major fish
producers in Africa, was 202,900 tons last year, down by 16.1
percent from that of the previous year, Angola's Ministry of
Fisheries revealed Monday.

A report issued by the ministry blamed the reduction on the
decrease of catch on the part of foreign fleets, which was, in the

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Business Environment Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's score for its business
environment has improved from 5.06 during the 1994-98 period to
5.99 for the 1999-2003 period, said the latest report of Economist
Intelligence Unit (EIU).
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's global ranking has moved up from 45th to 42nd place
out of 60 countries and its regional ranking has gone up to 11th
position from the 12th position out of 16 countries.
</P>
<P>
The EIU, a London-based think tank, said the improvement in Sri
Lanka's business environment was a result of its policy towards
private enterprise and competition, foreign investment, the labor
market and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The country's minuscule share of world trade and small
population has restricted market opportunities. Its score for
infrastructure has also been restrained due to bad roads and rail
network.
</P>
<P>
The EIU predicted a slowdown in economic growth in Sri Lanka,
lower tax revenue and high defense expenditure which will prevent
the fiscal deficit from falling below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the government will continue to lengthen the
maturity structure of its debt by shifting liabilities towards
long-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
Regulations pertaining to prices on energy, water supply and
transport are likely to be relaxed progressively.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Sri Lanka has one of the most open foreign
investment regimes in the region which is likely to move towards
greater liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Where the stock market is concerned, it has remained in the
doldrums and is unlikely to recover, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Cheaper Drug Against HIV to Be Available in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A drug proven to be effective
against the HIV virus is to be available here in the next few
months and will be another alternative for AIDS patients who are
unable to afford the existing therapy, the Bangkok Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The drug is said to be effective in blocking virus production
at the beginning of the HIV replication cycle.
</P>
<P>
Clinical results have confirmed that efavirenz penetrates
cerebrospinal fluid, a sanctuary where HIV is believed to conceal
itself and reproduce, and reduces HIV to below the level of
detection.
</P>
<P>
Marketed overseas as Sustiva by Merck Sharp and Dohme, a U.S.
pharmaceutical company, the drug will be released into the Thai
market after approval from the Food and Drug Administration, which
is expected this month.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the U.S. said that efavirenz could be used in
developing countries instead of drugs in the Protease Inhibitor
(PI) group since it is much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
It is calculated that if efavirenz is used to replace PI drugs,
it can save cost at about 4,000 baht (108 U.S. dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Thailand suggested more studies be carried out to
focus on an appropriate dosage since there has never been a
clinical trial of this drug on Thai people.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's first ever tube baby
unit has been established at a government hospital in the Southern
province, the Ministry of Health sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The unit at Mahamodara Hospital in Galle, 116 kilometers south
of Colombo, will greatly help childless couples who can not afford
expensive fertilization operations abroad, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The unit costing 15 million rupees (214,000 U.S. dollars)
includes an in vitro fertilization laboratory and two operating
theaters.
</P>
<P>
Childlessnes has become a major problem in Sri Lanka. Childless
couples become mentally disturbed and spend a large amount of
money in this connection.
</P>
<P>
Generally, about one million rupees (14,000 dollars) are spent
for an in vitro fertilization in India or Singapore while a very
much higher amount is spent in Britain or the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in the Southern province alone there are
as many as 7,500 childless couples.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the tube baby unit, a clinic for the upliftment
of maternal health activities has also been established at this
hospital where over 250 mothers are treated daily.

<P>
KATHMANDU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- After delay over one month,
voters in two constituencies of Kathmandu line up Tuesday to elect
their share of two deputies to the 205-seat House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Forty and 24 candidates are contesting the polls respectively
in the No. 1 and No. 3 constituencies in the capital, the Election
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The government has declared Tuesday a public holiday for all
government offices in Kathmandu to match the elections, which were
delayed due to the death of Man Mohan Adhikari, chairman and prime
ministerial candidate of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified
Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
The other five constituencies in the capital went to the polls
on May 3.
</P>
<P>
Bam Dev Gautam, general secretary of the Communist Party of
Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML), is trying his luck in the No. 1
constituency after losing in his home turf of Bardia district in
the elections on May 3.
</P>
<P>
Elections held on May 3 and May 17 produced 201 seats in the
house. The CPN-ML, which broke away from the CPN-UML in March
1998, failed to garner any seat.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress, which clinched 110 seats, formed on May 31
its majority government headed by Krishna Prasad Bhattarai.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai unofficially withdrew from the race in the No. 1
constituency of Kathmandu as he was already elected in Parsa
district on May 3. Lokesh Dhakal is competing as an independent
for the party.
</P>
<P>
Elections in the No. 5 constituency of Siraha district and the
No. 3 constituency of Sunsari district, which were rescheduled for
June 23 and June 26 respectively following the death of
candidates, will produce the remaining two seats in the 205-member
house.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML and the National Democratic Party (RPP) have agreed
to an electoral alliance in the last four constituencies. The RPP
agreed to support the CPN-UML in Kathmandu-1 and -3 and Siraha-5
while the CPN-UML will throw its weight behind the RPP in

<HEADLINE> Thailand Bans Belgian Meat, Poultry, Dairy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand Monday joined several
other countries in curbing imports of Belgian meat, poultry and
dairy products amid fears of food contamination by cancer-causing
dioxins, The Nation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
From Tuesday on, the import and sale in the kingdom of beef,
pork, chicken, eggs, dairy and other milk- or egg-based foods
originating in Belgium is banned, the newspaper quoted Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) chief Mongkol na Songkhla as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol insisted the ban was necessary even though before the
scare Thailand was not an importer of meat, poultry and dairy
products from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
FDA reports showed that before the onset of the dioxin scare,
16 Thai companies imported or had asked to import products from
Belgium in the form of chocolate, biscuits, meat and related
products.
</P>
<P>
However, three of the 16 companies had failed to import meat
from Belgium, while another two that had imported albumen worth
about two million baht (54,000 U.S. dollars) had only used it as a
raw material for foods destined for export.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol said the ban was temporary and would be lifted when the
situation improved.
</P>
<P>
The FDA chief ruled out the inspection of meat, poultry and
dairy products from other European countries, saying it would be
impractical and expensive.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin is a major carcinogen which can be absorbed in fat, meat
or milk.

<HEADLINE> Italy Confiscates Polluted Belgian Meat, Milk Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 7 (Xinhua) - The Italian Health Ministry has
confiscated thousands of kilograms of Belgian meat and milk
products which were suspected of potential contamination by a
toxic chemical, dioxin.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said on Monday that they were trying to trace the
path of suspect polluted Belgian products to the Italian consumer.
They will test them for dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin, which entered public awareness after the U.S. army used
it in defoliants during Vietnam War, is a compound difficult to
expel by human body and known to cause cancer and damage of
neurocyte.
</P>
<P>
Rome officially claimed on Monday there was no Belgian milk or
meat products such as pork, milk, chicken, beef, yogurt and cheese,
on sale in the city.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that inspections have been made at 110
farms, warehouses and supermarkets, with the products worth over
650,000 U.S. dollars being confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has announced a ban on sales of all
Belgian meat and dairy.
</P>
<P>
Fearing a repeat of the Mad Cow phenomenon, when nationwide
sales of beef plummeted, Italian butchers and supermarkets put up
signs saying that their meat was all of Italian origin and
absolutely dioxin-free.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian Agricultural Minister Paolo De Castro on
Monday suggested to the Italian consumers: "Buy Italian products!"
</P>
<P>
"This is when Italian quality should fight back," he told
agriculturists in the north Italian city of Cuneo.
</P>
<P>
"The consumer will have all the guarantees he needs if he buys
Italian product,'' said De Castro, "The quality system of Italian
products, for example all the pork products, is based on rigid
regulations, and the result is guaranteed quality for the consumer.
"
</P>
<P>
De Castro confirmed that Belgian and Luxembourg pork covers
only 5 percent of Italy's pork needs.

<HEADLINE> China's SOEs See Decreased Deficits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in
China generated 5.5 billion yuan in profit during the four months,
comparing with a net deficit for the same period last year,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission Shi
Wanpeng said state-owned and state holding enterprises increased
profits by 13.33 percent and reduced losses by 11.81 percent, by
the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Shi made the remarks in a telephone conference held Monday by
the commission and the All-China Federation of the Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
Profits showed an increase in nine cities and provinces
including Henan, Fujian, Shanghai and Tianjin in the first four
months. During the period, industries in Sichuan and Shanxi
provinces and Beijing began to make profits. Losses decreased in
13 provinces and autonomous regions, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of SOEs still is of grave concern, as the
deep-lying problems of SOEs are gradually exposed in the on-going
reform, said Zhang Junjiu, secretary of the All-China Federation
of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions at various levels should help spur the initiative

<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Rate for the benchmark 91-day
Treasury bills (T-bills) of the Philippines tumbled to its lowest
in 27 months, closing at 9.491 percent in Monday's auction, the
Philippine Star newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was due to favorable economic growth figures for the
first quarter and a cut in key overnight rates of the country's
central bank following a lower-than-expected inflation in May, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
National Treasurer Leonor Briones was quoted as saying that the
market was also ware of the government's firmness in rejecting any
high bids in the auction since it has adequate funds to meet its
financial requirements.
</P>
<P>
Rates for the 182-day T-bills shed 28.8 basis points to settle
at 9.986 percent from 10.274 percent a week earlier, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Briones expressed confidence that the 91-day T-bill rate could
drop to a flat nine percent in the coming weeks, especially if the
central bank continues to cut its key overnight rates.
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, the central bank's overnight borrowing rate was
brought down to 9.625 percent.

<P>
BONN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from seven Western
countries and Russia failed to reach an agreement here Monday on a
draft U.N. peace resolution over the Kosovo crisis after a long
bargaining, but they would resume the talks on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Eight foreign ministers meeting, which was
expected to finalize a U.N. resolution on the implementation of a
Kosovo peace agreement reached last week, lasted some eight hours
and had to be briefly adjourned due to a major rift between the
Group of Seven and Russia on some points of the draft.
</P>
<P>
The difference is focused on the command structure of an
international peacekeeping force to be deployed in Kosovo, the
immediate halt of NATO's bombings before Yugoslavia withdraws its
troops from Kosovo, and the war criminal issue, said the
diplomatic sources present at the talks.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who chaired the
meeting, expressed optimism over a final agreement between the two
sides at a subsequent press conference, stressing that the eight
ministers had agreed to 17 points of the 20-point draft and should
continue discussing the remaining three on Tuesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation in 1999 Estimated at 10-13 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia estimated the
year-on-year inflation at 10 to 13 percent this year partly
because of the rupiah's stable exchange rate against the U.S.
dollar and the steady drop in lending interest rate.
</P>
<P>
The improving economic activities would eventually pave the way
for the country's economic recovery, the central bank said in a
press release, quoted by Antara News Agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Overall, increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) will
range from minus two to nil percent and will reach a positive
growth in fiscal 1999/2000 ending in March.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, inflation will range from 10 percent to 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
The aggregate growth is expected to remain sluggish, and in
terms of demand, the inflation pressure will be relatively low,
the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier projected an inflation target of 17
percent for the current fiscal year, but recently revised it to 10
percent following positive development in the country's
macroeconomic picture.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze and Pearl Reaches to be Greener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China will launch massive forestry
projects in the next decade to improve the ecological environment
along the upper reaches of the Yangtze and Pearl, two of China's
long rivers.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, southwest China's Sichuan, Yunnan and
Guizhou provinces, Guangxi Zhuang and Tibet autonomous regions,
Chongqing Municipality and Chengdu City have decided to pool a
record 120 billion yuan to build an ecological forestry project to
cover more than 65 million hectares of land along the upper
reaches of the two rivers, according to the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The afforestation project is aimed at increasing the green
coverage in the regions to 47 percent, from the present 36.3
percent by 2010, by establishing about 12.5 million hectares of
new forest land on the upper reaches of the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
More than 5.7 million hectares of forest lands are expected to
be planted in the first stage of the ambitious afforestation
program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local governments will invest another 37 billion
yuan to stop the logging of natural forests and turn cultivated
lands, on mountain sides, with a slope of 25 degrees and above,
back into forests.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze and Pearl river areas are home to one-third of the
country's population and 40 percent of the national output value.
</P>
<P>
Wanton tree felling and poor farming practices have caused
severe soil-erosion in the region during the last few decades.
Last year, the government issued a ban on logging in the region
after raging floods devastated many parts of the country and
brought about heavy casualties and financial losses.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Foreign Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's foreign trade, including
border trade, amounted to 534.48 million U.S. dollars in the first
two months of this year, 87.16 million dollars more than that in
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Economic Indicators issued by the
country's Central Statistical Organization, exports in the period
amounted to 199.85 million dollars, while imports came to 334.63
million dollars, showing a trade deficit of 134.78 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's total export volume, the private sector took
up 144.1 million dollars or 72 percent, while the state sector
made up 55.75 million dollars or 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the total import volume, the private sector shared 263.5
million dollars or 78.75 percent, while the state sector
represented 71.13 million dollars or 21.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
To enhance foreign trade, Myanmar implements preferential
policies for private exporters and importers such as
simplification of the export and import procedures, extension of
privileges to entrepreneurs who export at least 2 million dollars'
worth of goods, exemption of custom duties for import of
agricultural implements like machinery, fertilizer and pesticide,
and turning border trade into a regular one using the U.S. dollar
in quoting prices and settling accounts.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar mainly exports agricultural, marine and wood products,
while importing capital, intermediate and consumers' goods.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's total foreign trade reached as high as
3.961 billion dollars, increasing by 31 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a high-ranking Myanmar official recently denied that
the Asian financial crisis had a spill-over effect on the
country's trade as 45 percent of the country's trade is with ASEAN
nations and is complementary rather than competitive, adding that
trade with these countries has been increasing over the past three
years.

<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- German tennis player Boris Becker's
preparation for Wimbledon at the Queen's Club London grass-court
championships had been a washout when only two matches of the
opening round were completed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Becker, triple Wimbledon champion and four-times winner at
Queen's, faced Czech Petr Korda in the opening round match but the
players were able to complete only one game before rain stopped
play.
</P>
<P>
The German player, who has said he will play just three more
tournaments before retiring -- Queen's, Wimbledon and Stuttgart in
July -- will complete his match against the 1998 Australian Open
champion on Tuesday. He leads 1-0.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they will give ticket-holders their money back
as less than the necessary two hours of play was completed on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the only matches to have been completed on a bleak and
drizzly day in London, 12th-seeded Australian Jason Stoltenberg
beat Zimbabwe's Wayne Black 6-3, 6-4 and 10th seed and 1992

<HEADLINE> NATO-Yugoslavia Military Talks to Go on: Ahtisaari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 7 (Xinhua)-The military meeting between NATO
delegation and the Yugoslav officers will continue although it has
stalked, said the European Union Kosovo envoy, Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari Monday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had agreed
it was necessary for NATO and Yugoslavia to keep concordant on the
technical details of Yugoslav forces' withdrawal, he said after
the meeting with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
But Ahtisari declined to say when the meeting would proceed.
</P>
<P>
The military meeting in Macedonia went into a deadlock on
Sunday when NATO delegates said Yugoslavia had raised unacceptable
demands. And the NATO again intensified bombing after a three-day
de-escalation.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari stressed that Russia was "very interested" in a
diplomatic solution to Kosovo crisis, saying "(the Russian
President Boris) Yelzin and (the Russian Kosovo envoy)Chernomyrdin
need peace as well."
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the Group of Eight (G-8) should achieve
agreement on the draft resolution of U.N. Security Council as
quickly as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 composed of seven leading industrial nations--U.S.,
Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Japan--and Russia. The
meeting near Bonn adjourned after ministers failed to get
compromise on several points in the draft.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari said he would fly to Beijing to seek China's back to
the draft.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Conduct Eighth THAAD Anti-Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military will conduct
the eighth test of an anti-missile defense system in New Mexico
State in the country Tuesday morning after seven successive test
failures, the Defense Department announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile is being
developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation to track and collide with
attacking enemy warheads in flight.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's test, postponed two weeks ago when a target missile
went out of control, will be conducted over White Sands, New
Mexico State, missile test range, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
THAAD is designed to protect troops and bases from medium-range
ballistic missile attack. Despite the failures to date, Pentagon
insists that much is learned from each test whether or not the
intercept takes place.
</P>
<P>
The most recent test was aborted May 25 when a Hera target -- a
converted Minuteman missile -- tumbled out of control shortly
after launch. The THAAD missile, designed to collide with and
shatter enemy ballistic missiles, was not launched.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department cited a number of reasons for the THAAD
system's failures so far, including problems with the
target-seeking system on the interceptor rocket.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Asks Clinton Flexible in Kosovo Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
asked United States President Bill Clinton to be flexible Monday
as talks between NATO and Yugoslav military officials on a Serb
pull-out from Kosovo continued to stumble.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to him about the need for the west to be open and
flexible," D'Alema told journalists on Monday in Italian north
city of Milan, relating the substance of a telephone conversation
with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He did not say exactly when the conversation took place.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said that, despite the problems which had emerged in
talks in Macedonia, hopes for a rapid conclusion to the conflict
had not yet been dashed.
</P>
<P>
The talks between NATO and Yugoslav delegations, which began on
Saturday, were originally intended by NATO as a simple handing
over of instructions on a pull-out.
</P>
<P>
They were suspended last night after problems emerged over the
make-up of the international force which is to oversee the Serb
withdrawal and the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said that he stressed to Clinton that it was necessary
"for Russia and other non-NATO countries to be accorded the same
dignity in the international force in Kosovo as NATO countries."
</P>
<P>
But despite his wish for flexibility in the allied camp, the
prime minister made it plain where the blame lay for the delays in
reaching a technical accord on the Serb troop pull-out.
</P>
<P>
"With renewed concern, we now see a continuation of the
dramatic conflict and perverse resistance to the obligations
necessary for true peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the post-war phase, which he said would hopefully
not be long in coming, D'Alema said Italy would propose to host an
international conference on Balkan reconstruction in the southern
port of Bari.

<HEADLINE> De Bruin Loses Drug Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The career of triple Olympic
swimming champion Michelle de Bruin is in ruins after she lost her
appeal against a four-year ban for doping in Lausanne, Switzerland
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
FINA, the sport's governing body, suspended the Irish swimmer
last August, ruling that she had tampered with a urine sample.
</P>
<P>
The sample, which was taken from her in January 1998, was found
to contain lethal levels of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
De Bruin, who shot to fame under her maiden name Smith at the
1996 Olympics in Atlanta, immediately protested her innocence.
</P>
<P>
A Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne heard the appeal
last month - but has now decided that de Bruin "was the only
person who had the motive and opportunity to manipulate the sample
".
</P>
<P>
De Bruin had two strands to her appeal - she tried to convince
the panel that the sample was not hers and also that a third party
may have manipulated them in order to adulterate their content.
</P>
<P>
The shamed swimmer sparked rumors of drug-taking at Atlanta,
when she came from obscurity to beat a host of more illustrious
competitors and went home with three golds and a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
However, she always dismissed the claims as part of a
whispering campaign begun by her rivals in the pool.
</P>
<P>
This ruling means de Bruin will be unable to defend her Olympic
gold medals in the 200m and 400m medley and 400m freestyle in
Sydney next year.
</P>
<P>
It also makes her ineligible for the 2001 world championships
in Fukuoka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
De Bruin will be aged 32 before she can compete again.
</P>
<P>
She is married to former Dutch discus champion Erik de Bruin,
who is also her coach and manager and who had previously been
banned for taking performance-enhancing drugs.

LONDON June 7 (Xinhua) - Wall Street's strong start, a spate of
merger news combined with positive economic reports to lift
European markets higher Monday, despite the downward pull from the
breakdown of negotiations on Kosovo.

<P>
The FTSE 100 in London extended its string of positive gains to
six straight days, climbing 50.50 points to 6412, a rise of 0.79

"The two or three bits of corporate action such as British
Steel's bid for Dutch company Hoogovens and Dixon's proposal to
float Freeserve helped to raise interest," a trader said.
</P>
<P>
Germany's benchmark Xetra DAX gained as pan-European demand for
defensive and cyclical stocks outweighed any jitters about the
breakdown in talks on a Serb withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra DAX closed up 88.73 points, or 1.73 percent, at

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Borrowing Shows a Small Rise in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumers' credit
outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, grew only at a 3.4 percent
annual rate in April to a seasonally adjusted 1.33 trillion
dollars, the Federal Reserve said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the annualized rate of borrowing in April was the
smallest so far this year and marked the third straight month that
the rate of borrowing has slowed.
</P>
<P>
In March, U.S. consumers borrowed at an annual rate of 4.6
percent, much higher than estimated, the Fed said. But the
annualized borrowing rate was 9.1 percent in February and 15.3
percent in January, according to the Fed's revised figures.
</P>
<P>
For April, revolving credit -- primarily credit cards -- showed
