</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The world's leading technology companies  
propelled the Nasdaq composite index within a point of a new 
closing high today, capping a quiet session that left most stocks 
with only slim gains. At the close of trading on Wall Street, the 
Nasdaq was up 16.53 points at 2,886.15. Its all-time high of 
2,887.06 was set Sept. 10. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 
20.27 at 10,823.90. A wide array of technology companies pulled the 
Nasdaq higher. Sun Microsystems rose a day after the company 
declared a 2-for-1 stock split. Aerial Communications soared after 
VoiceStream Wireless agreed to acquire it for $3 billion in stock 
and cash.

	Commerce To Have Web Sales Reports  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department said today it will  
begin asking the nation's retailers to report how much of their 
business is done online. The information will be gathered as part 
of the regular monthly survey the government conducts to compile 
its report on retail sales, a key indicator of how the economy is 
performing. Currently, companies' online sales are lumped into 
total retail sales figures reported to the Commerce Department for 
the monthly report.

	No Changes Foreseen in OPEC Output  
</P>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Ministers of the Organization of  
Petroleum Exporting Countries are expected to stick by their most 
recent round of production cuts when they meet Tuesday in Vienna. 
That means consumers could pay more to heat their homes and drive 
their cars this winter, with worldwide demand for petroleum 
products rising. OPEC produces more than 26 million barrels of 
crude each day, almost two-fifths of the world's total. At its last 
meeting in March, the group agreed together with key non-OPEC 
producers to slash daily production by 2.1 million barrels, or 2.6 
percent of the global supply, in an effort to buoy prices from 
12-year lows. The agreement extends through March 2000.

	Material May Show Russia Laundering  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A top Russian intelligence official said today  
that U.S. investigators have material suggesting that Russian 
businesses laundered money through the Bank of New York. The 
official, Viktor Ivanov, deputy head of the Federal Security 
Service, promised cooperation with the FBI in following the paper 
trail, Russian news agencies reported. Media reports that Russian 
officials may be involved in laundering up to $10 billion through 
the New York bank have intensified growing discontent with 
President Boris Yeltsin and the government just three months before 
national parliamentary elections. Russian officials visited the 
United States last week to meet with American investigators.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Texas Instruments said today it will offer  
software technology that will allow quicker development of products 
using its digital signal processor chips. The Dallas-based 
semiconductor company said the new technology, which it calls 
eXpressDSP, will make it easier to integrate and reuse blocks of 
software in different products. Currently, such information often 
must be rewritten every time it is used in a new product, TI said.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Customers wanting a Taurus, Mustang or  
Explorer would be able to search existing stocks or even place 
custom orders to Ford Motor Co. from their home computers under a 
joint venture announced today by Ford and Microsoft Corp. Using 
Microsoft's CarPoint Web site, Ford will be able to match a 
customer's order with cars in dealer lots, in distribution centers 
or even on the factory floor. Ford would not sell cars directly 
online, which is forbidden by franchise laws. Sales will still be 
completed through dealerships.

	Woman Heads Continental Pilot Group

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines said it has named a woman to  
lead its flight operations, the first such appointment in the 
nation by a major airline. Capt. Deborah McCoy will supervise more 
than 5,200 pilots and 8,700 flight attendants as Continental's 
senior vice president of flight operations, a newly created 
position. Her responsibilities include hiring, training and 
direction of all crew members. Capt. McCoy, a DC-10 pilot who 
joined Continental in 1979, had been vice president of training and 
inflight. She now reports directly to C.D. McLean, executive vice 
president of operations.

	Quaker Restructuring May Cost Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Quaker Oats Co. announced a restructuring  
today that could result in the loss of as much as 10 percent of its 
work force, or 1,200 jobs, over the next three years. The maker of 
oatmeal and Gatorade said the aim is to lower operating costs by 
removing inefficient assets and reconfiguring the company's food 
and beverage warehouse and delivery systems, among other moves. It 
envisions savings from the restructuring of $40 million to $45 
million in 2001, rising to $60 million to $70 million starting in 
2002.

	LONDON (AP) -- Technology and telecommunications shares led gains  
in European markets today as fears of an early rise in interest 
rates by the European Central Bank eased. News that Italy's August 
consumer price index was up just 0.1 percent from July, in line 
with market expectations, helped calm the situation. British retail 
shares bucked today's upward trend on reports of falling sales at 
leading clothing chain Marks &AMP; Spencer. The Dow Jones Stoxx Retail 
index dropped 1 percent on the news. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 
592 European companies closed up 1.52 points, or 0.5 percent, at 
311.77. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index closed with a gain of 
33.27 points at 3,782.02, while the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index closed 
up 38.57 points at 3,698.19. London's Financial Times-Stock 
Exchange 100-share index closed up 0.3 percent and Frankfurt's 
Xetra DAX index rose 0.9 percent.

	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's phone companies have launched an  
aggressive campaign to explain to testy homeowners and annoyed 
business managers just why, come April, their number's up. As 
Britain becomes more upwardly mobile, the country's phone numbering

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Sorry for Anti-Semitism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a powerfully worded letter to Jewish leaders,  
Cardinal John O'Connor has expressed ``abject sorrow'' for 
centuries of anti-Semitism by members of the Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish leaders said the Sept. 8 letter, published as a full-page  
ad Sunday in The New York Times, goes beyond the official church 
line and last year's ``We Remember'' decree from the Vatican, which 
apologized for ``errors and failures'' of some Catholics during the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask this Yom Kippur that you understand my own abject sorrow  
for any member of the Catholic Church, high or low, who may have 
harmed you or your forebears in any way,'' the New York cardinal 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, which initially was sent to the cardinal's Jewish  
friends, does not mention the Holocaust. But O'Connor spokesman 
Joseph Zwilling said the cardinal was referring to Nazi atrocities 
and other anti-Semitic acts of the last 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardinal referred to Pope John Paul II's bid to make next  
Ash Wednesday -- March 8 -- a day for Catholics ``to reflect upon the 
pain inflicted on the Jewish people by many of our members over the 
last millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We most sincerely want to start a new era,'' the cardinal  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Fisher, the U.S. Catholic bishops' staff expert on Jewish  
relations, said the cardinal has taken what has been said before by 
Catholic leaders, but ``put it in a way Jews can understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter ``expresses the mind of the church very clearly and  
without any possible ambiguity,'' Fisher said. ``It's not a new 
statement. He was not intending to break any new ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and Holocaust  
survivor who helped sponsor the ad along with other Jewish leaders, 
said O'Connor's appeal goes beyond past Catholic statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the prince of the church to say the things he does, it's  
very strong,'' he said. ``He went very far and it's a great gesture 
of understanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter comes just prior to the release of John Cornwell's  
book ``Hitler's Pope,'' which has renewed debate over what critics 
regard as Pope Pius XII's failure to specifically and strongly 
denounce the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	A detailed footnote in last year's ``We Remember'' document  
offered explanations for Pius's policy, provoking strong Jewish 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, who recently had brain surgery to remove a tumor, has  
long been active in Jewish-Catholic relations and was no doubt well 
aware of Jewish reaction to the Vatican's Holocaust decree.

<HEADLINE> Saints' Williams May Miss Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Week 2 meant Injury 2 for New Orleans Saints  
rookie running back Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heisman Trophy-winner sprained his right elbow in Sunday's  
loss at San Francisco and coach Mike Ditka isn't sure when Williams 
will be able to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time? I have no idea. I can't even answer. I don't know,''  
Ditka said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints (1-1) are off this week then play at Chicago on Oct.  
3. Practice will resume Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Williams, who sprained his ankle in the season-opening  
win over Carolina, will play against the Bears is not just a matter 
of his ability to play with pain, Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could be a functional problem where he can't function,  
can't hold the ball,'' Ditka said. ``We can't play him if he can't 
do that. If he can't move his hands or catch the ball or if he's 
not agile enough to control the ball you couldn't play him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams only speaks to the media once a week and refused to  
comment after Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	A high left ankle sprain kept Williams on the sidelines most of  
the preseason and a lower sprain of the same ankle knocked him out 
of the season opener in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, after catching an 8-yard pass, Williams was tackled  
by cornerback Darnell Walker on the last play of the game. He tried 
to break the fall with his right arm. Replays of the fall showed 
the arm bending backward at the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hyperextended elbow,'' Ditka said Monday. ``That's a  
sprained elbow. All the medical things show that's what it is. He 
has a lot of pain. But the MRI was negative. He's in an arm 
splint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury caused Williams to need help getting dressed after  
the game. Ditka at first feared Williams had broken the arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in an extraordinary amount of pain for an injury like  
that. that's why I thought the arm was broken,'' Ditka said. ``He's 
really stretched those ligaments, so one thing he will have to do, 
he'll have to wear an elbow brace when he plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New Orleans' 28-21 loss to the 49ers, Williams rushed for 80  
yards on 22 carries, a 3.6 average. He also caught three passes for 
5 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Described as 95 percent recovered from the ankle sprains before  
the San Francisco game, Williams showed glimpses of the style and 
speed that enticed the Saints to give up eight draft picks to get 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's career rushing leader from Texas also showed that he  
was not going to back down from opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got in his face,'' 49ers linebacker Ken Norton Jr. said.  
``We talked smack all day, but he's got style. He's strong and you 
can't rattle him. He's got a quiet confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams signed an incentive-laden contract with the Saints. To  
reach the big money boosters he must rush for over 1,600 yards and 
score 12 touchdowns. After two games he has 120 yards and has not 
scored.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Activists Back Bauer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Conservative activist Gary Bauer will  
pick up the endorsement of four important social conservative 
activists on Tuesday, including a leader in a rival's camp, aides 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer will collect the backing of Scott Coltrain, of Des Moines,  
head of the Polk County Republican Party and formerly vice chairman 
of Alan Keyes' campaign in Iowa, said the aides, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bauer will be endorsed by:  
</P>
<P>
	--Deb Taylor, of Polk City, past president of Iowa Right to Life.  
</P>
<P>
	--Sally Jones, of West Des Moines, past director of the Vitae  
Society of Iowa, a leading anti-abortion group. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mark Boddicker, Benton County GOP chairman and a prominent  
anti-abortion activist in eastern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement prepared for Tuesday's announcement, Bauer said  
the endorsements reflect new momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are gaining momentum every day and this is further proof  
that a presidential campaign is as strong as the great people who 
come on board,'' said Bauer, in the statement. ``I am particularly 
heartened that this group represents a very strong pro-life block 
in Iowa. This will be key to success in Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move underscores the intensity of the battle for social  
conservatives who are important in the politics of Iowa's leadoff 
precinct caucuses. A string of candidates is fighting over those 
voters, including both Keyes and Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes is also making a much better financed bid  
to coalesce those conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Coltrain was the biggest prize Bauer was to collect, not only  
because he previously had been a leader in the Keyes effort, but he 
also heads the party in an important county. 
</P>
<P>
	Polk County, which includes Des Moines, is the biggest county in  
the state, and the GOP machinery in that county is firmly in the 
hands of conservative forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary Bauer is now America's leading conservative and I am  
happy to join his campaign as a member of his state steering 
committee,'' Coltrain said in a statement prepared for Tuesday's 
announcement.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- An F-16 crashed on the runway Monday at Luke Air  
Force Base and smashed through a fence.

<P>
	Maj. Sharon Preszler, an instructor at the training base, was

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rican Activist To Press On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- One of the 11 members Puerto Rican nationalists  
granted clemency by President Clinton says she will continue her 
activism, but in a humane way. 
</P>
<P>
	Alejandrina Torres, freed after serving 16 years of a 35-year  
sentence for seditious conspiracy, spoke about the need for healing 
among Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	Torres, 60, said she will ``continue the process of  
reconciliation we've begun. No matter how difficult the task is, 
we'll achieve it because we've been called to freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torres spoke Sunday at a church where her husband, the Rev. Jose  
A. Torres, once served as pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she will work for Puerto Rico's independence ``in the  
most humane way possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six people were killed and dozens were wounded in a wave of  
bombings of U.S. civilian and military targets from 1974 to 1983. 
The attacks were linked to the Armed Forces of National Liberation, 
or FALN. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16 people offered clemency were associated with mostly FALN  
members, but were neither involved in any killings nor convicted in 
the bombings. They were found guilty of seditious conspiracy or 
possession of weapons and explosives and were sentenced to up to 90 
years. The Clinton administration said the sentences were too 
harsh. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, those receiving clemency were required to  
renounce violence and refrain from associating with convicted 
felons. 
</P>
<P>
	The clemency offer drew criticism from law enforcement officials  
and others, and congressional GOP leaders are demanding that 
Clinton explain his actions.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Has Computer Repair Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is testing consumer  
interest in having their computers repaired or upgraded at the same 
place they shop for linens, toiletries and milk. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailing giant has contracted with Computer Doctor to open  
repair and sales outlets in the front of 10 Wal-Mart Supercenters. 
Wal-Mart says the experimental outlets will open during the next 18 
months. If the experiment works, the company could look to any 
number of computer businesses to offer services within the walls of 
its 622 Supercenters. 
</P>
<P>
	The move could have Wal-Mart drawing customers from a large  
portion of the computer services market, said Gene Alvarez, an 
analyst for Meta Group in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tend to put myself in the consumer's position. If I was  
living in a rural area and Wal-Mart and the Computer Doctor was the 
closest place and I'm a technophobe -- if I know about it -- I would 
go there,'' Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart is known for its general merchandise and, at its  
Supercenters, for adding a full line of groceries to the mix. The 
consumer traffic at the stores is an instant advantage for the 
store-within-a-store concept, Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kind of like if I opened one of these up by a toll booth,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Wal-Mart could build a niche for serving customers who  
might otherwise patronize large electronics retailers and those who 
use catalogs. Smaller, locally-owned shops could also see fewer 
faces, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer Doctor, a small business in Aberdeen, S.D., opened its  
first Supercenter location Sept. 15 in Ankeny, Iowa. Another is 
planned for nearby Des Moines with the remaining eight sites to 
open in the Midwest, said Computer Doctor co-owner Lonnie 
Helgerson. 
</P>
<P>
	Helgerson said the Iowa location is staffed with four workers  
who fix broken computers, install components, provide warranty 
service for computers purchased at Wal-Mart and even make house 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The company started in 1992 and has been offering franchises  
since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart has long had other businesses, such as banks, leasing  
space in the front of its stores. It is also experimenting with 
bath and body and coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, (Computer Doctor) is no different than some of the  
other leased areas in front of our stores,'' Wal-Mart spokeswoman 
Melissa Brown said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer stores will only be in Supercenters and Ms. Brown  
said Wal-Mart does not have an exclusive contract with Computer 
Doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez says the Supercenters could attract customers who know  
they can drop off the computer to have, say, more memory installed 
while on a grocery errand. They can combine another trip to the 
grocery with the computer pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thinking about our customers who purchase computers and  
we hope to help them out with these services that, at one time or 
another, everybody needs,'' Ms. Brown said.

<HEADLINE> Celtics' Potapenko Is Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Celtics center Vitaly Potapenko pleaded  
innocent today to charges of disorderly conduct after being 
arrested arguing with his girlfriend at Logan International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an argument,'' said defense lawyer Harry Manion. He  
explained the player, nicknamed the ``Ukraine Train,'' was late 
picking up his fiancee at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just regret it happened, you know, and I wish it never  
happened,'' Potapenko said after being released on his own 
recognizance following his arraignment in East Boston District 
Court. ``It's going to be a lesson for me in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Port Authority employees called state police to  
break up the altercation in one of the airport's terminals, State 
Police Sgt. Edwin Anderson said. Potapenko and the woman were in a 
parking lot when troopers arrived. Potapenko was arrested when he 
refused to leave, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics did not return calls for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian-born Potapenko, 24, was traded to Boston in March  
from the Cleveland Cavaliers. In 33 games with the Celtics last 
season, he averaged 10.7 points and 7.3 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Hits Western Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- A quake with a preliminary magnitude of  
5 hit western Turkey early Tuesday, Turkey's Kandilli Observatory 
said. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake struck at 12:28 a.m. (5:28 p.m. EDT Monday) and was  
centered in Tekirdag, the semiofficial Anatolia news agency quoted 
officials of the Istanbul-based institute as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor of Tekirdag, Zeki Senal, said there were no reports  
of casualties, injuries or damage in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The temblor was felt in Istanbul, where inhabitants fled to the  
streets in a panic. Tekirdag is 80 miles west of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Kandilli said the quake was not an aftershock of  
the Aug. 17 earthquake that killed over 15,500 people and 
devastated large parts of western Turkey, private television NTV 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of aftershocks have kept Turks fearing another major  
temblor in the region.

<HEADLINE> Residents Abandon Tiny Copper Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLAYAS, N.M. (AP) -- Soon, the cookie-cutter stucco houses will  
be empty. The playgrounds and baseball diamonds silent. The 
six-lane bowling alley closed for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who live in this little company town in southwestern New  
Mexico -- many of them for more than 20 years -- are making plans to 
leave. The Phelps Dodge Corp. copper smelter down the road, the 
only thing that brought them to this spot in the middle of the 
desert, has closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame. It's a beautiful little town,'' said Carren  
Nicklas, who is moving her family to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	A slump in copper prices -- from $1.20 a pound in 1996 to a  
12-year low of 61 cents a pound in May -- has prompted producers to 
lay off thousands of workers and scale back production across the 
Southwest this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Broken Hill Proprietary Co. has laid off 2,600 workers in  
Arizona and Nevada -- 2,200 of them in the company town of San 
Manuel, Ariz., population 4,000. Phelps Dodge has cut 1,650 jobs in 
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, and Asarco Inc. has laid off 150 
miners near Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper is widely used in wiring and plumbing. The price decline  
has been attributed to overproduction, including the opening of 
several new mines in South America, and a slowdown in demand from 
Asia because of the economic turmoil there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any industry that has good times and bad times. In the bad  
times you look at ways to become more efficient and more 
economical, and unfortunately, one way to do that is to start to 
cut back production,'' said Chuck Shipley, president of the Arizona 
Mining Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is also using mergers to cut costs. In July, Asarco  
and Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. agreed to merge and form the nation's 
largest copper company. Then Phelps Dodge made a $2.7 billion bid 
for both companies but was rebuffed by their boards of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	In Playas, the smelter shut down during the first week of  
September, and 450 employees were laid off Sept. 10. About 50 
employees will remain on the job at the smelter to handle 
maintenance and shutdown work. 
</P>
<P>
	The laid-off workers can stay in their company-owned houses  
until June, as long as they pay the $50-a-month rent. Then the 
town, like the smelter it was built to support, will be mothballed 
in case Phelps Dodge decides to resume operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Laid-off workers like copper analyst Clay Hancock have little  
hope of returning to the copper business or finding jobs that would 
match the $17 an hour Hancock made in Playas. Hancock followed his 
father, an electrician, in moving to Playas 22 years ago to work 
for Phelps Dodge. Hancock's father retired here, and he had 
expected to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 46 years old and I've been with Phelps Dodge all my  
life,'' said Hancock, a widower raising a 14-year-old daughter. ``I 
mean, what am I going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like dozens of his neighbors, Hancock has signed up for  
state-financed job training. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge picked the remote spot for its smelter back in the  
1970s because it was close to railroad tracks that run from its 
copper mines in Arizona to its refinery in El Paso, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A town plaza was planted with grass and weeping willows. A  
couple of churches, a small grocery store, a bank, a post office, 
the Copper Pins bowling alley and a clinic eventually were built, 
and Playas became home to 750 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the businesses are preparing to scale back and close by the  
end of the year, reducing Playas to a collection of mostly 
abandoned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are some who see this time as more a new beginning  
than an end. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nicklas' 49-year-old husband, Bill, a locomotive mechanic  
at the smelter for all of its 23 years, is among 135 of the 
laid-off workers who have been offered jobs at other Phelps Dodge 
facilities. The couple and their two children are moving to 
Morenci, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sexton, 44, who worked at the smelter for 21 years, plans  
to use the job training to learn how to install computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a good peace about it,'' Sexton said. ``It's an  
opportunity for me to advance myself.''

<HEADLINE> Viacom Chief's Wife Wants Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The wife of Sumner Redstone, chairman  
and chief executive officer of Viacom, is seeking a divorce -- and 
$3 billion -- reportedly claiming adultery. 
</P>
<P>
	Phyllis Redstone, 74, filed for divorce Tuesday in Middlesex  
Probate Court after 52 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumner Redstone, 76, who lives in Newton but spends most of his  
time in New York, is listed as the world's 32nd richest man by 
Forbes magazine, with a fortune estimated at $8.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers were sealed at the request of Redstone's attorney.  
But Mrs. Redstone's attorney, Irving Helman, said there was no gag 
order, and he told newspapers that the suit alleges adultery and 
cruelty. Helman did not identify the other women, but he told the 
New York Post that Redstone ``had been seen with the woman on 
several occasions in California and in Paris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redstone's attorney, George Abrams, declined to respond.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the interest of his family, Mr. Redstone chooses not to  
reply publicly to any allegations, no matter how false or 
misleading they may be,'' Abrams said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a personal matter which Mr. Redstone intends to  
resolve in a private way,'' he said. He said Redstone and his two 
children ``are united on all matters affecting the family's 
business interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom is now in a $37 billion deal to acquire CBS Inc. In a  
statement, the company said the divorce would not affect the 
proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Redstone will remain as chairman and chief executive of Viacom  
after the merger takes place. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time Mrs. Redstone has filed for divorce. She  
did so in the 1980s and again in November 1993, when Viacom was in 
a takeover battle for control of Paramount Pictures. She withdrew 
that lawsuit three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's really mad this time,'' Helman told the Boston Herald.  
``And she's not going to change her mind.''

<HEADLINE> Atlanta RB Anderson Injures Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Atlanta running back Jamal Anderson  
sprained his right knee in the first quarter and the Falcons said 
he would not return to Monday night's game against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmitt Smith ran 2 yards for a touchdown as the Cowboys took a  
10-0 lead after one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	While making a cut in the Falcons' backfield less than seven  
minutes into the game, Anderson's right knee buckled without 
contact. Anderson, who lost 2 yards on the play, had 9 yards on 
three carries. He walked off of the field under his own power but 
the team said he would not return. 
</P>
<P>
	The first score of the game was set up by a long interception  
return by Dallas linebacker Dexter Coakley, who picked off a pass 
by Tony Graziani at the Dallas 47 and returned it to the Atlanta 
10. Richie Cunningham kicked a 23-yard field goal four plays later. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Cowboys' last possession of the first quarter, a 38-yard  
pass from Troy Aikman to Raghib Ismail set up Smith's touchdown 
run. On the play, Ismail re-injured a sprained left shoulder that 
caused him to miss three preseason games. His status was not 
immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons had a chance to score midway through the quarter,  
but Morten Andersen shanked a 49-yard field goal attempt, which was 
his third miss in two games. Andersen did not miss a field goal 
attempt in last year's regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler nor Cowboys  
cornerback Deion Sanders, who were both listed as doubtful for the 
game, were in the starting lineups. 
</P>
<P>
	Graziani made his third career start in place of Chandler, who  
pulled his hamstring in the Falcons' season-opening loss to 
Minnesota last week. Chandler warmed up in full pads before the 
game but was officially announced as the Falcons' third 
quarterback, meaning he can't play unless injuries make it 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, meanwhile, decided to give his injured left toe an  
extra two weeks to heal. With Dallas going into a bye week, the 
All-Pro cornerback and punt returner can continue recovering until 
Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be playing if this was a playoff game,'' Cowboys  
owner Jerry Jones said. ``The smart thing to do was wait two 
weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders injured the toe late last season and missed five games  
and parts of two others. He played in a playoff loss and in the Pro 
Bowl, then underwent surgery in April. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, Sanders has missed all of training camp, the  
exhibition season and the season opener, a 41-35 victory over 
Washington. Charlie Williams replaced Sanders at right cornerback 
for the second straight week.

<HEADLINE> UAW Supports DaimlerChrysler Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers executive council members  
were unanimous in their support of a proposed four-year labor 
contract with DaimlerChrysler, UAW President Steve Yokich said at a 
news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The council members, made up of local union presidents and  
chairmen, will return home to provide contract details to the 
75,000 rank-and-file members, who will vote on the contract 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good contract,'' Yokich said. ``A lot of old  
problems got cleared up in this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those problems that were cleared up were job security and  
improved pension benefits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said the contract is a reward for helping the automakers  
through the tough times. ``It's our turn now that things are 
good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average DaimlerChrysler worker would receive an average of  
$29,300 in wage increases and bonuses over the next four years 
under the proposed contract, The Flint Journal reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to DaimlerChrysler, its average assembly worker is 43  
years old and earns about $70,000 a year, because of overtime and 
profit sharing. The same worker gets 37 paid vacation days a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed contract, the company's basic monthly pension  
would increase from $40 to $47.45 per year of service during the 
life of the contract. That means workers with 30 years of service, 
who are eligible for Social Security payments, would see their 
monthly pensions increase from $1,200 to $1,423.50 during the next 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	For someone who retires under the 30-and-out program and is not  
yet eligible for Social Security, monthly benefits would rise from 
$2,295 to $2,730 by the end of the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed contract also calls for an increase in basic  
pension benefits by nearly 20 percent for workers who retired 
before October 1984, union sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials said last week the deal also includes an  
agreement not to spin off any parts of the company into independent 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a clause might be aimed more at GM and Ford than  
DaimlerChrysler. GM has spun off its Delphi parts unit, and Ford 
would like to spin off its Visteon parts unit, a move the UAW 
opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, Yokich said he does not expect difficulty in  
getting similar contracts at GM and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's going to be difficult. The pattern is  
there,'' he said. I don't think anybody is going to say we don't 
want to take the pattern. I think it will work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said he will be at GM on Tuesday for talks there. He said  
he does not expect an agreement until after UAW members vote 
Saturday on the DaimlerChrysler contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ford of Canada faces a strike deadline Tuesday at  
11:59 p.m. by the Canadian Auto Workers union. Talks between Ford 
and CAW bargainers were continuing, Ford spokesman Jim Hartford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been steady progress, but there's still a lot left on  
the table,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	George Peterson, president of Los Angeles-based AutoPacific  
Inc., said a strike in Canada could cause shutdowns at Ford plants 
in the United States that build the profitable F-Series pickup 
trucks because the V-8 engines used in many are made in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The V-8 also is used in Ford Expeditions and Lincoln Navigators.  
Ford Windstar minivans and Ford Crown Victorias and Mercury Grand 
Marquis sedans also are made in Canada.

<HEADLINE>  Puerto Rico Welcomes Home Trinidad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- They chanted his name while salsa  
songs written in his honor blared from giant speakers. Revelers 
jammed highways, hoping to get a glimpse of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Felix Trinidad, a conquering hero come home, was back in Puerto  
Rico on Monday, welcomed by thousands amid a frenzy of adulation 
and national pride. 
</P>
<P>
	At an airport news conference, Trinidad joked about his victory  
over Oscar De La Hoya on Saturday night in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a different style of boxing,'' Trinidad said. ``He ran  
a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's plane landed in San Juan amid roars of ``Tito!  
Tito!'' Fans waved the U.S. territory's lone-star flag and placards 
declaring ``Gallito castao!'' -- Spanish for ``Top-class fighting 
cock!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Pedro Rossello, who praised Trinidad for ``glorifying the  
name of Puerto Rico,'' was among the dignitaries on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I promised you this victory and I did it,'' Trinidad said.  
``This triumph is for all of Puerto Rico. There is no doubt now 
that the best boxers are in Puerto Rico -- pound for pound they have 
the most heart. I feel super content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police tried to close one lane to make way for a victory  
cavalcade, but delirious motorists ignored the officers and zipped 
by. Others abandoned their cars in an airport logjam and walked the 
last mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tito No. 1,'' was the message scrawled in lipstick across the  
bare midriffs of a group of teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
	This had been the most anticipated welterweight bout in years,  
pitting two unbeaten 26-year-olds known for knockout power -- De La 
Hoya with his left hand, Trinidad with his right. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, the ``golden boy'' from California, seemed assured  
victory after connecting with his jab early on. But in the last few 
rounds, he turned complacent and Trinidad's tenacity paid off as he 
scored with his punishing right. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya was befuddled by the majority decision. He was sure  
he had won. Trindiad dismissed such opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person who deserved this win was Tito Trinidad and the  
judges agreed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Felix Trinidad Sr., the boxer's father, trainer and manager,  
said any rematch would have to be on his son's terms. The Puerto 
Ricans were unhappy Trinidad received only $10.5 million. While 
that sum was many millions more than any previous payday for him, 
it was half of De La Hoya's take. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer's father suggested a rematch for Puerto Rico or New  
York, where there is a large Puerto Rican population. He would not 
say how much his son would demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tito has a huge value in boxing and that has no price,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternative would be a fight with Jim Page, the WBC champion  
in his 147-pound category, or a move up to the 154-pound category. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad used the occasion to bring attention to Vieques, an  
outlying island that Puerto Ricans want the U.S. Navy to stop using 
as a live bombing range. The bombing was suspended after an April 
accident killed a civilian Puerto Rican guard there. The U.S. 
Congress is to hold hearings on the issue this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peace for Vieques!'' Trinidad declared. The night of the  
fight, he entered the ring in front of a map of the island 
demanding: ``Navy get out of Vieques!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy, like Trinidad's victory, has brought a  
nationalistic outpouring on the island, where patriotic feelings 
are deep despite meager support for the independence movement. The 
4 million islanders are U.S. citizens who serve in the military and 
receive federal funds though they do not pay federal taxes and 
cannot vote for president or the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport, Mabel Roubert waited with two sons, Marcus, 14,  
and Braulio, 8, whom she had taken out of school. 
</P>
<P>
	``School is important,'' she said. ``But they have to learn that  
when something like this is going on, when the people of Puerto 
Rico are behind something, you have to go out and participate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angry tourists tried to catch flights by walking up to two miles  
from hotels to the airport. Guillermo Flores Molina of Mexico spent 
90 minutes walking to the airport in the scorching sun with his 
daughter, wife and luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a disaster,'' he said. ``Who's going to pay for this  
flight that I'm going to miss?''

<HEADLINE> Last Church Shooting Victims Buried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The last of seven funerals held for the  
victims in a Texas church shooting were conducted Monday, with 
mourners lamenting the loss of three innocent children. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wedgwood Baptist Church, a standing-room crowd packed the  
bullet-scarred sanctuary to remember Cassandra Griffin, 14, who was 
among those killed by an apparently deranged gunman Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Gene Ashbrook killed seven people attending a youth  
service, then turned the gun on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a special girl she was,'' Carolyn Jackson, a family  
friend, said after the service. ``She was quiet, but she was 
powerful in her own right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners have heaped flowers, stuffed animals, balloons and  
notes around the church's lawn. Some people leaving the funeral 
signed a large poster that also rests there. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the church, someone had parked a pickup truck and covered  
its windows with white-painted slogans: ``Rule heaven, Cassie'' and 
``Cassie always in our hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people also gathered at the First Baptist Church in  
nearby White Settlement on Monday to remember Joseph Ennis, 14, an 
only child who dreamed of joining the NBA. Friends said he was a 
curious, searching teen-ager who only recently joined the Baptist 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	And at a service at Bethesda Community Church in suburban Haltom  
City, Wedgwood Baptist's pastor, the Rev. Al Meredith, remembered 
14-year-old Kristi Beckel as a girl who loved ``I Love Lucy'' 
reruns, volleyball and singing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're crying, not for Kristi. She is with the Lord. She can  
spike every ball that comes over the net now. She can sing bass if 
she wants to, and first soprano. Her joy is unspeakable,'' Meredith 
told the mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wedgwood, where the congregation returned for worship for the  
first time on Sunday, folding chairs replaced blood-soaked pews 
removed for repair. Bare cement floors lay exposed where 
bloodstained carpet had been removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers from several churches were attending a Christian  
music concert when Ashbrook, 47, walked in and began shooting. He 
killed three adult youth workers and four teen-agers before taking 
his own life. Seven people were injured; three remained 
hospitalized on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Funerals were held Saturday for the other victims.

<HEADLINE> Anderson Hoping To Dance in Dallas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Jamal Anderson is itching to dance.  
</P>
<P>
	The co-creator of the ``Dirty Bird'' touchdown celebration has  
gone nine months without reaching the dance floor. He's hoping to 
finally hit the end zone Monday night when his Atlanta Falcons play 
the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson isn't saying whether he'll revive the wing-flapping  
dance used during Atlanta's ride to the Super Bowl or if he has 
something new planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, can I get into the zone first?'' he said, laughing.  
``When I get into the end zone I may do like Deion Sanders and drop 
down and pray that I'm finally back in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson ran for 14 regular-season touchdowns and had two more  
through the air last year. He scored twice more in the playoffs, 
including a 5-yard run in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	But Anderson was shut out in the Super Bowl and again in the  
opener last Sunday against Minnesota. The Vikings held him to 50 
yards on 16 carries in the Falcons' 17-13 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys may be the perfect opponent for Anderson to get out  
his dance shoes against. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas allowed Washington's unheralded Stephen Davis to gain a  
career-high 109 yards and two touchdowns on 24 carries last week. 
It wasn't enough, though, as the Cowboys rallied for a 41-35 
overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say that just because Stephen did good against them I  
think I will,'' Anderson said. ``No disrespect to Stephen Davis as 
a running back, but they're going to be ready to play me. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know I'm coming to town and they're going to be fired up  
for the possibility of shutting me down. That's something that 
happens now on a weekly basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How much Dallas focuses on Anderson may depend on who is handing  
him the ball. Quarterback Chris Chandler is doubtful with an aching 
right hamstring; backup Tony Graziani has been lifted at halftime 
in each of his two career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	While coaches usually say they're ready for whoever plays,  
Dallas' Chan Gailey admitted things will be different if Chandler 
is out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they'll change their overall package, but I  
think they'll rely a little bit more heavily on their running 
game,'' Gailey said. ``I'm sure they'll have Jamal try to attack us 
and wear us down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis wore down the Cowboys by simply running at them. Dallas  
defenders made technique mistakes that got them out of position, 
then had fundamental breakdowns such as failing to finish tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to make sure we're playing good technique, be where  
we're supposed to be and not miss tackles,'' Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Sanders plays also will be a game-time decision. The  
former Falcons player is recovering from surgery on his left big 
toe in April and hasn't played since the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he wants to play cornerback and return punts when he  
comes back. With a bye week looming, it may make sense for him to 
skip another week to be stronger for the next game on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm closer, but still far,'' Sanders said Friday while feeling  
the soreness caused by a stiff workout Thursday. ``It doesn't look 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should the Falcons drop to 0-2, they'll be living down to the  
expectations of people who said their Super Bowl run last year was 
a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
	``After last week, I can see why we haven't gotten any more  
respect,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``We've got to do the things we 
did last year for us to get back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys are trying to regain the aura they had during their  
run of three championships in four seasons. That streak ended three 
seasons ago, and Dallas has won just one playoff game since. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do teams respect us the way they used to respect us? I don't  
know that,'' receiver Michael Irvin said. ``If we win the Super 
Bowl, people should respect us again. Until then, they shouldn't, 
and I really can't blame them if they don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Emmitt Smith said the attitude towards Dallas now  
is similar to when the team started its championship run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we've been successful for such a long time that  
we can't see ourselves being the underdog,'' Smith said. ``It 
doesn't matter. You play both sides of the spectrum. Right now, 
we're just on the bottom side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the underdog is being on the bottom, but there's a lot  
of fight in a dog that's going to bark a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Evidence Said Ignored by Drug Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Despite growing evidence that a link existed  
between the diet drugs fen-phen and fatal lung disease and heart 
damage, a maker of one of the drugs lobbied the government to relax 
limits on its use, The Dallas Morning News reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Internal company memos in 1996 indicated that American Home  
Products knew of illnesses and deaths from the rare lung disease 
among users of Pondimin, which was part of the fen-phen diet-drug 
combination, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 the company received researchers' reports of leaky heart  
valves among fen-phen users, according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the newspaper reported, the Madison,  
N.J.-based company and its pharmaceutical division, Wyeth-Ayerst 
Laboratories, lobbied members of Congress and the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration to ease restrictions on use of Pondimin 
and Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	Strategies discussed in the memos included a self-described  
``SWAT team'' to prepare testimony supporting fewer regulations and 
making an appeal to an influential lawmaker that would remain 
``below the radar screen'' of public opinion, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobbying campaign did not work, and the Food and Drug  
Administration pressured American Home Products, the nation's fifth 
largest drug manufacturer, to pull Pondimin and Redux from the 
market in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the memos proved the company, which made  
fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen combination, put profits 
over safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has recently been hit by multi-million-dollar  
jury awards in recent lawsuits, is trying to negotiate a mammoth 
settlement of thousands of fen-phen claims for an amount reported 
to exceed $3 billion.

<HEADLINE> Enqvist Pulls Out With Sore Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) -- Complaining of a sore back,  
top-seeded Thomas Enqvist withdrew from his rain-delayed semifinal 
match against Austria's Stefan Koubek Monday in the Samsung Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Their semifinal was rained out Sunday with the match tied at 5-5  
in the third set. After losing the first set 6-3, Enqvist won the 
second, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Koubek advanced to face Romanian Adrian Voinea in the final  
played later on Monday. Voinea defeated Morocco's Younes El Aynaoui 
6-3, 6-4 in a semifinal completed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My back is very sore and I'm going back to Stockholm to have  
an X-ray and try to find out what it is,'' Enqvist said Monday 
before departing. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament was scheduled to be completed Sunday, but play  
was postponed by rain on Saturday and Sunday's matches were delayed 
and then stopped by rain.

<HEADLINE>  Puerto Rico Welcomes Home Trinidad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- They chanted his name while salsa  
songs written in his honor blared from giant speakers. Revelers 
jammed highways, hoping to get a glimpse of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Felix Trinidad, a conquering hero come home, was back in Puerto  
Rico on Monday, welcomed by thousands amid a frenzy of adulation 
and national pride. 
</P>
<P>
	At an airport news conference, Trinidad joked about his victory  
over Oscar De La Hoya on Saturday night in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a different style of boxing,'' Trinidad said. ``He ran  
a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's plane landed in San Juan amid roars of ``Tito!  
Tito!'' Fans waved the U.S. territory's lone-star flag and placards 
declaring ``Gallito castao!'' -- Spanish for ``Top-class fighting 
cock!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Pedro Rossello, who praised Trinidad for ``glorifying the  
name of Puerto Rico,'' was among the dignitaries on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I promised you this victory and I did it,'' Trinidad said.  
``This triumph is for all of Puerto Rico. There is no doubt now 
that the best boxers are in Puerto Rico -- pound for pound they have 
the most heart. I feel super content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police tried to close one lane to make way for a victory  
cavalcade, but delirious motorists ignored the officers and zipped 
by. Others abandoned their cars in an airport logjam and walked the 
last mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tito No. 1,'' was the message scrawled in lipstick across the  
bare midriffs of a group of teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
	This had been the most anticipated welterweight bout in years,  
pitting two unbeaten 26-year-olds known for knockout power -- De La 
Hoya with his left hand, Trinidad with his right. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, the ``golden boy'' from California, seemed assured  
victory after connecting with his jab early on. But in the last few 
rounds, he turned complacent and Trinidad's tenacity paid off as he 
scored with his punishing right. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya was befuddled by the majority decision. He was sure  
he had won. Trindiad dismissed such opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person who deserved this win was Tito Trinidad and the  
judges agreed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Felix Trinidad Sr., the boxer's father, trainer and manager,  
said any rematch would have to be on his son's terms. The Puerto 
Ricans were unhappy Trinidad received only $10.5 million. While 
that sum was many millions more than any previous payday for him, 
it was half of De La Hoya's take. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer's father suggested a rematch for Puerto Rico or New  
York, where there is a large Puerto Rican population. He would not 
say how much his son would demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tito has a huge value in boxing and that has no price,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternative would be a fight with Jim Page, the WBC champion  
in his 147-pound category, or a move up to the 154-pound category. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad used the occasion to bring attention to Vieques, an  
outlying island that Puerto Ricans want the U.S. Navy to stop using 
as a live bombing range. The bombing was suspended after an April 
accident killed a civilian Puerto Rican guard there. The U.S. 
Congress is to hold hearings on the issue this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peace for Vieques!'' Trinidad declared. The night of the  
fight, he entered the ring in front of a map of the island 
demanding: ``Navy get out of Vieques!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy, like Trinidad's victory, has brought a  
nationalistic outpouring on the island, where patriotic feelings 
are deep despite meager support for the independence movement. The 
4 million islanders are U.S. citizens who serve in the military and 
receive federal funds though they do not pay federal taxes and 
cannot vote for president or the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport, Mabel Roubert waited with two sons, Marcus, 14,  
and Braulio, 8, whom she had taken out of school. 
</P>
<P>
	``School is important,'' she said. ``But they have to learn that  
when something like this is going on, when the people of Puerto 
Rico are behind something, you have to go out and participate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angry tourists tried to catch flights by walking up to two miles  
from hotels to the airport. Guillermo Flores Molina of Mexico spent 
90 minutes walking to the airport in the scorching sun with his 
daughter, wife and luggage. 
</P>

flight that I'm going to miss?''

<HEADLINE> Accuracy for Gene Tests Unregulated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A gene test concluded Nancy Seeger was at  
greatly increased risk of getting breast and ovarian cancer, so the 
Illinois woman, who had watched cancer kill her mother and aunt, 
had her ovaries removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight months later, Seeger got more devastating news: The  
company that tested her genes had made a mistake -- she didn't have 
the cancerous genetic defect after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene tests that promise to predict a person's future health are  
being sold to Americans, for hundreds of dollars apiece, with a 
seldom-mentioned caveat: No one regulates the accuracy of most of 
those tests, even though mistakes can be life-altering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration, which oversees most medical  
tests, says it lacks the money to regulate gene tests such as the 
one Seeger took. Nor does a federal law that oversees the quality 
and expertise of medical laboratories address genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say that while most laboratories do a good job -- and  
genetic tests are powerful tools that can help many people -- 
Seeger's experience illustrates risks that the public and doctors 
must understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor is she alone: Johns Hopkins University had to stop a study  
of inherited colon cancer last year after discovering a gene test 
bought from a commercial laboratory missed cancer-causing mutations 
in too many patients. 
</P>
<P>
	How can patients or primary-care physicians choose the best gene  
test if genetics professionals can't? ``It's been a mess, 
frankly,'' responded one of the researchers, Hopkins psychologist 
Ann-Marie Codori. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala has  
appointed a panel of leading geneticists to determine, by Dec. 1, 
how to ensure quality gene testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans ``just assume we've got these great scientific  
institutions, and the FDA's there, and whatever's being offered is 
protected one way or another,'' she told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	She charged the panel to make sure ``the science doesn't get  
ahead of the ability of the appropriate scientific institutions'' 
to oversee it. 
</P>
<P>
	Accuracy isn't the only question. The panel also is grappling  
with how and when to use gene tests. 
</P>
<P>
	An adoption agency, for example, recently asked Hopkins to test  
a fetus for the gene that causes Huntington's disease, because the 
mother planning to give up the baby for adoption had relatives who 
died of the neurological disease, Codori said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university refused, calling it unethical to hurt a baby's  
adoption chances because of a disease that wouldn't even appear 
until middle age, by which time a cure might be found. 
</P>
<P>
	And a company quit marketing tests to predict who was at risk of  
Alzheimer's disease only after a study found people with that gene 
actually had less than a 20 percent chance of getting sick, Dr. 
Neal Holtzman, who headed a National Institutes of Health genetics 
task force, told Shalala's advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor do many doctors, never trained in genetics, understand test  
results: A New England Journal of Medicine study found doctors 
misinterpreted results for almost one-third of patients tested for 
a certain colon cancer gene. Fortunately for the patients, the 
gene-testing lab intervened and provided the right information. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists already have developed about 600 genetic tests. The  
majority are for very rare diseases in families plagued by certain 
illnesses. But more routine testing of now-healthy people to 
predict their future risks of cancer or other killers is poised to 
explode, says Dr. Francis Collins, the NIH's gene director. 
</P>
<P>
	``The risks of something going wrong, or of marketing a test  
before you've proven its utility, are significant,'' said Collins, 
one of Shalala's genetics advisers. ``This is a brand new field, 
about to mushroom into a significant part of medicine. We ought to 
make sure it goes right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question is how to lower those risks without stifling a  
rapidly moving field. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA does regulate special ``gene test kits'' sold to doctors  
by a handful of companies. For example, some women with aggressive 
breast cancer are prescribed Herceptin only if an FDA-approved test 
kit shows the Her-2 gene the drug targets is fueling their tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FDA isn't regulating the vast majority of genetic tests,  
those performed by laboratories or companies shipped a patient's 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts feel the FDA's lengthy approval process could  
inappropriately slow genetics and note alternatives exist, such as 
setting professional standards for gene testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my concerns ... is that we not overreact,'' said Dr.  
Edward McCabe of the University of California, Los Angeles, 
chairman of Shalala's committee. ``There clearly is value in these 
tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And no medical test is guaranteed never to be wrong. Yet gene  
tests are regarded with ``mysticism,'' complains fellow committee 
member Elliott Hillback of Genzyme Corp., a leading genetics firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, I believe, have convinced the American public ... that  
somehow these tests are specific, they tell the future, they are 
black-and-white and not gray,'' Hillback said.

<HEADLINE> Vinny, Doug, 2 Lives That Converge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- When Doug Flutie threw the ``Hail  
Mary'' that made him a household name, Vinny Testaverde was in his 
redshirt season at Miami, watching the desperation pass allow 
Boston College to beat his Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie won the Heisman Trophy for that and other heroics in  
1984, two seasons before Testaverde won his own Heisman for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Ah, how things have come full circle for two quarterbacks who  
finally got their due last year after living on the edge of pro 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie reprised his heroics Sunday night as the Bills beat the  
Jets 17-3, the guy the NFL thought was too little to play with the 
big guys doing all the little things his larger brethren don't do. 
He even threw a block that leveled Mo Lewis, a 257-pound Pro Bowl 
linebacker to spring Antowain Smith on a 12-yard run to the 
1-yard-line and set up the game's first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde?  
</P>
<P>
	The man who led the Jets to the AFC title game last year was  
watching again, out for the season with a torn Achilles' tendon 
that has all but killed the high hopes of a Super Bowl title the 
Jets held entering the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde and Flutie are more similar than they are different.  
</P>
<P>
	The differences are superficial. Testaverde is 6-foot-5, 235  
pounds, the prototypical NFL quarterback who in his early years 
possessed marvelous mobility for a man his size. Flutie is 5-9, 
179, and still possesses marvelous mobility. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarities?  
</P>
<P>
	Both were huge college heroes and both were pro disappointments  
until last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde had the misfortune of being taken by Tampa Bay with  
the first pick in the 1987 draft. That turned out to be the fifth 
of 13 straight seasons in which the Bucs lost 10 games or more. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, he threw 13 touchdowns and set an NFL record with 35  
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he became the subject of an inside football joke when he  
suggested that the Bucs change their orange jerseys to a darker 
hue, blaming his color blindness for not being able to distinguish 
orange from visiting white. Thus, he suggested, the interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally went to Cleveland, moved with the Browns to Baltimore  
but remained an enigma, a quarterback with huge talent but 
questionable judgment who could be counted on to make the big 
mistake at the worst time. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year with the Jets, that changed. He threw for 29 TDs with  
just seven interceptions as the Jets fell a game short of the Super 
Bowl. He played well this preseason and seemed set to take the team 
that extra step when he went down on the artificial turf of Giants 
Stadium without being hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, meanwhile, went from the USFL's New Jersey Generals to  
the Chicago Bears to the New England Patriots, with modest success. 
He finally went to Canada where he got his championships -- Grey 
Cups, MVPs, what have you. 
</P>
<P>
	The only problem is that no one in the United States cared ...

</P>
<P>
	So last year, he came back to Buffalo for the minimum salary  
(with bonuses), then discovered the Bills had traded for Rob 
Johnson and signed him to a $25 million, five-year contract. So 
Johnson started and Flutie sat while Glenn Foley opened the season 
for the Jets and Testaverde sat. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson got hurt and Flutie played. The Bills, who started 0-3,  
made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's up to Flutie to uphold the common history.  
</P>
<P>
	After a slow start Sunday, he did nicely, rushing for 67 yards,  
an NFL career high, and passing for 160 more. One of his runs was a 
24-yard dash for a touchdown and he looked every bit as fast at 36 
as he did at 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was that block on a linebacker 80 pounds heavier.  
</P>
<P>
	``Doug did all the things necessary to win tonight,'' Smith  
said. ``That's what he brings to the team. He's the smallest guy on 
the team and he has one of the biggest hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny's a big guy with a big heart.  
</P>
<P>
	Too bad they both weren't on the field.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 12, Diamondbacks 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Derrick Gibson hit the first two homers of his  
major league career, doubled and drove in six runs Monday night to 
lead the Colorado Rockies over the Arizona Diamondbacks 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's magic number for clinching the NL West remained at  
six. San Francisco, 7 1/2 games behind the Diamondbacks, played later 
at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson played in place of Larry Walker, who leads the majors in  
batting at .380. Walker was out of the starting lineup for the 
fifth time in 10 games because of a sore left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson had been 2-for-12 -- both singles -- with no RBIs this  
season for Colorado. But he broke loose at Coors Field as the 
Rockies won on the day they hired Dan O'Dowd as their new general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Shumpert had three hits and scored three runs and Neifi  
Perez homered and drove in three for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamey Wright (4-2) gave up five runs in seven innings, and still  
improved to 4-1 since being recalled from Triple-A Colorado 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Daal (15-9), who had won his last two starts, lasted 4 2-3  
innings and gave up nine hits and eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Shumpert doubled with one out in the first and Gibson followed  
with a home run to straightaway center field. 
</P>
<P>
	Daal's RBI grounder tied it at 2 in the second, and Arizona went  
ahead in the third on Erubiel Durazo's single. 
</P>
<P>
	Shumpert hit an RBI triple and Gibson doubled as Colorado took  
the lead for good in the bottom half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies broke it open with a five-run fourth, capped by  
Gibson's three-run homer to center off Armando Reynoso. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Bell, who had three hits, hit his 37th home run in the  
Arizona seventh, making it 9-5. Perez hit a two-run homer in the 
Colorado eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Teams have scored in double digits 44 times in the 76 games  
played this year at Coors Field. ... Arizona catcher Kelly Stinnett 
returned after missing two games with a sprained left hand.

<HEADLINE> Commerce To Have Web Sales Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a reflection of the growing popularity of  
the Internet, the Commerce Department said Monday it will begin 
asking the nation's retailers to report how much of their business 
is done online. 
</P>
<P>
	The information will be gathered as part of the regular monthly  
survey the government conducts to compile its report on retail 
sales, a key indicator of how the economy is performing. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, companies' online sales are lumped into total retail  
sales figures reported to the Commerce Department for the monthly 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department wants to break out the online sales  
figure, but the process of coming up with reliable information 
could be tricky, and it's not clear if or when the government will 
report the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley said in a speech made available  
to reporters Monday that the government will ask retailers how much 
of their sales were online. That question will be asked in surveys 
for October, November and December, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure the numbers are reliable, and we are  
getting a proper cross section before we release the results,'' 
Daley said in the speech delivered Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we think e-tailing is so important that we have to develop  
our ability to measure it and report it in government statistics as 
soon as possible,'' Daley added. 
</P>
<P>
	If the government develops a reliable measure, information about  
online retail sales could be broken out for the first time in 
monthly reports released early next year, said Commerce Department 
economist Lee Price.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Wait for Bush To Emerge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, the man in charge  
of protecting the Republican majority in the House, summed up the 
legislative strategy in a few sentences in a recent speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll join the issues'' with the Democrats, he said,  
emphasizing a Republican tax cut bill and a measure to protect the 
Social Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, ``It all crystalizes next year when we get a  
presidential candidate. Then everything focuses on him.'' Davis 
added, ``We try not to do any damage until then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Davis' comments suggest, the one-time revolutionaries in  
Congress are largely playing political defense this autumn, hoping 
to avoid antagonizing the country long enough for presidential 
front-runner George W. Bush to take command of the GOP team next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the measures bubbling to the surface in the final weeks  
of this year's session read like points on the Democratic agenda: 
legislation granting patients the right to sue their managed care 
insurance companies; fresh gun control provisions; an increase in 
the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We even passed a campaign finance bill,'' House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert noted wryly last week. He and the other members of the GOP 
leadership voted against the bill, but it was sent to the Senate 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	The main GOP accomplishment of the year is a $792 billion tax  
cut that's likely to be vetoed on Wednesday by President Clinton. 
No override attempt is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is a slender prospect of a compromise effort with  
the White House before year's end, possibly involving a 
prescription drug benefit for Medicare, the immediate Republican 
focus now has turned to spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	But after pledging for months to obey the spending discipline  
imposed by the 1997 balanced budget agreement, Republicans admit 
they will break the limits that they put into place. 
</P>
<P>
	They've retreated to a new bottom line: They won't dip into the  
Social Security surplus to pay for routine government costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had emergencies we've had to deal with. In fact, the  
caps are exceeded,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told 
reporters recently as he and Hastert met for hours with key 
lawmakers, hoping to speed spending bills to Clinton's desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is be honest, get our work done,  
don't raid Social Security and don't raise taxes,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of those spending bills are likely to be vetoed, and  
Republicans expect they will have to yield to Clinton's demands for 
more money in education and other areas before Congress adjourns 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Their hope is to place Clinton into a political quandary by  
demanding that he outline ways to fund his priorities without 
spending the Social Security surplus or raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	And at a private leadership meeting on Friday, Lott emphasized  
his determination to avoid a summit meeting with the White House in 
which all unresolved issues are rolled into one complex 
negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, according to congressional sources who spoke only on  
condition of anonymity, he and Hastert agreed that each spending 
bill will be dealt with separately, with Republicans and Democrats 
from the House and the Senate doing the negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long run, this grind-it-out strategy may produce a solid  
foundation for success in next year's elections. Bush holds a 
commanding lead in the race for the GOP presidential nomination, 
and is ahead of both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill 
Bradley in the polls. The GOP assumption is that if they win the 
White House, they will hold the House and the Senate, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the meantime, Hastert and Lott will spend plenty of time  
over the next few weeks doing damage control: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hastert announced Friday that the House would debate health  
care legislation early in October. A bipartisan bill backed by the 
White House and opposed by the GOP leaders appears ready to pass. 
Republicans are expected to soften the provision relating to 
lawsuits against health carriers and seek other changes to cushion 
the blow for their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	They may attempt to add provisions expanding access to medical  
savings accounts and increasing the tax deductibility of health 
insurance provisions for the self-employed, according to GOP aides 
familiar with the deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Similarly, Republicans in both houses are preparing for  
possible debate on the minimum wage by crafting a package of 
add-ons that can satisfy business groups who traditionally oppose 
such legislation. Among the options is one extending tax breaks to 
firms that hire hard-to-employ workers. Another would increase the 
tax deductibility of business meals, currently set at 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hastert has been saying for months that he favors passage of  
modest gun control provisions, even though a bill died in the House 
earlier in the year. GOP officials have been working quietly on a 
possible compromise expected to include a ban on certain high 
capacity ammunition clips and to require the sale of safety devices 
with weapons. The main sticking point has been background checks 
for gun show purchases.

<HEADLINE> Security Lapses Seen at Weapons Labs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Security has improved markedly at the  
government's three nuclear weapons laboratories, but investigators 
were able to penetrate some sensitive areas of the facilities' 
computer systems, says an Energy Department review being released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Security experts were unable to enter the top-secret computer  
network used for nuclear weapon design during the intense security 
review conducted over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But at two labs -- Sandia in New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore in  
California -- the security team was able to obtain from the outside 
``sensitive,'' though not secret, information on unclassified 
computer systems ``without a whole lot of difficulty,'' one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, which has  
been the focus of a three-year investigation into alleged Chinese 
espionage, such penetrations were successful only from within the 
lab compound, said the official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity in advance of the report's release. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by the Energy Department's Office of Independent  
Oversight says Los Alamos overall showed significant improvements 
in its security and was given a ``satisfactory'' rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sandia and Lawrence Livermore labs were given ``marginal''  
rating, but officials said security improvement under way make it 
likely the two labs' rating will be raised to satisfactory by 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said that while more work is  
needed, the findings showed major improvement and demonstrated that 
security efforts are working. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to get a decent report card on security measures,''  
he said in a telephone interview. ``Security at our labs is good 
and getting better. The labs deserve credit for their improvements 
rather than continued criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House national security adviser Sandy Berger said Sunday  
that efforts to improve security, beginning in 1997, were hampered 
by ``bureaucratic resistance'' and ``an institutional 
unwillingness'' by the research labs to adopt more rigorous 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' defended Clinton  
administration responses to allegation of Chinese espionage at the 
labs, about which he got a detailed briefing in mid-1997. While 
President Clinton directed new security measures in February 1998, 
it was not until earlier this year that tough, new measures were 
put in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent reviews by the team of 25 security specialists --  
dubbed by Richardson as his ``junkyard dogs'' -- was intended to 
test those new measures, including computer safeguards and improved 
handling of classified material. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past six months, new procedures have been implemented  
to guard against moving data out of the top-secret classified 
system and to better safeguard the unclassified system against 
outside access, officials said. The unclassified network has been 
compartmentalized, separating ``sensitive'' from other information, 
and electronic mail is being randomly monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, one official said investigators were able to get  
into the sensitive areas of the unclassified system at all three 
labs during their reviews. He said changes were made to plug the 
security gaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Access to the unclassified computer network has been of concern  
because at Los Alamos, investigators last March found that a 
scientist had improperly transferred thousands of files of 
top-secret computer codes into his unclassified office computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired in March for other security  
violations after being the prime target of a three-year FBI 
investigation into the alleged theft of nuclear secrets by China in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has not been charged with any crime and has denied proving  
China with any secrets. While acknowledging he moved the computer 
codes, he claimed he did so only to make his work easier. 
</P>
<P>
	The security review at Los Alamos was conducted in August and  
earlier in the summer at Sandia and Livermore, officials said. It 
found Los Alamos had significantly increased computer security, 
improved protection of classified material and accountability of 
nuclear materials, added guards and put in more alarm sensors. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, there was ``a marked change in attitude''  
about security among Los Alamos scientists and managers, one 
official noted.

<HEADLINE> Pressure Builds To Open Cuba Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For four decades, Americans have been banned  
from selling virtually anything to Cuba. But problems in the U.S. 
farm economy are putting pressure on Congress to ease the embargo 
for sales of food and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate overwhelmingly approved an amendment last month to an  
agricultural spending bill that would allow licensing of such 
exports, and the provision is expected to be a major issue as House 
and Senate negotiators try to reach a compromise this week on the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that has absolutely been pushed onto the  
radar screen by the ag lobby groups,'' said Jose Cardenas, 
Washington director for the Cuban American National Foundation. 
``They've been playing this for all it's worth, that Mr. and Mrs. 
Family Farmer are being pushed off their farms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardenas and other U.S. opponents of Fidel Castro have watched  
in dismay as a steady stream of farmers and members of Congress 
have trekked to Cuba in recent weeks to meet with the Cuban 
president and discuss potential agricultural trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Sen. Byron  
Dorgan, D-N.D., met with Castro for seven hours in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that everyone would take a look at 40 years of  
history and say that embargoes to Cuba have done nothing but hurt 
the people of Cuba,'' said Dorgan, who will be one of the Senate 
negotiators on the agricultural appropriations bill. ``When you've 
got public policy that doesn't work, then after four decades you 
might consider changing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups and agribusinesses are clamoring to move a glut of  
grain that has depressed commodity prices for the second year in a 
row, and they've been pressuring Congress and the Clinton 
administration to remove all barriers to food exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States expects to export $49 billion worth of  
commodities this year, down from a peak $59.8 billion three years 
ago, and the Agriculture Department is forecasting only slight 
improvement in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration decided this summer to allow sales of  
food and medicine to three other countries listed as terrorist 
states -- Iran, Libya and Sudan -- but was barred from including Cuba 
by a federal law named for Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Rep. Dan 
Burton, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he has no intention of lifting the Cuban  
trade embargo, in place since shortly after Castro took over in 
1959. Congress strengthened the embargo in 1996 with the 
Helms-Burton Law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate provision, whose co-sponsors include conservative  
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., and liberal Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., 
would allow the government to issues licenses for up to one year 
for food and medicine sales to public institutions in Cuba but 
would bar the Agriculture Department from subsidizing them. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would prohibit the president from including  
food and medicine in future embargoes of other countries without 
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration hasn't taken a position on the issue.  
A leading House negotiator, Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, said 
recently that Cuba should have to offer some internal reforms in 
return for permission to buy U.S. products. Kaptur is the ranking 
Democrat on the House agricultural appropriations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups claim agricultural trade with Cuba could hit $2  
billion within five years, encompassing wheat, soybeans, rice, 
corn, meat and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	But to do that, Cuba would have to double its current food  
purchases from all sources, and Castro's critics say that's a 
laughable prospect given the country's poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba imported $692 million in agricultural commodities in 1997  
and had $935 million worth of such exports, mostly sugar, according 
to the latest data available from the United Nations' Food and 
Agriculture Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm organizations say Cuba is bound to buy from U.S. sources,  
if it has a chance to, to take advantage of lower shipping costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba currently buys about 700,000 metric tons of wheat, mostly  
from Europe and Canada. ``We're thinking we could sell them all 
their 700,000 tons,'' said Dawn Forsythe, spokeswoman for U.S. 
Wheat Associates, the export promotion arm of the wheat industry. 
``We have the wheat available, and I think that Cuba would like to 
get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A House-Senate conference committee is scheduled to begin  
negotiations on the appropriations bill Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Trees Blaze in Northern California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Firefighters rappelled down ropes from  
helicopters to battle flames approaching a town in the scenic Big 
Sur and used explosives to clear fire lines around a huge blaze in 
extreme Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	As of today, more than 47,559 acres of forest had burned in the  
Trinity Alps Wilderness Area about 200 miles north of San 
Francisco. Crews were blowing up fallen trees on steep slopes to 
make fire breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the nation's biggest active blaze, said fire spokeswoman  
Rosemary Hardin. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 1,350 people fought the fire, which was spreading  
northwestward towards the Klamath National Forest, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 miles south of San Francisco, some 3,000  
firefighters worked on a group of fires in the Big Sur that had 
burned 25,684 acres of trees and brush. 
</P>
<P>
	That fire had burned to within a mile of Tassajara Hot Springs,  
a scenic resort town deep within the Los Padres National Forest, 
and authorities advised people to evacuate voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters rappelled down from helicopters to reach fire lines  
on nearly vertical slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're planning on a long siege,'' said Joe Pasinato, a U.S.  
Forest Service spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Wildfires Burn 72,000 Acres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) -- Stubborn lightning-caused fires burned  
through more than 72,000 acres of Northern California's forests 
Monday and forced Benedictine monks to flee their monastery high in 
the coastal mountains of Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires were burning in nearly inaccessible terrain in the  
Trinity Alps Wilderness Area about 210 miles north of San Francisco 
as well as in two areas of Big Sur, more than 100 miles south of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these mountains go straight up and down,'' said Joe  
Pasinato, a Forest Service spokesman with the firefighters in Big 
Sur. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 250 vacationers and monks at the New Camaldoli  
Hermitage, a monastery perched 1,300 feet above the Pacific Ocean, 
were ordered to leave Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hermitage, reachable only by a narrow twisting road from the  
coastal highway, houses between 30 and 40 monks who maintain vows 
of silence and support their contemplative life by making 
fruitcakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation order was made after one of two large wildfires  
burning in Big Sur's Los Padres National Forest burned through two 
dry creeks and then raced up nearby hills. Twenty homes and other 
buildings were threatened, but no one was injured, said Paul 
Christensen, a fire information officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Big Sur fire came within a mile of another religious  
center Tassajara Hot Springs, which is populated by Zen Buddhists. 
Residents were advised to either evacuate, or be ready to leave in 
a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 47,559 acres had burned by Monday in the Trinity fire,  
making it the largest wildfire currently burning in the nation, 
fire spokeswoman Rosemary Hardin said. It was spreading northwest 
towards the Klamath National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	In Big Sur, blazes sparked on Sept. 8 have burned 25,700 acres  
of oak trees, sage, chapparal and other brush. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 5,000 people were trying to contain the two groups of  
fires, and a fleet of air tankers were dumping water or a mixture 
of chemicals and water on the blazes.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Wants Ten Commandments Posted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Religion and government have been  
enmeshed since the nation's founding, and the Ten Commandments 
``are how we got to where we are today'' and should be posted in 
schools, publisher Steve Forbes says. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes called the commandments ``the foundation of our  
civilization'' and said youngsters cannot properly learn the 
nation's heritage without them. He said the United States is no 
different from Muslim countries, where religion is central to 
public life. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you went to, say, a country that has the Muslim religion,  
and you go to a school, you might expect to see the Koran there. 
You wouldn't be surprised,'' said Forbes. ``It's part of their 
culture. It's the same thing here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wealthy publisher and candidate for the Republican  
presidential nomination, at a suburban school for an event billed 
as boosting school technology, said: ``The importance of education 
is more than keeping your mind nimble, but in instilling a strong 
sense of what is right and what is wrong.'' And it is in carrying 
out that values education, Forbes said, that leads to the 
controversy about posting the Ten Commandments in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``In schools, you should have an understanding of from whence we  
came, and it starts with the Ten Commandments,'' said Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that religion has been a central theme of American  
political life since its inception. ``Our founders understood 
this,'' he said, noting the Declaration of Independence having 
several references to God. 
</P>
<P>
	During questioning by pupils at the school, Forbes was asked  
about his views on school prayer. He endorse that as well as 
posting the Ten Commandment in schools, a major goal of social 
conservatives who are important in Republican politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes dismissed the argument many critics that putting the  
religious document in schoolrooms improperly mingles government and 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the basis of Western civilization,'' said Forbes. ``The  
Ten Commandments gave us Judaism, from which flowed Christianity, 
from which flowed the rise of Europe, from which we had our 
origins. It's the foundation of civilization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A student suggested posting the commandments would favor a  
particular form of religion and asked whether Forbes would include 
allowing other religious materials such as the Koran in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said that misses the point.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Koran is not the basis of this civilization,'' he said,  
``the Ten Commandments are. Understanding them as the basis of our 
civilization going back several millenniums is basic to 
understanding how we got to where we are today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes argued that the tenets laid out in the Ten Commandments  
are such a central part of the nation's character that they should 
be included as a central part of its educational system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like the Declaration (of Independence) or the  
Constitution, but it is from whence all this began,'' said Forbes. 
``I support having voluntary prayer, noncoercive. And I support 
posting the Ten Commandments, since those commandments are the 
foundation of our civilization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Forbes sought the GOP presidential nomination in the last  
election cycle, he campaigned almost exclusively on his idea of 
replacing the federal tax code with a flat tax. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he has advocated the flat tax but also campaigned  
hard for backing from social conservatives. He's won some support, 
although he faces competition from several other candidates for 
that side of the party.

<HEADLINE> The Two Sides to Elizabeth Dole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nobody has stumped in high heels as far as  
Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	For three decades, she has marched around Washington working for  
five presidents, campaigned across America for her husband and 
traversed dusty roads at home and abroad as director of the 
American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Her choice in footwear: ``Something that has a solid heel and a  
soft material. You do have to watch the material because if it's 
too firm, your feet will be aching by night,'' Dole said, slipping 
a pump off her stocking foot to display its 3-inch heel. 
</P>
<P>
	Like her ideal traveling shoes, this presidential candidate is  
cushy on the outside with a sturdy soul. Her demeanor is smooth as 
suede; her resolve, tough like leather. 
</P>
<P>
	At a home for low-income seniors in Washington, Dole waltzes  
from table to table offering her patented syrupy greetings. ``How 
are you-u-u-u-?,'' she says with a soft Carolina drawl. ``How are 
you doing? Thank you for being here. Good to see you-u-u.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But under this satiny persona is a scrappy, disciplined,  
take-charge woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was pretty bold for a girl,'' says Ann Morgan, who went to  
high school with Dole in Salisbury, N.C. ``Everybody knew she was a 
teen-age girl, but everybody knew she had something the rest of us 
didn't have. 
</P>
<P>
	``We jokingly said she'll probably be the first lady president.  
She said `Ya-all are crazy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	At 63, Dole is making speeches in New Hampshire, signing bumper  
stickers and spinning upsidedown on the Loop-O-Plane carnival ride 
in Des Moines on her quest to become leader of the free world. If 
she succeeds, Dole would be America's first female president. Her 
campaign motto: ``Let's make history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, she trails Texas Gov. George W. Bush. She must  
convince voters she's not running for vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyn Nofziger, one of President Reagan's core conservative aides,  
notes that Dole started out a Democrat, became an independent when 
she worked in the Nixon administration and then joined the 
Republican Party in the mid 1970s -- about the time she married Bob 
Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's probably more conservative than she was 20 years  
ago, but basically, she's a believer in big government -- the 
government doing things and making people do things,'' he says. As 
transportation secretary, ``she gave us that damn middle tail light 
in the back of cars. Nobody has ever told me how many lives it's 
saved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nofziger doesn't always agree with her politics, but he warmly  
recalls when Dole visited his daughter who was dying of cancer. 
``And she didn't just duck in and duck out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole is stepmother to Robin, her husband Bob's daughter from his  
previous marriage, but she never had children of her own. She's got 
maternal instincts, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Clason, who worked with her at the Red Cross, says when he  
got sick with fever in Somalia, Dole knocked on his hotel room door 
and handed him Tylenol wrapped in a Kleenex -- ``like a mother would 
do for a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Dole privately considered running for president before, it  
wasn't until about a year ago that she sought counsel from her 
friends and advice on discerning God's will. 
</P>
<P>
	Her nephew, John Hanford III, said a pastor advised her last  
December to run if she thought it was the only thing she could do. 
Hanford, an adviser on international religious liberty, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said `Elizabeth, I think sometimes decisions are more  
difficult than that,''' he said. ``I told her that in my opinion 
it's less a bolt of lightning and more like lights lining up over 
time like a runway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout her life, Dole has lighted one beacon after another.  
</P>
<P>
	Bachelor's degree from Duke University. Master's degree in  
education. Harvard law degree. Deputy assistant to President Nixon 
for consumer affairs. Member of the Federal Trade Commission. 
Assistant to President Reagan for public liaison. First female 
transportation secretary. Labor secretary in President Bush's 
Cabinet. President of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, she's shadowed her husband during three national  
campaigns. Coming and going from their apartment at the Watergate, 
the Doles hit the campaign trail eight months after their marriage 
when President Ford picked Bob Dole as his running mate in 1976. 
They lost. He ran unsuccessfully for president in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Now with her campaign for the presidency, the tables have  
turned. This time around, they're coming and going from a hotel. 
They had to move out of their apartment temporarily while workers 
tore out walls to expand it into the unit they bought next door -- 
the apartment where Monica Lewinsky and her mother lived during the 
impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as a tyke, little ``Liddy'' -- a childhood nickname she  
wished people would forget -- had a lot going on. She was 
neighborhood ringleader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always coming up with the ideas to `Let's do this. Let's  
do that. Let's go off to that other block.' We weren't supposed to 
cross the street,'' she said. ``Sometimes I led them into things 
like walking across the ice on someone's fish pond and falling 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the time, she was eager to please. When she forgot to  
take a book to her second-grade class, she considered herself 
``such a total failure'' that she cried all the way home. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, she earned her first presidential title:  
President of the third-grade bird club. She lost her election for 
high school class president, but was elected student government 
president at Duke University and was May queen of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Her brother, John Hanford Jr., calls his sister a ``goal  
maker.'' She comes by it naturally, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 98-year-old mother, who still lives in the family's  
English-style house in Salisbury, is a gracious and personable 
woman long active in school, church and historic preservation. 
Their late father worked tirelessly in his floral and construction 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father was always a person to do things absolutely right  
and proper,'' her brother said. ``Every morning he was up a couple 
of hours before any other member of the family, charting his day's 
course. Consequently, he covered an enormous amount of ground, but 
everything had to be done to the ``nth''degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole is a list maker, too. Her coworkers say she is punctual,  
devours briefing books, has little patience for incomplete work and 
doesn't like surprises. She's not always buttoned-up, says Wayne 
Valis, who worked with her in the White House and now helps her 
raise money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen her sip a glass of wine,'' Valis said with a playful  
conspiratorial whisper. And she even smokes a cigarette now and 
then. ``Maybe once a year -- to relieve stress, but then she 
apologizes profusely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole says she's battled perfectionism.  
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken me years to see that you don't have to always  
strive for perfection -- that perfection itself can become a kind of 
social tyranny and that there is most definitely a point of 
diminishing returns,'' Dole has written. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, on a hot day in July, Dole set up an ironing board in the  
restroom of a public library in Ankeny, Iowa, so she could press a 
white suit that had gotten wrinkled on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Her seamless campaign appearances and flawless speeches have led  
her critics to call Dole canned, robotic, too rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she believes that if you don't prepare very, very  
carefully, it will show,'' said Jean Eberhart Dubofsky, who roomed 
with Dole at Harvard and later became a Colorado Supreme Court 
justice. ``You plan for everything. You don't leave anything to 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole says his wife ``puts a smile'' on the face of the GOP  
with its hard-boiled image -- something he had trouble shaking when 
he ran for president in 1996. But she is no pushover. 
</P>
<P>
	That was clear at the senior home where friends gathered in July  
to celebrate the former senator's 76th birthday. Candles on his 
cake were lighted. A piano man started playing ``Happy Birthday,'' 
but Dole wasn't finished with her speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just one more minute,'' she said, cutting off the music.  
</P>
<P>
	A aide carrying in the cake stopped in her tracks. Dole talked  
on. The candles dripped. Finally, she led the singing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his birthday, but her show.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Get QB Smith Ready To Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Bengals are getting rookie  
quarterback Akili Smith ready for his first NFL start while holding 
out the slimmest hope that Jeff Blake will be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake sprained his passing shoulder Sunday during a 34-7 loss to  
San Diego and spent most of Monday getting treated at the team's 
practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bruce Coslet said it's unlikely that Blake will be able to  
play Sunday in Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff is very questionable,'' Coslet said. ``There's a 25  
percent chance that he will play -- that's if everything would go 
perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves the 0-2 Bengals in a worst-case scenario. They're  
forced to start a rookie quarterback who arrived in camp less than 
a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the third overall pick, missed virtually all of training  
camp in a contract impasse. He signed a seven-year deal on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Three games into an already star-crossed season, Smith might be  
called upon to run the offense even as he tries to learn it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough, definitely,'' Smith said Monday.  
``We're desperate for a win. But this is the reason they drafted 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals cleared the decks of quarterbacks after they  
selected Smith in the draft. They dumped Neil O'Donnell, Paul 
Justin and Eric Kresser, leaving only two rookies backing up Blake 
-- Smith and seventh-round choice Scott Covington. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a risky gamble by the front office, which was depending  
upon Blake to stay healthy until Smith learned enough to run the 
offense. The gamble backfired immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake was forced to leave a season opening game against  
Tennessee because of leg cramps, and the Bengals failed to get a 
first down with Smith and Covington running the offense for three 
consecutive series. The Titans took advantage and rallied for a 
36-35 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake was hit hard by linebacker Junior Seau late in the first  
half Sunday and lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown 
that put the Chargers ahead 28-7. 
</P>
<P>
	With Smith running the offense in the second half, the Bengals  
managed only two first downs and 21 net yards in what turned out to 
be the most lopsided home-opening loss in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real tough when you come into a game down 20-some  
points,'' he said. ``The fans want you to bring the team back 
instantly. It was tough out there. The defensive linemen know we're 
not running the football; they just get after you. I took some 
pretty good shots yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet wouldn't say how much the Bengals will have to simplify  
their game plan to accommodate Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be some plays that we may not be able to run if  
Akili is in there,'' center Rich Braham said. ``We may have to go 
back to doing some basic things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even when Blake ran the offense Sunday, the Bengals struggled.  
They scored a touchdown on their first drive, then failed to get a 
first down on their next six possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Things could get even uglier with a rookie in there.  
</P>
<P>
	``The offensive line and the running backs and the receivers are  
going to have to pick up the pace for him,'' tackle Willie Anderson 
said. ``We've got to keep the running game going and keep him out 
of third-and-long to keep the pressure off of him.''

<HEADLINE> Material May Show Russia Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A top Russian intelligence official said Monday  
that U.S. investigators have material suggesting that Russian 
businesses laundered money through the Bank of New York and 
promised cooperation with the FBI in following the paper trail, 
Russian news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Media reports that Russian officials may be involved in  
laundering up to $10 billion through the New York bank have 
intensified growing discontent with President Boris Yeltsin and the 
government just three months before national parliamentary 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials visited the United States last week to meet  
with American investigators who are probing the potentially 
explosive issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Ivanov, deputy head of the Federal Security Service,  
Russia's main intelligence agency, said the U.S. investigators 
showed material indicating Russian businesses and banks may have 
laundered money in the U.S., the news agencies Interfax and 
ITAR-Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have agreed with our American colleagues on a visit of FBI  
workers to Moscow for a closer coordination of efforts,'' Interfax 
quoted Ivanov as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov's statements appeared to contradict Prime Minister  
Vladimir Putin, who said earlier Monday that the visit produced no 
evidence of Russian money being misdirected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, media reports of Russian money-laundering have  
not been confirmed,'' Putin said after a meeting with Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering is the process of moving criminal gains through  
a series of bank accounts to make them look like legitimate 
business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov's remarks also contradicted his own comment last week in  
Washington that ``U.S. law enforcement agencies did not show any 
documents that could confirm reports on the Bank of New York 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov did not provide details on Monday of the materials shown  
by the U.S. investigators, and he could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of New York spokesman Cary Giacalone declined to comment on  
the latest statements from Ivanov. He repeated the bank's previous 
position that it has not been accused of any wrongdoing and 
declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into 
money-laundering allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some reports have said the allegedly laundered money could  
include loans from the International Monetary Fund, but Ivanov said 
the United States has presented no evidence that money from the IMF 
or other international institutions was involved, the reports said. 
Nor was there any evidence that high-level officials had been 
involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Media reports have said the scandal could be one of the largest  
cases of money laundering ever uncovered in the United States. But 
no one has been charged yet, and U.S. investigators have not 
commented on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin acknowledged that the problem of capital flight exists,  
but not only in Russia. He said that Russian and American experts 
had ``established constructive business contacts'' during the 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, a leading Yeltsin  
opponent, said the money laundering allegations could not be 
written off so easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not think the reports are untrue. What is going on is a  
cover up because the senior officials implicated cannot explain the 
scandal away,'' he told a news conference, according to Interfax.

<HEADLINE>  Wife of Mikhail Gorbachev Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Raisa Gorbachev, the spirited and outspoken wife  
of the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, died today in a 
German hospital after a battle with leukemia. She was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gorbachev, who was widely admired in the West and long  
resented at home, died of circulatory and inner organ failure at 
University Hospital in Muenster, Germany, hospital spokeswoman 
Jutta Reising said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since July 25, Mrs. Gorbachev had been at the hospital receiving  
treatment for leukemia. She underwent chemotherapy and had shown 
some improvement, but her condition deteriorated in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhail Gorbachev, who led the Soviet Union from 1985 until its  
collapse in 1991, stayed in Muenster and was at his wife's side 
throughout her illness. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mrs. Gorbachev fell ill, the couple that had been so  
widely despised in Russia suddenly received a flood of support and 
sympathy -- with thousands of Russians sending letters, flowers and 
money to the Gorbachev Foundation office in the Russian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Some suggested special diets, others offered prayers. A few  
offered blood and bone marrow transplants. Herbal medicines arrived

<HEADLINE>  Wife of Mikhail Gorbachev Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Raisa Gorbachev, the spirited and outspoken wife  
of the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, died today in a 
German hospital after a battle with leukemia. She was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gorbachev, who was widely admired in the West and long  
resented at home, died of circulatory and inner organ failure at 
University Hospital in Muenster, Germany, hospital spokeswoman 
Jutta Reising said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since July 25, Mrs. Gorbachev had been at the hospital receiving  
treatment for leukemia. She underwent chemotherapy and had shown 
some improvement, but her condition deteriorated in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhail Gorbachev, who led the Soviet Union from 1985 until its  
collapse in 1991, stayed in Muenster and was at his wife's side 
throughout her illness. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mrs. Gorbachev fell ill, the couple that had been so  
widely despised in Russia suddenly received a flood of support and 
sympathy -- with thousands of Russians sending letters, flowers and 
money to the Gorbachev Foundation office in the Russian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Some suggested special diets, others offered prayers. A few  
offered blood and bone marrow transplants. Herbal medicines arrived 
from Siberia. One woman offered to go to Germany to cook for 
Gorbachev, saying he must be tired of German cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be in the Russian character -- to run somebody into the

<HEADLINE>  Timor Peacekeeping Mission Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- An international peace force airlifted  
more than 1,000 soldiers to East Timor by nightfall today, taking 
control of the provincial capital from the Indonesians who 
forcefully occupied it for a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Hercules transport planes from northern Australia  
landed at 20-minute intervals bringing the tools of war -- vehicles 
and tons of ammunition, explosives, land mines and supplies -- to 
Dili, a city abandoned by its people and left in smoking ruins. 
</P>
<P>
	Securing the airport, commandos waded into high grass and palm  
trees and others crouched near the tarmac, guns at the ready, while 
the planes landed, swiftly unloaded, and took off for another 
sortie. 
</P>
<P>
	As the force spread across the city toward the wharf, columns of  
black smoke from burning houses billowed over Dili, apparently from 
fresh fires. Despite the arrival of the peacekeeping troops, it was 
still too dangerous to walk freely around the city to investigate. 
More fires could be seen outside the capital and along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights were to continue through the night, and 500 more troops  
set sail from Darwin, Australia, aboard the Australian navy's 
seacat HMAS Jervis Bay. By daybreak Tuesday, operation commanders 
said they hoped to have 2,300 troops in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been quite an encouraging day. Everything's gone very  
smoothly,'' said Duncan Lewis, the Australian military spokesman in 
Canberra. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of beginning the operation at dawn, heavily armed  
combat troops from Australia, New Zealand and Britain were in 
control of the airport and the harbor, the two vital links to Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian soldiers watched in apparent bemusement as the force  
moved into position, outfitted in heavy battle fatigues, armored 
vests, packs and ammunition belts in the sweltering tropical heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers disarmed two men who rode into the port area on a  
motorbike. They offered no resistance and sped away after troops 
ordered them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-Indonesia militias rejected East Timor's overwhelming vote  
for independence on Aug. 30 and went on a rampage of burning, 
looting and slaughter with the collusion of Indonesian security 
forces. Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeeping force commander, Australian Maj. Gen. Peter  
Cosgrove, said the troops ``met absolutely no resistance'' as they 
spread through the shattered capital. Despite reports of shooting 
Sunday night, ``by and large it has been a cordial reception,'' he 
said in Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Australian troops took an intensive language program  
and speak Indonesian. A large majority of Dili's residents speak no 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeeping mission, named Operation Stabilize, got under  
way just five days after the U.N. Security Council unanimously 
approved the force under Australia's command to quell the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge air operation deprived the United Nations of the planes  
it was using to drop of food to starving refugees in East Timor's 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a massive amount of relief ready to go,'' said David  
Wimhurst, spokesman for the U.N. Mission to East Timor, or UNAMET. 
``The question is getting it in as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a report made available today, the U.N. Children's Fund  
estimated 190,000 to 300,000 refugees were hiding in East Timor, in 
addition to 141,000 who fled to West Timor. Fears were rising of 
epidemics in overcrowded refugee camps from the lack of water and 
sanitation, UNICEF said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, met  
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie to discuss her visit Sunday to 
camps in West Timor, where independence supporters were herded by 
the militias in an attempt to evict the secessionists from East 
Timor and nullify the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had to trust the Indonesian police to safeguard the  
refugees in West Timor, as well as operations the UNHCR hopes to 
set up there. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeeping officers shook hands with the Indonesian  
commanders, but the Indonesian presence at the airstrip was light, 
and it quickly became obvious who was in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	British troops drove off the planes in open Land Rovers.  
Soldiers manned light machine guns mounted on the windshields, with 
Union Jacks fluttering above them. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the first plane approached, Indonesian forces chased a  
herd of goats off the airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
	The chaotic port area was crowded with thousands of refugees  
waiting to escape. It appeared that the Indonesian military had 
been unable to keep its promise to clear the port area of 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	As the sun set, there was near-pandemonium on the wharf in Dili.  
Hundreds of people, eager to escape the capital after more than two 
weeks of violence, tried to clamber aboard a passenger ferry and 
Indonesian naval supply ship, which many believed were the last 
ships out. 
</P>
<P>
	A flotilla of nine warships stood off the coast ready to take  
full control of the half-island territory. HMAS Tobruk, a large 
Australian supply ship, was just visible in the mist several miles 
off Dili.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) -- Stubborn lightning-caused fires burned  
through more than 72,000 acres of Northern California's forests 
Monday, including one blaze that was the largest active wildfire in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires were burning in nearly inaccessible terrain in the  
Trinity Alps Wilderness Area about 210 miles north of San Francisco 
and in Big Sur, more than 100 miles south of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these mountains go straight up and down,'' said Joe  
Pasinato, a Forest Service spokesman with the firefighters in Big 
Sur. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 5,000 people were trying to contain the two groups of  
fires, and a fleet of air tankers were dumping water or a mixture 
of chemicals and water on the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the terrain was too steep or remote in many places to  
carve firebreaks with bulldozers, firefighters used other 
strategies. In Trinity, they exploded fallen timbers with dynamite. 
In Big Sur, fire crews with chain saws rappelled down from 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 47,559 acres had burned in the Trinity fire, making it  
the largest wildfire currently burning in the nation, fire 
spokeswoman Rosemary Hardin said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Big Sur, blazes sparked on Sept. 8 have burned 25,700 acres  
of trees and brush and come within a mile of Tassajara Hot Springs, 
a scenic resort town deep within the Los Padres National Forest.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Suspends Somalia Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- The United Nations Children's Fund  
suspended its operations in southern Somalia on Monday following 
the killing last week of its highest-ranking health officer in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayub Sheikh Yarow, 41, died Thursday from wounds received during  
an apparent robbery attempt. Five other local UNICEF workers were 
wounded in Wednesday's assault, which occurred in Dibi Arab, a 
small town near Jowhar in central Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF officials said Monday that all its activities in southern  
Somalia, including distribution of high-energy food biscuits, would 
cease until at least Friday, when the decision would be 
reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
	The aid suspension comes at time when famine- and war-induced  
famine have produced the worst rates of hunger and disease in 
southern Somalia two years. According to local authorities, at 
least 10 people die each day in the Bakol region of southwestern 
Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures finished mixed Monday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were held down by forecasts calling for good harvest  
weather in the Midwest this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat led the losers, pressured by low demand for U.S. crops as  
well as improved planting of red winter wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans, before rebounding late in the session, sank  
when meteorologists said the weather would be mostly dry in the 
Midwest this week. That bodes well for a harvest that has been 
shadowed by drought conditions in several areas last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3 1/4 cents to $2.59 a bushel;  
December corn was unchanged at $2.10 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
1/4 cent to $1.12 a bushel; November soybeans fell 1/2 cent to $4.87 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork  
futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell .83 cent to 66.57 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .65 cent to 79.12 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs rose .98 cent a pound; February frozen pork bellies fell 
.78 cent a pound.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises Post-Floyd Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- After seeing entire communities submerged  
in water, President Clinton promised Monday that ``the American 
family'' would do all it can to help the victims of floods caused 
by Hurricane Floyd. ``We're going to be with you every step of the 
way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton toured this devastated community in eastern North  
Carolina by helicopter, his eyes taking in miles of brown water 
that seemed to swallow everything in its path: factories, small 
airplanes, cars and trees, six houses on a cul-de-sac showing only 
inches of roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``The damage was unbelievable. I was surprised by it,'' Clinton  
told reporters just before leaving town. ``We just have to stay 
with it and do our best to help them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said on Air Force One he was amazed at the depth of the  
water so many days after the hurricane because that is a sign that 
it is not receding quickly. These waters, he said, ``did not come 
from a normal ebb and flow. ... This was water that was literally 
blown in here by the hurricane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to cost them some real money to fix it, and we've  
got to help them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced separate federal disaster aid for North  
Carolina last week. Monday, he said the Labor Department will use 
$12 million to hire temporary workers to help with hurricane 
cleanup, and emergency food stamps will be available to help 
families in need. He urged flood victims not to be shy about 
seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who need it ought to take it,'' Clinton said.  
``There is nothing to be ashamed of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mainly, the president tried to comfort the people who fled their  
homes as Hurricane Floyd raked North Carolina and eight other 
states: South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Maryland, Virginia, New 
Jersey, New York and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every once in a while something happens that proves to you, no  
matter how hard you work, you are never completely in control,'' 
Clinton said. ``When things like this happen to some of us, we know 
they could happen to all of us. We know we have a responsibility as 
members of the American family to help you get back on your feet 
again, and we intend to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped by a shelter run by the Red Cross and Salvation Army,  
lingering to listen to people pour out stories of lost possessions 
and worries about their future. Clinton said he was impressed by 
the upbeat spirits many people displayed; he noted one minister was 
wearing a T-shirt reading, ``Too Blessed to be Stressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing khakis and cowboy boots, Clinton walked onto Main Street  
in downtown Tarboro with two small business owners whose shops were 
flooded. They pointed down two submerged streets, describing damage 
that Clinton couldn't wade in to see for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said he implored Clinton to ``tell  
the nation about this'' -- about the tens of thousands of people who 
have lost homes, the factories and jobs that have been flooded 
away. ``I'm asking that everybody in America help eastern North 
Carolina. We need a lot more money than everything that is headed 
our way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said there was a ``huge, huge problem'' in housing  
because many people who lost their homes did not have flood 
insurance because they were not in a flood plain. He said the 
government would try to set up trailers on their property for 
temporary housing while they rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was accompanied by the Federal Emergency Management  
Agency head, James Lee Witt, who said floods from Floyd are the 
worst he has seen in more than six years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Witt said FEMA is setting up temporary water stations in North  
Carolina, to provide showers, bathrooms and clean water, as well as 
offices where hurricane victims can apply for a variety of federal 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tarboro, the Tar River is falling slowly after cresting at 24  
feet above flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate Agriculture Department program will provide farm  
loans at less than 4 percent interest to help rebuild flooded farms 
and replace lost livestock. Those programs will cover hurricane 
victims in any state, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government will help fund unemployment payments for  
up to 26 weeks for workers whose jobs are on hold because of storm 
damage, Witt said.

<HEADLINE> American Faces, American Characters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the characters of the nation's past could  
step from their gilded frames and talk, there is a place in the 
nation's capital ready for the spirited conversations likely to 
result. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Portrait Gallery has since its founding three  
decades ago become a pantheon of sorts for four centuries of 
Americans who stood out from their crowded times. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a new book, ``American Characters,'' matches a galaxy of  
portraits from the gallery's collections with ``literary 
portraits'' -- word pictures of the statesmen and desperadoes, 
writers and scientists, athletes and artists, industrialists, 
generals, slave holders, abolitionists, clergy, lawyers, poets and 
dreamers who people the American past. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, which provides descriptions of Americans from  
Pocahontas to Walt Disney, is a collaboration between retired Yale 
University English and American Studies professor R.W.B. Lewis, who 
also serves on the commission that governs the gallery's 
acquisitions, and his wife, Nancy Lewis. It is published by Yale 
University Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, the commentators, people like Nathaniel Hawthorne  
and Walt Whitman, also hang in the gallery's collection of more 
than 18,000 portrait images. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dialogue that goes on and on in a way that builds many  
unexpected connections among the people that we have in the 
gallery,'' says gallery director Alan Fern. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1861, for example, Julia Ward Howe, who was to write ``The  
Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' watched as President Lincoln seated 
himself so near a portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart 
that she couldn't help comparing the painting and the person. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the canvas we saw the calm presence, the serene assurance  
of the man who had successfully accomplished a great undertaking,'' 
she told her daughters. ``In the chair beside it sat a tall, bony 
figure, devoid of grace, a countenance almost redeemed from 
plainness by two kindly blue eyes, but overshadowed by the dark 
problems of the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery has its own portraits of Washington's serenity. It  
also has a portrait of Stuart and of Howe, who appears in a 
composite photograph of ``Eminent Women.'' One of its Lincolns, an 
1865 photograph by Alexander Gardner, shows the president's eyes 
sunk in cavernous pits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewis book has this 1862 word portrait of Lincoln by  
Hawthorne: ``He was dressed in a rusty, black frock coat and 
pantaloons, unbrushed and worn so faithfully that the suit had 
adapted itself to the curves and angularities of his figure and had 
grown to be an outer skin of the man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the next page, Whitman, in an 1879 lecture, portrays  
Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, on stage for the last time 
at Ford's Theatre, ``his eyes like some mad animal's flashing with 
light and resolution ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	A long skip forward in time and Frank Lloyd Wright, an architect  
propelled by genius and the force of his own ego, is ushered into 
the presence of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
	A mutual friend of the two recalled that Wright ``never took his  
hat off when he came into the Oval Room and he stopped at the door 
with great drama and said, so the president could hear, ``You know 
..., I've always told you I would rather be Wright than 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are dozens of others:  
</P>
<P>
	--John Adams, as described by Benjamin Franklin: ``Always an  
honest man, often a wise one, but sometimes, in some things, 
absolutely out of his senses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Henry David Thoreau, the naturalist and writer, described by a  
contemporary as looking like ``some retired philosophical woodchuck 
or magnanimous fox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Abolition leader and former slave Frederick Douglass, in a  
description by Elizabeth Cady Stanton: ``He stood there like an 
African prince, conscious of his dignity and power, grand in his 
proportions, majestic in his wrath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- William Marcy ``Boss'' Tweed, as described by diarist George  
Templeton Strong: ``Were he not a supreme scoundrel he would be a 
great man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Chicago gangster Al Capone, assessing himself: ``Whatever else  
they may say, my booze has been good and my games have been on the 
square.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Portrait Gallery will close for three years  
while its quarters in the old Patent Office are renovated. Many of 
its American characters will travel to other museum showplaces in 
the United States, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum director Fern said he wants the diversity, and the  
dialogue between those Americans on exhibit and gallery visitors to 
continue when the museum reopens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want this place to continue to be the kind of place where  
people can look and read and think,'' he said. ``Unlike some other 
museums, people don't run here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will always be an interest in people's faces.''

<HEADLINE> Ekimov Wins 15th Stage in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VALENCIA, Spain (AP) -- Russia's Vjatceslav Ekimov finished ahead  
in the final sprint to win the 15th stage of the Tour of Spain on 
Monday, while Germany's Jan Ullrich retained the overall lead for a 
fourth straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekimov, of the Costa Almeria team, rode the 119-mile stage in 4  
hours, 31 minutes, 44 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The main pack, including Ullrich, came in more than 12 minutes  
behind Ekimov, while eight other riders broke away some 12 miles 
into the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	American Frankie Andreu, of the U.S. Postal team, finished  
second in the same time as Ekimov, while Italian Paolo Bettini was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Ullrich, who has topped the overall standings since Friday, had  
a 49-second advantage over Igor Gonzalez Galdeano, and was 2:35 
ahead of Roberto Heras, both of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gap among the top 10 can be recuperated in the  
mountains,'' Ullrich told the Europa Press news agency. ``That's 
where you can lose a lot of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's 16th leg covers 124 miles between Valencia and Teruel,  
and includes four lower category mountain climbs.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Bridging Cultural Divide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dr. Aliza Lifshitz looked into the eyes of  
the dying AIDS patient, struggling to find the right words. 
</P>
<P>
	He had shown up at her Southern California medical office  
wanting to travel to Queretaro, Mexico, where magic waters were 
said to cure the disease claiming thousands of lives. 
</P>
<P>
	How could she say no?  
</P>
<P>
	It was the early 1980s and poor Hispanic patients were lining up  
at her door, looking for something -- anything -- to get rid of the 
then-mysterious disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I let them know there was no scientific proof the waters could  
cure them. But I didn't tell them no. It was part of their culture, 
their belief,'' she says. ``You can't tell someone who believes 
this that it's stupid. That's dangerous because the person won't 
come back and won't get the treatment they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The approach has made the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center internist  
one of the leading Hispanic medical voices in the country -- not 
only in treating illness, but in trying to overcome the cultural 
divide that often leaves immigrants alienated by doctors who have 
little understanding of their culture and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her involvement has transcended medicine. She's a powerhouse  
in the community,'' says Victor Blanco, president of Physician Care 
Management Co., who has worked alongside Ms. Lifshitz at health 
fairs. 
</P>
<P>
	With a nationally syndicated call-in show on Univision  
television and Radio Unica networks and a weekly column in the 
Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion, the 46-year-old ``Doctora 
Aliza'' answers questions and provides basic medical advice with a 
sensitive frankness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The need of the Latino community is in some ways very  
different ... to the Anglo community,'' Ms. Lifshitz says. ``They 
need a lot of basic information because of language barriers or the 
difference in culture or, for some, a fear of being deported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her practice, which is 50 percent Hispanic, she says her  
approach is the same. Many of the questions she's asked -- whether 
on the air or in her office -- deal with the clash between cultural 
beliefs and standard medical practices. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, for example, tea is considered a common remedy for  
minor ailments, such as colds, headaches and general aches and 
pains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alternative medicines have been around in Central America  
forever. Here, it's a relatively new thing,'' Ms. Lifshitz says. 
``You have to be open to the possibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she also warns listeners ``because it's natural, doesn't  
mean it's not harmful.'' She also suggests seeing a doctor for a 
diagnosis before turning to a ``healer,'' a person with no formal 
medical training who often is the first recourse for people in 
small villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Annabelle Alcocer is one of her patients. Reared in Central  
America, Ms. Alcocer, 51, asked her about the use of teas to treat 
severe headaches and insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of dismissing it, Dr. Lifshitz said we should first  
find out what's causing it,'' Ms. Alcocer says. ``She said, 
`There's nothing wrong with having a cup of tea. It will help 
soothe you, but this medicine will cure it.' So I used both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Mexico to a Russian immigrant father and an American  
mother, Ms. Lifshitz was reared in Mexico in a Spanish-speaking 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe that growing up in Mexico and being exposed to  
that environment makes you much more open,'' says Ms. Lifshitz, who 
lives with her husband in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	But when she began practicing medicine in the United States, she  
was struck by the cultural divide between doctors and their 
Hispanic patients. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, she's written ``Mama Sana, Bebe Sano -- Healthy  
Mother, Healthy Baby,'' (Avon Books) the first of-its-kind 
bilingual book for expectant mothers. Previous books were available 
in translated versions with pop-culture references that can be 
confusing to immigrant mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lifshitz's book, written as a step-by-step guide with  
illustrations, provides details about how and when to seek prenatal 
care, a section on types of medical examinations to expect, a 
section for expectant fathers and a glossary of terms. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes first-person childbirth experiences from  
Spanish-speaking celebrities, including talk show host Cristina 
Saralegui and actress Lucia Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just a Hispanic thing. Everybody has babies,'' Ms.  
Lifshitz says. ``It's written to help the Latina mother in the 
United States have a baby and an Anglo doctor to understand the 
cultural background of the expectant mother.''

<HEADLINE> Differences in Medicare Costs Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senior citizens whose doctors' offices are  
owned by hospitals may be paying more for appointments than those 
who see independent physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Monday by the Department of Health and Human  
Services Office of Inspector General found said some hospitals may 
be improperly treating physician practices they own as outpatient 
departments when they bill Medicare -- even though in some cases the 
doctors offices are far from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	That costs Medicare patients more because Medicare out-of-pocket  
fees for visits to hospital outpatient departments are higher than 
for visits to a doctor's office. The outpatient fees can be 50 
percent or more of the total bill, compared with the standard 20 
percent for doctor's appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Government payments to outpatient departments are also higher  
because of the way overhead costs are accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	``A provider-based designation results in increased Medicare  
payment with no apparent benefit for Medicare or the beneficiary,'' 
said the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors did not seek to confirm or tally overpayments, but  
speculated that the problem may be more widespread than the elderly 
or the government know because hospitals have in recent years been 
buying up doctors' practices at a rapid rate. 
</P>
<P>
	By examining advertising and other public records, auditors  
determined that at least 100 of the 200 hospitals they focused on 
own physician practices. However, contractors who process Medicare 
bills knew about only half of these cases. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS Inspector General June Gibbs Brown recommended that Medicare  
require hospitals to treat all physician practices they own as 
separate entities for billing purposes, making exceptions only in 
special cases, such as clinics that have long been located in a 
hospital building. 
</P>
<P>
	In a July 28 letter to Brown, Medicare's Deputy Administrator  
Michael Hash disagreed, saying gray areas in hospitals' 
relationships with doctors make that impractical. Hash said the 
program would clarify rules for when physician practices may be 
treated as integrated with a hospital and seek legislation to 
punish attempts to evade them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hash also noted that some problems would be alleviated by  
Medicare payment changes Congress has ordered phased in during the 
next decade that are intended to eliminate cost discrepancies when 
the same services are provided in different settings.

<HEADLINE> 'Spooky Mansion' Includes Riddles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ten-year-olds play with educational software while adults merely  
pay for it -- a natural division of activity, since a lot of the 
stuff is beyond adult brainpower. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest bit of software to demonstrate this is Scholastic's  
``I Spy Spooky Mansion,'' for both Mac and PC platforms, aimed at 
ages 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
	The premise of the game is that the player is trapped in a  
spooky mansion. There's a way to get out, but to discover it, the 
player must solve 13 picture riddles that are located in 10 
different rooms of the mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	A picture riddle asks the player to find the correct object from  
a non-obvious clue. A ``foot without toes'' refers to a ruler, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm still stuck on the first picture riddle I tried and am  
stubbornly determined not to call upon either Scholastic media 
relations or a 10-year-old neighbor for help. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the riddles, the software includes games and  
activities. One of the games is Mystery Bins, for example, in which 
a pair of objects flash and the player must figure out how they 
match and click on other objects similarly matched. But the matches 
can be as non-obvious as the same first letter, or rhyming or 
functionality. The difficulty level can be adjusted from ``easy'' 
to ``hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another activity is the Ghost Machine, in which players can  
create ghosts by searching the mansion for ingredients in a recipe 
that is revealed a clue at a time. And if they're so inclined, 
players can use a microphone to create their own picture puzzles. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholastic has great kid-sense and the user interface shows  
that, with nice, forgiving touches. Games for individual players 
are saved automatically, for example, which means a designer 
remembered that sometimes kids rushing from one activity to another 
don't always follow directions. The entire software experience is 
enriched with appropriate sound effects and background music that 
should keep kids interested. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements for both the Mac and PC are modest. For the  
PC, at least a 486 DX at 66 megahertz and Windows 9-whatever, 16 
megabytes of RAM, quad-speed CD-ROM drive, 256-color display, sound 
card and 10 megabytes of disk space. For the Mac a PowerPC at 75 
megahertz and System 7.5.5 or later, with the same RAM, monitor and 
hard disk requirements as the PC version. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholastic products are widely available at retail. ``I Spy  
Spooky Mansion'' costs $29.99.

<HEADLINE> Carter Isn't Slowing Down at 75 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Jimmy Carter says he has little time for getting  
old. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president turns 75 on Oct. 1. Following a black-tie  
birthday bash near his home in Plains, he plans trips to England, 
Switzerland and Norway next month to raise money for his Carter 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, he and his wife, Rosalynn, monitored  
elections in Nigeria and Indonesia. Last month, President Clinton 
awarded both of them the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the 
nation's highest civilian honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter is also wrapping up work on two books, jogs three miles a  
day and works on his tennis serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have already begun to cut back some,'' he said. ``One of  
the nice things about having been president is Rosalynn and I can 
choose what items on a very long menu we want to undertake. If we 
don't want to do something, we just say no.''

<HEADLINE> Janikowski Leads Seminoles to 3-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Since Florida State's offensive and  
defensive units don't seem to be in sync at the same time, it's a 
good thing placekicker Sebastian Janikowski has been almost perfect 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Janikowski kicked five field goals, blasted all of his kickoffs  
into or out of the end zone -- twice hitting the goal-post crossbar 
-- and ran down a North Carolina State linebacker to save points in 
No. 1 Florida State's 42-11 victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been impressive yet,'' Florida State coach Bobby  
Bowden said Sunday. ``We've been winning because we have superior 
personnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with Janikowski, an All-America pick last year when he  
kicked 27 field goals -- just two short of the NCAA single-season 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Since missing his first field goal try of the year, Janikowski  
has kicked nine straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (3-0, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) is 100-13-1  
this decade -- the only school to reach the century mark in wins. 
The Seminoles also are 56-2 in the ACC as they go after an eighth 
straight league title. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina State (3-1, 0-1) upset the Seminoles 24-7 last  
year behind quarterback Jamie Barnette, who lost two fumbles and 
was intercepted four times Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's defense, which gave up five touchdowns a week  
earlier in a 41-35 victory over Georgia Tech, looked back on its 
game against the Wolfpack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jamie was running for his life,'' North Carolina State coach  
Mike O'Cain said. ``He was getting his butt knocked off after every 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two turnovers by Barnette resulted in Florida State touchdowns.  
</P>
<P>
	Abdual Howard returned one interception 47 yards for the game's  
final score and Jamal Reynolds recovered a Barnette fumble in the 
end zone for a third quarter TD that gave Florida State a 32-11 
lead. The ball was stripped by David Warren. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really turned the game around,'' said Barnette, who was  
also sacked three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnette, who threw for 287 yards against Florida State last  
year, was 10-of-25 for 129 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State led 18-3 at the half on a 1-yard touchdown run by  
fullback Dan Kendra and four field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Janikowski, a left-footed junior, kicked field goals of 30, 47,  
22 and 31 yards. He also ran down Clayton White, who intercepted a 
2-point conversion pass thrown by holder Marcus Outzen after a poor 
snap. 
</P>
<P>
	Janikowski, who added a 47-yarder in the fourth quarter, could  
have been given an opportunity to try one from 61 yards away on the 
final play of the first half but Florida State instead was 
unsuccessful on a desperation ``Hail Mary'' try. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Minor scored on a 2-yard run that gave Florida State a  
25-3 lead early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Passingham's 22-yard field goal that briefly tied the game  
3-3 in the first quarter and Rahshon Spikes' 3-yard run in the 
third quarter accounted for the Wolfpack's scoring. Spikes led all 
runners with 89 yards on 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came down here with some confidence because they won last  
year,'' Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke said. ``We wanted to 
take that confidence out of them early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's offense struggled all day, managing 378 yards --  
its lowest output in three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not as good offensively as last year, but we're better  
defensively,'' O'Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke, who threw six interceptions in last year's loss, was  
intercepted twice Saturday and failed for the first time in 13 
starts at Florida State to throw a TD pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forty two points is not enough against a team that humiliated  
us last year,'' said Florida State's Peter Warrick, who caught nine 
passes for 75 yards and returned 2 punts for 46 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have buried those guys,'' Weinke said.  
``And we didn't bury them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden was more philosophic.  
</P>
<P>
	``The offense has been kind of inconsistent,'' he said. ``But  
there's no need in me complaining about 42 points.''

<HEADLINE> Online Swiss Accounts Raise Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some U.S. regulators are concerned about plans  
by a Swiss bank to allow people everywhere to open accounts over 
the Internet with starting deposits as low as $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	MFC Merchant Bank, based in Geneva, Switzerland, will offer the  
online accounts starting Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by a bank in Switzerland, famed for its bank secrecy  
laws, concerns some U.S. bank regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises difficult new issues that are going to have to be  
resolved,'' Oliver Ireland, associate general counsel of the U.S. 
Federal Reserve, said in a telephone interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was first reported in Monday's editions of USA Today.  
The newspaper quoted a vice president of MFC Merchant Bank, Peter 
Jessop, as saying the bank will never give the U.S. Internal 
Revenue Service ``details on our clients unless our clients ask us 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. citizens, who are legally allowed to have accounts in  
foreign banks, are required to report such accounts to the IRS. 
U.S. regulators acknowledge, however, that it is difficult for the 
government to discover such accounts themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has blocked MFC  
Merchant Bank's plan to let U.S. citizens do securities trading 
through online accounts with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesman Christopher Ullman said the bank must register as  
a broker with the market watchdog agency before it can sell 
securities to U.S. citizens.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 4, Indians 3, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Juan Encarnacion singled home the winning run  
with one out in the 10th inning Monday night to give the Detroit 
Tigers a 4-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL Central champion Indians lost for the sixth time in seven  
games to fall a half-game behind idle New York in the race for the 
league's best record. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Palmer hit a two-run homer off Dwight Gooden for the  
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	David Riske (1-1), Cleveland's sixth pitcher, walked Tony Clark  
to open the 10th. Riske then fielded Palmer's bunt but threw high 
to second for an error. 
</P>
<P>
	One out later, Encarnacion lined a 1-1 pitch to right, scoring  
pinch-runner Gregg Jefferies. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Jones (4-4) blew his fifth save chance, giving up the tying  
run in the Cleveland ninth. Omar Vizquel led off with a single and 
scored on pinch-hitter Kenny Lofton's double. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton took third on Brad Ausmus' passed ball, but the Tigers  
catcher atoned by throwing out Lofton when he took a wide turn 
around third. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, trying to prove he deserves to pitch in the postseason,  
lasted 5 2-3 innings. He gave up three runs on five hits and three 
walks, and also hit two batters. 
</P>
<P>
	C.J. Nitkowski pitched 5 2-3 innings, allowing two runs on four  
hits and five walks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ausmus reached on an infield single in the first and Palmer hit  
his 35th home run, a shot into the second deck in left. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Polonia tripled in the third and scored on Clark's  
groundout for a 3-0 Detroit lead. The Tigers might have had another 
run in the inning, but Deivi Cruz was picked off by Gooden after 
singling ahead of Polonia's triple. 
</P>
<P>
	Nitkowski, who worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth,  
walked the first two batters in the Cleveland sixth and both 
scored. Jim Thome singled home Roberto Alomar and Travis Fryman hit 
a single that scored Manny Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Clark made a nice over-the-shoulder catch in foul territory  
to retire Vizquel for the first out of the game. The first baseman 
tripped and fell over the rubber in the visitor's bullpen as he 
made the grab. ... This was the start of the final homestand ever 
at Tiger Stadium. After four games with the Indians, the Tigers 
will play host to Kansas City for four, playing the final game at 
Michigan and Trumbull on Monday, Sept. 27. The team moves to 
Comerica Park, about a mile away, next season. ... Groundskeepers 
have cut a dirt path from the mound to home plate, recreating the 
look of the original diamond at the old ballyard.

<HEADLINE> American Indian's Long Road to PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Notah Begay III is a mix of Stanford  
suave and down-home humility. He's an American Indian with enough 
game to win on the PGA Tour and the moxie to turn down an 
invitation to play a round with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	A tour rookie who spent part of his youth on a reservation near  
Albuquerque, Begay last month won the $2.75 million Reno-Tahoe 
Open. That brought a call from the White House, but Begay had to 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't fit it into my schedule,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	But Begay did take last week off from the tour to return to  
Albuquerque to promote next month's New Mexico Classic, a Nike Tour 
event that is the state's only pro golf event. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a sense of obligation that frequently brings him back to  
his roots. Begay is half Navajo and half Pueblo Indian. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always held the people of New Mexico dear to my heart,''  
Begay says. ``It's a very special place and one that I always love 
to return to. If I can help by making an appearance or talking to 
people about the Nike Tour event coming up, then by all means I'm 
going to do all I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay is a graduate from the Nike Tour, where he had four  
second-place finishes last season and gained instant notoriety by 
shooting a 59 at the Nike Old Dominion Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old golfer's only win last season was the New Mexico  
Open, as obscure a pro event as there is -- except to Begay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, some people might say, 'That's not that great a win,'  
but for me, it was because that's what I set out to do,'' Begay 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Begay also played golf, soccer and basketball at the Albuquerque  
Academy, a private school that won 46 of 52 basketball games and 
state championships in 1989 and 1990 with Begay as one of the 
starting guards. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to Stanford, where he joined Tiger Woods and Casey  
Martin in leading the Cardinal to a national golf title. 
</P>
<P>
	Described by Martin as ``the antithesis of the traditional,  
conservative, upper-middle-class, white golfer,'' Begay wears 
earrings, putts right- and left-handed -- depending on which way the 
putt breaks -- and has a swing that won't make any golf 
instructional video. 
</P>
<P>
	Begay describes his swing as ``unorthodox, but natural. I would  
say homemade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my own interpretation of how I should swing,'' he says.  
``My fundamentals are good -- balance, grip, setup. The way it looks 
is not great. I think it has a lot to do with my body composition. 
I've got big shoulders and short arms, so it looks funny. It's 
never going to look graceful, but it's powerful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begay earned $495,000 with the win at Reno, and with total  
earnings this season of $653,204, is 57th on the tour money list. 
He needs to finish in the top 40 to qualify for the Masters and in 
the top 30 to get into next year's British Open and PGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to play in five more tournaments, so it's not going  
to be easy,'' he says. ``I'd probably have to win again or have a 
couple of top-five finishes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His Reno victory also gives Begay an exemption on the tour  
through 2001. That luxury, he says, will allow him to pursue his 
mission to introduce golf to American Indians living on 
reservations. This summer, Begay has been working with the U.S. 
Golf Association and the Native American Sports Council to set up 
junior golf programs on reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a position to have some influence over some kids'  
decisions,'' he says. ``Hopefully, I can urge them, encourage them 
to make the right choice. Staying off drugs. Staying in school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this summer, Begay testified before a Senate  
subcommittee on Indian Affairs on the state of American Indian 
youth and what he felt led to his success as the only American 
Indian on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of role models,'' Begay says. ``Because of  
that, a lot of young American Indians have difficulty relating to 
being successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Natonabah, a Navajo and photographer for the Navajo Times  
has been covering Begay's golf career since his days at Stanford. 
He and Brown say Begay has achieved folk hero status with American 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's put on a good show, you might say,'' Natonabah says.  
``He's graduated from a university. He's now on the PGA and he's 
won. Native Americans need someone like him.''

<HEADLINE> Graham Nash Breaks Legs in Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIHUE, Hawaii (AP) -- Graham Nash relied on the memory of a  
Hawaiian sunset to block out the pain of two broken legs and a 
broken ankle suffered in a boating accident off Kauai. 
</P>
<P>
	The musician, his wife, Susan, and son Will, 19, were aboard a  
friend's boat on Sept. 12 when a ``freak'' wave sent Nash into the 
air. As he was coming down, the boat was pushed up by another wave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard my leg snap. I felt it break in half,'' Nash, 57, said  
Saturday from his home on Kauai's north shore. ``I have to say it 
was an amazing sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The member of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young said he refused to  
think about the pain during the two hours it took to get him to a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just decided to ignore everything below my waist, block it  
out,'' he said. ``In my mind I saw that glorious sunset from a 
visit here two months ago with my friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Nash arrived at the hospital, the doctor told him he wanted  
to insert pins into his legs and a plate into his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked into the man's eyes and I told him, `I trust you  
completely. Rock on,''' said Nash, who may need a wheelchair for 
the next three months.

<HEADLINE> Bloomberg, Braun To Co-Lead ABC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new organizational structure that leaves  
Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd Braun in joint control of Walt Disney Co.'s 
merged ABC network and television production unit was announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomberg and Braun will share management of all creative,  
programming and business areas for the ABC Entertainment Television 
Group, which they co-chair and which includes ABC Entertainment and 
Touchstone Television. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation of ABC and the Touchstone production arm,  
framed as a cost-cutting measure, contributed to Jamie Tarses' 
resignation last month as ABC programming president. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarses and Braun reportedly clashed, undermining Disney's hope  
of seeing more of its own shows on the network -- part of the reason 
for the July merger. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the new ABC structure, cooperation between  
executives at the network and Touchstone was stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Carolyn Ginsburg Carlson will continue to direct  
network comedy development and current programming, but will work 
with Touchstone Executive Vice President Steve McPherson on all 
Touchstone comedies intended for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Braun, in a statement, said the new structure eliminates  
redundancies ``and yet retains the structural integrity of both the 
network and the studio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, ABC executives had said Touchstone would remain an  
active player in creating shows for sale to other networks and not 
simply be an ABC supplier.

<TEXT>
<P>
	GILBERT, Ariz. (AP) -- U S West couldn't keep up with fan demand  
for The Boss. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans crippled phone service for as long as two hours Friday  
trying to buy tickets for Bruce Springsteen's upcoming concert in 
Phoenix. About 60,000 residents in this suburban community were 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's Gilbert switching office collapsed under the high  
volume of calls shortly after tickets went on sale at 10 a.m., said 
Jim Roof, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a major traffic jam. No calls went in, no calls  
went out,'' Roof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen will perform with the E Street Band on Oct. 15 at  
America West Arena as part of the band's first U.S. tour since 
1988's ``Tunnel of Love.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Yen; Up Vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell slightly against the yen on  
Monday in thin trading, as foreign exchange markets waited to see 
if Japanese leaders would intervene to curb the rise of their 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against most European currencies, including the  
euro. The euro was quoted at $1.0383, down from $1.0403 late 
Friday. Trading was slow overall, due to a Jewish holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 106.38 yen in New York late Monday,  
down from 106.86 yen on Friday, as traders waited to see if the 
Bank of Japan would intervene to slow the soaring yen when its 
policy board meets Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A recovering Japanese economy, which has attracted investors,  
has led to the yen's recovery against the dollar in recent months. 
Last Wednesday, the dollar hit a 3 1/2-year low of 103.20 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Japanese government worries that a soaring yen will cut  
short the country's recovery by making Japanese exports too 
expensive on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the Japanese government wants the yen to weaken,''  
said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in 
Minneapolis. But he said that the foreign exchange marketplace was 
relieved that foreign intervention looked unnecessary at least for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5476 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5418, and 1.4775 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4732. The British 
pound fell to 1.6207 from 1.6235. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8835 German  
marks, up from 1.8801; 6.3170 French francs, up from 6.3055; and 
1,864.67 Italian lire, up from 1,861.26 late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Reeling Wildcats Search for Answers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- For the Arizona Wildcats, the 1999 football  
season has been a cold slap in the face, a nasty dose of reality 
that quickly erased all the preseason hype. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dick Tomey said he deserves the biggest share of blame.  
</P>
<P>
	``We probably overachieved last year, and we are underachieving  
now,'' Tomey said Sunday. ``If you are underachieving, the head 
coach is the most to blame for that. Everybody has to take their 
brunt of the responsibility, but I bear the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomey had his players practicing at 7 a.m. Sunday, just a few  
hours after their 50-22 loss to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we all felt better,'' he said afterward. ``For the  
situation, this was the best thing to do. Nobody slept. The guys 
were terrific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomey was singing a much different tune a few hours earlier,  
when the blowout against Stanford ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it wasn't as embarrassing as Arizona State's 35-7 loss to  
New Mexico State 120 miles up the freeway in Tempe, but it was a 
Pac-10 game, and it was ugly. Especially for a Wildcats' team that 
was ranked No. 4 in the preseason and was supposed to be the 
overwhelming favorite to earn the school's first-ever trip to the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor decisions on offense, a pass defense that left Stanford  
receivers all alone all night and, most obviously, horrible 
tackling all contributed to the rout. They were symptoms that 
showed up glaringly in the season-opening 41-7 loss at Penn State, 
but this was Stanford, a team beaten by Texas 69-17 in its season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't how an Arizona football team plays,'' said safety  
Greg Payne Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's been painfully obvious through those two one-sided  
losses and unimpressive victories over Texas Christian and Middle 
Tennessee State, it's the way this Arizona team plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen starters returned from last year's 12-1 team, but it's  
becoming painfully obvious how much those few who left are missed. 
Cornerback Chris McAlister, offensive lineman Yusuf Scott, 
defensive lineman Daniel Greer and fullback Kelvin Eafon provided 
talent and attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Now add wide receiver Brad Brennan to the absentee list. He left  
the game with a hamstring injury and Tomey pronounced him out for 
the season. The coach said he would apply for a medical hardship to 
restore this season's eligibility because it's the kind of injury 
that's not likely to heal quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that many years ago, Arizona's defense was among the best in  
college football, the feared ``Desert Swarm.'' This year's version 
is more like ``Desert Sieve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford rolled up 578 yards -- 364 through the air and 214 on  
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do a lot of stunting in the defensive line,'' said  
Cardinal freshman running back Kerry Carter, who scored three 
touchdowns in his first collegiate start. ``If you catch them in 
any particular stunt, you can break one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what Stanford did in the fourth quarter with  
touchdown runs of 49 yards by Casey Moore and 44 yards by Cory 
Wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just aren't where we're supposed to be right now,''  
defensive tackle Keoni Fraser said. ``We have a lot of things to 
fix. We just aren't together, aren't tackling, aren't doing a lot 
of things. We aren't the team we were last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-headed quarterback system of Ortege Jenkins and Keith  
Smith had some big plays, mostly by Jenkins, but he was sacked five 
times and threw an interception. Smith threw two interceptions, one 
on his first play after entering the game in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of poor judgment at different positions,'' Tomey  
said, ``particularly at quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, which tumbled from No. 19 far out of the top 25, plays  
next Saturday at winless Washington State, a team beaten by 
Stanford 54-17.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was lower against the yen early Tuesday  
following trader speculation that Japan and the United States 
failed to reach an agreement on foreign exchange policy. Japanese 
stocks edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 106.40 yen, down 1.52 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo but above its late New York level of 106.38 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 10.73  
points, or 0.06 percent, to 17,585.99 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Monday, the average closed up 232.99 points, or 1.34 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo foreign exchange traders believed that Japan's Vice  
Finance Minister for International Affairs Haruhiko Kuroda failed 
to reach any agreement with U.S. officials during his visit to 
Washington last week. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the international bureau at  
the Ministry of Finance, said Tuesday that rumors the U.S. and 
Japan did not reach any agreement on foreign exchange policy last 
week ``aren't true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuroda, who met with U.S. Undersecretary of the Treasury for  
International Affairs Timothy Geithner and other officials, has not 
disclosed what was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has been widespread that Japan had requested U.S.  
aid in combating the yen's appreciation against the dollar. 
Japanese media reports have said both sides reached an agreement on 
foreign exchange policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the uncertainty, traders were also waiting for the outcome  
of the Bank of Japan's policy-board meeting later Tuesday. The bank 
is widely expected to ease its credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed an easing would be effective in curbing upward  
pressure on the yen if such a policy actually helps lower long-term 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 110.56 yen, down  
from 112.55 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started mixed as the market was  
awaiting the result of the key Bank of Japan meeting amid 
widespread hopes that the central bank will take action as a 
concession to enlist U.S. cooperation in stopping the yen's rise 
against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock market players were also waiting for the outcome of the  
election for the top post in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, 
although Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is widely expected to win the 
three-man race. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 4.37 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,514.91. 
The TOPIX closed up 18.01 points, or 1.20 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed  
at 10,823.90 points, up 20.27. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.6800 percent from Monday's finish of 1.6500 percent. Its price 
fell 0.26 point to 101.88.

<HEADLINE> GM Plans High-Tech Campus in Mich. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILFORD, Mich. (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will invest $200  
million over five years to convert its Milford Proving Ground into 
a high-tech campus. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment for the 4,000-acre site will attempt to better  
mesh individual divisions and establish a team environment to 
promote innovation, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had incredible success over the years, but we eventually  
wound up with 107 buildings ... that had no common function or 
identity,'' James I. Gutting, director of Milford Proving Ground 
operations, told The Detroit News for a Sunday story. ``(We) found 
there are benefits to putting activities together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upcoming improvements include:  
</P>
<P>
	--A $60 million vehicle performance integration center, which  
will bring car and truck testing under one roof. Work on the center 
will start in the fall and be completed in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $60 million expansion of the electromagnetic compatibility  
center, where the automaker tests everything from cell phones to 
radio beams to make sure they don't interfere with a vehicle's 
computer or navigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--A new $10.5 million commons center, to be made of glass and  
steel tubes, designed to showcase GM's latest products and offer a 
reception area, cafeteria and auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The proving ground, which has 132 miles of test roads, including  
a 4.5-mile circular track where vehicles travel as fast as 110 mph, 
was established in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the expansion, GM plans to have 5,000 employees -- up  
from the current 4,800 -- at the proving ground.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cop Broke Open LA Police Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Around Rampart, west of downtown Los Angeles,  
residents said the maze of hills and small streets lined by modest 
old homes has been getting safer for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime has dropped since 1992, when Rampart was the most violent  
of the the 18 divisions in the Los Angeles Police Department. Many 
credit local officers, describing them as polite, professional and 
quick to answer even minor calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're pretty good, yes they are,'' said Jack Macisaac, who  
has lived in the neighborhood since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Hector Martinez, up early Sunday to wash his car: ``A lot  
of neighborhoods, you want to be inside by 6 o'clock. But here, if 
you want to come down to the market after dark and walk back, you 
can. Here it's a quiet, nice place. A nice neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which made it all the more surprising when a small army of  
reporters arrived seeking comment on the biggest police scandal to 
hit Los Angeles in more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten officers and a supervisor from the Rampart station have been  
suspended after allegations that officers lied in court, framed 
innocent people and shot at least one man, then put a gun in his 
hand and arrested him for assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Javier Francisco Ovando, who allegedly was handcuffed when he  
was shot and paralyzed, was released from prison last week. On 
Sunday, he got to speak by phone for the first time to Destiny, the 
2-year-old daughter he never has seen, his lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the investigation is Rafael Perez, a former  
narcotics officer who pleaded guilty to stealing eight pounds of 
cocaine from an evidence room. He made the allegations of 
wrongdoing in an effort to obtain a lighter punishment when he is 
sentenced Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me think less of the police department, by all  
means,'' said Jack Williamson, who lives near the Rampart station. 
``If you're ever under investigation or stopped for something, who 
knows what might happen to you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet several neighbors praised police efforts in the old  
neighborhood, which has emerged in recent years as one of the more 
ethnically diverse sections of Los Angeles as immigrants from 
Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and other countries joined 
Hispanic and white residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do a good job, at least out here,'' Danny Dagdagan said  
of the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, gesturing toward the station down the hill, he laughed and  
added, ``I don't know about inside there.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops Reach East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- An advance team of U.S. Marines entered  
East Timor today with the first wave of international peacekeepers, 
scoping out the territory before a larger American contingent moves 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. Gen. John G. Castellaw, commander of the U.S. contingent  
in the force, led a team of six Marines on a reconnaissance mission 
into the territory, while other peacekeepers secured the key 
locations of the capital's airport and harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting the lay of the land,'' Castellaw told The  
Associated Press in Dili, East Timor's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is contributing up to 200 troops to the  
U.N.-approved peacekeeping force, which is expected to eventually 
number 7,500 troops. The force is charged with imposing order in 
East Timor after weeks of bloodshed and paving the way for the 
territory's independence from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is providing logistics and communications  
support to the Australian-led force, but no combat troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our footprint will remain small -- communications and  
intelligence,'' said Castellaw, who is deputy commander of the 3rd 
Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Castellaw said his advance team would not stay in East Timor  
today, but would return instead to the northern Australian city of 
Darwin, the staging post for the international force in East Timor 
(INTERFET). 
</P>
<P>
	It may be days or weeks before U.S. personnel are put in place  
in Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage it's not time for the logistics and  
communications that we will offer (to INTERFET), when the time 
comes we will phase in our presence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Castellaw -- who has been involved in other humanitarian military  
operations, including Operation Provide Comfort in northern Iraq 
after the 1991 Gulf War -- said the troops that arrived today 
received no resistance and were helped by the Indonesian military 
in Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an arrival, not an assault,'' he said. ``The  
environment was conducive to moving troops in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castellaw said he and his men were working well with the  
international force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have worked and exercised with the Australians before and  
we are glad to be here in support of this operation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Timor Sea on Australia's northern coast, a C-5 Galaxy  
transport plane touched down early today in Darwin, bringing an 
18-member U.S. Navy team and crates full of vital satellite 
communications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's small and it's quick to get out in any location,'' Chief  
Warrant Officer Scott Griffin of the U.S. Navy said of his mobile 
communications team, which arrived after a 17-hour flight -- 
including a stopover in Guam -- from the navy base in Pearl Harbor, 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're specifically here to assist the Australia-led force,''  
said Maj. Chuck Peabody of the U.S. Marines. ``We'll remain 
flexible to do any other kind of task that comes along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The communications gear brought today, which handles voice and  
data, is the only such system that the U.S. military has in the 
Pacific region and one of three worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the first group of American forces -- 13 Marines --  
arrived in Darwin and set up Castellaw's command post.

<HEADLINE> Students Take on Welfare Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the debate continues over the best way to  
help people move off welfare, hundreds of college students across 
the country are aiming for a simple, personal approach -- helping 
people one by one. 
</P>
<P>
	They're scouring the classified ads, writing resumes, giving  
rides to job interviews and prodding unemployed people to think 
about long-term life goals. They aim to give, for free and with 
minimal training, the same sorts of help an entire industry of 
professionals is paid millions of dollars in government contracts 
to provide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just problem-solve,'' explained senior Brian Kreiter, who  
arrived at Yale University eager to reach beyond the ivory towers 
and into the poverty-stricken streets of New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what students are good at -- working the system,'' he  
said. ``We found they'll stop at nothing. They'll call their 
parents' friend's uncle and find out who's a good pro bono 
lawyer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yale group, which has served 57 clients since January, was  
formed about a year ago and quickly set its sights on expansion. 
Kreiter and co-founder Kirsten Lodal began by calling high school 
friends who had scattered to various colleges and prodded them to 
start their own chapters. 
</P>
<P>
	Now students in six cities have formed full-fledged groups. Two  
of them -- Yale's and one at the University of Michigan -- have 
started helping people. Students at 16 other schools plan to launch 
chapters this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	They've connected with the Welfare to Work Partnership, a group  
that prods businesses to hire welfare recipients and is lending the 
students its lists of interested companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see them as a great, non-traditional way to carry our  
message,'' said Eli Segal, the partnership's president. ``There are 
lots of ways young people can help with their energy and idealism, 
provided they have the wisdom to know what they don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Student organizers realize there are some problems they  
shouldn't tackle themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be terrified to have one of my students to try and do  
drug rehab with someone,'' Kreiter said, ``but they sure as heck 
can find someone who can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claudia Valasco, 33, had been looking for work on her own for  
three months but hadn't found any when she walked into the New 
Haven student office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had tried everything -- agencies and everything -- but nobody  
called me,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She found Annie Moyer, now a junior at Yale, who asked what sort  
of job she wanted, then helped improve Valasco's resume and scoured 
the paper for jobs at child care centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Moyer coached her new ``client,'' whose English is a little  
shaky, before she called for an interview, and helped her get 
proper directions -- a problem in the past due to the language 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Valasco found work at a child care center, and now Moyer is  
trying to help her find another job that pays more. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are so friendly and they always call me (and ask), `How's  
everything?''' Valasco said. ``They always worry about me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students start off knowing little about child care or bus  
schedules or looking for work without much education. ``But we have 
a lot of time and we have the willingness to figure it out,'' Moyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to spread their work nationally, Kreiter and Lodal took  
several months off from Yale and moved to Washington, opened the 
National Student Partnerships office and spent the summer 
recruiting students in town for internships. They estimate that 
some 1,000 students are involved nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Each group begins by contacting businesses that serve students  
and asking if they would be willing to hire someone who needs work. 
They alert drug treatment clinics and job training centers to what 
they are doing. And they hang signs around town offering help. 
</P>
<P>
	They try to help everyone in need, not just people who have been  
on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Students found one man a volunteer job on campus to boost his  
resume and helped another fill out applications for junior college. 
One student went to court with a client who faced jail for failing 
to pay child support, vouching that the group was helping him find 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	At Valdosta State University in Georgia, 18-year-old Ashley Bell  
hopes to help people find transportation to jobs. In Richmond, Va., 
senior Stephen Dumont is setting up a career fair with a local bank 
and hopes to open an office this fall near his University of 
Richmond campus. And in New York City, junior Candice Ashton hopes 
to recruit fellow Columbia University students, although she's not 
quite sure what they will do for those in need. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe making dinner,'' she said. ``Just being involved in  
their life.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Canada Makes New Contract Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Ford of Canada cut the likelihood of a strike by  
the Canadian Auto Workers union in half by making a much better 
contract offer, the union president says. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer by the automaker on Sunday rekindled stalled  
negotiations between Ford and the CAW, which represents almost 
13,000 workers in Canada. Details of the offer were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty percent is a long way away from where we were on Monday  
this past week,'' union President Buzz Hargrove said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all very optimistic we could put together a good  
agreement here. Fifty percent means there really is a possibility 
this can be done without a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Ford offered the union a 1 percent pay increase each  
year for three years, a $340 signing bonus and minor improvements 
to the cost-of-living allowance for CAW's 12,900 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said Friday there was a one-in-1,000 chance of  
settlement before the 11:59 p.m. EDT Tuesday deadline, calling the 
offer a ``recipe for a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The first offer was poor judgment,'' Hargrove said. ``It  
didn't accomplish anything and, in fact, it dug a hole'' between 
the two sides, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Although negotiations made considerable strides over the  
weekend, Hargrove said the company's offer is being treated as a 
starting point for serious talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still enough major issues between us that could end up  
with a strike here, but we sure feel a lot better after viewing 
this morning's proposal than we did a few days ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW struck General Motors Corp.'s Oshawa, Ontario, assembly  
plant during 1996 contract talks, idling some U.S. parts and 
assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike at Ford could affect production of some of the  
company's most profitable vehicles. Its Windsor, Ontario, plant 
makes engines for the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator sport 
utility vehicles, the Ford Windstar minivan and other trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove and his American counterparts have said that  
autoworkers were entitled to a share of the industry's record 
profits. On Thursday, the United Auto Workers reached a tentative 
deal with DaimlerChrysler AG that provides a 3 percent raise for 
each year of a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said the union will not release wage increase amounts  
or any other numbers offered by the company until they reach a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The average production line worker earns a base wage of $16.22  
an hour Canadian. Those with special skills earn $19.58. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has selected Ford as the so-called target company  
three times in the last three decades -- 1973, 1976 and 1990. In 
each case, there was a strike, lasting an average of 12 days.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Exec Sees Larger Jumbo Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. is likely to proceed with development  
of a larger 747 jumbo jet in the next couple of years, chairman 
Phil Condit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has been studying the possibility of building what it  
calls the 747-X for years, but until now has questioned whether 
there is enough of a market to justify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's chief rival, the European consortium Airbus Industrie,  
plans its own super-jumbo jet, the A3XX. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing probably will proceed with development of its new 747  
version ``sometime in the next two years,'' Condit told The Wall 
Street Journal in an interview published Monday. Such a timeline 
would make the jet available a year or two before the first A3XX 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Boeing officials estimated developing a new 747  
would cost between $2 billion and $3 billion, far less than the 
cost of an all-new aircraft such as the A3XX. Boeing's last all-new 
jetliner, the 777, cost about $10 billion to develop in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's existing 747-400 is the biggest passenger aircraft  
made, capable of carrying 416 passengers 8,380 miles. The expanded 
version would carry 500 passengers more than 8,600 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The double-deck A3XX would seat 555 to 655 passengers.  
</P>
<P>
	Condit said there is a market for the Airbus plane and ``they  
will sell some. No question about it.'' Boeing's final decision on 
producing the larger 747 won't be based on undercutting the A3XX, 
he said, but on whether there is enough demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Boeing and Airbus have been discussing superjumbos at least  
as far back as 1991. But to date, neither company has found enough 
airline interest to actually build one. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus Vice President Phillipe Jarry has said that if enough  
orders are received, first deliveries of the A3XX could occur in 
2005. Airbus officials have estimated there is a market for 1,500 
of the superjumbo planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing disagrees. Its most-recent annual market outlook,  
released last spring, estimates that only 930 of the 20,150 
aircraft to be delivered over the next 20 years will be in the 747 
and larger category, and only about 250 will be 500-plus seat 
airplanes. About three-quarters of the jetliners delivered over the 
next two decades will be single-aisle and regional jets, Boeing 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus believes the larger aircraft will be needed to offer  
increased capacity on long-range flights between major airport 
hubs. Boeing thinks airlines will use smaller jets on nonstop 
flights between smaller cities.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Floyd Rescuer Commits Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRANFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Lt. Russell Scott Wilde was happy to be  
going home after working two days straight evacuating hundreds of 
people fleeing floods from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	But after spending that Saturday evening out with his wife,  
Wilde went into his bedroom and shot himself, leaving his 
colleagues to wonder if the strain of his work was too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the responsibility that he had -- he was the  
commander of our flood recovery efforts ... combined with the long 
hours, contributed to this tragedy,'' Capt. Eric Mason said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason said he could think of no other reason Wilde, 33, might  
have killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilde reported for work Thursday afternoon as high winds and  
driving rains brought by Hurricane Floyd lashed New Jersey. Aside 
from a brief break early Saturday morning, he worked until 4 p.m. 
Saturday, coordinating the evacuation of 300 residents to an 
emergency shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	The command center, run by Wilde, received more than 750 phone  
calls during the crisis. Mayor Thomas Denny said Wilde had 
``performed with admirable qualities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mason said Wilde was in good spirits when he left work and was  
looking forward to seeing his wife, Tracy, and children, Russell, 
7, and Hayden, 4, who were with a baby sitter when he killed 
himself with his .45-caliber service handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Wilde called police shortly before 11:30 p.m. to report the  
shooting. No note was left, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilde lived his entire life in this central New Jersey town of  
about 23,000. 
</P>
<P>
	During 14 years on the force, he received 14 department  
citations and three lifesaving citations, and was awarded the 
Carnegie Medal for heroism in 1988 after helping rescue two girls 
from drowning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will receive a police funeral with honors,'' Mason said.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Prices Fall 4 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Natural gas futures tumbled 4 percent Monday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after the latest tropical storm veered away 
from a path toward the Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of crude oil and related energy products also fell.  
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, cocoa rose on continuing concerns over  
developments in Ivory Coast and Indonesia, and lean hog prices 
retreated after a day of speculation about the number of hogs 
killed by Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts that tropical storm Harvey might be bound for the  
gas-rich Gulf stirred the natural gas market early in Monday's 
session. But later projections showed it would target Florida 
instead, and prices came spiraling back down. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no fear of any outages in the Gulf now,'' said Richard  
Smid, an energy futures trader for Fimat USA Inc. in New York. 
``Without any danger from hurricanes, this price had to come 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas demand is at a seasonal ebb in the United States,  
between the summer heat and its high air-conditioning demand and 
the equally high demand of winter when gas is needed for home 
heating. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for October delivery fell 8.9 cents to $2.519 per  
1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil prices slipped lower as some traders bucked the common  
market thinking that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries will adhere to its production quotas at Wednesday's 
meeting in Vienna, Austria. Oil prices have doubled in the past six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost everyone's expecting OPEC to stay at the status quo,  
but I think they might increase production slightly,'' said Donald 
Luke, another trader at Fimat USA. 
</P>
<P>
	October crude fell 43 cents to $24.29 a barrel; October heating  
oil fell 9.2 cents to 60.25 cents a gallon; October gasoline fell 
.21 cent to 68.45 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude oil for November fell 14 cents  
to $22.66 a gallon on the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the New York Mercantile Exchange, cocoa finished up more  
than 3 percent as traders fretted about how cocoa production will 
be affected by continuing liberalization in Ivory Coast and Ghana 
and unrest in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants at a conference sponsored by the Cocoa Merchants  
Association of America in Bermuda late last week said the Ivory 
Coast crop next year might suffer as a result of current 
uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
	December cocoa rose $31 to $952 per ton.  
</P>
<P>
	Lean hog futures were buffeted early in the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange trading session by speculation on the high number of hogs 
that died in North Carolina as a result of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders said the market rose more than 2 percent not because  
of Floyd but on general bullish sentiments about the market ahead 
of this week's quarterly report by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture on hogs and pigs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's all kinds of speculation going around on how many hogs  
were killed as a result of Floyd, but it's all guesswork,'' said 
Michael Downs, an independent trader on the Merc floor. ``What's 
more important to us is the cash market has kind of straightened 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	October lean hogs rose .98 cent to 44.65 cents a pound.

<P>
	MARYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Charlie Daniels has gotten back a guitar  
he ``left sitting in the parking lot of a beer joint in southern 
Maryland in 1963.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was returned to him by Donnie Barbra of Maryville, who  
repairs guitars for a hobby. Barbra had bought the guitar and 
discovered the musician's name on it. It was returned earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbra got to meet the performer Friday at the Tennessee Valley  
Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you ever seen this before?'' Barbra asked as he presented  
the instrument to Daniels. ``It's been a loooooonng time,'' Daniels 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels said he ``certainly never expected'' to see the guitar  
again and hopes to play it again. He is known for such hits as 
``The Devil Went Down to Georgia.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Watch Issued for Bermuda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Bermuda was under a tropical storm warning early  
today as Hurricane Gert moved closer, while western Florida 
prepared for rain and wind stirred up by Tropical Storm Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. EDT, Hurricane Gert was 395 miles southeast of Bermuda  
and moving to the northwest at nearly 13 mph. Its top sustained 
winds had slowed slightly to 125 mph, but Bermuda remained under a 
hurricane watch issued by the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was expected to make a gradual turn to the north, but  
Bermuda residents began heading to grocery stores for supplies 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a threat to Bermuda ... it's a strong storm,'' said  
public safety minister Paula Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Bermuda suffered major damage from a hurricane was  
in 1987, when Hurricane Emily hit the island, moved offshore, then 
struck again. 
</P>
<P>
	By early today, the tropical depression circulating in the Gulf  
of Mexico had become Tropical Storm Harvey, with top sustained 
winds of nearly 45 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm watch was issued for much of Florida's western  
coast, from the Suwanee River north of Cedar Key to Bonita Springs 
north of Naples. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. EDT, Harvey was 305 miles southwest of St. Petersburg  
and not moving much. The storm was expected to pick up speed as it 
moves to the northeast and forecasters warned that it could bring 
several inches of rain to central Florida by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey could come ashore north of Tampa, cross Florida on  
Tuesday, then shoot into the Atlantic with 60 mph winds, hurricane 
specialist Brian Jarvinen said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Pacific, Hurricane Hilary made its debut Sunday off the  
coast of Mexico but was expected to weaken. It was more than 200 
miles southwest of Baja California, traveling to the northwest at 
about 12 mph.

	BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) -- Unseeded Adrian Voinea of Romania  
won the rain-delayed Samsung Open on Monday, defeating fifth-seeded 
Stefan Koubek of Austria 1-6, 7-6, 7-6 (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
	Voinea defeated Morocco's Younes El Aynaoui 6-3, 6-4 in a  
semifinal completed earlier Monday in the clay-court tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other semifinal, top-seeded Thomas Enqvist pulled out  
complaining of a sore back, giving Koubek a walkover. 
</P>
<P>
	Their semifinal was washed out Sunday after each had won a set  
and the third was tied 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``My back is very sore and I'm going back to Stockholm to have  
an X-ray and try to find out what it is,'' Enqvist said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	All of Saturday's play was lost to rain and Sunday's matches  
were late starting and then stopped by rain.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Internet Plan Said Worrisome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- U.S. regulators are concerned about plans  
by a Swiss bank to allow people to open accounts over the Internet 
with starting deposits as low as $5,000, USA Today reported. 
</P>
<P>
	MFC Merchant Bank, based in Geneva, Switzerland, will offer the  
online accounts starting Oct. 15, the newspaper reported today. It 
quoted a bank vice president, Peter Jessop, as saying the bank will 
never give the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ``details on our 
clients unless our clients ask us to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver Ireland, associate general counsel of the U.S. Federal  
Reserve, told the newspaper that the plan by MFC Merchant Bank was 
``a problem we will see more of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fed spokesmen didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking  
comment today. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. citizens, who are legally allowed to have accounts in  
foreign banks, are required to report such accounts to the IRS. 
U.S. regulators told USA Today, however, that reporting the 
accounts is ``an honor system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has blocked MFC  
Merchant Bank's plan to let U.S. citizens do securities trading 
through online accounts with the bank, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesman Christopher Ullman had no immediate comment.

<HEADLINE> Infoseek Fires Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An Infoseek executive was arrested in an  
Internet sting operation and accused of planning a sexual encounter 
with a teen-ager, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick J. Naughton, an executive vice president with the Web  
portal company, was arrested by FBI agents Thursday at the Santa 
Monica Pier, Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's 
office, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Naughton, 34, of Seattle was released Friday pending an Oct. 12  
arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	In an e-mail message to employees, Infoseek President Harry  
Motro said he was shocked and saddened by Naughton's arrest. 
``Patrick is no longer an employee of Infoseek,'' the message said. 
</P>
<P>
	An affidavit filed in federal court accused Naughton of  
interstate travel with the intent of having sex with a minor, 
Mrozek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Naughton, who oversees the Walt Disney Co.'s Go Network of  
Internet sites, used an Internet chat room to send lewd messages to 
a male FBI agent posing as a 13-year-old girl, the Los Angeles 
Times said, citing the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for a Patrick J. Naughton in Seattle wasn't  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Walt Disney Co. acquired a stake in Infoseek last year and  
worked with it to create the Go Network, which competes with other 
portal sites to offer Web searches, entertainment and personalized 
news. In July, Disney said it was acquiring all of Infoseek.

<HEADLINE> Marshall Makes AP Top 25 Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Marshall has 21 reasons to celebrate  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thundering Herd are in The Associated Press college football  
poll for the first time since the rankings began in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall is ranked No. 21 after beating Bowling Green 35-16  
Saturday night and watching several other ranked teams lose. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Mid-American Conference team to make the Top 25 was  
Toledo in October 1997, when it entered the poll at No. 24. It rose 
to 18th the next two weeks, but lost to Ball State and fell out of 
the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	One loss and the Rockets were gone -- a message well-noted by  
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	``You only get one chance in the Top 25, so we have to make it  
stick,'' quarterback Chad Pennington said. ``We've got to be more 
consistent as a team, especially on offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a team that moved up to Division I-A in 1997, Sunday's  
milestone is not lost on coach Bob Pruett. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something that three years ago people never would have  
dreamed would happen,'' Pruett said. ``Hopefully we can continue to 
justify our ranking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's another first for a program that set an NCAA record  
Saturday for victories in a decade with 104, one more than the 
Alabama teams of the 1970s and the Nebraska teams of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make any difference until you see how it ends,''  
Pruett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thundering Herd came close to entering the rankings in 1998  
after starting the season 8-0, but it lost any poll hopes after 
getting routed by Bowling Green 34-13. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Marshall's entrance was made possible by a similar  
score -- Colorado State's 34-13 loss to Brigham Young, along with 
losses by Alabama, Arizona State and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is whether Marshall can hold onto or improve  
its status. The remaining schedule works against it. Marshall has 
no opponents currently in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, five of the eight opponents are winless, a luxury for a  
two-time defending Mid-American Conference champion, but a possible 
turnoff for poll voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest tests will be road games at Miami of Ohio -- the only  
team on Marshall's remaining schedule with a winning record -- and 
Western Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowling Green believes in Marshall's poll prospects.  
</P>
<P>
	``They deserve it,'' Falcons quarterback Ricky Schneider said.  
``They've got so many weapons. They are very versatile. The defense 
doesn't give up the big play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowling Green defensive back Chad Long went a step further.  
</P>
<P>
	``Top 15, I'd say,'' he said. ``They've got a really explosive  
team.''

<HEADLINE> 50 Arizona Homes Destroyed by Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- A thunderstorm destroyed 50 homes, damaged  
others and knocked out electrical service to thousands of 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst of the monsoon season storm pummeled a 2-square-mile  
area of Mesa on Sunday with high wind, hail and heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
	No serious injuries were reported.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 50 mobile homes that were destroyed, 150  
other homes were damaged in the city east of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind ripped most of the roof off Sheila Hall's mobile home  
in the Desert Sands Trailer Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary. Really scary,'' Hall said after the storm ripped  
off most of her roof. ``It was like someone was opening a can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 9,000 businesses and homes in the Phoenix area lost  
electrical service. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind also yanked the roofs from part of a strip mall in  
Scottsdale and two apartment buildings in central Phoenix. An empty 
tractor-trailer rig parked in Mesa was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther south, heavy rain and hail also fell on the north side  
of Tucson, flooding several houses for the second time in three 
weeks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cos. Tap Internet in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- U.S. companies and investors are moving ahead  
with projects to tap China's potentially vast Internet market, but 
that could change quickly if the Chinese government makes good on a 
threat to enforce its longstanding ban on foreign investment in 
Web-based ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, including Intel Corp., said Monday that they would have  
little choice but to comply if the crackdown is genuine. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a ban would be a serious blow both to U.S. companies and  
Chinese startups that depend on the U.S. for capital and 
technological expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of uncertainty on the table,'' said James Yao,  
executive director of AsiaTech Ventures, which operates a $70 
million venture capital fund focusing on Asia. ``I believe 
companies in China as well as the investment community (outside 
China) are scrambling to realign their strategy as far as the 
Chinese Internet is concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If this policy is enforced, it would definitely cut off  
Chinese Internet startups' access to capital on a worldwide basis, 
and it would definitely slow the development of Chinese Internet,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A crackdown could hardly come at a worse time. Big U.S.  
companies such as Intel and Web portal Lycos Inc. are boosting 
their involvement in China. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chinese companies, including some already backed by U.S.  
investment such as Sina.com and Sohu.com, have said publicly they 
want to raise more foreign capital through public offerings on the 
Nasdaq stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	China is expected to become one of the biggest, and potentially  
most lucrative markets for Internet traffic and electronic commerce 
over the next decade. The Chinese information technology market, 
which includes the Internet and related products, was $9.2 billion 
in 1998 and is expected to reach $15 billion by 2000, according to 
International Data Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on foreign investment officially has been on the books  
for years, but was widely ignored by the government and Chinese 
startups that aggressively courted investment from U.S. companies 
and venture capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, Information Industry Minister Wu Jichuan told  
reporters during a news conference that China would begin enforcing 
a law prohibiting foreign ownership in Internet service companies, 
saying the government needed to strengthen its control over 
information content. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day as Wu's statement, Lycos announced a $50 million  
deal to build Internet portals focused on China and other Asian 
countries and Intel said it would help Soho.com build a system to 
allow Internet users to buy goods on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel is proceeding with the project and other ventures in China  
for now, spokesman Tom Waldrop said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be awaiting clarity from the Chinese government as to  
their intentions and of course, we will comply,'' Waldrop said. 
``We will be in dialogue with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet advertising firm 24/7 Media, which has a year-old  
partnership with China.com, a leading Chinese-language portal, also 
is waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	A serious attempt to keep foreign money out of Chinese Internet  
companies ``would require us to take a different approach to the 
Asian marketplace,'' said C. Andrew Johns, the company's chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that China.com is a very strong, good company. We're  
excited to be partners with them, but if the Chinese government 
precludes us from continuing our involvement, we would have to look 
elsewhere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian Buying Consortium, a Web-based membership buying club  
for Asian Americans, will move ahead with Click2Asia.com, a Web 
portal scheduled to launch in October, said spokesman Chin Yao. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to be very aggressively going into Asia, which  
includes China,'' Yao said. ``It's going to be turbulent with the 
hyper growth China is experiencing in the Internet. I really 
believe this is like a blip on the radar screen and there will 
continue to be more blips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo Shong, an investment banker with Boston-based International  
Data Group, said it was unclear whether Wu was speaking of all 
Internet investment, or just service providers: those companies 
that control access to the medium. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the uncertainty interest in China remains strong among  
venture capitalists, Shong said in an telephone interview from Hong 
Kong. International Data has about $60 million invested in 50 
separate deals in China and is looking for more, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have lots of confidence in the Chinese market, particularly  
in the Internet market in China. We see a huge potential here,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapid growth of the Internet is causing concern among Chinese  
government officials, who fear foreign control over a significant 
new communications medium, said Greg Mastel, a China analyst and 
director of global economic policy at the New America Foundation in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see foreign investment as a potential threat to their  
control over the information flow,'' Mastel said. ``This step 
demonstrates that the concern's gotten more acute, but it's 
something they've been worried about a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Annual Miss'd America Pageant Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The flowers and dime-store crown were  
real. Nearly everything else was fake, from the eyelashes to the 
cleavage to the lip-synched songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to Atlantic City's other beauty pageant, the one for men  
dressed in drag. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven blocks and a world away from the stage where Miss America  
2000 was crowned Saturday night, the Miss'd America Pageant 
lampooned its famous older sister with a raucous, gender-bending 
spoof funny enough to bust a girdle. 
</P>
<P>
	Held annually on the night after Miss America's crowning, Miss'd  
America provides a sarcastic antidote to the apple-pie sincerity of 
the real pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	The swimsuit competition? A nauseating display of chunky thighs  
and muscular arms. The musical production numbers? Over-the-top 
atrocious. The evening wear contest? Outright hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
	The only serious thing Sunday was the cause: The event raised  
more than $15,000 for support programs run by the South Jersey AIDS 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the wildest show this side of the Boardwalk,'' said Bill  
Mattel, the alliance's former chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Wild, indeed.  
</P>
<P>
	There was Miss Sallotta Tea, who squeezed 240 pounds into a  
sequined black cocktail dress and opera-length black gloves. Down 
the runway went Miss Tea, pushing a cart loaded with goodies and 
warbling a version of the title song from the musical ``Cabaret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is a big buffet, my friend. So come to the big buffet,''  
sang Miss Tea. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was Miss Tenee, a 6-foot-3 inch, 205-pounder, who  
began a talent segment in a purple Afro wig and brown velour dress. 
That soon disappeared, revealing a silk chemise. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Tenee won the crown, was given a dozen roses and headed  
down the bulb-adorned runway as the crowd sang a reworked version 
of ``There She Is,'' the Miss America standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The capacity 600-person crowd was a mix of gay and straight,  
casino workers and local politicians, Miss America Pageant 
hairstylists and female impersonators. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that there wasn't some authenticity to the proceedings.  
</P>
<P>
	Miss America 1998 Kate Shindle, who spent her reign promoting  
AIDS advocacy and needle exchanges, sang ``My Man'' during the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, what's any pageant without a former  
Miss Whatever singing Streisand?'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally lower  
Monday, but the key index in Tokyo rose for the second straight 
session as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 232.99  
points, or 1.34 percent, to close at 17,575.26. On Friday, the 
average closed up 50.68 points, or 0.29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei was boosted by gains in export-oriented high  
technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen is seen as negative for Japanese exporters because  
it makes their products less cost-competitive overseas and erodes 
the value of repatriated earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 107.92 yen, up  
1.40 yen from late Friday's level of 106.52 yen in Tokyo and also 
above its New York's 106.86 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations of joint Japan-U.S. efforts to boost the dollar  
against the yen ahead of the Group of Seven meeting of finance 
ministers and central bankers this weekend kept the American 
currency strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks closed mixed in relatively active trading.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, slipped 12.47 points, or 0.09 percent, closing at 
13,472.37. On Friday, the index had gained 54.24 points, or 0.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices opened higher in reaction to a stronger Japanese  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	But the early gains were eroded after selective profit-taking  
hit the market, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares closed lower as buying sentiment was damped by  
disappointing August trade figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's August non-oil domestic exports -- a leading  
indicator for the export-reliant economy -- rose 8.5 percent from a 
year earlier, below most expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Straits Times Index fell 9.01 points, or 0.4  
percent, to 2,122.93. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed lower over uncertainties  
in East Timor despite the arrival of international peacekeeping 
forces. The Composite Index fell 3.684 points, or 0.7 percent, to 
543.333. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan share prices closed lower as investors took  
profits following Saturday's sharp gains. The market's key Weighted 
Stock Price Index fell 44.79 points, or 0.5 percent, to 7,972.14. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 17.59 points, or 0.8 percent, 
to 2,110.80. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, boosted by  
follow-through buying on the back of Wall Street's rise Friday. The 
Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies rose 21.87 
points, or 1 percent, to 2,105.75. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower on a dearth of  
major domestic market-making news. The All Ordinaries Index closed 
at 2,907.3, down 7.4 points, or 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher, boosted by the announcement  
Saturday that the government will set up a fund to help stabilize 
the local bond market. The Korea Composite Stock Price rose 8.68 
points, or 0.9 percent, to 933.88. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower on political  
jitters following protests by supporters of jailed former deputy 
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. The Composite Index fell 3.65 points, 
or 0.5 percent, to 710.03. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed lower as investors were  
disappointed by a 3.5 percent economic growth in the second 
quarter, which was lower than some expected. The Stock Exchange of 
Thailand index fell 3.95 points, or 0.9 percent, to 434.21.

<HEADLINE>  KLA Demilitarization Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The demilitarization of the Kosovo  
Liberation Army was postponed today for 48 hours after the KLA and 
NATO were unable to agree on the future of the ethnic Albanian 
rebel group. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel group had been required to demilitarize at midnight  
Sunday but KLA leaders refused to sign an accord transforming the 
ethnic Albanian force into a civilian Kosovo Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deadline is midnight Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson,  
commander of the NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo, told reporters. 
Later, a NATO spokesman, Maj. Roland Lavoie, said the talks would 
resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of demilitarization is still ongoing,'' KLA  
political leader Hashim Thaci told reporters as he left NATO 
headquarters in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. ``The talks are still 
ongoing and it's been postponed for another 48 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and U.N. mission chief Bernard Kouchner negotiated with  
Thaci and the KLA military chief Gen. Agim Ceku into the early 
morning hours today. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations and NATO were seeking KLA approval of a plan  
to transform the former rebel army into a 5,000-member civilian 
Kosovo Corps to perform humanitarian and rescue missions. 
</P>
<P>
	KLA commanders, however, want their force to be the basis for  
the future national army of an independent Kosovo. That was their 
goal during the 18-month war with the Serbs, which ended when 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepted a U.N.-backed plan 
to halt 78 days of NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	A diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
KLA leaders objected to numerous points of the NATO proposal -- 
including the name ``Kosovo Corps,'' which they feel falls short of 
an independent force. They also were holding out for permission to 
retain more weapons than NATO would allow and to ensure that KLA 
members would control the Kosovo Corps, the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency -- which  
reflects the official view -- called the negotiations a ``farce,'' 
and said NATO, ``gave in to terrorist KLA blackmail and extended 
the deadline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has insisted that the foreign peacekeepers must be the only  
armed force in Kosovo. The Russians and Serbs -- who consider the 
KLA terrorists responsible for attacks against Serb civilians -- 
oppose any formula that might let the KLA keep the same 
organizational structure under a different name. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the discussions, the weapons issue appeared to be  
the main sticking point. While NATO wants to allow 200 corps 
members to carry weapons, the KLA wants to double that number, 
Lavoie said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the KLA has been surrendering all weapons  
except personal ones, such as hunting rifles, as required, and 
``the disarmament aspect of the demilitarization'' has been 
completed on schedule, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lavoie said that the NATO-led peace force now guards sites  
containing more than 10,000 KLA weapons, and nearly 5.5 million 
rounds of ammunition handed over by the former guerrilla fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear, however, whether those weapons constitute the  
total number held by the rebels. Weapons shown to reporters at 
NATO-guarded storage sites include old, bolt-action rifles. NATO 
continues to report seizing weapons such as submachine guns, land 
mines and mortars that were already supposed to have been 
surrendered during the phased demilitarization. 
</P>
<P>
	While many KLA members have returned to their families and jobs  
after NATO and Russian peacekeepers entered the province June 12, 
senior KLA officials have insisted that the remaining force serve 
as the nucleus of an army to defend the province against the Serbs 
when the peacekeepers leave.

<HEADLINE> 1,700 Stranded on Fla. Cruise Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A fire aboard a cruise ship disabled its engines,  
leaving it drifting in the Gulf of Mexico today with 1,700 
passengers and crew as Tropical Storm Harvey swirled nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire in the engine room of Carnival Cruise's Tropicale broke  
out about 6:15 p.m. Sunday and was put out quickly, but the engines 
were affected, Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The starboard motor was temporarily restarted early today and  
the 670-foot vessel was moving toward Tampa under its own power for 
a while, Gallagher said. The engine failed again, leaving the ship 
adrift about 100 miles southwest of Tampa, he said. It was drifting 
slowly toward Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	The cruise ship, which was carrying 1,096 passengers and 605  
crew members, still had air conditioning, working toilets and 
electricity for guest rooms. The ship has departed Tampa on 
Thursday for a four-day cruise. It made stops in Key West and 
Cozumel, Mexico, before it was scheduled to return to Tampa this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical Storm Harvey, which formed late Sunday in the eastern  
Gulf of Mexico, was expected to come ashore early Tuesday afternoon 
in the Tampa Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	A tug boat, the Beverly Anderson, was expected to meet up with  
the ship this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Murphy said weather might make it  
necessary to tug the ship to Key West instead of Tampa, away from 
the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a vessel that size in tow, it's not going to be making  
great speed,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher said the ship was heading for Tampa because it would  
be easier on the passengers to return from the port from which they 
left. He estimated the tug boat would be able to pull the ship at 
about 7 mph, depending on sea conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we wouldn't enter the port to coincide with the  
arrival of that storm,'' Gallagher said. ``But it's going to be a 
lot easier for us to deal with the guests from Tampa than from Key 
West. We are trying to minimize the inconvenience for our guests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seas were near 6 feet in the area where the ship was adrift,  
Murphy said. Gallagher said that is not considered rough for such a 
large vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is concerned, keeping an eye on them and keeping in  
contact,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 40-year-old male passenger with a heart condition was  
airlifted from the ship early today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carnival Cruise Lines ship Sensation, with about 2,000  
passengers aboard, was nearby in case the Tropicale needed 
assistance, Gallagher said, but an evacuation probably would not be 
necessary.

<P>
	WINTER HARBOR, Maine (AP) -- Two people died today when high  
waves swept them into the ocean from a scenic point in Acadia 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of a lobster boat recovered the bodies of a man and a  
woman, Coast Guard spokesman Matt Buckingham said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims had been standing at scenic Shoodic Point, on rocks  
not protected by a guard rail. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness saw the two being swept away and called authorities.  
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard sent two boats to the scene but the lobster boat  
crew found the bodies about 25 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Although far out in the Atlantic, Hurricane Gert is creating  
high swells along the coast. Seas were three to five feet in the 
area this morning.

<HEADLINE> Dow Is Up 20.27; Nasdaq Nears High / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The world's leading technology companies  
propelled the Nasdaq composite index within a point of a new 
closing record Monday, capping a quiet session that left most stock 
indicators little changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq gained 16.53 points to close at 2,886.15. Its  
all-time high of 2,887.06 was set Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was up 20.27 at 10,823.90, and  
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 0.11 to 1,335.53. 
</P>
<P>
	But declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller 
companies fell 1.25 to 433.20. 
</P>
<P>
	A wide array of technology companies pulled the Nasdaq higher.  
Sun Microsystems rose 5 13/16 to 94 1/2 a day after the company 
declared a 2-for-1 stock split. Aerial Communications, a maker of 
digital cellular phones, soared 6 5/8 to 26 5/8 after VoiceStream 
Wireless agreed to acquire it for $3 billion in stock and cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer rose 2 1/8 to 79 1/16, and Microsoft picked up 1 1/8 to  
97 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed strength in technology shares provided a rare spark  
in one of the quietest sessions of the year. Many Wall Street 
professionals were out of work Monday to commemorate Yom Kippur, 
the Jewish Day of Atonement. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 564.95 million shares, compared with 842.63  
million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's fluctuations against the Japanese yen kept the  
market off balance in the early going. Stocks initially rose as the 
dollar continued to climb back from last week's 3 1/2-year low against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But after rising as high as 107.41 Japanese yen in European  
trading, the dollar's advance slowed. In New York, the dollar 
closed at 106.38 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar had dipped to 103.20 yen on Wednesday, its lowest  
level since February 1996, hampering U.S. stocks. A weaker dollar 
can make imports more expensive, and it can also make foreign 
investments more appealing, luring investors away from U.S. 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors also appeared unwilling to take major  
new positions in advance of the Federal Reserve's Oct. 5 meeting on 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have been hurt in recent weeks by concerns that the  
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for the third time this 
year when its Open Market Committee meets in two weeks. The Fed 
raised rates twice this summer in an effort to keep inflation from 
escalating too sharply, and with no major inflationary gauges due 
out before the central bank's next meeting, some analysts believe 
stocks will remain stuck in a narrow range. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the Dow Industrials average will remain locked  
within a 10,500 to 11,500 range,'' said John H. Shaughnessy, chief 
investment strategist at Advest Inc. of Hartford, Conn. 
``Thereafter, we expect a very solid rally based on very positive 
earnings reports and growing investor confidence that future Fed 
rate hikes will likely be limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip S. Dow, director of equity strategy at Dain Rauscher in  
Minneapolis, said earnings reports, or advance notices of earnings 
surprises, will most likely be the catalyst for the market's next 
big move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until then, it's hard to come up with any convincing arguments  
that the market should go way up or way down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole Food offered the latest evidence of investors' harsh  
punishment for companies that miss estimates. Dole shares fell 2 3/4 
to 21 1/4 after the company said it expects to break even or record a 
``slight'' loss for the third quarter, below analysts' predictions 
of earnings of 13 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Strength in technology shares extended to the Dow Monday. IBM  
rose 4 3/4 to 130 1/8, and Hewlett Packard rose 3 13/32 to 104 1/16 as 
both companies rebounded from losses on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric rose 2 to 122. Merrill Lynch analyst Jeanne  
Terrile reinstated the stock as a Merrill ``Focus One'' stock, 
praising the company's Internet strategy. Terrile said in a report, 
``The environment around GE keeps getting better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.3 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.3 
percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.8 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Oil Co. Plans Diversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The state-run Philippine National Oil  
Co. has proposed to build a power plant with iron and steel 
factories for $1.57 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal disclosed Monday comes four years after the  
government relinquished control of its debt-laden National Steel 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil company plans to produce steel and power to sell at  
competitive rates to industries and to supply rural power 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the project would save the country $350 million in steel  
imports and $70 million in oil imports, while generating 21,000 new 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Investments, which is responsible for approving,  
monitoring and providing incentives for investment in the country, 
said the oil company plans to borrow 15 percent of its funds from 
local sources and the remainder from overseas, mainly from the 
Austrian Credit Export Bank and Voest-Alpine Stahl AG. Both 
institutions agreed to provide a 13-year loan at 5 percent interest 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Voest Alpine will provide the oil company with cost-efficient  
and environmental technology to produce hot metal from coal and 
iron ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The project could derail efforts by National Steel's controlling  
shareholder, Hong Kong-based Hottick Investments Ltd., to take in a 
new partner to infuse fresh funds into National Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	National Steel is the country's largest steel-maker burdened  
with an estimated $350 million in debt.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Cos. DDI, IDO May Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Telecommunications company DDI Corp. said Tuesday  
that it is studying future ties with cellular-phone service 
provider IDO Corp., but denied a report that it is in the final 
stages of merger negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	DDI's comments came after the Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported in  
its Tuesday morning edition that DDI, a long-distance telephone 
carrier, is finalizing negotiations with IDO to merge next April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are studying our future course, but nothing has been  
decided beyond that,'' DDI said in a brief statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading of DDI shares was briefly halted on the Tokyo Stock  
Exchange Tuesday morning amid the merger rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company would rack up consolidated revenues of $15  
billion, making it second largest telecommunications group after 
the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. group, according to the 
Nikkei report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the two telecommunications companies commenced  
full-scale negotiations this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The surviving company after the planned merger would be DDI, in  
which Kyocera Corp., currently in possession of a 25 percent DDI 
stake, will be the leading shareholder with a stake of more than 20 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp., the largest shareholder in IDO, will become  
the second largest after Kyocera, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	DDI said it has good business relationship with Toyota and IDO.  
DDI and IDO jointly provide digital cellular-phone service.

<HEADLINE> Dragging Death Case Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A jury began deliberating Monday in the  
murder case against the second of three white supremacists to stand 
trial in the death of a black man who was dragged by his ankles 
behind a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Russell Brewer, 32, could get the death penalty if  
convicted of murdering James Byrd Jr. in the town of Jasper last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's prison buddy John William King, 24, has been on death  
row since his February conviction in Byrd's murder. A third man, 
Shawn Allen Berry, also 24, is awaiting trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they believe the three men killed Byrd to  
promote their fledgling white supremacist organization -- the 
Confederate Knights of America -- and initiate Berry into the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying, which shocked the nation, was one of the grisliest  
racial crimes since the civil rights era. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, sometimes sobbing, testified last week that he was with  
King and Berry when Byrd, 49, was chained to the bumper of Berry's 
pickup and dragged for three miles along a rutted logging road and 
a bumpy asphalt route. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Brewer, he climbed inside the truck cab, smoked a  
cigarette and didn't realize Berry had chained Byrd to the back of 
the truck until they began driving. Brewer said he was convinced 
Byrd had died when Berry slashed his throat with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	But a pathologist testified there was no evidence of a knife  
wound and no knife was found. Byrd was alive until his head was 
torn off when it slammed into a culvert, the pathologist said. And 
DNA evidence showed Byrd's blood on the shoes of all three men. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there is a pattern of deceit,'' Jasper County District  
Attorney Guy James Gray said in his closing argument Monday. 
``Russell Brewer crafted his defense to stay just short of a 
capital offense. He's not afraid of the penitentiary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Brewer to get the death penalty for the slaying, the jury  
must find that he committed a second felony -- in this case, 
kidnapping Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's attorney, Doug Barlow, asked jurors: ``If you think  
Russell was up here trying to concoct a story, don't you think he 
would have concocted a story that would have made him much less 
culpable?''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Technology and telecommunications shares led gains  
in European markets today as fears of an early rise in interest 
rates by the European Central Bank eased. 
</P>
<P>
	News that Italy's August consumer price index was up just 0.1  
percent from July, in line with market expectations, helped cut 
concerns that the ECB, ever watchful for rising inflation, will 
soon need to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't expect an interest rate hike from the ECB before  
the year end, our best guess is somewhere at the end of the first 
quarter,'' said Michael Browne, head of European Equities at Chase 
Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
	British retail shares bucked Monday's trend on reports of  
falling sales at leading clothing chain Marks &AMP; Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weekend newspapers reported that the chain has suffered a  
steep fall in sales since it launched its autumn range at the end 
of August, and in recent weeks some brokers have cut their 
forecasts of group profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Retail index dropped 1 percent on the news.  
Marks &AMP; Spencer, its fifth-biggest stock, closed down 15 pence at 
338.75 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies closed up  
1.52 points, or 0.5 percent, at 311.77. The best performing sectors 
were telecoms and technology, with gains of 2.3 percent and 1.7 
percent in their respective indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index closed with a gain of 33.27  
points at 3,782.02, while the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index closed up 
38.57 points at 3,698.19. 
</P>
<P>
	London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed  
up 0.3 percent and Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 0.9 percent. In 
Paris, the CAC-40 index rose 0.8 percent and Milan's MIBtel index 
rose 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, shares of engineering and telecoms group Mannesman  
rose euros 4.75 to euros 144.00 on news of an agreement with 
Deutsche Telekom on interconnection fees. Deutsche Telekom rose 59 
cents to close at euros 40.59.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Voters Favor Pot Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- D.C voters support medical use of marijuana by  
a more than 2-to-1 margin, according to the results of a November 
ballot initiative finally counted after a judge overruled a 
congressional ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call upon the Congress to respect the will of the  
electorate,'' said D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams. He called 
Monday's release of the referendum results ``the first of a long 
line of cases'' to secure self-government for district residents. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., chairman of the House panel  
that oversees district affairs, said, the release ``threatens to 
reignite the national ridicule of D.C. that erupted when Marion 
Barry was arrested.'' Istook was referring to the former mayor's 
arrest and conviction after he was caught on videotape smoking 
crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Roberts ruled Friday that preventing  
city officials from counting and certifying the referendum results 
was a violation of the constitutional rights of district voters. 
</P>
<P>
	As passed, District of Columbia ballot initiative 59 would allow  
doctors to inform their seriously ill patients of the option of 
using marijuana to ease certain symptoms and side effects of 
treatment related to AIDS and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	After the proposal is submitted on Capitol Hill, Congress would  
have 30 legislative days to pass a resolution of disapproval. If it 
didn't, the measure would become law. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 11 of 13 D.C. Council members and Mayor Anthony  
Williams supported the measure, the White House and the Republican 
majority in Congress have cited a lack of conclusive medical 
research in their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marijuana continues to be a Schedule I substance and is still  
illegal under federal law to cultivate, possess or use,'' said 
Joseph C. Peters, acting Assistant Deputy Director of the Office of 
National Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would send a terrible message to America's young people to  
allow those laws to be openly flaunted in the same city where they 
were passed,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr wrote the amendment to the district's budget that blocked  
city officials from spending local money to count the ballot last 
November. He also is backing an amendment to the city's 2000 budget 
to block possible implementation of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-nine percent, or 75,536 district voters, cast their  
ballots in support of the measure. Thirty-one percent, or 34,621 
ballots, were cast against the initiative in an election that 
brought out 40 percent of the district's 353,503 registered voters.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Forecasts for good harvesting conditions in the  
Midwest this week sent soybean and grain futures prices lower in 
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices extended last week's decline after meteorologists  
said the weather would be mostly dry in the Midwest this week. That 
should boost prospects for a harvest that will be hard-pressed to 
approach the levels of the past two autumns. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also took a slight dip on the forecast news. It also was  
pressured by harvest progress made over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices were pressured by poor export demand.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3/4 cent to $2.74 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.09 3/4 a bushel; December oats fell 3/4 
cent to $1.11 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 5 cents to $4.82 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures retreated in early trading today on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell .75 cent to 66.65 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .80 cent to 78.97 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs rose .83 cent to 44.50 cents a pound; February frozen 
pork bellies fell .25 cent to 54.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> China, EU To Begin WTO Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China announced Monday it will resume talks with  
the European Union on its bid to enter the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng told his visiting French  
counterpart, Francois Huwart, that negotiations are being set up, 
the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. The report did not say 
when the talks were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	China resumed talks earlier this month with the United States on  
WTO membership. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit in  
Auckland, New Zealand, ended without any breakthrough. Shi led 
China's negotiating team in meeting U.S. Trade Representative 
Charlene Barshefsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Western countries are insisting that China do more to open its  
markets before it becomes eligible for membership in the world 
trade rules-making body. 
</P>
<P>
	China broke off talks with the EU and United States on WTO entry  
after NATO accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia in 
May during the Kosovo war. 
</P>
<P>
	China needs to settle separate deals with the United States, its  
largest market, the European Union and several other countries in 
order to get into the WTO. Beijing hopes to wrap up the 
negotiations by year's end before entry becomes harder during the 
next round of global trade talks.

<HEADLINE> McCain Reform Plan Denounced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Conservative lobbyists criticized Sen. John  
McCain's latest campaign finance reform plan Monday, but a 
supporters suggested their attacks could end up boosting the 
Arizona Republican's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans for Tax Reform, Christian Coalition, National Rifle  
Association and others denounced the bill co-written by McCain and 
Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis. as an attack on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would ban ``soft money'' -- unlimited donations that  
corporations, labor unions and some individuals give to political 
parties. It also would limit the ability of unions to use 
compulsory fees from nonmembers to further political efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Tobias, political director for the National Right to Life  
Committee, accused the sponsors of offering a watered-down version 
of their earlier bill with hopes of making it more restrictive 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The `McCain Lite' version of the bill introduced this week is  
simply a vehicle for amendments that contain the speech-suppressive 
provisions of the previous iterations of McCain-Feingold,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the soft money ban would end up preventing groups like  
hers from discussing issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Republican Party can't talk about its positions on  
various issues, or the Democratic Party can't, why should any group 
be able to?'' she said. ``We firmly believe that if the ban on soft 
money is passed, we're next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors dropped a provision that would have banned ``issue  
advocacy'' advertisements by outside groups within 60 days of an 
election. Any organization running such ads during that time would 
be required to disclose who paid for the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative groups said they expect the advertising ban to  
reappear as an amendment to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The original McCain-Feingold bill was so bad, it was like the  
Three Stooges scrambling to get through the door at the same 
time,'' said Roger Stenson, director of Citizens for Life -- New 
Hampshire's National Right to Life affiliate. ``The remake by 
Senator McCain is merely an attempt to get one stooge through at a 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's supporters noted that National Right to Life Committee  
defended Bush when he appeared to waver on his anti-abortion views 
and was silent when Elizabeth Dole tripped up over the abortion 
issue. McCain's drive to stem the influence of campaign money is 
viewed as a threat by special interest groups, including 
organizations like NRLC and the NRA which are traditionally allied 
with the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of campaign finance reform supporters also showed up  
wearing stickers that said ``79 percent'', in reference to a recent 
poll showing 79 percent of New Hampshire voters want reform. An 
hour later, McCain supporters had their own news conference to 
defend the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``These Washington lobbyists come to New Hampshire to discredit  
campaign finance reform and to protect their own six and 
seven-digit salaries,'' said Peter Spaulding, a member of the 
governor's executive council. ``These Washington special interest 
groups can spend unlimited amounts of money anonymously... they 
call it their right. I call it spreading rumors and lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spaulding said the conservative groups attempt to tarnish McCain  
could end up helping him by serving as an example of the special 
interests McCain stands up to. He joked that he'd be willing to pay 
to bring the group back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think with their performance today, they are one of the best  
arguments we have for campaign finance reform,'' he said. ``The bus 
tickets are ready any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spaulding said McCain's message has resonated with New Hampshire  
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, campaign finance reform has been sort of an  
academic issue. What Senator McCain has been able to do is explain 
how the current system prevents any type of change from any side,'' 
he said. ``Whether you're interested in health care, education or 
military reform, special interests control the agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative groups plan a similar rally Tuesday in South  
Carolina, where McCain also has campaigned heavily.

<HEADLINE> Car Crashes Barricade at Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A car crashed through a barricade at a street  
festival, injuring at least 29 people, including a police officer 
who tried to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, Michael Cowperthwaite, 25, of Union Township, was  
charged with driving under the influence and aggravated vehicular 
assault after Sunday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowperthwaite had been driving recklessly on another downtown  
street and fled as police officers approached his car, authorities 
said. The car crashed through two barriers, struck booths and tents 
and then collided with a taxi, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw people diving either way, diving out of the way in both  
directions,'' said Jeremy Daniel, 23, of Park Hills, Ky. ``He just 
took out everything in his path. Insane. I saw a couple of people 
lying in the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowperthwaite and the taxi driver were among those injured.  
Cowperthwaite was released from the hospital to police custody. He 
was to be arraigned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowperthwaite's blood-alcohol reading was 0.209 percent, more  
than twice the legal limit in Ohio, police Capt. Vince Demasi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the injuries were cuts and bruises.  
</P>
<P>
	Organizers say up to 500,000 people attended the city's annual  
Oktoberfest-Zinzinnati festival during its two-day run, although 
most had left by the time the accident happened about 40 minutes 
before the festival was to end. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowperthwaite also was charged with leaving the scene of an  
accident, disregarding a police officer's signal and driving the 
wrong way on a one-way street.

<HEADLINE> 'Will &AMP; Grace' Accused of Slur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Viewers taking part in this week's Hispanic  
boycott of major broadcast networks, dubbed a ``brownout,'' are 
protesting the new season's lack of minority characters. 
</P>
<P>
	That means they'll miss Tuesday night's premiere of ``Will &AMP;  
Grace'' on NBC, for which they might be grateful. 
</P>
<P>
	In a scene that plays with startling insensitivity, tart-tongued  
character Karen Walker notices that her Salvadoran maid has paused 
for a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, you're on the clock, tamale. Get to work,'' snaps Karen  
(Megan Mullally). 
</P>
<P>
	In many melting-pot Southern California neighborhoods, epithets  
like ``tamale'' are fighting words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, no,'' Federico Subervi, a University of Texas media  
professor, said after hearing the sitcom exchange. ``It's an ethnic 
slur. ... I don't know what it is with these scriptwriters. What's 
in their heads? 
</P>
<P>
	``The writers and the network executives, the ones who have the  
final word, they don't get it. They really do not get it,'' Subervi 
said. ``When Latinos and others are saying increase our numbers, it 
does not mean increase our stereotypical representations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The verbal sparring between Rosario Salazar and her boss on  
``Will &AMP; Grace'' (9 p.m. EDT) isn't a fair fight, a case of tit for 
tat. Rosario responds to Karen's very personal barb with a weak 
``Listen, lady, I'll squash you like a wormy apple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the use of the word ``tamale,'' which was included  
in a preview tape of the episode distributed by NBC, series 
executive producer David Kohan said a longer version of the scene 
called Karen to task for her ignorance. It was edited for time. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no offense was intended, he was not minimizing anyone's  
objections to the scene, Kohan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosario and Karen have a prickly but caring relationship, one  
that is ``much more evenhanded'' than this episode indicates and 
which will be demonstrated in the future, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	A more thoughtful approach clearly is needed, said Lisa  
Navarrete of the National Council of La Raza, the group 
coordinating the two-week boycott of ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC that 
continues through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the sophomore series about the friendship between  
homosexual Will (Eric McCormack) and heterosexual Grace (Debra 
Messing) takes care to include a range of gay characters and is 
otherwise smartly written. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that a show that has done quite a bit to  
break stereotypes about gays would resort to such cheap shots at 
the Latino community,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inclusion of such a slur when television is under scrutiny  
for excluding minorities is revealing, Navarrete added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's the network under siege for not having enough diversity  
in its minority characters, and the writers and producers aren't 
making the connection that maybe they shouldn't engage in this kind 
of thing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sensitive nature of ethnic (or racial or religious)  
differences, however, does not mean that they have to be skirted or 
treated in a timid, politically correct fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider scenes in two new series. NBC's ``The West Wing,''  
debuting 9 p.m. EDT Wednesday, shows presidential aide Toby Ziegler 
trying to mend fences with members of a Christian political group 
at odds with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	But his diplomacy ends when a woman in the group castigates  
another White House aide for his ``New York sense of humor. ... 
They think they're so much smarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A seething Ziegler snaps back: ``She meant Jewish. When she  
said, 'New York sense of humor,' she's talking about you and me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's premiere of the risque Hollywood satire ``Action''  
(9:30 p.m. EDT Thursday, Fox), used religion to make a funny, 
telling point about its unscrupulous main character, producer Peter 
Dragon, and the movie business. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragon is berating a Jewish screenwriter for talking business at  
a Christmas party when Dragon is abruptly summoned to confer with 
his studio chief. ``Probably about the Baby Jesus or the 
Maccabees,'' the producer sputters. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics and other minorities are calling for such  
well-considered attention -- and the sooner the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only have we been penalized and offended by being excluded  
(from television), but we're being insulted with the kinds of roles 
we get,'' said Alex Nogales, chairman of the National Hispanic 
Media Coalition. ``It's unbalanced, it is unfair, it is 
prejudicial.''

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Schools To Diversify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Under a federal court order to change their  
admissions practices, school officials are proposing a ``diversity 
index'' -- ranking students by income, English proficiency, test 
scores and ethnicity -- to determine which campuses to allow 
students to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	A student whose ``individual profile will contribute to  
increasing the diversity of (a) school will have priority for 
assignment/admission to that school,'' according to the plan, 
worked out over the summer by a 27-member committee of district 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Orrick will consider the proposal at  
a Nov. 5 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 62,000-student district's previous admissions rules, a  
school was barred from having more than 45 percent of students from 
any one ethnic group and required to have at least four ethnic 
groups represented. 
</P>
<P>
	That system, brought about by an NAACP lawsuit, was intended to  
remedy past discrimination against black and Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also prompted another lawsuit, filed in 1994, in which  
several Chinese-American families claimed their children were being 
unfairly excluded from some schools -- including one of the city's 
most prestigious. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials, the NAACP and lawyers for Chinese-American  
students and parents agreed to a settlement in February which said, 
in part, that ``race or ethnicity may not be the primary or 
predominant consideration in determining . . . admissions 
criteria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the district's proposal stemming from that settlement,  
four selection criteria will be used: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Socioeconomic status: Students' rankings would depend on  
whether they are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, live 
in public housing or receive public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Academic achievement: Students would be ranked based on their  
performance on California's annual achievement test. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Language skill: Ranking would be based on students English  
fluency. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Race-ethnicity: Students would be broken into nine ethnic  
groups: black, white, Latino, Chinese-American, Japanese-American, 
Korean-American, Filipino-American, American Indian and ``other 
nonwhite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some parents praised the proposal, critics said  
considering race in any form violates terms of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is a ``blueprint to destroy the concept of  
neighborhood schools in the name of diversity,'' said the Chinese 
American Democratic Club, a group that speaks for families opposed 
to using race in school assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The criteria are supposed to be race-neutral, but this  
proposal includes the use of race,'' said David Levine, an attorney 
representing the Chinese-American families in their class-action 
suit.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Mixed at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks turned mixed Tuesday morning as  
investors awaited the outcome of a key meeting of Japan's central 
bank. The dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 169.83  
points, or 0.97 percent, to 17,745.09 at the end of the morning 
session. On Monday, the average closed up 232.99 points, or 1.34 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on  
the first section slipped 1.19 points, or 0.08 percent, to 
1,518.09. The TOPIX closed up 18.01 points, or 1.20 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices were mixed as the Bank of Japan's  
policy-board met amid hopes that the bank would ease its credit 
policy. Analysts say an easing would help curb upward pressure on 
the yen if such a policy helps lower long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen hurts Japan's exporters by making their products  
more expensive abroad and lowers the value of their repatriated 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock market players were also waiting for the outcome of the  
election for the top post in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, 
although Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was widely expected to win the 
three-man race. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed  
at 10,823.90 points, up 20.27. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar bought 107.32 yen, down 0.06 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
106.38 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback was under selling pressure amid speculation that  
Japan and the United States failed to reach an agreement on foreign 
exchange policy during talks last week in Washington between 
Japan's Vice Finance and U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the international bureau at  
the Ministry of Finance, denied the rumors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuroda, who met with U.S. Undersecretary of the Treasury for  
International Affairs Timothy Geithner and other officials, has not 
disclosed what was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe Japan has requested U.S. aid in combating the  
yen's appreciation against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 111.22 yen, down  
from 112.55 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.6950 percent from Monday's finish of 1.6500 percent. Its price 
fell 0.39 point to 101.75.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall on Weaker Dollar / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Monday as traders grew  
pessimistic as the dollar reversed course after several days of 
gains against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/16  
point, or $3.12 1/2 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.07 percent from 6.04 percent 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's session was marked by quiet trading during which bonds  
stayed within a tight price range. Traders attributed the slow 
trading day to the Yom Kippur holiday and a lack of new economic 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices followed fluctuations in the dollar against the  
Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern of Treasurys following the dollar's lead was  
established week ago, when the dollar fell to a 3 1/2-year low against 
the Japanese currency. A rebound by the dollar late last week 
helped push bond prices higher. But after gaining more ground early 
in the day, the dollar slipped back Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A falling dollar makes imports more expensive in the United  
States, adding to inflationary pressures. Traders worry that 
inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve, who already have raised 
rates twice this year, may see a need for a third rate increase at 
an Oct. 5 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up between 1/16 point and 1/8 point, and intermediate maturities 
were up 7/32 point to 5/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.65 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from Friday to 4.53 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.06 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 
percentage point to 4.86 percent. One-year yields were 5.24 percent 
as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point to 4.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.19 percent from 5.06 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 9/32 point to 112 29/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.86 percent from 5.85 percent.

<HEADLINE> House Said Subpoena Figure Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House press secretary Joe Lockhart cited  
figures from a House Government Reform and Oversight Committee 
report Monday to back up his claim that the committee has issued 
more than 700 subpoenas for investigations of the Clinton 
administration and the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's chairman, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., questioned  
that figure on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Sunday, saying it was 
``totally out of line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton has been the House's most aggressive pursuer of alleged  
White House and administration wrongdoing, investigating scandals 
from Whitewater and possible illegal campaign contributions to, 
more recently, the 1993 Branch Davidian siege in Waco and Clinton's 
granting of clemency to Puerto Ricans linked to a terrorist group. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart last week said that partisan politics was behind the  
issuing of more than 700 subpoenas to White House and 
administration and Democratic Party officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Burton on Monday, he said Burton's committee, in  
a report issued last November, stated that in 1997 and 1998 the 
committee issued 758 subpoenas in connection with Burton's 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes the volume of subpoenas more extraordinary is the  
fact that they were issued unilaterally'' without the approval of 
Democrats on the panel, Lockhart wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Burton also made 643 individual demands for information  
in connection with his campaign finance investigation between Oct. 
1, 1996 and March 31, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the House Government Reform and  
Oversight Committee, accused Lockhart of not reading the committee 
report correctly. Corallo said that the 700 subpoenas were sent out 
to a wide range of officials, agencies and even banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``But only 26 went to the White House and the majority of those  
were for documents,'' Corallo said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Clinches Fed Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- The U.S. team's easy victory over Russia  
in the Fed Cup final this weekend was expected. Venus Williams' 
frequent trips to the net were a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the biggest news to come out of the event, in which the  
United States captured its 16th Fed Cup title with a 4-1 win 
against the overmatched Russians, is that Williams spent most of 
the weekend working with U.S. captain Billie Jean King on a 
serve-and-volley game. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Williams was the only U.S. loser, and her match  
Sunday against Elena Dementieva ended when she was wide with a 
forehand volley in a third-set tiebreaker, she said she's now 
committed to learning how to volley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely felt good with my volleys. I missed a couple, but  
that's what it takes to learn,'' Williams said as King nodded her 
head in approval. ``I'll get there. If I don't keep coming in, I 
definitely won't get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams primarily is a baseliner, but King believes the  
6-foot-1 1/2 Williams can overwhelm opponents by coming to the net 
more often -- as King did while dominating women's tennis in the 
late 1960s and early `70s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a beginning. She wants to be a serve-volleyer. At least  
she's trying,'' said King, who preached to Williams all week about 
the need to come in more often. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsay Davenport, who won two singles matches against the  
Russians, said a net-charging Williams could be an even more 
difficult opponent. Davenport is ranked second in the world, just 
ahead of No. 3 Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it's pretty scary if Venus becomes as good a serve  
and volleyer as she is a baseliner,'' Davenport said. ``I've got to 
start doing that, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport clinched the Fed Cup title when she defeated Elena  
Likhovtseva 6-4, 6-4 Sunday, giving the U.S. team a 3-0 lead in the 
best-of-5 event. She then marched around the stadium holding a U.S. 
flag with teammates Venus and Serena Williams and Monica Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	``All week we've been practicing, working toward this goal, and  
it's great,'' Davenport said. ``We're not used to it as tennis 
players to be on a team. So when we get the opportunity, I think we 
all really enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Greenwood's ``God Bless the U.S.A.'' blared from speakers as  
the four Americans smiled broadly and waved to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great we brought the Fed Cup back to the United States,  
where it belongs,'' King said. ``I think we can have a dynasty in 
the future with these players and a few of the others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dementieva overcame a 4-1 deficit in the third set of the next  
match to defeat Venus Williams 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) and prevent the 
United States from sweeping the event. But the Williams sisters 
then joined in doubles to defeat Dementieva and Elena Makarova 6-2, 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. title came as little surprise. While the American team  
had four of the world's top five players, Russia was missing its 
top-ranked player, No. 15 Anna Kournikova, who has a minor stress 
fracture in her right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. squad, which King referred to as the ``Dream Team,''  
was so strong that U.S. Open champion Serena Williams was 
restricted to doubles and Seles, ranked fifth in the world, did not 
play at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very good and they can beat anybody, any team,  
5-zip,'' Likhovtseva said. ``We can't borrow any players from them, 
right?''

<HEADLINE> Debate on Navy Bombing Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as the controversy continues over  
President Clinton's grant of clemency to Puerto Rican separatists, 
debate is heating up over the U.S. military's live firing range on 
a tiny Puerto Rican island. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional hearings are planned this week on the future of  
the U.S. military in Vieques, where the Navy has suspended 
live-ammunition exercises pending recommendations from a 
Pentagon-appointed panel. The exercises have been conducted since 
the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico's government wants the Navy to return the training  
facility to civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy, wanting to resume the training, announced Monday it  
could be sending a battle group into the Mediterranean and Persian 
Gulf in a ``significantly reduced state of combat readiness'' 
because of the suspension. The ships departed Norfolk, Va., Monday 
for limited training in the Puerto Rico training area, the Navy 
said, before sailing to the Mediterranean next February. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Ricans have long objected to using the island for target  
practice, but the issue boiled over in April when an errant bomb 
killed a Puerto Rican civilian guard, David Sanes Rodriguez, 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides endangering the island's 9,400 residents, they say, the  
military is polluting the environment and driving away tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon says live-fire practice is essential to pilot  
training and cannot be conducted elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Vieques weapons range is the only place where aircraft,  
Navy surface ships, ground forces, and Navy and Marine Corps 
personnel assigned to our Atlantic Fleet can conduct integrated 
training with live ammunition under combat-ready conditions,'' Vice 
Adm. Robert J. Natter, deputy chief of naval operations for plans 
and policy, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said if live-fire training remains suspended through  
December, the ships would be deployed without being certified to 
support Marines ashore with their big guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they depend on the Navy base for jobs, Puerto Ricans  
have for years opposed the Navy's use of Vieques, a 22-mile-long 
island eight miles east of Puerto Rico's main island, as a bombing 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials say the accident that killed Rodriguez was a  
tragic mistake but note it is the only casualty in more than 50 
years of training on the island's 24,000-acre bombing range, which 
has prepared pilots for every armed conflict since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the battle over Vieques is reverberating loudly in  
New York's complicated melting pot of ethnic politics and is an 
emerging issue in the U.S. Senate between first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	The clemency issue already has spun into a major issue for Mrs.  
Clinton, who angered many Puerto Rican leaders by opposing her 
husband's clemency offer to 16 separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said the  
first lady was ``very concerned'' about the Vieques issue, but was 
reserving any final judgment until a Pentagon-appointed panel 
issues its report. The panel has completed its hearings and is 
working on its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls to Giuliani's campaign office seeking comment were  
not returned. While Puerto Ricans vote strongly Democratic, 
Giuliani pulled in 43 percent of the Latino vote in his 1997 
re-election as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	While Puerto Ricans were split on the clemency issue, community  
observers say they are united on Vieques. And by coming out against 
the U.S. Navy in Vieques, either candidate could gain or solidify 
support among New York's 1.3 million Puerto Ricans, who make up 6 
percent of the statewide vote.

<HEADLINE> Banderas To Play Poet in New Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Spanish actor Antonio Banderas has

<HEADLINE> Homer Race, NL East Chase Shapes Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sosa vs. McGwire. Braves vs. Mets. Bring it on!  
</P>
<P>
	The NL's best races take shape starting tonight. That's when  
Mark McGwire and his 58 home runs meet Sammy Sosa and his 61 homers 
at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to having a great series. Just wait and  
see what happens,'' said Sosa, who homered Sunday as the Chicago 
Cubs beat Milwaukee 8-7 in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire warmed up for the three-game set by homering twice for  
St. Louis in a 4-3 loss to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I've done so far isn't too shabby,'' McGwire said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, Atlanta tries to hold its one-game lead in the  
NL East when New York visits Turner Field. Both teams are off 
today, then the Braves and Mets play six times in the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be fun,'' Atlanta ace Greg Maddux said.  
</P>
<P>
	Said Mets manager Bobby Valentine: ``I'm sure they know we're  
coming. Actually, I'm hoping we play them a few more times than 
six.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta beat Montreal 5-1 and New York defeated Philadelphia  
8-6. In other games, Arizona downed Florida 8-7, Pittsburgh stopped 
Cincinnati 8-5, San Diego defeated San Francisco 6-3, and Los 
Angeles beat Colorado 5-2 in a game stopped after seven innings 
because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
                     *Cubs 8, Brewers 7, 10 innings    	
</P>
<P>
	A day after becoming the first player to twice reach 60 homers,  
Sosa hit No. 61. The Cubs slugger has 13 games to challenge 
McGwire's record of 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa launched a two-run shot in the first inning. Carried by a  
16 mph wind, the ball landed on a street outside Wrigley Field, hit 
a car windshield on a bounce and wound up in a yard. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenallen Hill's fourth pinch-hit homer of the season tied it in  
the bottom of the ninth. Sosa singled in the 10th and later scored 
on Benito Santiago's single. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Astros 4, Cardinals 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Houston increased its NL Central lead to 3 1/2 games over  
Cincinnati despite McGwire's two home runs at Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire connected twice, giving him 515 career home runs -- 500  
as a first baseman. He has 62 multihomer games, tied with Hank 
Aaron and trails only Babe Ruth (72) and Willie Mays (63). 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Holt (5-13) gave up both of McGwire's homers. But Holt  
also won after seeing St. Louis beat Astros 20-game winners Jose 
Lima and Mike Hampton the previous two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Wagner got his 37th save, breaking the team record of 36  
set by Doug Jones in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Braves 5, Expos 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Millwood beat Montreal for his career-best 18th victory  
and Freddy Garcia homered in his first at-bat for host Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, acquired in a trade with Pittsburgh, replaced Brian  
Jordan in the outfield. Jordan has a sore right hand and Braves 
manager Bobby Cox admitted the cleanup hitter with 106 RBIs might 
be done for the season. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Mets 8, Phillies 6    	
</P>
<P>
	John Olerud, Mike Piazza and Roger Cedeno hit home runs that led  
New York over Philadelphia at Shea Stadium. The Mets lead 
Cincinnati by four games for the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud and Piazza, who missed Saturday's game because of a  
bruised left hand, connected for consecutive homers in the third 
inning. Cedeno had three hits, scored three runs and stole his 65th 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Rogers left with a strained left hamstring that put in  
doubt his next scheduled start for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Pirates 8, Reds 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Brian Giles hit his 38th and 39th homers as Pittsburgh withstood  
Greg Vaughn's 40th home run for Cincinnati at Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds pitchers walked eight. Pete Harnisch also broke Ed  
Sprague's left hand with a pitch, sidelining him for the season. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Diamondbacks 8, Marlins 7    	
</P>
<P>
	Arizona cut its magic number for winning the NL West to six,  
beating Florida on Matt Williams' sacrifice fly in the bottom of 
the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks, who lead the division by eight games over the  
Giants, now begin their final road trip of the season with visits 
to Colorado and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Dodgers 5, Rockies 2, 7 innings    	
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Brown overcame the 43-degree cold and the Colorado hitters  
to win at Coors Field in a game called after seven innings because 
of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown (17-8), who had lost two in a row, lowered his ERA to  
2.98. Los Angeles reliever Pedro Borbon got one out for his first 
save in the majors since 1996 with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Padres 6, Giants 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Phil Nevin's two-run single highlighted a four-run seventh  
inning and the San Diego Padres rallied to beat San Francisco for 
the second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego trailed 3-2 before rallying against Shawn Estes, who  
had beaten the Padres twice this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn hit a tying single down the right-field line. Reggie  
Sanders reached on an infield single to load the bases before 
Nevin's single to center. Eric Owens followed with an RBI 
groundout.

<HEADLINE> Ford, Microsoft To Collaborate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- New car buyers looking for a Ford will be  
able to buy exactly the car they want, using the Web to choose the 
paint color, upholstery, stereo system and other details, under a 
joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Monday upgrades Microsoft's CarPoint Web  
site so that users can have their orders matched with cars in 
dealer lots, in distribution centers or even on the factory floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a customized car is complete, the Web site user would be  
referred to a dealer, who would negotiate the price and deliver the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``CarPoint is going to change the way cars are bought and sold  
with technology that brings together manufacturers and dealers to 
deliver the services consumers want,'' said Steve Ballmer, 
Microsoft's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford would not sell cars directly online, which is forbidden by  
franchise laws. Sales would be completed through franchised 
dealers, who would make the profit on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer is driving a revolution in automotive retailing,  
and Ford intends to be at the forefront of that revolution,'' said 
Ford's CEO Jacques Nasser. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and Ford's industry dominance gives CarPoint an edge  
among the growing array of online car-buying services, such as 
AutoNation and Autobytel, which also refer customers to dealers but 
don't have alliances with manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are two important fixtures in electronic commerce and in  
our industry -- that's what makes it significant,'' said Paul 
Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers 
Association in McLean, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser said he called Microsoft CEO Bill Gates about five months  
ago to propose the joint project. He ended up speaking with 
Ballmer, who warned him that ``e-commerce works in high speed, so 
be ready to move quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Four weeks later I called and said I'm ready to move, and now  
four months later here we are,'' said Nasser. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford will take a minority stake in the joint venture with  
CarPoint and will be Microsoft's lead partner. Microsoft said it 
expects other automakers to also become involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers are seeking ties with technology companies to  
streamline distribution systems, reduce costs and inventories and 
gain access to online consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a defensive as well as offensive tool for the customer,''  
said Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers with the patience and know-how to do their own  
research can have more control over the price by using a variety of 
different Web sites to learn exactly how much it costs dealers to 
put together the car they want. Armed with this information, they 
can go to dealers themselves and make them compete with each other 
to sell them their ideal car. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web also has virtual dealerships, such as CarsDirect.com, a  
venture backed by computer executive Michael Dell that obtains cars 
from its dealer partners at wholesale prices and sells them to 
consumers online. 
</P>
<P>
	But Taylor doesn't consider brick-and-mortar dealerships to be  
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of customers still rely on the dealer for  
delivery of the car, service, information and follow up, and that 
makes the purchase of a car somewhat different,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Florida Sheriff's Dept. Wins $25M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A sheriff's department that helped in a seven-year  
money laundering probe has received half of the $50 million seized 
from a marijuana smuggler, the largest single currency seizure made 
by U.S. Customs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a culmination of several years of hard work on part of  
Customs and Monroe County Sheriff's Office,'' Customs Commissioner 
Ray Kelly said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs seized the money from Paul Hindelang in July 1998.  
Hindelang operated one of the largest marijuana smuggling 
organizations in the United States between 1975 and 1981, according 
to Customs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindelang was an associate of marijuana kingpin Julio Nasser  
David, who along with his wife Sheila Arana de Nasser amassed 
millions in drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindelang was convicted in 1981 and sentenced to 30 months in  
prison for his part in smuggling 500,000 pounds of marijuana into 
the southeastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time he agreed to forfeit all of his drug money, which he  
said totaled $640,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators discovered that Hindelang had hidden money in  
bank accounts and corporations in Panama, the Turks and Caicos 
Islands, Switzerland, the Netherlands Antilles and the Cayman 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindelang used the accounts and corporations to purchase  
property and businesses in Montana, California, Colorado, Texas, 
Oregon and Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monroe County Sheriff's Office requested half the $50  
million seized since the investigation was conducted by Customs 
agents and Monroe County deputies. By law, local law enforcement 
entities get money proportional to the work they did in a case.

<HEADLINE> Online Retailers Want To Do Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If online retailers made a to-do list for this  
holiday season, their top priority would likely be: Keep shoppers 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shopping took off last Christmas at an unexpectedly  
rapid pace, but there were lots of glitches -- from late deliveries 
to shoddy customer service -- that left consumers frustrated, 
irritated and disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as merchants big and small head into their busiest time of  
the year, they are hoping history won't repeat itself, especially 
since many spent the bulk of this year focused on improving the 
customer experience on their sites. ``They can't afford any 
mistakes if they plan to stay in the game,'' said David Baltaxe, an 
analyst of Internet commerce at Current Analysis, a research firm 
in Sterling, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year was an incredible holiday season for online merchants,  
with sales soaring well above predictions. The Web-retailing frenzy 
continued all this year, with millions of shoppers and thousands of 
businesses jumping into the fast-expanding online marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales growth is expected to accelerate this Christmas.  
Online research firm Jupiter Communications was set to announce 
Tuesday that Internet sales this holiday season will reach an 
estimated $6 billion, almost double what they were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say it's going to take a lot more this year for  
merchants to woo shoppers to their sites. The newness of the 
Internet can't alone drive sales anymore; shoppers want a 
hassle-free experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great because there are so many sites out there offering  
so many options, some I could never find in stores,'' said Jamie 
Moody, a 27-year-old from Dallas who plans to do about 25 percent 
of her holiday shopping online. ``But if I have any doubts about a 
site, I will not order from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, a recent study by online market research firm  
Bizrate.com found that Internet shoppers who have delivery troubles 
were 73 percent less likely to shop again from that merchant. 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure that last year's troubles won't haunt them again,  
online merchants have retooled their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	They've made technology upgrades to help prevent sites from  
shutting down or slowing to a crawl due to heavy demand. They've 
also added new automated capabilities, such as constant updates on 
their sites of whether products are in stock or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Many built new and bigger warehouses, so they can stock more  
goods and get them to the customers faster. Amazon.com this year 
alone is adding three million square feet of warehouse space. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we weren't able to scale to the level of volume we  
had. We couldn't guarantee that people could get their gifts by 
Christmas,'' said David Lord, chief executive of toysmart.com, an 
online toy retailer that completely overhauled its business model 
since last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we had to make big changes this year to prevent the  
same things from happening,'' he said. ``The customer isn't going 
to give us a second chance again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other merchants, including Wal-Mart and eToys, turned to outside  
companies to help store and ship their goods. In fact, demand is so 
high for these experienced facilitators, such as Fingerhut, that 
some are turning away new business. 
</P>
<P>
	As for basic customer service, many sites improved the ways that  
shoppers can reach the company if they have any question, now 
offering assistance through toll-free numbers, e-mail or live 
online chat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like in a traditional store, you should be able to turn  
around and ask a salesperson a question,'' said Bill Bass, the head 
of e-commerce at Lands' End, which just launched a live chat system 
on its site. ``And it shouldn't be hard to find that person 
online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although it's only September, the Christmas rush on the Internet  
is expected to begin earlier than in traditional stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to start soon so I'm sure I have everything in time  
for Christmas,'' said Janet Westergaard, a mother of three from Los 
Angeles who plans on doing 95 percent of her holiday shopping 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	But everyone agrees there are no guarantees that it will be a  
glitch-less holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dot-com's have spent millions this year to market and  
advertise their companies and get people to notice them,'' said the 
Internet analyst Baltaxe. ``Now it's time to prove themselves and 
some probably won't be able to.''

<HEADLINE> Hill Leaders Want F-22 Fighter Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional leaders have told lawmakers  
writing fiscal 2000 spending bills to restore money the House had 
slashed for building the Air Force's coveted F-22 stealth fighters, 
congressional aides said today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was initially unclear whether the entire $1.8 billion --  
enough to build the first six of the aircraft -- would be provided. 
But aides speaking on condition of anonymity said they expected 
that a compromise House-Senate measure financing the Pentagon next 
year would contain much if not all of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall defense bill could be ready for final congressional  
approval by the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Restoration of the funds would represent a major victory for the  
Air Force and Lockheed Martin Corp., prime contractor for the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force wants the radar-evading F-22 to be its top  
warplane for the beginning of the 21st century. It has spent nearly 
$25 billion so far developing it and has planned to spend $40 
billion more to build 339 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The House deleted the $1.8 billion after Rep. Jerry Lewis,  
R-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations defense 
subcommittee, argued that the aircraft is too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate provided the $1.8 billion, which was also  
supported by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House leaders dated Sept. 15, White House budget  
chief Jacob Lew wrote that the F-22 ``is optimized to perform a 
crucial role -- achieving air superiority early in any future 
conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican leadership's decision to provide F-22 money  
underlines their effort to remove potential clashes with President 
Clinton from spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	With fiscal 2000 beginning Oct. 1, GOP leaders want as many as  
possible of the 13 bills signed into law quickly. So far, Congress 
has completed work on just four of the measures, and administration 
officials have threatened vetoes against six of them.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Sentenced Over Leaking Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A lawyer who lied to a grand jury about  
leaking to the press taped conversations between himself and a 
murder suspect has been sentenced to four months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have an officer representing the bar calculatingly lie and  
commit perjury to the grand jury is the worst thing I can think 
of,'' U.S. District Judge Dennis Shedd told attorney Jack Duncan on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to send this message: If you commit perjury in federal  
court ... you go to jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan and client B.J. Quattlebaum were videotaped in 1995  
talking at the Lexington County Sheriff's Department. Both men 
denied being aware of the taping, but deputies said otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan was one of several people called before a federal grand  
jury during an investigation into the making of the tapes as a 
possible violation of federal wiretapping laws. At the time, he 
denied giving the tape to a television station. He later pleaded 
guilty to perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Quattlebaum was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The  
tape was not used at his trial. However, Quattlebaum has appealed, 
saying the tape was made illegally and led police to focus their 
investigation on him.

<HEADLINE> Gators' Top Receiver To Miss Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A high ankle sprain will sideline No. 3  
Florida's top receiver, Travis Taylor, for three to four weeks, 
coach Steve Spurrier said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who was injured midway through Saturday's game against  
Tennessee, has 16 catches for 244 yards and five touchdowns on the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, he was expected to be out for a week but the injury  
turned out to be worse than originally anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	With Taylor's absence, Darrell Jackson will become Florida's  
primary receiver and Alex Willis should step in as the second 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our best receiver is out for a bit and Darrell Jackson, Alex  
Willis and whoever else, could come in here and play,'' Spurrier 
said. ``I don't know who it's going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also injured in last week's game was defensive lineman Buck  
Gurley. He sprained an ankle and is questionable for Florida's game 
at Kentucky on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Extends Liberians' Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will allow  
Liberians living in the United States to remain past a Sept. 28 
deadline, an administration official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will be announced formally later this week, the  
official said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15,000 Liberians live in the United States under a  
temporary protection program first granted in 1991, when large 
numbers of people fled civil war in the African country. 
</P>
<P>
	The protected status was extended six times, but was scheduled  
to expire Sept. 28. After that, Liberian citizens would have to 
return home unless they could get a new visa or gain permanent 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration recognizes many Liberians in the United  
States under the temporary protected status have established strong 
ties in the United States,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Liberian civil war is officially ended, Liberians  
living in the United States say the country remains politically 
troubled and unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., said the White  
House plans to grant a two-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 live in Rhode Island under the current temporary  
protected status, including about 75 who marched on the state 
capital earlier this month to press their request to remain in the 
United States.

<HEADLINE> Dunleavy Says Blazers Even Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Less than a month before the NBA  
exhibition season gets under way, Mike Dunleavy says his Portland 
Trail Blazers will be even better than the team that made it to the 
Western Conference finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know there isn't a team in the league we can't beat. I  
don't expect us to be the favorites, and a lot of teams in the West 
got better,'' he said. ``But I think we got better, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His enthusiasm is shared even by one of his less admiring  
players who had complained about not getting enough playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jermaine O'Neal is approaching his 21st birthday as Dunleavy  
approaches his third season with the Blazers, and O'Neal says they 
are ready to launch a new era, professionally and personally. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his four-year, $24 million contract and three  
years of NBA experience, O'Neal says he is also on better terms 
with Dunleavy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have a personal relationship with Mike, now we are  
developing that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get to know each other a lot better. He's a  
great players' coach -- he likes to joke with you and shoot around 
with you -- but what was missing was that personal level, as far as 
getting to know the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy says the new mix of players this year -- including the  
addition of Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf -- will be good 
athletically and professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen Portland players are under contract. Some returning  
players, including Kelvin Cato and Walt Williams, have reportedly 
been in trade talks. And several -- Damon Stoudamire, Greg Anthony, 
Rasheed Wallace, Stacey Augmon, Smith, Schrempf and Cato -- worked 
out a week or so ago in front of Dunleavy in Las Vegas at a 
minicamp for NBA players and prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll have good chemistry on this team,'' Dunleavy  
said as he and his staff prepare for the start of camp, Oct. 5 in 
Tualatin, and the 18-day, eight-game exhibition schedule that will 
begin Oct. 12 in Corvallis against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said he is looking forward to getting some regular play  
this season after bouncing back faster than expected from midsummer 
surgery to remove a bone spur from his left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wants to finally get rid of the nickname ``The Kid,'' as  
he has been known since the Blazers drafted him at age 17. 
</P>
<P>
	In the process, he hopes the Blazers can do away with their  
also-ran reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time, coming in, we know we can win it all,'' O'Neal  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers led almost all the way last season in winning their  
first Pacific Division title since 1992. But it was a 
lockout-shortened, 50-game season, an exhausting race that offered 
little time to rest or practice. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the NBA will be back to its usual pace with each  
team playing 82 games in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dunleavy dismissed talk that the Blazers' success last  
season was because they had a deeper bench to play 50 games in 88 
days, and if the season had been its normal length, conflicts over 
playing time would have torn the team apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can say what they want,'' Dunleavy said. ``But I think  
we would have been just as good last season over 82 games. And I 
think our depth will pay off this season maybe more than it did 
last season.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 7, Cubs 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mark McGwire's 59th homer was the perfect way to  
end a perfect game Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Mac broke up Jon Lieber's bid with two outs in the seventh  
inning, moving McGwire within two home runs of Sammy Sosa for the 
major league lead and sparking the St. Louis Cardinals to a 7-2 
victory over the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa flied out to the wall in the first, walked, singled and  
struck out to stay at 61 homers. McGwire finished 1-for-4 in the 
opener of a three-game series at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieber struck out nine of the first 17 batters, including  
McGwire in his first two at-bats, and had retired 20 straight on a 
chilly 61-degree night. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was scoreless when McGwire cranked an 0-1 pitch over  
the center-field fence into a 16 mph wind. After that, Lieber -- 
winless in 13 starts since July 10 -- fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
	In an ensuing span of six pitches, Lieber gave up two singles  
and two-run homers to Thomas Howard and J.D. Drew. After a single 
by Marcus Jensen, Lieber (8-11) was lifted and St. Louis scored two 
more on an RBI single by Eduardo Perez and run-scoring double by 
Edgar Renteria for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit 70 homers last season to beat Sosa by four,  
broke his own record of 128 for most homers in two seasons. He now 
has 129, combining this season and last. 
</P>
<P>
	He has homered four times in his last four games.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark Thompson (1-2) allowed just four hits in six scoreless  
innings to get his first victory since April 4, 1998, when he was 
with Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Andrews hit a two-run homer in the Cubs ninth off Ricky  
Bottalico. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest the Cardinals came to a hit before McGwire's shot  
was with two outs in the sixth when Thompson hit a liner that Cubs 
first baseman Mark Grace jumped high to catch. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace had dropped Renteria's foul pop for an error leading off  
the game, but Lieber came back and retired him on a grounder. Then 
the right-hander took off, working quickly and getting help from 
home plate umpire Ian Lamplugh's liberal strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	With flashbulbs popping all over, McGwire struck out on three  
pitches in the first. Sosa sent the crowd to its feet in the bottom 
half, backing Howard to the wall in right center. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire fanned again in the third, while Sosa drew a walk in the  
fourth and singled to right in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire ran out of the Cardinals' dugout during batting practice  
and jogged out to right field to chat with Sosa. He'd planned to 
congratulate Sosa on becoming the first player to reach 60 homers 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think getting to 50 now is a piece of cake,'' McGwire  
said before Monday night's game. ``You can't name the people on one 
hand who have hit 50 homers consistently. You can't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he said Sosa's latest accomplishment deserved more attention  
than it got. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally thought when he hit 60, it should have been the  
top story on every sports television network, which it wasn't. He 
deserved it.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* McGwire has 16 homers in 22 career games against the Cubs.  
... He and Sosa have homered in the same game just three times over 
the last three seasons. ... McGwire has five homers against the 
Cubs this season and Sosa four against St. Louis. ... McGwire now 
leads Sosa by one RBI 136-135. ... Lieber has lost eight straight 
decisions. ... The crowd of 38,085 was about 2,000 short of a 
sellout.

<HEADLINE>  East Carolina Stranded by Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- East Carolina players should have  
swaggered through campus Monday, savoring the weekend's victory 
over South Carolina and their best start in a decade with No. 9 
Miami up next. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they lolled around a hotel lobby here wearing the same  
black ECU travel shirt and purple sweats they brought four days 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates are stranded, blocked from their home by Hurricane  
Floyd's flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to keep everyone's minds on football,'' East  
Carolina coach Steve Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have switched Saturday's game against Miami to  
Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh, N.C. With much of eastern North 
Carolina under water, power and drinking water are at risk in 
Greenville, N.C., and ``we didn't want to put our fans in harm's 
way or add to the burdens or recovering from the disaster that is 
all around us,'' athletics director Mike Hamrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen players were flooded out of their apartments,  
Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing we can do about, so we try not to worry so  
much,'' said sophomore quarterback David Garrard, who lives in a 
flooded complex next to the Tar River. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan has held position meetings and film sessions. He taped his  
Sunday coach's show in a hotel room. The Pirates practiced at South 
Carolina's indoor facility Monday and expect to use the weight room 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But little is routine. The team wore game jerseys to practice.  
When players asked Logan what to do about supplies like underwear, 
Logan said he told them, ``Don't worry about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soap, toothpaste and deodorant all are running low, equipment  
director Dan Glinski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates might have to stay here through Friday, school  
spokeswoman Mendy Nestor said. The East Carolina campus is closed 
until next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar was expected to peak soon, but more rain was forecast.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to think about what's up there,'' said receiver  
Arnie Powell, whose apartment also was flooded. ``We've got a game 
that's important to us and we're trying to concentrate on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glinski said South Carolina has washed East Carolina uniforms,  
opened the visitors locker room and provided video equipment so the 
Pirates can plan for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no different than what they would do for us,'' South  
Carolina coach Lou Holtz said. ``We have great compassion for them 
and what's happening up in their area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players have gotten out some, to a movie Sunday and to the  
mall on Monday. Nestor said a few had brought video games with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the players sat on hotel lobby couches Monday, the talk  
shifted quickly from flooding to football -- and maybe a little of 
that swagger. Long snapper Ryan Luckadoo wondered how many votes 
the team got in the week's college football poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many do you think we'll get if we beat Miami?'' sophomore  
Chris Nelson asked.

<HEADLINE> Tire Plant Workers OK Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Continental General Tire plant will  
recall workers starting this week after striking union employees 
approved an agreement ending the longest strike in Charlotte in 
several decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the United Steelworkers of America Local 850 voted  
876 to 289 on Sunday to ratify the contract, which will increase 
wages and pensions but allow the company to reduce its plant work 
force by about 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Union workers walked off their jobs a year ago, complaining they  
deserved compensation for concessions made to the company when the 
tire industry was struggling in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 6 1/2-year contract provides the first general wage  
increases since 1989. The contract also restores full 
cost-of-living adjustments, upgrades pensions and provides 100 
percent family health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental General Tire, meanwhile, will be able to trim its  
work force to 1,300 employees from 1,450. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to start recalling people as early as this  
week,'' said Michael Polovick, spokesman for Continental General 
Tire. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers earned an average of $17.50 per hour before the strike.  
The cost-of-living provisions, added to negotiated raises, will 
increase pay by about $2.97 per hour.

<HEADLINE> Euro Ryder Team Arrives in Boston  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The two Ryder Cup captains were posing for  
pictures on Monday when Ben Crenshaw reached over to put his hand 
on the little gold jug. 
</P>
<P>
	European captain Mark James had other ideas, though. He pulled  
the trophy away from his American counterpart, giving both men and 
their audience a big chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
	James was mostly joking, but the symbolism was clear: If  
Crenshaw wants to hold the Cup, his heavily favored Americans are 
going to have to win it this weekend at The Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much has been made about who's favored. It doesn't  
matter,'' Crenshaw said. ``Whoever is going to prevail is going to 
have the feel for this golf course. That is paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about a series of 18-hole matches. You do  
anything you can to prepare, but it's very difficult to predict at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Concorde carrying most of the European team -- some were  
already in town -- arrived at Logan International Airport at about 
10 a.m. Monday. They were greeted by Gov. Paul Cellucci and Lt. 
Gov. Jane Swift, then escorted by state troopers to a waiting bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport workers crowded the scene, first posing with the  
supersonic plane that usually lands in Boston only in emergencies -- 
the last was in 1996 -- then crowding the check-in area for the 
captains' news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	James, Cup in tow, launched into a diplomatic stump speech that  
belied the importance of golf's most pressure-packed tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we would obviously like to bring the trophy home, or  
retain it, the main purpose is to enjoy the week,'' James said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, when he was done speaking, James took the Cup away,  
leaving Crenshaw to answer questions next to an empty pedestal 
where the trophy had rested. 
</P>
<P>
	James said some of his players might ``pop up'' to the course to  
get their bearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take a few putts. Have a look around,'' he said. ``I don't  
think they'll be doing anything too stressful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two teams will play practice rounds on Tuesday, Wednesday  
and Thursday. Play begins in earnest Friday with the first of two 
days of alternate-shot and best-ball matches. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, there will be a dozen 18-hole singles matches. One  
point is awarded for each victory, and a half-point for a draw, 
with the U.S. needing 14 1/2 points to win the cup; as defending 
champion, Europe would retain the cup if it ends in a 14-14 tie.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Land Prices Fall Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Land prices in Japan fell last year for the eighth  
year in a row, and the pace of the decline accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Residential land prices fell by 2.7 percent in the 12-month  
period ending June 30, faster than the 1.4 percent drop in the 
previous year, the National Land Agency said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial land prices tumbled 6.6 percent, compared with a 5.2  
percent fall in the previous 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese land prices have been falling steadily since the late  
1980s. Companies are still struggling to dispose of bad real estate 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall in the price of land over the past year was most  
pronounced in big cities. Residential land prices fell at a faster 
pace in all large cities, while commercial land prices fell at a 
faster pace in most of them. 
</P>
<P>
	In the greater Tokyo area, residential land prices tumbled 7.3  
percent, compared with 4.4 percent in the previous 12-month period.

<HEADLINE> Rain for Floyd-Stricken Southeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- More rain expected tonight could worsen the  
North Carolina flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd that already is 
blamed for billions in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials today said 1,500 people remained stranded by the  
high water. Throughout the weekend, 1,000 or more others had been 
rescued from rooftops by helicopters and boats. 
</P>
<P>
	The flooding has virtually shut down the eastern third of North  
Carolina -- an area twice as big as the state of Vermont --with towns 
inundated and highways blocked by high water. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 29 people were confirmed dead and others were missing  
after 20 inches of rain inundated North Carolina's coastal plain. 
They were among 55 deaths blamed on the huge storm on its path from 
the Bahamas into New England. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton arrived in Tarboro to tour the flooded area  
today, accompanied by the Federal Emergency Management Agency head, 
James Lee Witt, and announced federal programs to help farmers and 
others weather the devastation. Clinton already had declared the 
eastern two-thirds of the state a disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
	Looting was reported in Duplin and Hertford counties, and  
Ahoskie police asked for help with security. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar River was falling slowly at Tarboro after cresting at 24  
feet above flood stage, but the town and other areas were under a 
new flood watch through tonight, with 2 inches or more of rain 
possible from an incoming cold front and moisture from Tropical 
Storm Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the last thing anyone wanted to hear at Tarboro High  
School, where 2,000 people have been sheltered, some since Thursday 
when Floyd began dumping torrential rain on its run up the East 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't want to see it because there's nothing I can do  
about it,'' said James Roscoe of Princeville after picking out a 
pair of rain boots and a clean shirt from among donated clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami  
said today it was possible that most of Harvey's rainfall could 
stay offshore from North Carolina. ``We're going to have to wait 
and see on that,'' said meteorologist Todd Kimberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	The bloated Neuse River started rising into the downtown area of  
Kinston today and National Guardsmen were sent to help evacuate Red 
Cross workers from a hotel. Officials were warning downtown 
merchants they also might have to leave if the river backs up 
behind a downtown bridge, said Carolyn Dunn, a spokeswoman for the 
city of 26,000. 
</P>
<P>
	State emergency management officials have said damage may exceed  
the $6 billion total for Hurricane Fran in 1996. Sen. John Edwards, 
D-N.C., said Sunday he will seek $1 billion in relief just for 
stricken farms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have thousands and thousands of people who will  
be homeless, and they'll be homeless for a long time,'' said Steve 
Glenn, deputy operations chief of the state Emergency Operations 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding, power and telephone outages and a lack of drinking  
water remain serious problems from the Carolinas to upstate New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, tens of thousands of people were in a fifth day  
today with little or no water in their homes. With one of its 
plants shut down, the Elizabethtown Water Co. asked businesses to 
shut off water and even told residents how many times to use the 
toilet before flushing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad to get any water,'' said Helen Kindon of Edison,  
N.J., one of hundreds who lined up for bottled water Sunday. 
``Brushing my teeth is very difficult. Cooking is hard; you can't 
rinse anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Tarboro, the Tar River was falling slowly after cresting at  
24 feet above flood stage. But it will peak today in Greenville, an 
already flooded community of 44,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is figuring out their own survival,'' Carl Campbell  
said as the river inched closer to his home. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to rescues, National Guard helicopters are being  
used to deliver food to stricken towns whose grocery shelves are 
bare, and drinkable water is being rushed to counties where 
wastewater treatment systems have failed and tap water is 
undrinkable. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 300 roads, including parts of Interstates 95 and 40,  
remained closed Sunday, and 6,400 people were in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	In southeastern North Carolina, the Waccamaw, Cape Fear and  
Lumber rivers also have risen to record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is certain when streets with submerged cars and homes  
will recede or how long the flood refugees will be homeless, but 
people are eager to get back to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to get it together,'' said James Moore, who has been  
at a shelter since Thursday. ``I ain't trying to make this my 
home.''

<HEADLINE> Waco Investigator Tours Siege Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- The former Republican senator investigating  
the possibility of an official cover-up after the 1993 Branch 
Davidian siege toured the site Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	John C. Danforth, former senator from Missouri, made his first  
trip to the scene where David Koresh died in a fire along with 
about 80 followers. 
</P>
<P>
	Danworth, 64, flew over the site in a helicopter before landing  
near the former compound, Fox News reported on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy assistant investigator Ed Dowd, McLennan County Sheriff  
Jack Harwell and a handful of local deputies accompanied him. 
Danforth walked around the Mount Carmel site 10 miles east of Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to get a feel for what it's like out here,'' Dowd  
told Fox. ``He came to check out the scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno tapped Danforth to head an  
independent inquiry into the actions of law enforcement during the 
deadly raid on the compound after it was learned that the FBI used 
potentially incendiary tear gas during the final day of the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau had denied the use of such devices for years.  
</P>
<P>
	Government officials maintain that Branch Davidians, not federal  
agents, set the deadly fire on April 19, 1993.

<HEADLINE> Bob Barker Recovering After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An operation on game show host Bob Barker  
``went very well,'' says his surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker underwent surgery Monday to relieve a blocked artery. He  
will probably remain hospitalized through the end of the week, said 
his doctor, neurosurgeon Anthony Caputy of George Washington 
University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker, 75, was admitted to the hospital Thursday after  
complaining of clumsiness in his right hand. Tests revealed his 
left carotid artery was 85 percent blocked, a condition his doctors 
said is common in people his age. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker underwent a procedure in which the artery is opened and  
the blockage cleared. His doctors said 40,000 people have the 
procedure each year. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime animal rights activist, Barker was in Washington to  
lobby for a bill that would ban circuses from using elephants. 
</P>
<P>
	His illness is not expected to interfere with production of  
``The Price Is Right.'' Barker been host of the program since 1972. 
A spokesman said the show is taped well in advance.

<HEADLINE> Rolls-Royce To Buy Vickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Aircraft engine-maker Rolls-Royce PLC has reached  
an agreement to buy Britain's Vickers PLC for about $933 million, 
saying it wants to become a leading world manufacturer of marine 
power systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Vickers' board has approved the deal, which was disclosed  
Monday. The deal requires approval by shareholders of both 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Vickers shares soared on the offer which valued each share at a  
53 percent premium on Friday's closing price. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading Vickers, the biggest gainer on the London Stock  
Exchange, rose 79 pence to 245 pence, or $3.97. Rolls-Royce slipped 
4 pence to 222 pence, or $3.60. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acquisition has powerful industrial and financial logic,''  
Rolls-Royce said in a statement. ``The principal attraction for 
Rolls-Royce in acquiring Vickers is the creation of a global leader 
in marine power systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vickers' products include Challenger tanks, the British army's  
main battle tank, motor vehicle and defense systems and components 
for gas turbines. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolls-Royce makes marine power systems, as well as aircraft  
engines. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal goes through, Vickers non-executive chairman, Sir  
Colin Chandler, will join the board of Rolls-Royce as a 
non-executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Vickers sold Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. -- a separate  
company from the jet engine-maker -- to Volkswagen AG of Germany.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Sentenced Over Leaking Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A lawyer who lied to a grand jury about  
leaking to the press taped conversations between himself and a 
murder suspect was sentenced to four months in prison on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have an officer representing the bar calculatingly lie and  
commit perjury to the grand jury is the worst thing I can think 
of,'' U.S. District Judge Dennis W. Shedd told attorney Jack 
Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to send this message: If you commit perjury in federal  
court ... you go to jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan and client B.J. Quattlebaum were videotaped in 1995  
talking at the Lexington County Sheriff's Department. Both men 
denied being aware of the taping, but deputies said otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan was one of several people called before a federal grand  
jury during an investigation into the making of the tapes as a 
possible violation of federal wiretapping laws. At the time, he 
denied giving the tape to a television station. He later pleaded 
guilty to perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Quattlebaum was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The  
tape was not used at his trial. However, Quattlebaum has appealed, 
saying the tape was made illegally and led police to focus their 
investigation on him.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Moves From Projects to Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A skinny nerd with a genius IQ, Janet McDonald felt  
like an outsider in the New York housing projects she still calls 
home, and later in the mainly white domain of American corporate 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a successful lawyer in Paris, McDonald has written about her  
struggle to reconcile two opposing worlds in a new memoir, 
``Project Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her experience recalls those of other talented  
African-Americans: jazz singers Josephine Baker and Billie 
Holliday, novelists James Baldwin and Richard Wright, who all fled 
America for Europe, where they blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paris is where Americans, especially African Americans, have  
always come to begin again,'' McDonald, 45, said in an interview. 
``I feel more human, not like some black object the way I felt in 
the United States, where you're objectified by race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Project Girl,'' published by Farrar, Strauss, Giroux,  
McDonald recounts a struggle ``marred by spectacular failures and 
salvaged by unlikely comebacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite rape, arson and drugs, the daughter of a postal worker  
managed to earn degrees from Vassar, Columbia University School of 
Journalism and New York University School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, McDonald's well-cut pant suit cultivates a corporate  
image. But when she takes off the jacket, the imposing tattoo of a 
roaring lion spread across her shoulder tells another story. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year old tattoo is a reminder, McDonald said, of the  
anger that nearly derailed her journey from the housing projects 
where she grew up in the New York borough of Brooklyn, to an 
apartment overlooking the Eiffel Tower, where she lives today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw that lion, with its mouth wide open, and I knew I had to  
have it,'' she said. ``It was who I was at the time. But it's still 
a part of who I am today. I like it and I don't plan to have it 
removed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald was the only one of seven children in her family who  
shined academically. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody I knew as a kid is either on drugs or dead,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When she goes home nowadays, she calls ahead to have someone  
meet her. ``People don't know me anymore. They just think I'm some 
well-dressed, wealthy person who's gotten lost,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The book has turned her into something of a hero at home.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt scorned and rejected as a nerd in my youth, and now I  
... belong in a way I never did,'' she said. ``They cheer me on, 
'Hey, you're representing us.''' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald said she wanted the memoir to show a different side of  
the projects and to inspire minority youths drawn into the downward 
spiral of drugs and teen-age pregnancies. The book, to be released 
in paperback early next year, is being considered for use in New 
York City high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trauma -- it's all in the book,'' McDonald said. ``It's  
like a little bundle I'd like to leave behind so I can move on. I 
suppose I'm taking it with me, but at least, it's not taking me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a teen-ager, she hobnobbed with militants who condemned the  
white military-industrial complex, skipped class and let her grades 
slip. 
</P>
<P>
	She finished high school at 16, not even knowing she should have  
applied to college before graduation. She rebounded and went on to 
Vassar with a junior year in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's severest trauma came when she was raped in her dorm  
room while a student at Cornell University law school. 
</P>
<P>
	A whirl of neurotic episodes followed, including a suicide  
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, she was caught lighting fires in the dormitory at  
New York University law school, where she had transferred. After a 
journalism degree and much therapy, she was readmitted to NYU. 
</P>
<P>
	Her choice to live abroad, she said, may well be a way of opting  
out of her lifelong ``struggle to belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes to quit law someday to write full time and has just  
completed a young adult novel about an unwed teen-age mother who 
competes in a spelling bee to earn scholarship money for college. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Spelling Bee'' will be published next year.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, she's working on a new book, ``Paris Girl'' -- a book  
that she said ``strips away the stereotypes like the great fresh 
vegetables and great wines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be about the Paris you see on post cards, but about  
the multiracial, multiethnic city where real people like me live.''

<HEADLINE> Supremacist Guilty in Drag Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A second white supremacist was convicted  
Monday in the dragging death of a black man whose gruesome end 
shocked the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Russell Brewer, 32, could get the death penalty for  
murdering James Byrd Jr. in the town of Jasper last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury of 11 whites and one Hispanic took just four hours to  
reach a verdict. Standing with his lawyers, Brewer showed no 
reaction. The judge had admonished spectators against any show of 
emotion. There was none. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury returned immediately to begin hearing testimony on  
whether Brewer should be sentenced to life in prison or death. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in the punishment phase was set to continue Tuesday  
and Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said he did not 
anticipate the case returning to the jury until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever they come up with we will accept that, of course,''  
Mary Verrett, Byrd's sister, said after emerging from the 
courthouse. ``I want to see the ultimate penalty ... I can't begin 
to describe how good we feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's former prison buddy John William King, 24, has been on  
death row since his February conviction in Byrd's slaying. A third 
man, Shawn Allen Berry, also 24, is awaiting trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they believe the three men killed Byrd to  
promote their fledgling white supremacist organization -- the 
Confederate Knights of America -- and initiate Berry into the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying was one of the grisliest racial crimes since the  
civil rights era. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the death penalty but that's what he deserves.  
The just punishment for this case and these facts and circumstances 
is death,'' Gray said after the verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's attorneys had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the first trial, the case against Brewer was moved out of  
Jasper, 150 miles away, after the defense argued that the people of 
Jasper would be inclined to convict to redeem their small town in 
the eyes of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, sometimes sobbing, testified last week that he was with  
King and Berry when Byrd, 49, was chained by the ankles to the 
bumper of Berry's pickup and dragged for three miles along a rutted 
logging road and a bumpy asphalt route. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Brewer, he climbed inside the truck cab, smoked a  
cigarette and didn't realize Berry had chained Byrd to the back of 
the truck until they began driving. Brewer said he was convinced 
Byrd had died when Berry slashed his throat with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	But a pathologist testified there was no evidence of a knife  
wound and no knife was found. Byrd was alive until his head was 
torn off when it slammed into a culvert, the pathologist said. And 
DNA evidence showed Byrd's blood on the shoes of all three men. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there is a pattern of deceit,'' Gray said in his  
closing argument Monday. ``Russell Brewer crafted his defense to 
stay just short of a capital offense. He's not afraid of the 
penitentiary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order to find Brewer guilty of capital murder, the jury was  
required to decide that Brewer helped kidnap Byrd as well as murder 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's attorney, Doug Barlow, had told the jury: ``If you  
think Russell was up here trying to concoct a story, don't you 
think he would have concocted a story that would have made him much 
less culpable?''

<HEADLINE> No Changes Forseen in OPEC Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Consumers could pay more to heat their  
homes and drive their cars this winter, with worldwide demand for 
petroleum products rising and OPEC members showing little sign of 
budging beyond their reduced levels of oil production. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  
are expected to stick by their most recent round of production cuts 
when they meet Wednesday in Vienna, Austria. OPEC produces more 
than 26 million barrels of crude each day, almost two-fifths of the 
world's total. 
</P>
<P>
	At its last meeting in March, the group agreed together with key  
non-OPEC producers to slash daily production by 2.1 million 
barrels, or 2.6 percent of the global supply, in an effort to buoy 
prices from 12-year lows. The agreement extends through March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil ministers arriving on Monday reiterated their commitment to  
OPEC's current output levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am in favor of keeping the cuts until April 1, 2000,''  
Libyan Oil Minister Abdalla Salem El-Badri told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, oil minister of Kuwait, said that  
global oil inventories were still too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a possibility of an extension in the cuts beyond March  
2000,'' al-Sabah said. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC has displayed uncommon unity since its last meeting. Unlike  
the past, when members of the cartel routinely produced beyond 
their assigned quotas, OPEC's compliance with this year's 
production cuts has been high, peaking at 92 percent in August, 
according to the International Energy Agency in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	That has helped drive up prices. Contracts for U.S. benchmark  
West Texas Intermediate crude oil are trading in New York at nearly 
$25 per barrel, more than double the year's low price of $11.26 set 
on Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Average pump prices for a gallon of gasoline in the United  
States stood at nearly $1.32 a gallon this month, up from less than 
$1 in February, according to the Lundberg survey of 10,000 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil prices in the United States are expected to average  
about $1.04 per gallon this winter, up from 80 cents per gallon 
last year, the U.S. government estimated earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	These higher prices could tempt some in OPEC to pump more oil  
than their quotas allow. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, however, ministers from several of the 11  
member countries have expressed support for continued restraint, 
and none has objected to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, industry analysts expect that this week's meeting  
will not lead to any immediate changes in output. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be wrong for them to change their production quota  
simply because of this sharp rise in price. That would be a 
knee-jerk reaction,'' says Mark Redway, an analyst with the 
London-based brokerage Greig Middleton and Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC aims to keep oil prices stable at a high level, and any  
increase in production would risk triggering a new round of 
volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they have to do to stabilize prices is keep to their cuts  
until they feel stockpiles have come down to an appropriate 
level,'' Redway argues. 
</P>
<P>
	Global oil stockpiles are expected to fall as temperatures cool  
and seasonal needs for heating oil increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand should rise due to economic recovery in Asia and to a  
lesser extent, Brazil, said Deborah White an analyst with the 
International Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	White foresees global demand rising by 5 million barrels per day  
to create a total daily demand of 78 million barrels by the first 
quarter of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Upward pressure on prices for crude and refined products should  
grow accordingly. Charlie Sharp of the brokerage T. Hoare Canaccord 
predicts that the price for North Sea Brent crude in London could 
peak this autumn at $25 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we wouldn't expect that to be sustained for the rest of  
the year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As oil prices go up, there will be more and more temptation  
for OPEC countries to bust quotas, and there will be more and more 
oil coming in from non-OPEC countries as well,'' Canaccord said. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC's members are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela, the United  
Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Indonesia 
and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela recently proposed setting up a mechanism to regulate  
prices for the benefit of all producers. It wants OPEC countries to 
adjust production whenever prices approach either extreme of a 
predetermined band. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC ministers are expected to discuss the idea in Vienna, but  
some analysts doubt it could ever work in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to target any price,'' says Leo Drollas,  
chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know enough about oil supplies -- about oil demand --  
on a monthly basis. ... So you'd be flying in the dark most of the 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Trump Vs. The Buchanan Brigade? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He's got the money. He appeals to women -- of  
the supermodel variety at least. And with his moniker splashed in 
gold across sky-high buildings, Donald Trump has the name ID for a 
presidential run. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other corner in this most unlikely of matchups is Pat  
Buchanan, the family values conservative who has made running for 
president something of a moral crusade every four years. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a slugfest worthy of one of Trump's casinos.  
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps we need Don King to moderate?'' said Maurice Carroll,  
a political analyst with the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute. 
``Both of these guys are showmen. They like the attention ... and 
they're both smart. I wouldn't want to get in their way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Buchanan flirts with defecting to the Reform Party to run  
for president, saying he's feeling abandoned by a GOP that's too 
close to the center, Trump has a top aide in Washington researching 
the cost and feasibility of getting on the 41 state ballots that 
don't have permanent spots for Reform Party candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump has the Reform Party's highest-elected official, Minnesota  
Gov. Jesse Ventura, urging him to run. Buchanan has Republicans 
praying he won't or he may take conservative votes from the GOP to 
the benefit of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, Trump challenged Buchanan's provocative comments  
on Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Third Reich like a 
candidate-in-waiting. Buchanan argues in a new book that Hitler was 
not a direct threat to the United States after 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	But could Trump really be thinking of running for president? He  
may have to work at his populist touch. In his biography ``Trump: 
The Art of the Comeback,'' The Donald describes how he loathes 
shaking hands, because hands are crawling with germs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a bad custom,'' he says in the book.  
</P>
<P>
	He's no fan of the double kiss either.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing so phony,'' he told The New York Times  
recently. ``You usually end up knocking heads or noses. And it's 
disgusting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless,'' he added slyly, ``the woman is attractive.''  
</P>
<P>
	Now picture The Donald working a campaign rope line of your  
average Americans or kissing babies. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's his flamboyant and well-documented personal life.  
Since divorcing Marla Maples, the woman who ended his first 
marriage to Ivana, Trump appears in gossip pages with a rotating 
array of gorgeous models on his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was that infamous New York Post headline quoting  
Ms. Maples, then his girlfriend, trumpeting her trysts with him as 
the ``Best Sex I've Ever Had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's press clippings, in which he rails against abortion,  
homosexuality and premarital sex, are equally controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump characterized a potential match this way on Monday: ``As  
much as I like Pat, it would be nasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said on CNN's ``Crossfire'' on Monday that he  
personally likes Trump. What does bother him is the role money is 
playing in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're becoming a plutocracy,'' Buchanan said. ``You've got  
$200 million, $100 million candidates.''

<HEADLINE>  Rockies Name O'Dowd As New GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Vowing to put a championship team on the field  
every season, Dan O'Dowd was introduced as general manager of the 
Colorado Rockies on Monday, concluding a month-long search. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old O'Dowd is considered one of the brightest young  
executives in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	He was assistant general manager of the Cleveland Indians from  
1993-98 but was out of baseball this season as he pursued a goal of 
becoming a major league general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, O'Dowd was the Indians' director of player  
development from 1988-92, overseeing a farm system that included 
the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, now the Rockies' Triple-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan had a big role in building a consistent winner in  
Cleveland,'' Rockies chairman Jerry McMorris said. ``Now, we want 
to bring that winning attitude to Colorado. We feel Dan was clearly 
the best candidate to move this organization to the levels we want 
to achieve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd, who signed a five-year contract, replaces Bob Gebhard,  
the Rockies' original general manager who resigned under pressure 
on Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very exciting situation to come into,'' O'Dowd said  
at a news conference. ``The stability of this organization is a 
plus in my mind. The tremendous fan support, this facility (Coors 
Field) and a solid foundation have already been laid here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal, very simply, is to put a championship-contending  
club on the field each and every year. I come from a winning 
background, and I think I know what it takes to win. We will raise 
the level of expectations internally in this organization. We will 
be hard-working, we will be smart and we will be creative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in Colorado Springs for five years, and so I kind of got  
a feel for what altitude ball is all about. I feel pretty good 
about my background coming in here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During O'Dowd's tenure in Cleveland, the Indians won four  
straight AL Central titles (1995-98) and advanced to the World 
Series in 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Indians' director of player development, he cultivated  
such future All-Stars as Charles Nagy, Manny Ramirez, Jeff Shaw and 
Jim Thome. During that period, the Sky Sox advanced to the Pacific 
Coast League playoffs four straight seasons (1989-92) and won the 
league championship in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Indians, O'Dowd worked five years for the  
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	The underachieving Rockies stood at 67-83 and in last place in  
the NL West. With just two weeks left in the season and with 
manager Jim Leyland having announced his intention to resign after 
the season, O'Dowd faces some immediate challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	He denied that Leyland's resignation signals a red flag, saying,  
``It really was not a concern of mine. I think Jim made a decision 
based on his own set of parameters, whatever they were. I think 
this (manager) is a jewel of a job, and I think this is a jewel of 
a ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd planned to report for work in Denver early next week.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the next few days I'll make decisions about staff,'' he  
said. ``I think there are good people here. Some of them may need 
to be shifted to other areas to maximize their skills. I also have 
people I've worked with in the past that I may look to bring in 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other candidates to interview for the job were Gary  
Hughes, the Rockies' vice president of player personnel, and Omar 
Minaya, assistant general manager of the New York Mets.

<HEADLINE> New Life for Watson on Senior Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Tom Watson had to wait three years before winning  
on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	He needed all of two tournaments to win on the Senior Tour.  
</P>
<P>
	Watson shot a 10-under 62 Sunday to shatter a day-old course  
record at the Bent Tree Country Club to win the $1.3 million Bank 
One Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The ease of his five-stroke victory surprised even him. He was  
tied for the lead going into Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had to shoot low. And I hadn't shot a low round in a  
long time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson was a tour rookie in 1971, and he didn't win his first  
event until he took the 1974 Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his last PGA Tour event in 1998, the Colonial in Fort  
Worth, at age 48. He joined the Senior Tour ranking sixth on the 
all-time money-winning list. Watson has now become the 
third-youngest winner ever on the 50-and-older tour -- and banked a 
$195,000 winner's check in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The 62 broke Watson's PGA Tour career low of 63, which he had  
accomplished three times, and beat Hale Irwin's course record of 
9-under 63 set on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, who finished 12th in the tournament, has 25 Senior Tour  
victories, three behind Lee Trevino for the most on the tour. He 
warned that Watson's quick success doesn't mean he will dominate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom Watson is a great player, but he has done nothing to  
change my perspective,'' Irwin said. ``I'm not going to jump on the 
wagon where we're all playing for second place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for one day, Watson can feel the thrill of being the hot  
young gun on the tour again, having beaten the tour's best as the 
top 11 players on the money list were in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	While Watson entered the tour, a founding father of the Senior  
PGA Tour was retiring from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Don January announced his retirement after shooting a 6-over 78  
on his hometown course. He shot an 8-over 80 opening round on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who won the first of Senior PGA Tour event in 1980, then  
22 more, said his game was no longer competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any regrets about retiring. The only thing is I  
wish I'd done it sooner. I didn't think I'd stay out here until I 
was shooting 80,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 70-year-old links veteran won his first PGA Tour event 43  
years ago when he won the 1956 Dallas Centennial Open.

<HEADLINE> Dad Severely Burned Retrieving Toy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONROVIA, Calif. (AP) -- A father trying to retrieve his child's  
toy from a power pole was shocked and seriously burned as his four 
children looked on, a fire official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, whose identity was not released, suffered second- and  
third-degree burns to 65 percent of his body on Sunday. He was in 
critical condition this morning at Torrance Memorial Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old man climbed a power pole outside his home to  
retrieve a toy rocket and parachute. He was using another pole to 
try to free the toy when he was shocked, city fire Battalion Chief 
Sam DiGiovanna said. 
</P>
<P>
	The electrical current set his clothes ablaze. The man lost his  
hold and fell from the pole but became entangled in a metal step 
and dangled until a witness took off his own shirt and tried to 
smother the flames, DiGiovanna said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had four of his children -- three sons and one daughter --  
sitting in the truck in the back when it happened,'' witness Scott 
Dowell said. ``They all got out. Actually, one of the sons climbed 
up on the fence and was trying to help his dad. It's just a 
horrible, horrible situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man's fall set shrubbery on fire where he landed but the  
fire was quickly doused, DiGiovanna said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monrovia is 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE>  Hundreds Die in Taiwan Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The strongest quake in Taiwan in decades  
jolted the island early Tuesday, wrecking a 12-story hotel in 
Taipei, destroying more than 100 homes islandwide and killing at 
least 269 people, the government said. About 1,000 people were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.6 and was centered 90  
miles south-southwest of Taipei, the U.S. Geological Survey's 
National Earthquake Information Center said. It also issued 
warnings of possible tsunamis, or huge waves that sometimes follow 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The temblor was about the same strength as the devastating one  
that struck Turkey on Aug. 17, killing more than 15,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, the island nation's capital, the quake wrecked the  
78-room Sungshan Hotel, collapsing the bottom stories and setting 
the badly damaged top listing to one side. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire crews turned hoses on the wreckage as smoke poured from  
fires raging in several destroyed rooms. Sixty people were still 
feared trapped in the building, with 49 people already evacuated 
and sent to the hospital and another 11 people evacuated uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman pulled from the wreckage urged rescuers to look for more  
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hurry, go rescue people. They're in there. They're inside,''  
said the unidentified woman, who was dressed in street clothes and 
did not appear to be injured. ``I lived on the ninth floor, but now 
it's the fourth floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 50 people were reported injured when a 12-story  
apartment building collapsed in the Taipei suburb of Hsinchuang. An 
estimated 100 others were still trapped within the building, which 
collapsed onto a neighboring five-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan Television showed collapsed four-story residential  
buildings in the central city of Taichung, but gave no figures for 
dead or injured there. Water poured from ruptured mains and 
distraught residents squatted with their heads in their hands as 
rescuers helped apparently unhurt survivors from the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Severe damage was reported in the town of Puli near the quake  
epicenter, but details were sketchy. An explosion was reported at 
the town's major business, a rice wine distillery, and scores of 
buildings suffered damage, the Broadcasting Corporation of China 
said. No casualty figures were immediately available there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Ministry's disaster management center reported 269  
dead and about 1,000 injured islandwide. Hundreds more people were 
reported trapped under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said he and Mrs. Clinton were  
``saddened'' by news of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in touch directly with the Taiwan authorities to  
determine what assistance from the United States may be needed,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's quake was Taiwan's worst since a 7.4-magnitude one hit  
the island in 1935, killing 3,276 people. Taiwan is jolted by 
dozens of quakes each year, but most are centered in the Pacific 
Ocean east of the island and rarely cause damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest quake struck at about 1:45 a.m., while most of  
Taiwan's 22 million people were sleeping. It knocked out electric 
service throughout the northern part of the island. State radio 
said the initial quake was followed by six aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
	After the temblor, people made their way into the streets from  
damaged buildings, some wearing only underwear, some in 
nightclothes. Some appeared dazed, but others quickly recovered 
from the sudden awakening. A few waved from damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Dirk Kempthorne, the governor of Idaho who is visiting Taipei on  
an Asian trade mission, said he was sleeping in a top-floor room in 
the 25-story Grant Hyatt Regency in Taipei when the earthquake hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been through quite an experience,'' Kempthorne said by  
telephone from the street outside the hotel. ``I think many of us 
thought we might be done for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kempthorne said the quake began as a gentle swaying, ``and then  
it increased in intensity until you were virtually thrown from the 
bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou announced schools and offices would be  
closed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In southwestern Taipei, some people brought candles into the  
street. Many carried umbrellas to stay out of the rain, huddling 
around battery-operated radios. 
</P>
<P>
	Rern-Wei Cheng, a visitor to Taipei from California, said he was  
watching television with his family when the earthquake struck. 
``When I first felt the quake, I thought of a Turkish friend who 
went back to Turkey to visit his family when the earthquake hit 
there. ... We were all frightened and we hid under the kitchen 
table.'' No one in the family was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information  
Center said the quake prompted tsunami warnings for Taiwan, Japan, 
the Philippines, Yap, Guam, and Palau.

<HEADLINE> Yanks, Tribe Hold AL's Best Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees have alternated trips  
to the last four World Series. That pattern might end if the 
defending champion Yankees keep this up. 
</P>
<P>
	New York took three of four in Cleveland this weekend, blowing a  
6-0 lead Sunday before coming back with four runs in the ninth for 
an 11-7 victory. The win left the teams tied for the league's best 
record at 90-59. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians won the AL pennant in 1995 and again in `97, when  
they beat the Yankees in the first round of the playoffs. New York 
won it all in 1996 and `98, using an ALCS victory over Cleveland to 
springboard to its 24th championship. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Indians already clinched their fifth straight AL  
Central title, the Yankees maintained a three-game lead over Boston 
in the East with 13 games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went 5-2 on the trip after losing the first game and we had  
to,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``After that win Tuesday 
night in Toronto (trailing 6-1 in the eighth), I have felt 
comfortable with this team. You can't ask for anything more than 
coming in here and winning three of four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other AL games, it was Boston 7, Detroit 3; Chicago 3,  
Toronto 2; Tampa Bay 15, Texas 2; Oakland 12, Kansas City 3; 
Seattle 2, Minnesota 1; and Baltimore 5, Anaheim 4. 
</P>
<P>
	New York built a 6-0 lead after four innings against rookie Jim  
Brower, making his first start, before the Indians began knocking 
around Yankees starter David Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was frustrating, then rewarding, then frustrating,''  
Indians manager Mike Hargrove said. ``We came back against a great 
pitcher and a great ballclub, and to give it up the way we did was 
frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no message to send. If I wanted to send them a  
message, I'll write Joe a letter. Once you get to the postseason, 
you throw it all out the window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Watson (4-1) got the win in relief and Mariano Rivera  
pitched the ninth. Rivera has not allowed a run in 21 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Girardi's two-run single capped New York's four-run ninth  
and Bernie Williams and rookie D'Angelo Jimenez each went 4-for-5. 
</P>
<P>
	With the score tied 7-7, Williams opened the ninth with a double  
off Tom Martin (0-1). One out later, pinch-hitter Tino Martinez was 
intentionally walked before Jorge Posada slapped an RBI single to 
left off Paul Shuey. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez added an RBI double before Girardi singled in two more.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thome and Richie Sexson hit back-to-back homers in the  
fourth, and Manny Ramirez hit a 471-foot shot in the fifth for the 
Indians, giving them a 7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone was tagged for six hits and seven runs in 4 2-3 innings and  
remained winless since Aug. 8, a span of seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
	New York won the season series 7-3.  
</P>
<P>
                         *Red Sox 7, Tigers 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Fenway Park, Boston kept pace with the Yankees as Nomar  
Garciaparra and Trot Nixon homered to complete a three-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Wakefield (6-10) allowed just four hits in 5 2-3 innings,  
but three were solo homers. He walked one and struck out three for 
only his second win in seven starts since May 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's fourth straight loss ended Dave Mlicki's (13-11)  
eight-game win streak, the Tigers' longest since Doyle Alexander in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Encarnacion homered twice for the Tigers -- the first  
multi-homer game of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra went 9-for-12 in the series, including homers in the  
last two games, to raise his league-leading batting average to 
.360. 
</P>
<P>
                       *White Sox 3, Blue Jays 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Toronto, Brian Simmons' three-run homer gave Chicago four  
straight wins and handed the Blue Jays their fifth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, who hit a three-run homer in the second inning of  
Friday's 7-3 win, homered again in the second for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Sirotka (10-13) allowed two runs and four hits in seven  
innings. Roy Halladay (8-7) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Devil Rays 15, Rangers 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Arlington, Texas, Fred McGriff, Bubba Trammell and Jose  
Guillen homered as Rangers starter John Burkett (7-8) and reliever 
Mike Morgan gave up 10 runs on nine hits in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	McGriff reached the 30-homer mark for the eighth time, becoming  
the second player to hit 30 for four different teams, joining 
teammate Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
	Trammell went 3-for-5 with four RBIs and Tony Graffanino had a  
pair of RBI doubles for the Devil Rays, who tied a club record for 
runs scored set earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolando Arrojo (6-11) got the win.  
</P>
<P>
                       *Athletics 12, Royals 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Jason Giambi and Miguel Tejada both homered and drove in three  
runs in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	A sparse crowd of 13,914 saw the A's remain 4 1/2 games behind  
Boston for the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Chavez, in his first game back from the disabled list,  
drove in two runs to support Gil Heredia (13-7). 
</P>
<P>
	Sal Fasano and Mike Sweeney each homered for the Royals, who  
have lost five of six in Oakland. Reliever Chris Fussell (0-5) took 
the loss. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Twins 2, Mariners 1    	
</P>
<P>
	At Seattle, LaTroy Hawkins became Minnesota's second  
double-digit winner as the Twins won on Cristian Guzman's sacrifice 
fly in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins (10-13) allowed five hits in 7 2-3 innings, walked two  
and struck out five in beating Jamie Moyer (14-7), who pitched his 
fourth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Orioles 5, Angels 4    	
</P>
<P>
	Pinch-hitter Derrick May's two-run homer in the eighth inning  
sent Baltimore to its 11th straight victory -- the Orioles' longest 
such streak since winning 13 in a row in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Conine singled with two outs in the eighth off Lou Pote.  
Troy Percival (4-5) relieved and May lined his first pitch over the 
left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken Jr. singled his first three times up and moved to  
2,990 career hits. He has 14 games remaining to reach 3,000 this 
season.

<HEADLINE> EU Demands U.S. Drop Tax Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union on Monday demanded  
the United States drop an export support program for U.S. companies 
within the next 12 months, after a World Trade Organization ruling 
upheld EU claims that the program constitutes an unfair tax break. 
</P>
<P>
	``The European Commission calls on the U.S. to abolish the  
system by Oct. 1, 2000,'' said Gunnar Wiegand, foreign policy 
spokesman for the EU's executive body. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU said a WTO ruling Friday accepted European complaints  
against the so-called Foreign Sales Corporation program, which 
grants tax relief to U.S. corporations exporting through offshore 
subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiegand said the program covers $250 billion in exports and  
represents an unfair subsidy of $2.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said they hadn't yet reached a decision on  
whether to appeal the WTO decision. Speaking on condition of 
anonymity, they said a decision would be taken only after the WTO 
ruling is official released Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporate welfare program that grants tax relief to U.S.  
firms exporting through offshore subsidiaries, mostly located in 
the Virgin Islands, Barbados and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU says U.S. firms get 64 percent corporate income tax  
relief on profits made through offshore subsidiaries for exports 
made in the United States, and pay no taxes at all when they 
repatriate the profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU says its success in outlawing the program would far  
outweigh recent successful U.S. victories over European 
restrictions on imports of hormone-treated beef and bananas 
marketed by U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO granted Washington permission to impose sanctions worth  
$116.8 million on EU goods in retaliation for the European beef 
ban, and $191 million in the banana case.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Chmura To Undergo MRI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Mark Chmura's flirtations with paralysis  
are becoming more frequent, and the Green Bay Packers are wondering 
how much longer their Pro Bowl tight end will continue to tempt 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
	In Green Bay's 23-15 loss to Detroit on Sunday, Chmura's hands  
and arms went numb for the third time in six weeks after what his 
teammates said was a cheap shot by Lions rookie linebacker Chris 
Claiborne. 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctors were scheduled to examine Chmura on Monday to  
determine whether it's safe for him to continue playing. He was 
expected to undergo an MRI and other tests before deciding whether 
to retire, as he has been urged by his wife and agent to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Even his teammates were unnerved by Chmura's latest brush with  
incapacitation, which came when he was hit by Claiborne after 
catching a pass in the first quarter. Claiborne speared Chmura with 
his helmet as the tight end fell to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't think it was clean,'' said Tyrone Davis,  
Chmura's backup. ``He was clearly on the ground. I know there are 
rules for protecting receivers as well as quarterbacks. ... I think 
they need to send that in to the league and get it reviewed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura briefly returned to the game after the hit but left for  
good in the second quarter, and he watched the second half in 
street clothes. The Packers said he suffered a stinger -- a 
nerve-related injury that causes some numbness -- and a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to make sure that you take every precautionary  
measure,'' Packers coach Ray Rhodes said. ``We'll go back through 
the evaluation process and testing, and until then we won't be able 
to give out any more information on Mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura has a bulging disc in his neck which was first noticed on  
Aug. 5, when he was hit in a training camp drill by defensive 
lineman Vaughn Booker. He sat out several days of practice but went 
numb when he hit a tackling dummy a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Chmura's agent and his wife, Lynda, asked him to retire  
last month after the second incident. He missed the entire 
preseason schedule but played in Green Bay's season-opening 28-24 
win over Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``If his career is over, it's been a great eight years,'' Lynda  
Chmura told the Green Bay Press-Gazette. ``He accomplished a lot 
more than most people thought he could. If it isn't, we'll just 
keep chugging along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes said he didn't think Claiborne's hit was malicious. He  
also said it was too soon to speculate whether Chmura's retirement 
was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like all the evaluations to come back before it's even  
talked about,'' Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Chmura was Green Bay's second-leading receiver  
behind Antonio Freeman last season, with 47 catches for 554 yards 
and four touchdowns. He was rewarded with the first Pro Bowl start 
of his seven-year career and his third Pro Bowl selection. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the second integral Packers offensive player to be  
severely limited by injuries this year. Wide receiver Robert Brooks 
ended his seven-year career in July after continual back and knee 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns linebacker Chris Spielman retired last month after a  
violent hit left him momentarily paralyzed. Spielman was attempting 
a comeback from neck surgery and a season away from football. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a bulging disc in Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston's  
neck -- an injury similar to the one suffered by Chmura -- ended 
Johnston's season and possibly his career. Johnston, who had neck 
surgery in 1997, will need a lengthy rehabilitation before he can 
decide whether to play again.

<HEADLINE>  Giants Shellshocked After Big Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Less than a day after giving up 50  
points to the Washington Redskins, the New York Giants still looked 
shellshocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Players rolled their eyes, shook their heads and shrugged their  
shoulders when asked Monday how a defense considered among the 
NFL's best could play so poorly in a 50-21 loss to the Redskins at 
Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't believe this was happening,'' safety Percy  
Ellsworth said in a low voice, sitting in front of his locker. ``I 
never, ever, ever, ever thought as a team they could put up 50 
points on us. I never, ever thought that was possible. Fifty 
points, that's just ... wow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellsworth wasn't the only one who couldn't explain the Giants'  
worst defensive effort in 33 years, although the players were 
hoping their use of words like aberration, fluke and mental 
meltdown weren't that far off base. 
</P>
<P>
	The other option seemed inconceivable. The Giants vaunted  
defense couldn't be as bad as quarterback Brad Johnson and the rest 
of the Redskins made them look in scoring on their first three 
possessions, and on seven of 13 in the game. That number is even 
more impressive considering that two of the non-scoring possessions 
came at the end of the halves when Washington was running out the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first three times they had the ball, they went right  
through us like Grant took Richmond,'' said Giants coach Jim 
Fassel, who noted the Redskins played very well. ``They took it 
right down the field every time and scored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, which only outgained New York 395-373 in total  
yards, did the same thing on the next-to-last drive of the first 
half. It also scored a field goal and a touchdown on its first two 
possessions of the second half in opening a 43-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't that we didn't know their offense or didn't study,''  
linebacker Scott Galyon said. ``We felt we were ready, but once the 
ball was kicked off, we didn't show up. I definitely think it was a 
fluke. We're a hundred times better than what we showed 
yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow linebacker Corey Widmer agreed, to a point.  
</P>
<P>
	In beating Tampa Bay 17-13 in the season opener the week before,  
the Giants defense was dominating. It played with intensity, forced 
five turnovers, scored two touchdowns and harried Trent Dilfer so 
much that Tony Dungy had to replace his quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's performance fell far short of that standard.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the kind of stuff that can happen when you take  
something for granted,'' Widmer said. ``That's what happens when 
you get a little high on yourself and you think just because you 
played the way you did the week before, that it's going to happen 
every week and you can rest on your laurels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Widmer said the same type of inconsistency killed the Giants in  
1998, when New York missed the playoffs with an 8-8 record just a 
season after winning the NFC East. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of game is unacceptable if we want to go the places  
and do the things we want to do,'' Widmer said. ``That's is not the 
way to get there. We have a lot of work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one thing everyone seemed to agree on is that the Giants  
have to learn from this game, put it behind them and then 
concentrate on Sunday night's game at New England (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel like this is just our one bad game,'' Ellsworth  
said. ``Hopefully, we'll use it as a wakeup call and look back at 
the end of the season and say this was a critical turning point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a ray of good news for the Giants, it seems that  
cornerback Jason Sehorn, who has been sidelined since training camp 
opened with a hamstring injury, will make his season debut against 
the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Lincoln, who has been filling in for Sehorn at right  
cornerback, was benched in the second half after being called for 
pass interference twice, setting up two touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Schott's May Be Questioned in Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Attorneys for a group that tried  
unsuccessfully to bring a minor league team to Dayton asked a 
federal judge Monday to allow them to question former Cincinnati 
Reds owner Marge Schott about her racial opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	In a motion filed in U.S. District Court, Baseball at Trotwood  
Inc. said there is evidence Schott made decisions regarding the 
Dayton baseball project and that her racial views are relevant 
because Baseball at Trotwood's majority owner is former boxing 
promoter Rock Newman, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott's attorney, Stephen Bailey, said he had not seen the  
court filing and declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Reds granted territorial rights to the Dayton  
Professional Baseball Club, paving the way for that group to bring 
a Class-A affiliate to Dayton next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball at Trotwood is suing the Dayton Professional Baseball  
Club and Schott, alleging it was the victim of racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott is scheduled to be questioned privately later this month  
by attorneys for Baseball at Trotwood. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 10, Schott asked Judge Walter Rice for a protective  
order to bar any inquiry into her religious beliefs or practices, 
ethnic background, or opinions on racial relations and 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott has been disciplined twice by major league baseball for  
making inflammatory remarks. She was suspended by baseball's 
executive council for the 1993 season because of racially and 
ethnically offensive remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott agreed to turn over daily operation of the Reds to John  
Allen in 1996 rather than accept another suspension for additional 
inflammatory remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents filed by her attorneys, Schott  
played no part in the Reds' decision to grant territorial rights to 
the Dayton Professional Baseball Club because she had been 
suspended from making such decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, major league baseball approved the $67 million sale  
of Schott's controlling interest in the Reds to her partners.

<HEADLINE> Judge Brown Says He Can Handle TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- He dresses all in black and stars in his  
own TV show. He's got a publicist and routinely gets mobbed for 
autographs. Not bad for a mere public servant. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Brown, the sharp-tongued administrator of justice at Shelby  
County Criminal Court, is the only sitting jurist with a national 
TV show. He relishes the high profile both jobs have given him. 
</P>
<P>
	But some critics grumble that Brown should choose between court  
business and show business. By doing both, they say, Judge Brown is 
doing neither any justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court system has a legitimate concern. It is a violation  
of ethics if he is not devoting full time to a full-time job,'' 
said Geoffrey Hazard, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he can do both jobs without compromising either.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't play golf or anything like that. I'm in my office ...  
sometimes at 8 or 9 o'clock at night,'' he said. ``I don't sleep 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 52, gained national attention for handing down unusual  
sentences, like requiring lawbreakers to write book reports on the 
``Autobiography of Malcolm X.'' He has let burglary victims go to 
convicted thieves' homes and take some of their possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood producers began paying attention when Brown presided  
over James Earl Ray's attempt to invalidate his guilty plea for 
killing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court removed Brown from the case last year  
after prosecutors argued he was biased toward Ray, who died in 
prison several weeks later. Brown denied the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to the state's contentions, this court has no  
predisposition to favor a new trial for James Earl Ray nor to be 
biased against the merits of the state's position,'' he said at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	His syndicated ``Judge Joe Brown'' show began airing a year ago.  
He carries his no-nonsense demeanor to the program, which has 5 
million viewers and has been second in popularity behind ``Judge 
Judy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his peculiar sentences and stern lectures, Brown said he  
tries to make an impression on young, poorly educated lawbreakers 
who have little regard for law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	For his show, Brown travels to Los Angeles to tape two- or  
three-day sessions, 24 weeks a year. He would not disclose what he 
is paid for the show, but makes $102,240 a year as a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting weekends and holidays, Brown was away from his real  
court 80 days last year, according to the Administrative Office of 
the Courts in Nashville. That got the attention of the state 
Supreme Court, which recently told Brown to quit hiring a retired 
judge to sit in for him when he is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commercial Appeal of Memphis suggested that Brown spend more  
time in Shelby County and less on TV. ``A Criminal Court judgeship, 
these turbulent days, is a full-time job,'' the newspaper said in 
an editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said some of the work days he missed were for vacations  
and judicial meetings. And he noted that since the show began, the 
number of cases he disposed of has increased 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm supposed to be overworked, why did I pick up the  
workload?'' asked Brown, who won re-election to a second eight-year 
term last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown describes himself as a man of the people, though requests  
for interviews, once handled by his secretary, now are fielded by a 
public relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his removal from the Ray case, he has been  
criticized by the state Court of the Judiciary for saying another 
judge was ``masquerading as a judge'' and threatening to ``put a 
foot deep in somebody's behind'' if another court failed to supply 
information he wanted in a child support case. 
</P>
<P>
	A clerk in Brown's court recently was disciplined for signing  
arrest warrants for criminal defendants while the judge was out of 
town. Brown said he knew nothing about that. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown grew up in south-central Los Angeles and graduated with  
honors from law school at the University of California, Los 
Angeles. He prides himself on being streetwise and often packs a 
pistol, sometimes under his judge's robe. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Floyd Ag Losses May Pass $1 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- In all the sodden grief left by Hurricane  
Floyd, Craig King found a sliver of good news after he was 
airlifted to one of his farms: His 20 head of valuable breeding 
cattle were safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hadn't had any feed since Wednesday, ... but they were in  
reasonably good shape,'' King said Sunday. ``The main thing was 
that they had water. I fed them enough to last them a couple of 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the outlook for the state's agriculture industry is  
grim. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural losses could exceed $1 billion, far more than the  
record $872 million in damage caused by Hurricane Fran in 1996. The 
state is the nation's largest producer of turkeys and sweet 
potatoes, the second-largest hog producer and third-largest chicken 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimate that floodwaters may already have claimed a  
million poultry and 110,000 swine while inflicting uncalculated 
damage to fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not even close to being ready to start looking at  
crops,'' said Jim Knight, a state Agriculture Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Military vehicles -- on the water and in the air -- have been  
called in to help save livestock across eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Three National Guard helicopters ferried farmers Sunday to hog  
and poultry operations without electricity to turn on generators 
and get feed and water to their animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Camp Lejeune Marines also sent an amphibious landing craft to a  
Craven County farm, where 1,000 hogs died in the flooded Trent 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	Precise damage assessments will have to wait while officials try  
to save livestock in desperate need of food and water. Knight said 
corn, peanut and cotton crops were seriously damaged; much of the 
tobacco crop has already been harvested. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Northeast Cape Fear River rose Sunday, Jim Connor chose  
to shoot his 35 goats rather than let them drown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if they could swim, there isn't anywhere for them to get  
to land,'' Connor told the Morning Star of Wilmington. Connor is 
living on the second floor of his flooded house. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, disposal of livestock carcasses has presented a  
potential public health problem. Officials plan to set up two 
portable incinerators in the region and expect 10 more from 
Florida. Above-ground composting is being considered for poultry 
carcasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal inspectors have been called in from other states to  
assist North Carolina officials, who are also considering using 
inmate labor and private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the sheer numbers that we're going to have, it's  
going to be just a mammoth operation,'' Knight said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo's key stock index moved higher today as  
anticipation of joint efforts by Japan and the United States to 
support the dollar boosted the greenback against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 232.99  
points, or 1.34 percent, to close at 17,575.26. On Friday, the 
average closed up 50.68 points, or 0.29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was traded at 107.92 yen, up 1.40 yen from late  
Friday's level of 106.52 yen in Tokyo and also above its New York's 
106.86 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices, led by export-oriented high  
technology shares, rose on the back of the lower yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen is seen as negative for Japanese exporters as it  
makes their products less cost-competitive overseas and erodes the 
value of repatriated earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 534.19 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, up from 518.72 million 
shares last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers outnumbered decliners 700 to 516, while 130 issues  
were unchanged. Of the 36 industrial sectors that make up the 
Nikkei Average, financials, transport equipment, electrical and 
precision instruments were the top gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign exchange, anticipation of joint Japan-U.S. efforts to  
boost the U.S. dollar against the yen ahead of the Group of Seven 
(G7) meeting of finance ministers and central bankers this weekend 
kept the greenback strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also benefitted from expectations that the Bank of  
Japan will ease monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationally circulated Yomiuri newspaper reported over the  
weekend that the central bank may decide on a further quantitative 
easing at its policy board meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed an easing would be effective in limiting upward  
pressure on the yen if such a policy actually helps lower long-term 
interest rates, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower rates would make yen-denominated assets, such as bonds,  
less attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since BOJ easing is regarded as one of conditions for  
U.S.-Japan joint (dollar-buying) intervention, it's certainly a 
plus for the dollar,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of 
foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank. ``But easing will also prompt 
overseas investors to buy yen for investing in Japanese stocks,'' 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar hit a low of 107.41 yen and a high of 108.19 yen in  
today's dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 112.55 yen, up from  
110.60 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark Japanese government bond fell to  
1.6500 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7050 percent. Its price 
rose 0.48 points to 102.14 from 101.66.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Ship Fire Strands 1,700 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A cruise ship left adrift not far from  
Tropical Storm Harvey got one engine started Monday and headed 
further out into the Gulf of Mexico to escape the strengthening 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Seas around Carnival Cruise Line's Tropicale swelled up to 12  
feet as the vessel, carrying 1,700 passengers and crew, moved away 
from the storm's projected path. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically we are going to do a big loop in the Gulf and turn  
around, with a very safe distance between us and Harvey, and follow 
the storm back in to Tampa,'' Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher said the Tropicale will rendezvous with a tug boat  
Tuesday, and the tug will escort the ship into port in case the 
engine fails again. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, Harvey was centered about 110 miles southwest of  
St. Petersburg, moving northeast at nearly 10 mph. It had top 
sustained winds of about 60 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, meanwhile, was about 160 miles southwest of the city  
and traveling farther away at about 9 mph. The Port of Tampa was 
closed by the Coast Guard late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tropicale had been scheduled to return to Tampa on Monday  
morning after a four-day cruise through Key West and Cozumel, 
Mexico. But both of the 660-foot vessel's engines were damaged in a 
fire Sunday night, leaving it adrift about 100 miles southwest of 
Tampa, Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews managed to restart the starboard motor Monday afternoon.  
Originally, a tug boat was expected to meet up with the ship and 
tow it to Key West. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were under their own power they could break through  
these waves with no problem, otherwise they are at the mercy of the 
seas,'' Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Murphy said. ``They could be 
rocking and rolling a bit with each swell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cruise ship, which was carrying 1,096 passengers and 605  
crew members, still had air conditioning, working toilets and 
electricity for guest rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard spokesman Harry Craft in St. Petersburg, 22 miles  
away from Tampa, said his office had received many calls from 
passengers' relatives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's really not much we can do,'' Craft said. ``If there  
were seven or eight people out there, we'd probably send out a 
helicopter and get them out of there, but we're talking about 1,700 
people.''

<HEADLINE>  New Miss America Vows To Help Vets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The new Miss America put away her  
evening gown, adjusted her tiara and got down to work less than 24 
hours after her coronation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have over 250,000 homeless veterans, spread nationwide,''  
Heather Renee French told reporters Sunday, a day after she was 
named Miss America 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``A large population, of course, are in Washington, D.C., and in  
large cities. You find they congregate in the larger areas because 
that's where the facilities are that treat those needs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While her predecessors have campaigned for AIDS prevention,  
literacy or diabetes awareness, the 24-year-old French had another 
cause in mind. It wasn't hard: She's the daughter of a disabled 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father, Ron French, 52, served in the U.S. Marine Corps in  
Vietnam and was wounded in combat -- he was shot in the wrist -- 
early in his four-year hitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans' reactions have already been felt at the French  
household. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've already heard from six or seven just since last night,''  
her father said. ``They said they're really grateful that someone 
like her can be a spokesperson for them. It's about time the 
veterans had a spokesperson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French, of Maysville, Ky., had dreamed of becoming Miss America  
ever since she was about 9, her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
	She pursued it doggedly, entering the Miss Ohio pageant once and  
competing in the Miss Kentucky pageant three times before winning 
it on her fourth try and qualifying for a shot at Miss America. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, she sang ``As If We Never Said Goodbye'' for her  
talent offering during the nationally televised 79th annual 
pageant. She became the first Miss Kentucky to win the Miss America 
Pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	French wins a $40,000 college scholarship and a years' worth of  
clothing from New York design houses, but she has to live out of a 
suitcase -- Miss America typically travels 20,000 miles a month 
during her reign. 
</P>
<P>
	The scholarship money, together with the pageant's decision to  
drop a 50-year-old ban on women who have had abortions or divorces, 
made for comic fodder during the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to French's coronation, co-host Marie Osmond joked that  
the new Miss America would split the scholarship cash. ``She's 
going to share it with her ex-husband,'' Osmond quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	French ducked questions Sunday about her opinion of the rules  
change. She has never been married, but she has a boyfriend, Tracey 
Morris, a 38-year-old investor. 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't, however, duck a tricky question about her embraced  
cause: What will the newly crowned Miss America do when she 
encounters a homeless veteran? 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't just give them a handout,'' she replied. ``I  
believe we need more permanent solutions, instead of temporary 
solutions, and that's what handouts are.''

<HEADLINE> Debate on Navy Bombing Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Navy battle group headed for the  
Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf will arrive in ``a significantly 
reduced state of readiness'' if its crews can't undergo live-fire 
training on Puerto Rico's Vieques Island, the Navy says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement announcing departure of the aircraft carrier USS  
Dwight D. Eisenhower and accompanying ships from Norfolk, Va., on 
Monday, the Navy said suspension of key training on Vieques would 
leave the ship's crews uncertified to support Marines ashore with 
their big guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Live-fire training has been canceled for the first round of  
training in the Puerto Rico area, the Navy said. If it cannot be 
conducted in the second round in December, officials said, the 
ships will deploy unready to the Mediterranean and the Gulf in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Live-fire training was suspended at Vieques after an errant bomb  
killed a civilian guard, David Sanes Rodriguez, on the island April 
19. A Pentagon-appointed panel is weighing Puerto Rican demands 
that the Navy abandon the facility it has been using since World 
War II. Puerto Ricans say the live-fire training endangers the 
island's 9,400 residents and pollutes its environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Aircraft squadrons on the ships also would be in a ``degraded  
state of combat readiness,'' said Vice Adm. Robert G. Natter, 
although they will be able to complete some required training at 
alternate sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no other places to conduct the surface gunnery  
live-fire and large-scale integrated air-to-ground and surface 
gunnery operations we normally undertake on Vieques,'' Natter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Vieques weapons range is the only place where aircraft,  
Navy surface ships, ground forces, and Navy and Marine Corps 
personnel assigned to our Atlantic Fleet can conduct integrated 
training with live ammunition under combat-ready conditions,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy noted that the last two battle groups deployed from the  
Atlantic Fleet ended up participating in combat operations. The USS 
Enterprise battle group engaged in operations against Iraq from the 
Persian Gulf and the USS Theodore Roosevelt flew combat missions in 
Kosovo from the Mediterranean.

<HEADLINE> Sears Canada To Buy T. Eaton Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Sears Canada is buying all the outstanding common  
shares of insolvent retailer T. Eaton Co. Ltd. for $20.3 million, 
in a move that keeps the Eaton's name and brands alive and saves 
1,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears Canada announced Monday it will also take over Eaton's  
trademarks, along with eight Eaton's stores, plus options on five 
other locations. The stores will operate under the Sears banner. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal requires approval from the courts, regulators,  
shareholders and creditors, but Sears said it expects to close the 
transaction by year-end. On Monday, an Ontario court granted 
Eaton's another 45 days to Nov. 4 to wind down operations and pay 
off creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears Canada chief executive Paul Walters said in a telephone  
news conference that the company will look at keeping the Eaton's 
name and some of its brands alive. Such options include continued 
sales of Eaton's goods via its Web site, resurrecting an Eaton's 
catalog, selling Eaton's brands in Sears stores and even the 
possibility of having Eaton's named stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the Eaton's brand has a long and valued position in  
the marketplace,'' Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears Canada will pay $20.3 million cash plus $13.5 million to  
clear Eaton's tax liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton's, the once-dominant department store chain, has lost more  
than $270.7 million since 1996 and some of those losses can be used 
by Sears Canada to lower the company's future tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight stores Sears Canada has agreed to take over are at St.  
Vital Centre in Winnipeg, Galeries La Capitale in Quebec City, 
Halifax Shopping Centre in Halifax, Sherway Gardens in west 
Toronto, Yorkdale Shopping Centre in north Toronto, Scarborough 
Town Centre in east Toronto, Westmount Shopping Centre in London, 
Ont., and Brentwood Mall in Burnaby, B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	These stores help Sears round out its 110-store Canadian network  
and give it the option to upgrade a few of its stores to better 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider our offer to be a good one,'' Walters said. ``It  
allows us to enter the best shopping centers where we still have 
voids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sears' strategy has been to open stores in the suburbs since  
they carry items including lawnmowers, tools, appliances, 
furniture, clothing and cosmetics attractive to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears plans to hire up 1,000 of Eaton's 13,000 employees,  
Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is conditional on Eaton's completing its plan to wind  
down operations under court supervision. Eaton's assets and 
liabilities not being acquired by Sears would be transferred to a 
new company, which will negotiate with other potential buyers on 
some of the remaining Eaton's assets.

<HEADLINE> Jets Coach Won't Blame QB for Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Jets coach Bill Parcells refused to  
single out his new quarterback, Rick Mirer, for Sunday's 17-3 loss 
to the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he insisted, it was a team effort.  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a good performance by anyone,'' Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Jets have begun the season 0-2 for the second  
straight year, and the fourth time in the past five. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot on my mind in terms of how to try to rectify  
what's going on here,'' Parcells said. ``We have some tough teams 
coming up, and if we don't play a lot better than we played 
(Sunday) night, we will not win any of these games. That's the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To lead the turnaround, the Jets have turned their hopes to  
journeyman Mirer, who stepped in for injured Vinny Testaverde 
against the Bills and registered an erratic performance. The 
seventh-year veteran, making his first start in just under two 
years, completed 13 of 28 passes for 121 yards, with only 22 yards 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer, however, was victimized by at least five dropped passes  
and an offensive line that was penalized five times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emphasis people gave me all week was don't try to do too  
much,'' Mirer said. ``I didn't ... (but) other guys tried to do 
special things. Sometimes, that doesn't help. Really, we played our 
game, but we just didn't win. We made it real hard for the defense, 
because we made them play all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets failed to score a touchdown for the first time since  
the season finale in 1995, a 12-0 loss to the New Orleans Saints. 
They compiled only 190 yards, 74 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer completed only three first-half passes, and didn't connect  
with a wide receiver until early in the third quarter. In 10 
possessions, the Jets moved into Buffalo territory only twice, 
squandering their best opportunity for a touchdown in the second 
quarter when running back Jerald Sowell was stopped just short of 
the end zone on a 4th-and-inches attempt to score. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills responded with a 12-play, 99-yard march to a TD.  
Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie keyed the drive with 38 yards 
rushing on two scrambles, and delivered a crushing block to 
linebacker Mo Lewis in springing a 12-yard run by Antowain Smith to 
the 1-yard line. Smith, who finished with 113 of the Bills' 224 
rushing yards, ran in for the score untouched on the following 
snap. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie's sensational improvisation, which resulted in a  
career-best 67 yards on seven carries, provided a headline contrast 
to Mirer's struggles in learning the Jets' complicated offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets' only scoring drive came in the third quarter when  
Parcells opened up the offense. Mirer completed 4 of 6 passes for 
63 yards in marching the Jets to the Bills' 13-yard line. New York 
had to settle for a John Hall 31-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, we were a little conservative early in the game,  
to try to get Rick under way,'' Parcells said. ``We opened it up in 
the second and third quarters. But, the things that affected us 
mostly there, the penalties we continue to have on the offensive 
line, that decreases your chances of making a first down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer, for his part, feels that improvement will come in time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know there isn't a lot of time to be waiting,'' he said. ``I  
just hope I keep making strides. We didn't get a whole lot 
accomplished (Sunday) on the scoreboard, but it was valuable for 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Maine Potato Farmers Begin Harvest / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The 1990s have been bleak for Maine's potato farmers. Neighbors  
watched nervously as the potato prices plummeted because of a 
nationwide glut. Banks began auctioning off generations-old farms. 
</P>
<P>
	But now there's hope.  
</P>
<P>
	Farmers and their helpers poured into the fields this week to  
begin harvesting a crop described as ``tremendous.'' Also, the 
state's total acreage for potatoes climbed instead of decreasing 
for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a real optimism here,'' said Don Flannery, associate  
executive director of the Maine Potato Board. ``That being said, we 
are realists, too. We know our competition in Canada and 
nationwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in northern Maine managed to avoid the effects of the  
East Coast drought this summer. They are banking on a bumper year 
after near-perfect weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maine has been very fortunate in Aroostook County in that  
they've had timely showers and it's made for an excellent crop,'' 
said Maine Agriculture Commissioner Bob Spear. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in land devoted to potatoes from 65,000 acres last  
year to 68,000 acres this year was partly because of demand from 
McCain Foods USA, the world's largest french fry producer, Flannery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, based in Oakbrook, Ill., is completing a $70 million  
expansion of its french fry processing plant in Easton this fall. 
It has four other processing plants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Yaeger, sales manager at H. Smith Packing in Blaine,  
called McCain's expansion a ``vote of confidence in the Maine 
potato grower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it is more than a just morale boost.  
</P>
<P>
	Because of the reliability in the french fry and potato chip  
market, more and more farmers are shifting their crops from the 
types of potatoes sold in grocery stores to potatoes that are more 
suited to processing. 
</P>
<P>
	Processing potatoes are considered to be less susceptible to  
market conditions than ``tablestock'' because farmers enter into 
contracts with processors like McCain, Frito Lay and Humpty Dumpty 
Potato Chip Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 54 percent of the crop was dedicated to french fries  
and potato chips, 19 percent went to tablestock and the remaining 
27 percent was harvested for seed, according to the Maine Potato 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
	That's good news for Aroostook County and a state where potatoes  
are the No. 1 agricultural commodity, with annual sales of nearly 
$105 million. Maine ranked eighth in the nation in potato 
production last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all farmers are confident, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark Nightingale, whose grandfather started his farm in New  
Limerick, says it's a slow road to economic recovery in Aroostook 
County and not everyone is out of the red. 
</P>
<P>
	``People here are still struggling and there isn't much help,''  
said Nightingale, who reduced his potato crop to 380 acres this 
year and increased his wheat production, planting 400 acres of 
grain. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that because of the weather in northern Maine  
this summer, this crop should be particularly good in terms of 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had just enough water and we've had an unusually warm  
year,'' said Jim Cook, director of Crown of Maine Organic 
Cooperative, in Madawaska.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Irradiate Food Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The nation's biggest poultry producer  
is preparing to test irridiated foods for sale to consumers. In 
doing so, Tyson Foods Inc. joins a move to embrace a decades-old 
food safety process that has been used in space but never widely 
accepted on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson said Monday it believes there is a market for irradiated  
food. It will sterilize its poultry from potentially harmful 
bacteria with a process that uses electron beams, rather than the 
other form or irradiation that relies on low-level doses of gamma 
rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have come to the conclusion in our research and evaluation  
of consumer acceptance that now is the time to take this step,'' 
said Tyson spokesman Archie Schaffer III from the company's 
Springdale, Ark. headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has contracted with San Diego-based Titan Corp., which  
will irradiate Tyson products at a facility in Sioux City, Iowa, 
set to open next month. Other food processors are to have meat 
irradiated at the facility as well, officials from both companies 
said. Tyson will be the first poultry company involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Giant meatpackers giants IBP Inc. and Excel Corp. earlier this  
year disclosed plans to treat meat irradiated by Titan. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson and Titan are to spend the next several months developing  
packaging and labeling and testing products. Tyson said a market 
test could come early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a portion of Tyson products will be irradiated and they  
will be clearly labeled as such. Schaffer said the proportion and 
types of products have not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Tyson said that it does not regard irradiation  
as a panacea for eliminating harmful bacteria from food and that 
consumers using its irradiated products will still have to handle 
the meat safely and make sure it is fully cooked. 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the Center  
for Science in the Public Interest, said the group does not have 
any strenuous objection to the electron-beam method. 
</P>
<P>
	``For consumers, irradiated foods are likely to contain many  
fewer bacteria and, potentially, no bacteria. It is safer from a 
microbiological standpoint than foods that have not been 
irradiated,'' DeWaal said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWaal said irradiation can result in some vitamin content being  
reduced but said that is of slim concern, assuming only a tiny 
portion of a person's diet is irradiated. 
</P>
<P>
	The poultry industry would do better to make plants cleaner,  
rather than relying on irradiation to sanitize food on the back end 
of production, she said. Also, DeWaal said consumers want to know 
whether food has been irradiated. 
</P>
<P>
	The government requires irradiated products be labeled. Tyson  
said it prefers informational labels rather than warning labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Irradiation has been used for years on limited amounts of  
produce, spices, poultry and other foods. But only a few small 
retailers have offered irradiated products. 
</P>
<P>
	On a space mission last year, John Glenn and his fellow  
astronauts ate irradiated food.

<HEADLINE> Mich. St. Player Cleared of Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A misdemeanor charge accusing  
Michigan State All-America Mateen Cleaves of stealing beer from a 
convenience store has been dropped by prosecutors who couldn't 
produce a key witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection was to have begun this week, but Ingham County  
prosecutors dropped the charge because a witness was out of their 
jurisdiction and not immediately available to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III said he would refile the charges  
when the witness becomes available, the Detroit Free Press and the 
Lansing State Journal reported Tuesday. Dunnings called the absent 
witness a ``necessary'' one but not paramount to the case, the 
State Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to refile charges as soon as the witness becomes  
available,'' Dunnings told the State Journal. ``I don't want people 
to think the charges are resolved forever and always.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, who led Michigan State to the Final Four last season,  
and former teammate Antonio Smith were charged in April with 
committing larceny for property under $200 -- a 40-ounce bottle of 
beer from a local convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Smith also was charged with malicious  
destruction of property, also a misdemeanor, after allegedly 
breaking open a cooler containing the beer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection for Smith's trial is expected to proceed this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges carry a possible three months in jail.  
</P>
<P>
	Dunnings has said prosecutors have a videotape from the  
convenience store as well as accounts from at least six witnesses, 
though Cleaves' attorney said his client was ready for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had wrapped up our investigation and were ready to pick a  
jury and proceed with the case,'' Frank Harrison Reynolds told the 
Free Press. ``What (prosecutors) do in the future remains to be 
unseen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief statement Monday, the State Journal reported, Cleaves  
said that ``I am not going to replay the past but am looking 
forward to the future. I have learned a lot this past year. I am 
grateful for the support and concern of my family, my team, my 
university and my many friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old Cleaves, who will be a senior next season, also  
was arrested for an alcohol-related incident with teammate Andre 
Hutson during the 1997-98 season. He completed a youthful offender 
program for that offense.

<HEADLINE> Dragging Death Case Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A jury began deliberating today whether a  
former prison gang leader who admitted being on hand should be 
convicted in the chaining and dragging death of a black man last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Conviction on a capital murder charge in the death of James Byrd  
Jr. could send Lawrence Russell Brewer, 32, to death row. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there is a pattern of deceit,'' Jasper County District  
Attorney Guy James Gray said in his closing statement before the 
case went to the jury. ``He crafted his story to try to imply James 
Byrd was dead before they started dragging him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just admitted enough to comply with the facts ... and just  
staying just short of the death penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, sometimes sobbing, testified last week that he was on an  
old Jasper County logging road with John William King and Shawn 
Allen Berry in the early morning hours of June 7, 1998, when Byrd 
was chained by his ankles to the bumper of Berry's pickup truck, 
then dragged for three miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's attorney, Doug Barlow, told jurors not to ``be guided  
by dramatics and stretches of the imagination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think Russell was up here trying to concoct a story,  
don't you think he would have concocted a story that would have 
made him much less culpable?'' Barlow asked. 
</P>
<P>
	But the prosecutor said Brewer admitted enough be returned to  
prison but avoid a death sentence. Gray described Brewer as ``kind 
of a nobody,'' as a liar and racist who couldn't hold a job when 
not in prison, but when behind bars ``he's a big shot ... he has 
status in the pen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, was convicted in February and sentenced to death.  
Berry, also 24, faces trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, which began its discussions about 10:30 a.m., also  
could return a verdict on non-capital murder, aggravated assault or 
assault. Only a capital murder conviction could bring a death 
sentence. It would require jurors to agree there was another felony 
-- in this case, abduction -- involved in Byrd's death, and that 
Brewer helped. 
</P>
<P>
	If Brewer is convicted, the same jury will decide punishment  
after hearing witnesses and another round of arguments from 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer testified that, Berry had first slashed Byrd's throat,  
then chained him to the back of the truck. He said he even urged 
his two companions to release Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't mean to cause his death,'' Brewer said. ``I had no  
intentions of killing nobody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer said he knew nothing about a kidnaping, never intended  
Byrd to die and was convinced Byrd died when Berry slashed his 
throat with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	But a pathologist testified there was no evidence of a knife  
wound on Byrd's remains and authorities found no knife. Byrd was 
alive until his head was torn off when it slammed into a culvert, 
the pathologist said. And DNA evidence showed Byrd's blood on the 
shoes of all three men.

<HEADLINE> Ted Turner Recalls the Early Years </HEADLINE>

	BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- Ted Turner didn't always live on Easy  
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	On his way to his first billion dollars, the cable tycoon missed  
a payroll, nearly went bankrupt four times and took rash financial 
chances, he reminded lawyers Saturday.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Heard Boos From Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya heard the boos as he  
backpedaled around the ring in the final rounds, his anticipated 
brawl with Felix Trinidad drawing to what seemed to be an 
anticlimactic close. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the fans knew something De La Hoya didn't -- that he was  
throwing away certain victory in the biggest fight of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	What De La Hoya thought would be a triumphant boxing performance  
Saturday night instead became a bitter defeat, proving once again 
that it never pays to make assumptions in boxing unless your 
opponent is sprawled on the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I had it in the bag. I swear, I really did,'' De La  
Hoya said. ``Now I know how Lennox Lewis feels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya's decision to spend much of the final three rounds  
letting Trinidad chase him around the ring cost him dearly, mainly 
because he and his cornermen were so intent on following their 
strategy that they forgot how to do the math. 
</P>
<P>
	They also didn't count on the tenacity and heart of Trinidad,  
who refused to be overcome by frustration and finally began landing 
some good right hands just as De La Hoya began coasting in the 
final rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Oscar was a great fighter, but I have such a will to  
win,'' Trinidad said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most anticipated non-heavyweight fight in more than a decade  
didn't live up to its hype, despite the presence at ringside of the 
fighters who fought classic welterweight and middleweight fights in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns  
were all there to watch De La Hoya fight cautiously but effectively 
in the early and middle rounds only to give the fight away by 
simply not punching enough in the final few rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was entertaining in a tactical way, but not to the 11,610  
fans who packed the Mandalay Bay arena expecting to see a brawl 
between a pair of big punchers who both have suspect chins. 
</P>
<P>
	``For one time, I wanted to box and show a good boxing lesson,''  
De La Hoya said. ``I guess that wasn't enough for the people at 
ringside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Punching statistics showed De La Hoya landing 263 punches to 166  
for Trinidad, with almost all the difference coming in the left jab 
that the WBC champion used to bloody Trinidad's nose early and 
cause his left eye to almost swell shut. 
</P>
<P>
	``The object of boxing is to hit the other guy and not let him  
hit you,'' De La Hoya's veteran co-trainer Gil Clancy said. ``We 
had him so far ahead that there was no way he could lose in the 
final rounds unless he was knocked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The math of the three ringside judges, though, was different.  
</P>
<P>
	Through eight rounds, De La Hoya led 77-75 on two cards and  
77-76 on a third. But Trinidad won the last four rounds on one 
scorecard, and the other two judges gave him three of the four 
final rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad did it by finally landing some of the right hands he  
was missing in the early rounds and by being relentless in his 
pursuit of De La Hoya around the ring. De La Hoya basically took 
the 10th round off, brawled only briefly with Trinidad at the end 
of the 11th and tried to keep away in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``My corner said keep attacking. I knew it was close, but I kept  
attacking,'' Trinidad said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight was the richest of many rich bouts for De La Hoya, who  
was guaranteed at least $21 million to $10.5 million for Trinidad, 
who had never even approached that kind of payday in 35 previous 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I worth $10.5 million now?'' Trinidad asked De La Hoya  
after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	He may not be, unless it is in a rematch with De La Hoya, the  
only non-heavyweight who has proven he can sell pay-per-view in 
meaningful numbers. Some 1 million homes were expected to have 
bought this fight, at $49.95 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Puerto Rico went wild for its native son following the  
decision, Trinidad may not have shown the kind of performance he 
needed to market himself against any other fighters than De La 
Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the type of decision that elevated him to the status  
of his opponent,'' HBO boxing executive Lou DiBella said. ``On the 
other hand, Oscar walked in a star and walked out a star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An immediate rematch certainly isn't in the works, with Trinidad  
having to make a mandatory defense of the IBF title he holds and De 
La Hoya pondering some time off and a possible move into the 
154-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop Trinidad's promoter, Don King, from crowing  
about his fighter's prospects after the fight in a press conference 
filibuster that ended only after De La Hoya promoter Bob Arum cut 
off his microphone and told him repeatedly to shut up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, Oscar's shining star has been dimmed. Oh, I'm so happy.  
What a day,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	King said he would be happy to promote a rematch, only with the  
purses reversed so Trinidad would get the biggest money next time. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will be the day,'' Arum said.  
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, meanwhile, tried to smile as the effects of his  
first loss since his days as a teen-age amateur sank in. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was planning an immediate vacation and taking a  
``long time, long time'' away from the sport that has made him a 
multimillionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just very disappointed with boxing,'' De La Hoya said.

<HEADLINE> Material May Show Russia Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A top Russian intelligence official said Monday  
that U.S. investigators have material suggesting that Russian 
businesses laundered money through the Bank of New York and 
promised cooperation with the FBI in following the paper trail, 
Russian news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Media reports that Russian officials may be involved in  
laundering up to $10 billion through the New York bank have 
intensified growing discontent with President Boris Yeltsin and the 
government just three months before national parliamentary 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials visited the United States last week to meet  
with American investigators who are probing the potentially 
explosive issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Ivanov, deputy head of the Federal Security Service,  
Russia's main intelligence agency, said the U.S. investigators 
showed material indicating Russian businesses and banks may have 
laundered money in the U.S., the news agencies Interfax and 
ITAR-Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have agreed with our American colleagues on a visit of FBI  
workers to Moscow for a closer coordination of efforts,'' Interfax 
quoted Ivanov as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov's statements appeared to contradict Prime Minister  
Vladimir Putin, who said earlier Monday that the visit produced no 
evidence of Russian money being misdirected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, media reports of Russian money-laundering have  
not been confirmed,'' Putin said after a meeting with Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov's remarks also contradicted his own comment last week in  
Washington that ``U.S. law enforcement agencies did not show any 
documents that could confirm reports on the Bank of New York 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov did not provide details on Monday of the materials shown  
by the U.S. investigators, and he could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of New York spokesman Cary Giacalone declined to comment on  
the latest statements from Ivanov. He repeated the bank's previous 
position that it has not been accused of any wrongdoing and 
declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into 
money-laundering allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some reports have said the allegedly laundered money could  
include loans from the International Monetary Fund, but Ivanov said 
the United States has presented no evidence that money from the IMF 
or other international institutions was involved, the reports said. 
Nor was there any evidence that high-level officials had been 
involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Media reports have said the scandal could be one of the largest  
cases of money laundering ever uncovered in the United States. But 
no one has been charged yet, and U.S. investigators have not 
commented on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering is the process of moving criminal gains through  
a series of bank accounts to make them look like legitimate 
business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin acknowledged that the problem of capital flight exists,  
but not only in Russia. He said that Russian and American experts 
had ``established constructive business contacts'' during the 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, a leading Yeltsin  
opponent, said the money laundering allegations could not be 
written off so easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not think the reports are untrue. What is going on is a  
cover up because the senior officials implicated cannot explain the 
scandal away,'' he told a news conference, according to Interfax.

<HEADLINE> Ease on Cuban Sanctions Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With pressure from the farm lobby, a coalition  
of liberals and conservative lawmakers hopes to open a hole in the 
40-year-old trade embargo against Cuba that would allow the sale of 
U.S. food and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate overwhelmingly approved an amendment last month to a  
must-pass agricultural spending bill that would allow licensing of 
such exports. The provision is likely to be a major issue as House 
and Senate negotiators try to work out the final version of the 
appropriations measure this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have freedom to market products from our  
agricultural sectors with any and all customers,'' said Rep. George 
Nethercutt, R-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration decided this summer to allow sales of  
food and medicine to three other countries listed as terrorist 
states -- Iran, Libya and Sudan -- but was barred by law from 
including Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate provision, whose co-sponsors include conservative  
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., and liberal Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., 
would allow the government to issue licenses for up to one year for 
food and medicine sales to public institutions in Cuba but would 
bar the Agriculture Department from subsidizing them. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would prohibit the president from including  
food and medicine in future embargoes of other countries without 
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that has absolutely been pushed onto the  
radar screen by the ag lobby groups,'' said Jose Cardenas, 
Washington director for the Cuban American National Foundation. 
``They've been playing this for all it's worth, that Mr. and Mrs. 
Family Farmer are being pushed off their farms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations on the spending bill were scheduled to start this  
evening. In addition to the trade measure, lawmakers also have to 
work out a multibillion-dollar bailout for the farm economy. The 
Senate approved a $7.4 billion package of farm assistance in 
August, but farm organizations are seeking more. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups and agribusinesses are clamoring to move a glut of  
grain that has depressed commodity prices for the second year in a 
row, and they've been pressuring Congress and the Clinton 
administration to remove all barriers to food exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States expects to export $49 billion worth of  
commodities this year, down from a peak $59.8 billion three years 
ago, and the Agriculture Department is forecasting only slight 
improvement in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration hasn't taken a formal position on the  
Cuba issue. A leading House negotiator, Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, 
said recently that Cuba should have to offer some internal reforms 
in return for permission to buy U.S. products. Kaptur is the 
ranking Democrat on the House agricultural appropriations 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-Castro lawmakers hope to strip the Cuba provision from the  
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A stream of farmers and members of Congress, including Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., have trekked to Cuba in recent 
weeks to meet with the Cuban leader and discuss potential 
agricultural trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups claim agricultural trade with Cuba could hit $2  
billion within five years, encompassing wheat, soybeans, rice, 
corn, meat and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	But to do that, Cuba would have to double its current food  
purchases from all sources, and Castro's critics say that's a 
laughable prospect given the country's poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba imported $692 million in agricultural commodities in 1997  
and had $935 million worth of such exports, mostly sugar, according 
to the latest data available from the United Nations' Food and 
Agriculture Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm organizations say Cuba is bound to buy from U.S. sources,  
if it has a chance to, to take advantage of lower shipping costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba currently buys about 700,000 metric tons of wheat, mostly  
from Europe and Canada. ``We're thinking we could sell them all 
their 700,000 tons,'' said Dawn Forsythe, spokeswoman for U.S. 
Wheat Associates, the export promotion arm of the wheat industry. 
``We have the wheat available, and I think that Cuba would like to 
get it.''

<HEADLINE> Chiefs' RB Anders Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- One day after the best game of his  
career, Kansas City running back Kimble Anders underwent surgery on 
his Achilles' tendon and will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough. It's tough personally,'' Chiefs coach Gunther  
Cunningham said Monday when Anders was placed on injured reserve. 
``The football part, those things happen. You've got to go on. But 
it's tough personally because Kimble's done a great job for all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anders, a former Pro Bowl fullback, was converted this year to  
halfback and carried 22 times for 142 yards in Sunday's 26-10 
victory over Denver -- the biggest day by a Kansas City running back 
since 1991. He went down late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday, left guard Dave Szott underwent arthroscopic  
surgery on his right knee. The former All-Pro, who missed all last 
season with an arm injury, sat out most of the Denver game. Szott 
said he hoped to be back in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``But my wife winces when I say that,'' he said. ``I missed  
enough time last year. I don't want to miss much more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A skillful blocker and receiver, Anders was considered a quiet  
leader of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Bam Morris, who has been in Cunningham's doghouse after coming  
to camp overweight, will probably move into Anders' starting role. 
Morris, who did not play at all in the opener at Chicago, scored on 
a 5-yard run late in the Denver game. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-year man Rashaan Shehee could split time with Morris at  
running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bam will start and we'll just keep beating on him until he  
gets tired and then we'll put the next guy in,'' said Cunningham, 
adding that Shehee's role will ``expand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 260-pound Morris was pushed to the second team when the  
Chiefs switched positions for Anders, who had been to the Pro Bowl 
three times as a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready for whatever happens,'' said Morris, who gained 481  
yards on 129 carries last year. ``Whatever they throw at me, I'm 
ready and willing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like when a guy goes down, the other guys have to step  
up and play. Kimble had a great day. It's just terrible the 
accident that happened on that play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shehee, a second-round draft pick in 1997, has had a limited  
role as a third-down back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tragic situation,'' Shehee said. ``But the ship has to  
keep going. And the rest of us have to pick it up. We just have to 
be like No. 38 (Anders) out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs have several possibilities if Szott, another former  
Pro Bowl selection, misses any time. Jeff Smith, a veteran backup, 
performed well in place of Szott against Denver. Plus, Glenn Parker 
could move over from left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	John Tait, the No. 1 draft pick who did not sign until just  
before the season opener, might see action at left tackle. He was 
activated Monday after being inactive the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We rushed for 188 yards (against Denver) with Jeff Smith  
playing there for three quarters. The cupboard's not bare,'' 
Cunningham said. ``He played last year and he's a good backup 
player who can go in and start a game and win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tait admitted he's still got a lot to catch up on after missing  
all of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I do, the more comfortable I'll feel and the better  
I'll get,'' he said. ``I'm really eager to go. Arrowhead's a great 
place and I'm really eager to get my career going. There's a whole 
lot of work to do.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. Residents Still Boiling Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDISON, N.J. (AP) -- More than 1 million people in New Jersey  
were under orders Monday to boil their tap water because the 
flooding from Hurricane Floyd may have contaminated it. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of residents of Edison and nearby towns lined up for  
bottled water, offered free to the elderly and families with 
children under 2. Police delivered water to hundreds of elderly 
unable to leave their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how you take it for granted. You run the tap and  
that's it, and now it's like an emergency,'' said Christina 
Hussein, who brought her 5-month-old son, Tamir, on her arm as she 
picked up bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman Prosk and his wife, Arlene, both retired and dependent on  
prescription medications, said they had come for free bottled water 
every day since Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``How you miss simple things. You can't eat decently because you  
can't clean a dish,'' Prosk said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Edison and neighboring Middlesex County communities, tens of  
thousands of residents were getting nothing more than a rude cough 
as they turned on their faucets. A regional water supply plant in 
Bridgewater remained crippled after floodwaters damaged pumping 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant is on low ground near the confluence of the Millstone  
and Raritan rivers, which flooded when Floyd dumped nearly a foot 
of rain Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, drinking water was contaminated by the muddy  
runoff pouring into reservoirs.

<HEADLINE> YankeesNets May Sell Stock to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The company that will emerge from the union of  
the New York Yankees and the New Jersey Nets is already exploring 
the possibility of selling stock to the public, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Crain's New York Business also reported that the new holding  
company, YankeesNets, expects a tenfold increase in profits by 
2005, which might be used to acquire other sports franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	Crain's quoted sources it did not identify as saying that  
financial advisers for the new company are exploring a bid for the 
New York Jets, which have been for sale by the estate of the team's 
late owner, Leon Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Other reports have said potential buyers for the Jets include  
billionaire Kirk Kerkorian; real estate developer Samuel J. LeFrak; 
New York Mets co-owner Nelson Doubleday; New Jersey Devils owner 
John McMullen; and Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger of the Yankees and Nets is expected to be finalized  
in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crain's sources said financial advisers for the YankeesNets  
are studying other initial public offerings by sports teams, 
especially the one by British soccer team Manchester United, as 
models. 
</P>
<P>
	In a document obtained by Crain's, advisers to the YankeesNets  
project that the company could have $600 million in revenues within 
six years -- more than double the combined 1998 revenues of the two 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the merger is complete, the baseball and basketball teams  
will remain as separate subsidiaries under their current 
leadership, with George Steinbrenner running the Yankees, and Lewis 
Katz and Ray Chambers running the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told Crain's that the chief executive officer of the  
YankeesNets is expected to be Harvey Schiller, president of Turner 
Sports and a close friend of Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for YankeesNets, declined comment  
on the Crain's story, except to say that ``we're on track for the 
merger.''

<HEADLINE> Padres Get Ballpark Project Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Padres hired two executives to  
help with their downtown ballpark project, including former city 
manager Jack McGrory. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrory was named executive vice president-chief operating  
officer. The Padres also hired Bob Vizas as vice president-special 
counsel. Vizas is currently a San Francisco trial lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrory has been in private business since resigning as city  
manager in September 1997. During his tenure at city hall, the City 
Council agreed to a controversial $78 million expansion of Jack 
Murphy Stadium to accommodate the NFL's Chargers. When a portion of 
the deal hit a snag, high-tech company Qualcomm stepped in with $18 
million to help complete the project in exchange for putting its 
name on the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres say they can't survive financially at Qualcomm, which  
seats 70,000. A $411 million downtown ballpark was approved by the 
voters in November, shortly after the Padres were swept in the 
World Series by the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballpark, part of a $1 billion redevelopment project, has  
run into opposition and is being held up while an environmental 
impact report is completed. If the City Council approves the 
report, the Padres can proceed with property acquisition, 
demolition and site preparation toward a 2002 opening. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrory will serve as president of a company that will be formed  
to handle the development activities the Padres are responsible 
for.

<HEADLINE> Florida Sheriff's Dept. Wins $25M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A sheriff's department that took part in a  
seven-year money laundering probe received half of the $50 million 
seized from a marijuana smuggler -- the largest single currency 
seizure made by U.S. Customs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a culmination of several years of hard work on part of  
Customs and Monroe County Sheriff's Office,'' Customs Commissioner 
Ray Kelly said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs seized the money from convicted smuggler Paul Edward  
Hindelang in July 1998. Hindelang operated one of the largest 
marijuana smuggling organizations in the United States between 1975 
and 1981, according to Customs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindelang was an associate of marijuana kingpin Julio Nasser  
David, who along with his wife Sheila Arana de Nasser amassed 
millions in drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindelang was convicted in 1981 and sentenced to 30 months in  
prison for his part in smuggling 500,000 pounds of marijuana into 
the southeastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time he agreed to forfeit all of his drug money, which he  
said totaled $640,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators discovered that Hindelang had hidden money in  
bank accounts and corporations in Panama, the Turks and Caicos 
Islands, Switzerland, the Netherlands Antilles and the Cayman 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindelang used the accounts and corporations to purchase  
property and businesses in Montana, California, Colorado, Texas, 
Oregon and Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monroe County Sheriff's Office requested half the $50  
million seized since the investigation was conducted by Customs 
agents and Monroe County deputies. By law, local law enforcement 
entities get money proportional to the work they did and in a case.

<HEADLINE> Quaker Restructuring May Cost Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Quaker Oats Co. disclosed plans Monday to  
streamline U.S. and Canadian operations as part of a three-year 
project the company said could result in the loss of 1,200 jobs -- a 
tenth of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Those ultimately laid off may want to blame the runaway success  
of Gatorade, the nation's leading sports drink with sales of $1.3 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based food and beverage giant, which also makes  
Quaker cereals and Rice-A-Roni, said much of the savings from the 
move will be plowed into an expansion of beverage manufacturing and 
capital improvements associated with Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to allocate the funds to the businesses which  
are growing the fastest, and that's Gatorade,'' said John McMillin, 
an analyst for Prudential Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaker said the aim is to lower operating costs by removing  
inefficient assets and reconfiguring the company's food and 
beverage warehouse and delivery systems, among other moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Details on plant closings and job cuts are to be announced in  
the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it envisions savings from the restructuring of  
$40 million to $45 million in 2001, rising to $60 million to $70 
million starting in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	While Quaker has improved cost efficiency in recent years, ``we  
are convinced that we can accomplish even more,'' said Robert S. 
Morrison, chairman, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The news generated little excitement on Wall Street, where  
consolidations in the food and beverage industry have become 
commonplace. Quaker Oats stock fell 6 1/4 cents Monday to $62.75 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is simply a continuation of something they embarked on a  
couple of years ago to improve overall corporate profitability,'' 
said Steve Marascia, an analyst for Branch, Cabell, in Richmond, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a logistical standpoint it makes sense to do what they're  
doing -- to cut costs'' and wrap the food and beverage operations 
more closely together, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the restructuring, Quaker said its food and Gatorade  
warehousing would be integrated, assets in the company's U.S. and 
Canadian food operations may be reduced by close to 10 percent, or 
about $50 million, and U.S. beverage manufacturing would be 
expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects to take a series of restructuring and other  
charges over the next three years totaling between $225 million and 
$250 million before taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recently announced it was building a $115 million  
Gatorade plant in Indianapolis as well as adding manufacturing 
lines to an existing beverage facility in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Total costs are estimated at $230 million to $245 million, with  
the majority going to U.S. and Canadian Gatorade business, the 
company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatorade accounts for about 40 percent of Quaker Oats' revenues.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that making these changes now will help fuel the very  
strong momentum we've achieved in the first six months of this 
year, for the years to come,'' said company spokesman Mark Dollins.

<HEADLINE>  Browns Get Better in Week 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Tim Couch entered the Cleveland Browns'  
huddle in the third quarter Sunday at Tennessee, looked into the 
eyes of his offensive linemen and made a bold prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them, `If you give me protection on this one, it's  
going to be a score,''' the rookie quarterback said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds later, Couch backed up his boast, hooking up with rookie  
wideout Kevin Johnson on a 39-yard touchdown pass. It was Couch's 
first TD pass in the NFL and Cleveland's first of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call him Babe (Ruth) now,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said  
of Couch's called shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if Couch could only tell his teammates when their first win  
might come. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns took some positive steps toward win No. 1  
on Sunday in a 26-9 loss to the Titans. They were baby steps to be 
sure, but following an embarrassing 43-0 shellacking against the 
Pittsburgh Steelers in their opener, the Browns at least looked 
like a pro team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making some strides,'' linebacker Jamir Miller said.  
``We made some significant steps because we put some points on the 
board offensively. Defensively, we cut the score in half. So we're 
making some strides. It's nothing I would stand up and do back 
flips over yet, but we're getting there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, under intense pressure to perform well after Palmer  
benched starter Ty Detmer following the Pittsburgh debacle, played 
well enough to justify the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	After having to start his first two drives at Cleveland's 6- and  
3-yard-lines, respectively, the second one ending with an end zone 
sack for a safety, Couch moved the Browns' offense, which managed 
just 40 total yards and two first downs a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an unrelenting Titans' pass rush, Couch finished 12-of-24  
for 134 yards, but was 10-of-14 in the second half for 108 yards. 
He was sacked seven times, but managed 40 yards on five scrambles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is that I didn't throw any interceptions,'' he  
said. ``That's what I wanted to do. There's a lot of little things 
I can improve on, and I have to start getting a little better week 
in and week out. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I feel a lot more comfortable. Just going out there and  
playing with the guys a whole game as a starter. They get a feel 
for what I'm like out on the field and understand what I'm about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who didn't know of Couch's prediction until Monday  
morning, said he was impressed with his young quarterback's 
composure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he handled himself very well,'' Palmer said. ``That  
(TD) throw and catch. I don't know if it gets any better than 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while the Browns' offense improved -- it couldn't possibly  
get worse -- Cleveland's defense got pushed around once again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans outgained the Browns 412-173 in total offense, held  
the ball for more than 41 minutes and ran off 74 offensive plays. 
For the second straight week Cleveland's defensive starters were 
exhausted and several cramped up on the plane ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than half of its starters coming from 1998 playoff  
teams, Cleveland's defense was supposed to be the team's strength 
this season, keeping games close while the offense matured. 
</P>
<P>
	Under former Bears coordinator Bob Slowik, the defense was  
supposed to disrupt with an attacking style. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys flying around, guys jumping up and down,'' Miller said.  
``A lot of hits in the backfield, a lot of sacks. That's what it's 
supposed to look like, a party on every play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in two games, only the Steelers' and Titans' offenses have  
been partying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns haven't forced a turnover. They have recorded just  
one sack in 164 plays, and with its cornerbacks playing soft, 
Cleveland's D has allowed opposing QBs to complete 76 percent of 
their passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just disappointed in the time it's taken for us to gel,''  
Miller said. ``We've come together slower than I predicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer isn't blaming either starting unit for the 0-2 start, and  
thinks despite the lopsided numbers his team is getting better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just one side of the ball,'' he said. ``I see us  
making improvements. As a coach, you just have to take small steps 
and if the players keep taking small steps, eventually it will fall 
into place.''

(TD) throw and catch. I don't know if it gets any better than 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while the Browns' offense improved -- it couldn't possibly  
get worse -- Cleveland's defense got pushed around once again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans outgained the Browns 412-173 in total offense, held  
the ball for more than 41 minutes and ran off 74 offensive plays. 
For the second straight week Cleveland's defensive starters were 
exhausted and several cramped up on the plane ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than half of its starters coming from 1998 playoff  
teams, Cleveland's defense was supposed to be the team's strength 
this season, keeping games close while the offense matured. 
</P>
<P>
	Under former Bears coordinator Bob Slowik, the defense was  
supposed to disrupt with an attacking style. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys flying around, guys jumping up and down,'' Miller said.  
``A lot of hits in the backfield, a lot of sacks. That's what it's 
supposed to look like, a party on every play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in two games, only the Steelers' and Titans' offenses have  
been partying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns haven't forced a turnover. They have recorded just  
one sack in 164 plays, and with its cornerbacks playing soft, 
Cleveland's D has allowed opposing QBs to complete 76 percent of 
their passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just disappointed in the time it's taken for us to gel,''  
Miller said. ``We've come together slower than I predicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer isn't blaming either starting unit for the 0-2 start, and  
thinks despite the lopsided numbers his team is getting better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just one side of the ball,'' he said. ``I see us  
making improvements. As a coach, you just have to take small steps 
and if the players keep taking small steps, eventually it will fall 
into place.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Ginsburg Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is  
reported doing well after surgery for colon cancer, but it is 
unknown how long she will be away from work. A prolonged absence 
could create difficulties for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg, 66, is ``recovering without complications'' from the  
surgery she underwent Friday, court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said 
Monday. She offered no other medical update, and said she could not 
describe the extent of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg fell ill while teaching in Crete in July. She was  
hospitalized there on July 18, but initially was diagnosed as 
suffering from acute diverticulitis, a gastric disorder. The 
diagnosis was not changed to cancer until last week at Washington 
Hospital Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Her doctor, colorectal surgeon Lee Smith, said Ginsburg will  
remain hospitalized for about a week, but he refused to speculate 
when she might return to work. The Supreme Court's 1999-2000 term 
will begin Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Brief absences by any one justice generally do not create any  
logistical hardships for the nine-member court. A justice who did 
not participate in the granting of a case, or in ensuing oral 
argument, still can choose to participate in the decision-making 
process by reading briefs and a transcript of the argument session. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an absence theoretically makes it more difficult for those  
who file appeals to win court review because the four necessary 
votes must come from eight, not nine, voters. But when the court 
temporarily operated with eight justices in the past, it postponed 
action in cases that attracted three votes for review. 
</P>
<P>
	Longer absences have proved more problematic.  
</P>
<P>
	When the late Justice Lewis F. Powell missed several months of  
the 1984-85 term after undergoing surgery for prostate cancer, the 
court ordered five cases reargued the next term so he could 
participate in deciding them. The justices also resolved two key 
freedom-of-religion disputes by 4-4 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Such tie votes, traditionally announced without any written  
opinion, automatically uphold a lower court's decision and set no 
national precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell, who fully recovered from his surgery, retired in 1987  
and died last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The vacancy created by Powell's retirement was not filled until  
February of 1988 because the Senate rejected President Reagan's 
nomination of Robert H. Bork, and Douglas H. Ginsburg's nomination 
was dropped. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy got the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating with eight members for about six months took its toll  
on the court, which again had to order cases reargued and adjust 
opinion-writing assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Sandra Day O'Connor missed very little time from work  
when in 1988 she successfully was treated for breast cancer. 
Justice John Paul Stevens also missed little work when in 1992 he 
battled prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United  
States and the second-leading cancer killer, behind lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common treatment is surgical removal of the cancerous  
part of the colon and any nearby lymph nodes where the cancer has 
spread. Post-surgical radiation is often prescribed to kill any 
leftover tumor cells and decrease the chances of a recurrence.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Refuse To Suspend Sotomayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Cuban officials again refused to  
suspend high jumper Javier Sotomayor, contending his positive test 
for cocaine at the Pan American Games was the result of tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation said Monday it  
received a letter over the weekend from the Cuban federation 
rejecting the IAAF's demand that Sotomayor be suspended pending a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they have enough proof to say there was a  
manipulation of the urine sample,'' IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri 
said. ``We will now ask to see the evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world record-holder in the high jump, tested  
positive for cocaine at the Pan Am Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on 
July 30, and was stripped of his gold medal in the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor and Cuban officials, including Fidel Castro, have  
repeatedly claimed the athlete was the victim of a political 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban federation, headed by Alberto Juantorena, the 1976  
Olympic champion in the 400 and 800 meters, has defied IAAF rules 
calling for the suspension of any athlete failing a drug test. 
Juantorena is also a member of the IAAF's ruling council. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said Juantorena's letter did not say how Sotomayor's  
sample was allegedly manipulated or who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said the IAAF was pressing for more scientific  
evidence, including something from a Cuban doctor who claims it 
would have been physically impossible for Sotomayor to jump with 
the amount of cocaine allegedly found in his system. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the case would be handled by the IAAF medical  
commission or the council. The council can impose suspensions if a 
national federation refuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sotomayor case is different from normal doping cases because  
the Cubans allege the sample was manipulated, not that the result 
was inaccurate.

<HEADLINE> Dole Food Expects 3rd-Quarter Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dole Food Co. Inc. expects to take a loss  
during the third quarter as weak banana prices in Europe and the 
lingering effects of last year's citrus freeze in California help 
drive down earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues also have been affected by lower-than-expected prices  
in Dole's new fresh-cut flower business and the cost of rebuilding 
Dole operations after Hurricane Mitch, the company announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for Westlake Village-based Dole, the world's largest  
producer of fresh fruit, will fall into ``a break-even to 
slight-loss position for the quarter,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was expected to earn 13 cents per share, according  
to a First Call/Thomson Financial survey of industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	The news pushed Dole shares down $2.75 to $21.25 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Another major U.S. banana producer, Chiquita Brands  
International Inc., also has said it has been hurt by weak banana 
prices this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Weak demand in Eastern Europe and an increase in banana import  
licenses issued by the European Union have pushed prices down 
across the continent, which traditionally has been a major market 
for Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and U.S. fruit companies contend that  
the European Union unfairly restricts imports from the American 
companies. Earlier this year, the World Trade Organization ruled 
that the EU restrictions were illegal and authorized the Clinton 
administration to impose $191 million in punitive tariffs against 
European products entering the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU has been increasing banana imports in recent months,  
contributing to the oversupply, said Timothy Ramey, an analyst with 
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of a retaliatory step, I would argue,'' he said.  
``We're still in the middle of that dispute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As weather-related costs diminish and Dole's new flower business  
improves, earnings should improve despite the problems in Europe, 
said David H. Murdock, Dole's chairman and chief executive officer.

<HEADLINE> Evidence Said Ignored by Drug Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Despite growing evidence of a link between the  
diet drugs fen-phen and fatal lung disease and heart damage, a 
maker of one of the drugs reportedly lobbied the government to 
relax limits on its use. 
</P>
<P>
	Company memos in 1996 indicated that American Home Products knew  
of illnesses and deaths from the rare lung disease among users of 
Pondimin, part of the fen-phen combination, The Dallas Morning News 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company received researchers' reports of leaky heart valves  
among fen-phen users in 1997, according to the newspaper. At the 
same time, the Madison, N.J.-based company and its pharmaceutical 
division, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, lobbied members of Congress 
and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to ease restrictions 
on use of Pondimin and Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	Strategies discussed in the memos included a self-described  
``SWAT team'' to prepare testimony supporting fewer regulations and 
making an appeal to an influential lawmaker that would remain 
``below the radar screen'' of public opinion, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobbying campaign did not work, and the Food and Drug  
Administration pressured American Home Products to pull Pondimin 
and Redux from the market in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the memos proved the company, which made  
fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen combination, put profits 
over safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has been hit by multi-million-dollar jury  
awards in recent lawsuits, is trying to negotiate a settlement of 
thousands of fen-phen claims for an amount reported to exceed $3 
billion.

<HEADLINE> SeaWorld Sued for Man's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The parents of a man who was found  
dead in a killer whale's pool at SeaWorld are suing the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Dukes' naked body was found July 6, scratched, bruised  
and draped over the 5-ton Tilikum, the largest killer whale in 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old apparently made his way past security at  
SeaWorld, remaining in the park after it had closed. Wearing only 
his underwear, Dukes either jumped, fell or was pulled into 
Tilikum's huge tank. 
</P>
<P>
	A medical examiner concluded Dukes suffered hypothermia and  
drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	His parents, Patricia and Michael Dukes of Columbia, S.C., sued  
the theme park on Sept. 10, seeking ``several million dollars'' in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit contends that SeaWorld offers no public warning that  
Tilikum could kill people who enter the water. It also alleges that 
puncture wounds on Dukes' leg and foot are consistent with him 
having been pulled into the pool by Tilikum. 
</P>
<P>
	Vic Abbey, SeaWorld's executive vice president and general  
manager, called the suit ``as crazy as they come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only was that incredibly bad judgment to try to take a dip  
with a killer whale but remember, this water is 50 degrees, 
ice-cold water,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Dukes was trespassing.

<HEADLINE> Without QB McNair, Titans Adjust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Steve McNair is a mobile quarterback,  
just as liable to run as throw. Neil O'Donnell likes to get rid of 
the ball quickly. The Tennessee Titans will live with the 
difference for the next four games by changing as little as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we change our offense for Neil, we affect the other 10 guys  
on the offense,'' coach Jeff Fisher said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to stay with what you're doing. We did not change  
anything when it became apparent to us that Steve would not play. 
We're going to do things the entire offense is familiar with, not 
just doing things that suit Neil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of doing just that, the Titans (2-0) have two of the  
top five quarterbacks in the AFC after the first two games. McNair, 
who had surgery Sunday to repair a ruptured disc in his back, still 
ranks first in the conference after a career-high 341 yards passing 
in the opener. O'Donnell is fifth after going 31-of-40 for 310 
yards Sunday in his first start in place of McNair, a 26-9 victory 
over Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans also rank first in the AFC and fourth in the NFL in  
total offense, averaging 407.5 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But the challenge stiffens Sunday when the Titans visit the  
Jacksonville Jaguars, the defending AFC Central Division champions. 
McNair isn't expected back until Oct. 31, so O'Donnell is due to 
start at least the next four games. He will be tested by 
Jacksonville and the NFL's fifth-stingiest defense, giving up just 
243 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very talented, and we have to go down and play our `A'  
game, and I think we all know that,'' O'Donnell said. ``It's going 
to be a great challenge, and we'll see where we are and what's 
going on. But one game is not do or die this early yet. We'll run 
our offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher liked what he saw from O'Donnell against the expansion  
Browns. O'Donnell didn't force the ball and went to the open 
receiver as eight players caught passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's comfortable with some things,'' Fisher said. ``We're  
adjusting during the game, and he's right on top of the adjustments 
and has got good control of his huddle. The guys have confidence in 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Titans do need to change is their running attack. Pro  
Bowl selection Eddie George has yet to top 100 yards this season 
and hasn't rushed for 100 yards in nine straight games. Fisher said 
they simply have been taking what the defenses gave them the past 
two weeks but he isn't happy that they are averaging only 3.3 yards 
per carry. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee has had trouble running against Jacksonville in the  
past, and that may put pressure on O'Donnell. The offensive line 
picked up five of the Titans' seven penalties Sunday in not 
allowing a sack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to protect the quarterback at all costs, and  
it's important that we understand that he was not sacked,'' Fisher 
said in defending the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	That is because O'Donnell's backup is rookie Kevin Daft, who has  
yet to throw a pass in the NFL. So far the Titans are choosing to 
stick with those two with punter Craig Hentrich as their emergency 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, that will never happen,'' O'Donnell said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tours N.C. Hurricane Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Standing at a flooded street, President  
Clinton expressed amazement today at the devastation from Hurricane 
Floyd and promised ``we're going to be with you every step of the 
way'' in rebuilding damaged homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people know that no individual can handle this  
alone,'' the president said, announcing a package of emergency 
federal assistance programs. ``You all need to take advantage of 
these things,'' he urged residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton visited flood-stricken families taking refuge in an  
emergency shelter run by the Salvation Army and Red Cross. He said 
the extent of the flooding was ``something you would anticipate 
less than once every 500 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expressing surprise at the damage, Clinton said, ``No matter how  
much television there is, it doesn't do it justice. You can't show 
what it feels like inside for people'' who have lost homes and 
businesses or for farmers whose fields have been flooded and whose 
livestock were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things like this happen to some of us,'' the president  
said, ``we know they could happen to all of us. ... We know we have 
a responsibility as members of the American family to help you get 
back on your feet again. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we intend to do it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina Gov. James Hunt implored Clinton to ``tell the  
nation about this'' -- about the tens of thousands of people who 
have lost homes, the factories and jobs that have been flooded 
away. ``I'm asking that everybody in America help eastern North 
Carolina,'' the governor said. ``We need a lot more money than 
everything that is headed our way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said there was a ``huge, huge problem'' in housing  
because many people who lost their home did not have flood 
insurance because they were not in a flood plain. He said the 
government would try to set up trailers on their property for 
temporary housing while they rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was accompanied by the Federal Emergency Management  
Agency head, James Lee Witt, who said floods from Floyd are the 
worst he has seen in more than six years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get the devastation from the wind, but we got all  
the flooding which was just about as bad,'' Witt said as he and 
Clinton arrived in North Carolina, site of some of the worst storm 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency food stamps will help families needing a temporary  
source of low-cost food, the White House said today. A separate 
Agriculture Department program will provide farm loans at less than 
4 percent interest to help rebuild flooded farms and replace lost 
livestock. Those programs will cover hurricane victims in any 
state, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government will help fund unemployment payments for  
up to 26 weeks for workers whose jobs are on hold because of storm 
damage, Witt announced as he and Clinton arrived in Raleigh for a 
meeting with Gov. James Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Labor Department will distribute $12 million to  
temporary workers helping in cleanup, restoration and associated 
clerical tasks in hurricane-damaged areas of North Carolina, the 
White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced separate federal disaster aid for North  
Carolina last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Witt said FEMA is setting up temporary water stations in North  
Carolina, to provide showers, bathrooms and clean water, as well as 
offices where hurricane victims can apply for a variety of federal 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Witt said he will tour storm damage in New Jersey and New York  
on Tuesday. Connecticut requested help Sunday, Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 people are staying in a shelter in Tarboro,  
including many who arrived ahead of Floyd on Thursday and haven't 
been home since. Others were airlifted to safety with only the 
clothes they had on. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole town is just about inundated with water. The human  
toll on individuals and farmers is as bad as I've ever seen,'' Witt 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tarboro, the Tar River is falling slowly after cresting at 24  
feet above flood stage.
