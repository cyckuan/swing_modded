<HEADLINE> AL Calls for Pressure on Next Israeli Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Saturday urged the Arabs to join efforts in
pressing the next Israeli government to activate the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told the press that "it is important (for the Arab
countries) to work out a confrontation plan" in case that the
Israeli incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is re-elected.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if re-elected, Netanyahu and his government
"will most likely escalate matters and continue to shatter the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdel-Meguid cautioned that the pledges made by
Israel's opposition parties to advance the Middle East peace
process do not mean that possible victory of any of the blocs
"would automatically lead to a settlement" for the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Israeli Labor Party and the Centrist Party have
both expressed readiness to revive the peace process if they win
the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, Labor leader Ehud Barak and leader of the Centrist
Party Yitzhak Mordechai, among others, are running for the
premiership in the coming elections on Monday.

guard the state in spite of numerous problems challenging it.
</P>
<P>
The continued building of the government forces has led to the
dawn of peace in northern Uganda, he added.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, also the commander-in-chief of the government's armed
forces, has agreed to extend amnesty to rebels and their leaders
without discrimination in order to make a fresh start for peace.

that the wrong-doers give up their criminal acts and come back
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is on a week-long tour of northern Uganda,
also talked to local leaders and senior army officers. He
commended the government army for its efforts in cornering the

<HEADLINE> U.S., British Warplanes Continue Bombing Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes on
Saturday continued their bombardment of Iraqi civilian and
military targets, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said that at 10:35 local time (0635 GMT),
12 formations of enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace
violated Iraq's northern airspace over the provinces of Dohuk,
Erbil and Neineva.
</P>
<P>
He said the warplanes attacked some military sites in the
northern city of Mosul and a number of civilian facilities beyond
the so-called northern no-fly zone, which caused severe damage to
properties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
After the U.S.-British strikes against Iraq last December, Iraq
declared it does not recognize these restricted zones and vowed to
continue confronting any allied planes violating its airspace.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back and forced the enemy
planes to flee to their base in Turkey at 13:40 local time (0940
GMT), said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one formations of U.S. and British planes coming from
Saudi and Kuwaiti bases intruded into southern Iraqi airspace at
8:05 (0405 GMT) and 14:40 (1040 GMT) over Basra, Muthana,
Thi-Qar, Qadisiya and Misan provinces, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq's anti-aircraft units fired missiles at the
planes and repelled them at 9:35 (0535 GMT) and 16:15 (1215 GMT)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British warplanes have been regularly attacking
Iraqi military and civilian targets since last December, causing
severe civilian casualties and property damages.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Envoy Expects Peace Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's envoy to Tanzania,
Emmanuel Rwamibango, said Saturday in the Arusha Town in north
Tanzania that he is optimistic about the possibility of reaching
some agreements next month to restore peace and democracy to his
country.
</P>
<P>
Rwamibango said the ongoing Arusha peace talks facilitated by
Julius Nyerere, Tanzanian former president, is the best way of
attaining peace to the war-torn Burundi.
</P>
<P>
However, the Burundian Charge d'affaires in Tanzania did not
mention in which areas the parties may come to reach agreements.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Arusha peace talks are in the best
interest of all the feuding parties.
</P>
<P>
The envoy urged all 18 parties from Burundi to do their best to
achieve peace in the nearest possible future, reports from Arusha
said.
</P>
<P>
On last week's meeting of seven pro-Hutu parties in Moshi,
north Tanzania, the envoy said it was intended to achieve a common
position at the talks.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also dismissed as untrue that the Burundian
government is deploying tactics to slow down the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said false reports propagated by a few parties are not in
the interest of achieving peace in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The fifth round of face-to-face talks will resume next month.
The talks will discuss reports of the four committees appointed
and make necessary recommendations for a peace agreement to end
the ethnic strife, which has already claimed more than 150,000
lives since 1993 in the tiny central African nation.
</P>
<P>
The committees have been meeting in Arusha since last Monday
and are expected to wind up their work by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
The committees have been established to explore for the nature
of Burundi conflicts, look at the issues of democracy and good
governance, deal with peace and security and security, and examine
issues of refugees and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere has continued informal consultations Saturday after
arriving from Tripoli, Libya, where he met the country's leader
Muammar Gaddafi on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC)'s military intervention in Lesotho
was an "outstanding success" and similar partnerships were likely
in future, South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nzo made the remarks when he was addressing at a military base
in Bloemfontein, central South Africa, to mark the withdrawal of
SADC troops starting from Saturday after their eight month
existence in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Peace and calm have been restored to Lesotho...The
threat of a military coup has been averted and a legitimate
government is back in control."
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Botswana sent their troops in SADC's name into
Lesotho in September last year at the request of the mountain
kingdom's Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili.
</P>
<P>
SADC sent in troops fearing a coup by the Lesotho Defense Force
 following months of violent protest by opposition parties against
the outcome of the May general election.
</P>
<P>
The military intervention is said to have sparked massive
looting, burning and rioting in Maseru, the capital of Lesotho,
and two other towns.
</P>
<P>
Nine South African soldiers died, eight in combat and one in an
accident. Eighteen Lesotho soldiers were killed in fighting.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Deputy Defense Minister Roniie
Kasrils, about 30 million rand (five million U.S. dollars) had
been spent on the intervention up until December last year. The
total cost of the mission was not yet clear.
</P>
<P>
Saturday also saw the start of a new SADC mission, which will
see a 300- strong team of combined troops from South Africa and
Botswana to help the retraining and restructuring of the Lesotho
Defense Force.

<HEADLINE> Arab Candidate Withdraws From Israeli Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel's first Arab candidate
for premiership announced on Saturday that he decided to
withdraw from the election race, a move that could help Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak to win in the first round of voting on May
17.
</P>
<P>
Azmi Bishara, leader of Israel's National Democratic Assembly
(Balad Party), said he made the decision because his stay in the
race could hurt the chances of toppling the incumbent Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
However, Bishara did not call on his constituency to support
Barak, noting that he and Barak still divided on many political
issues.
</P>
<P>
Bishara, member of Israeli Kenesset (parliament), is an
advocate of equal rights for Israel's one million Arab citizens.
</P>
<P>
More than 4 million voters will take part in the coming
elections on Monday, and 11 percent of them are Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The latest public opinion poll showed that Barak would get 45
percent of the votes in the first round, while Netanyahu would
win 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's election law, if no candidate could get more
than 50 percent of the votes, a second round of voting would be
held in early June.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that Bishara would get 2.5 percent
of the vote if he stayed in.
</P>
<P>
Bishara has been under increasing pressure from other Arab
parties and political elements to step down in order to enable
Barak to increase his chances of winning in the first round of
voting.

<HEADLINE> Greek Official Criticizes Turkey for Aegean Islet Wedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos Saturday criticized Turkey for the latter's
reaction to reports of a plan by a Greek couple to marry and
settle on the islet of Platia in the Eastern Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos said that Turkish officials had earned
themselves "a spring shower" by helping to publicize a marriage on
the uninhabited rocky island, the semi-official Athens News Agency
(ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Platia lies between Kalymnos and Pserimos, and was reportedly
chosen by Greek entrepreneur Mihalis Lambropoulos and his Italian
fiancee Antonella Rossi for their wedding venue due to their
having met on Pserimos and their mutual love of the sea, but
Turkey Friday made representations over this matter to Greek
embassy officials.
</P>
<P>
Turkey accused Greece of creating artificial tension in the
Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Greece said Friday that a wedding could not constitute grounds
for political discussion and a field for creating problems.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Motion Rejected, Zyuganov Angry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov on
Saturday condemned the failed attempt to impeach President Boris
Yeltsin and said that deputies who voted against the impeachment
motion "betrayed" Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said the deputies who voted against the motion will pay with
their political careers. "The country understands what is going
on, and voters will now be able to make an assessment of each
deputy," Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
The lower house of parliament failed Saturday to set
impeachment proceedings against President Boris Yeltsin in motion
when none of the five charges brought against him received the
needed 300 votes from the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The failure marked an end of the process that lasted over half
a year in the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The charge on launching the bloody war in Chechnya received 283
votes, 17 short of the required 300 to move to the next stage of
the process.
</P>
<P>
The results of the vote for the four other charges were:
breaking up the Soviet Union in 1991, 269 votes; using force
against parliament in 1993, 263 votes; ruining the armed forces,
241 votes; and bringing about genocide against the Russian people
through policies that impoverished the country, 238 votes.
</P>
<P>
The rejection of the impeachment motion was welcome by Prime
Minister-designate Sergei Stepashin, who said an "extremely
serious" crisis has thus been averted.
</P>
<P>
"The extremely serious political crisis that could have taken
shape has been overcome. Reason has triumphed," Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very good decision and one that was expected. It
means that the State Duma will spend the rest of its time working
in a calmer regime while President Boris Yeltsin will have more
time to deal with urgent problems of the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin is waiting for confirmation by the State Duma
scheduled next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, said he
does not see the rejection as a defeat.
</P>
<P>
The impeachment action "will become a good lesson for the
future presidents of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin reacted "calmly" to the Duma vote, his spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
"This whole impeachment business is over. Yeltsin expects that
the State Duma will be able to... start considering a number of
laws that are necessary today," the Interfax news agency quoted
Yakushkin as saying.

ADDIS ABABA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health of
Ethiopia Saturday announced a short-term plan to treat the sugar
being supplied to the public with vitamin A.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the ministry was quoted here by the Ethiopian

Some 60 percent of the Ethiopian people suffer from vitamin A
deficiency and infants as well as lactating and pregnant mothers
are the prime victims, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
A national campaign is being conducted in the country to
provide vitamin A capsules to over nine million children under the
age of five and 395,585 lactating mothers from May 14-16 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that "this would not have a major effect on
the production cost of sugar."
</P>
<P>
Measures would also be taken to facilitate conditions for food
processing plants to enrich their products with vitamin A, the
ministry added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Paper Calls for Cessation of NATO Bombardment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese foremost newspaper, the
People's Daily, has urged the U.S.-led NATO to stop its air raids
against Yugoslavia and stressed that it is the precondition of any
political solution to the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The paper said, in a commentary to be carried in Sunday's issue,
that the U.S.-led NATO's atrocity of attacking the Chinese Embassy
in Yugoslavia has aroused widespread indignation. However, instead
of trying to change their stand, leaders of NATO countries have
continued the barbaric raids on the largest ever scale against
Yugoslavia while apologizing to the Chinese leaders and people.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "Stopping Bombing -- Precondition for
Any Political Solution", said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
in a welcoming speech to functionaries in the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, explicitly pointed out: "It is the time to end such a
war. No political solution can be discussed in the United Nations
amidst NATO's continuous wanton bombing." This is the principled
stance of the Chinese government and people on the political
solution to the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is well known that the Kosovo issue is an internal affair
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia involving complex ethnic and
religious contradictions. Outside military intervention will not
help solve the issue, rather will only complicate it," the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
When the Kosovo crisis first broke out, China stood for a
political solution through peaceful means, and opposed NATO's
intervention by force, it said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary went on to say that the happenings over the past
50 days have demonstrated that the lunatic bombing of Yugoslavia
by U.S.-led NATO have not solved the Kosovo crisis, rather have
caused a larger exodus of refugees and seriously devastated the
stability and peace in the Balkans and even Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It can be expected that if NATO continues with its military
intervention, the situation will become even more difficult for it
to handle. Now is the time for NATO to wake up to the danger and
stop its bombing," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It should be pointed out that the U.S.-led NATO conducted its
military intervention in Yugoslavia with no authorization of the U.
N. Security Council at all. Bypassing the United Nations, NATO's
military attacks against Yugoslavia is a gross violation of the U.
N. Charter and the norms of international laws, and a challenge to
the international stabilization mechanism represented by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the hegemonic deeds of U.S.-led NATO had
disturbed Europe and even the entire world and ran counter to the
world people's common aspirations for peace and development.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that "if these deeds are not resolutely fought
against, global peace, stability and prosperity in the 21st
century will in no way be guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led NATO's wanton bombardment has failed to subjugate the
Yugoslav people and further bombing will have no chance of success
either. The Kosovo crisis can only be brought back to the track of
political solution, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, it added, any political solution has a precondition,
that is the U.S.-led NATO must stop its bombing of Yugoslavia
immediately. If the bombing goes on, there will be no political
solution to talk about, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the United Nations, as an authoritative
international body, should play a leading role in seeking a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis. China, as a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council, will never agree to let the
United Nations discuss any political solution while the bombing is
going on, it said.
</P>
<P>
The more than 50 days of bombing by U.S.-led NATO has caused
tragic disasters to the Yugoslav people, with a large number of
innocent civilians killed or wounded, and hundreds of thousands
displaced.
</P>
<P>
This aggressive war, launched under the banner of "avoiding
humanitarian disaster," has produced the biggest humanitarian
disaster in Europe since World War II, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Now, military targets in Yugoslavia mainly destroyed, further
bombing will only kill more innocent people; further bombing will
only further expose the ferocious hegemonist nature of U.S.-led
NATO; and further bombing will only make NATO ever more isolated
in the world, it warned.
</P>
<P>
There is no peace to talk about under artillery fire, the
commentary said. All peace-loving nations and peoples in the world,
including the people of NATO countries, should unite and make
active efforts and contributions to stopping NATO's brutal bombing
of Yugoslavia and ending the Kosovo crisis as soon as possible,
the paper concluded.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Intensify in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Fighting intensified Saturday between
rebels and Nigeria-led west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG)
in Songo, 50 kilometers east of Sierra Leone's capital.
</P>
<P>
An officer of the peace-keeping force said that the rebels
attacked ECOMOG troops near Songo Friday and were repelled back
after suffering heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Loud artillery firing shocked Freetown, the country's capital,
terrifying local residents and reminding them of the rebels'
temporary control of the city last December. More than 5,000
people were killed in two weeks of battles between the rebels and
ECOMOG forces in support of the government forces.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been stepping up their raids on the outskirts
of the capital recently, in a bid to gain more weight in the
U.N.-sponsored negotiation.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials in Freetown said this week that U.N. would be
flying delegates from both sides this week to Togo to start peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader Foday Sankoh and his guerrilla leadership had
held internal talks on their uniformed stands in Togo over the
past three weeks, resulting in a position paper which a U.N.
official described as encouraging.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President-elect Stresses Food Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President-elect General
Olusegun Obasanjo has said that food production and the
development of the agricultural sector will form the cornerstone
of his administration when he takes office on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect was speaking at the palace of the Emir of
Katsina during his recent thank-you tour of the Northwest zone of
the West African country, the Daily Times newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said "if we can produce enough food to feed ourselves, half
of the problems of the country is solved."
</P>
<P>
"We will have eliminated poverty and if we are able to
eliminate hunger, the condition of poverty is already removed,"
General Obasanjo stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this year is the year of the beginning of
restoration to the country of all those things which have been
lost to it over the years.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo urged farmers in the most populous African country to
embark on large-scale farming to produce more food for
self-consumption and then export the surplus to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government will immediately find ways of
making fertilizer available to farmers by stopping the activities
of middlemen who buy the commodity at subsidized rates and then
re-sell to farmers at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow that to happen again. We are looking into
what should be the best way, if we are subsidizing fertilizer, to
get it to the farmers and not to a third party," the
president-elect pointed out.

ABU DHABI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh
Khalifa Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan Saturday met with visiting Chinese top
adviser Li Ruihuan and the two officials exchanged views on
bilateral ties and other issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), stressed the importance of maintaining the
friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches great significance to developing relations with
 the UAE, and the potential is large for the two countries to
cooperate in various fields," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident about the prospects of China-UAE
cooperation, adding his visit will push the friendship between
the two countries to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his gratitude to the UAE for its stand toward
Taiwan, which is an inseparable part of China, and he hoped that
the UAE will continue its support for China on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The prince praised the friendship between the two countries
and expressed his belief that the bilateral cooperation will
be pushed forward by Li's visit.
</P>
<P>
This is Li's first trip to the UAE in recent years.

<HEADLINE> African Countries To Speed Up Soil Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A consortium was set up at the
just-ended international workshop on sustainable management of
vertisols to carry out research on such soils in 13 African
countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Director General of the International Board
for Soil Research and Management Eric Craswell Saturday told the
Zimbabwe News Agency, "They will start sourcing for funds next
week from donor organizations."
</P>
<P>
He said they should start implementing the project next year.
</P>
<P>
The research will include techniques such as "tide-farrows"
that would help conserve water and "rod-beds" for water-locked
areas.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, vertisols, known as black clay soils and
self-churning soils, cover about five percent of the land.
</P>
<P>
They are generally found in dry areas, especially in the
southeast of the country.
</P>
<P>
Vertisols are potentially productive, but have not been
cultivated in some African countries because of the cultivation
problems, especially in relation to managing drought or
waterlogging.
</P>
<P>
Malawi, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ghana and Nigeria are
expected to benefit from the program.
</P>
<P>
Craswell said, "Each country will have its own program and it
will involve different organizations."
</P>
<P>
"If we can get the money and build the project in each country,
we might be able to reduce the cost of drought relief," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop, organized by donor organizations from
Australia, Britain and Denmark and attended by eight African
countries, ended Friday in Harare.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Visits Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami arrived in Saudi Arabia's Red Sea port of Jeddah
Saturday, kicking off a five-day official visit to the Gulf
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, the highest-ranking Iranian official to visit Saudi
Arabia since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, was greeted upon
arrival by Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz and other Saudi high-level officials.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is expected to hold a summit meeting with King Fahd
later in the day on regional, Islamic and international affairs,
as well as means of boosting bilateral ties, the Kuwait News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
His agenda also includes talks with Crown Prince Abdullah and
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Prince Sultan
Ibn Abdul-Aziz, who paid a visit to Iran early this month, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Gulf diplomatic sources said that Khatami's visit is likely to
yield tangible results in the political, trade and economic
fields.
</P>
<P>
But they were not optimistic if the two Gulf superpowers could
narrow their differences over how to maintain the security and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been opposing foreign military presence in the Gulf,
while Saudi Arabia still provides bases for U.S. and British
military forces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted Saudi officials as saying that Saudi
leaders could bring up during talks with Khatami the dispute
between Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the Gulf
islands of Abu Mussa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the three islands, which are occupied by
Tehran and claimed by Abu Dhabi, has been a main block in
the development of bilateral ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials denied that Riyadh was acting as a
mediator between the UAE and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the second leg of Khatami's three-Arab-nation
tour, which already took him to Syria, Iran's strategic Arab
ally. He will then go to Qatar for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials said that Khatami's visit to Saudi Arabia was
previously scheduled for last March, but was "adjourned due to
internal Iranian matters."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Iran were once in mistrust and discord
for nearly two decades because of Tehran's policy of exporting
its Islamic Revolution ideology. The revolution in 1979 toppled
the late Shah's regime and brought about the clergymen's rule.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two states began to improve since
President Khatami, a political moderate, took office in August
1997.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed desire for easing tension and establishing
mutual trust between Iran and the Gulf Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Saudi-Iranian ties saw a big boost in February 1998 when former
Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani went to Riyadh for
a 14-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, still an influential advisor to Iran's Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, held talks with Saudi leaders on a
broad range of issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the two countries exchanged a
number of other high-level visits aimed at coordinating
positions on ways of lifting oil prices as well as deepening
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Economic relations were also bolstered following a number
exhibitions and trade fairs held in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh and Tehran also agreed last February to resume
regular flights between the two countries after a suspension
of 20 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Admits F-16s Kill Civilians in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States admitted on
Saturday that three U.S. F-16 jets killed over 80 civilians by its
eight 500-pound bombs near the Kosovo village of Korisa.
</P>
<P>
But the Pentagon tried to shirk the U.S. responsibility for the
atrocity, saying the area was being used as a Serb military camp,
and vowed to continue NATO's bombing against Serb forces in Kosovo
even if innocent human beings had been killed.
</P>
<P>
"This accident at Korisa did not shake NATO's resolve in any
way," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said. "The air campaign will
continue, with increasing force, particularly against Serb ground
forces and police units in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
In Korisa, 70 km southwest of Kosovo's provincial capital
Pristina, grief-stricken survivors and Yugoslav officials told
reporters on Friday that at least 100 civilians were killed ans
scored injured by NATO bombing on the night of Thursday into
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The death tall was later adjusted downwards. A Yugoslav Foreign
Ministry spokesman put it at 79 killed with 58 wounded. On
Saturday, an independent Serbian news agency said the number of
dead had risen to 84 after five victims died in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Journalists found dismembered bodies scattered around, several
badly charred, some with smoke rising from them.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has said more than 1,200 civilians have been
killed and 5,000 injured since the bombing started on March 24.

<HEADLINE> This Weekend In Beijing Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- This two-day weekend, Chen Yin, a
student of the Foreign Language Department of Beijing University,
spent half a day attending academic lectures, half in managing
personal matters and a day reading on campus.
</P>
<P>
This noon, she was reading a foreign language book on the
Weiming Lake inside Beijing University, and around the lake were
many students who were chatting, strolling or reading.
</P>
<P>
The university library and self-study rooms were full of
students, and experiments in the laboratories were going on.
</P>
<P>
What is special, if at all, is that slogans condemning the NATO
atrocities remain on the walls of the corridors of dormitories,
and in Sanjiaodi of the university, candles were still burning in
memory of the three journalists killed by the NATO attack on the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia on May 8.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zhuo, a student of the university, said, "We students
firmly support the Chinese government's solemn statement and top
leaders' addresses, and we believe that the government is fully
capable of seeking justice from the U.S.-led NATO to defend our
national interests and dignity."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, more than 1,000 students attended a
ceremony where the national flag was raised on the sports ground,
at which they condemned NATO's barbaric atrocities and mourned the
killed journalists.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon, the finals of the "Beida Cup" football
match was held on campus as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
This weekend in other universities, including Qinghua
University, the People's University of China and Beijing Normal
University, is as peaceful as usual.
</P>
<P>
But many students have two more activities, namely, listening
to talks on current international affairs and watching anti-
aggression films.

<HEADLINE> Demonstrators in Cyprus Condemn NATO Bombing of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people staged a
peaceful demonstration in Cyprus on Sunday to condemn the NATO
bombing of Yugoslavia, the presence of British Bases in Cyprus and
Turkey's occupation of the northern island.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Cyprus Peace Council, the demonstration
started from Nicosia and ended near the southern coastal town of
Larnaca.
</P>
<P>
A resolution, which was adopted at the end of the march and
addressed to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, also called for the
dissolvement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is contrary to international laws, constitutes a danger
for humanity and world peace and therefore must be dissolved,"
the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
It said the U.N. role must be "strengthened and further
democratized in order to be able to resist U.S. hegemonism, to be
able to play a proper role in solving conflicts and to implement
effectively its own resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The NATO began air strikes against Yugoslavia's Serb targets on
March 24 after the Serb-led government refused to accept a peace
agreement to grant great autonomy to the independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on Kofi Annan to "intensify his efforts
for the implementation of U.N. resolutions on Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also said the two military bases Britain
retains in Cyprus since granting the island freedom from colonial
rule in 1960 must be abolished.

<HEADLINE> NATO Needs UN to Help End Kosovo Crisis - UK's Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said on Sunday that he wanted a United Nations Security Council
resolution to give NATO forces a green light to escort Kosovo
refugees back into the region.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the BBC Radio 4, Cook said he was
eagerly awaiting the U.N. resolution to give NATO forces the green
light to accompany Kosovo's refugees home.
</P>
<P>
"Through this week we have been working with our allies and
with Russia on the draft text of a resolution which would....
endorse...an international military force that could take the
refugees back in security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary also dismissed speculation that the
United States was not fully committed to NATO's air campaign.
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no reason to suggest that the Americans are
in any way not fully signed up to the NATO objectives," he said.
</P>
<P>
British newspapers on Sunday reported that the United States
was reluctant to commit ground troops in Kosovo, while Britain
underlined its position as the most hawkish member of NATO on
Saturday by putting 2,300 fighting troops on immediate standby for
the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Reopens Embassy in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Yemen reopened its embassy in
Kuwait Sunday after nearly nine years of closure due to Sanaa's
sympathy with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
After hoisting the Yemeni flag on the new embassy building,
Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Qader
Ba-Jammal said it marked a "return to good bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jamal arrived here on Saturday for a visit aimed at mending
Yemeni-Kuwaiti ties affected by the 1990-1991 Gulf war sparked by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait reduced its diplomatic representation in Yemen after
Sanaa opposed the idea of forming an international coalition to
drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit, Ba-Jamal met with Kuwaiti Emir Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and conveyed him a message from Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who invited the Emir to visit Yemen.
</P>
<P>
He also met with Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah and held talks with his Kuwaiti counterpart
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah on bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Ba-Jamal and Sabah called for unifying Arab
stands, respecting Arab and international principles and not
interfering in the internal affairs of others.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jamal also promised to help ensure the release of over 600
Kuwaiti and third countries' nationals allegedly held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Al-Sabah said Kuwait and
Yemen have "closed an old page and opened a new one" of their
bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Lome Talks for S. Leone Peace Postponed to May 24 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 16 (Xinhua) - The peace talks between the Sierra
Leonean government and the rebels scheduled for May 17 has been
postponed to May 24, a report reaching here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an unidentified senior diplomat based in
Freetown, capital of the tiny west African country as saying
Sunday that the postponement was partly due to logistical reasons.
</P>
<P>
More time is needed to put security measures in place in
Togolese capital Lome before the talks take place there, said the
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sierra Leonean government also needed more
time to study a position paper drawn up by the rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) movement.
</P>
<P>
Among the rebels' demands is the unconditional release of
their leader, Foday Sankoh, who faces execution after being found
guilty of treason.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader was allowed out of prison by the Sierra
Leonean government to travel to Togo in April this year for talks
with his field commanders.
</P>
<P>
The RUF rebels have been fighting successive governments in
Sierra Leone for eight years.
</P>
<P>
They have been joined by soldiers loyal to the military junta
that ruled the west African country for almost a year after a coup
in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
The west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG expelled the
military junta and reinstated President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are still holding places in some parts of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Killed in Embassy Attack Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The three Chinese journalists
killed on May 7 in a NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade were honored as "excellent journalists of the people" by
the All-China Journalists Association here today.
</P>
<P>
The three journalists, Shao Yunhuan of Xinhua News Agency and
the young couple of Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying of Guangming Daily,
were awarded the titles at a commemorative meeting held by the
Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party (CCCPC) and the All-China Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the three journalists, Ding Guangen, a
member of the CCCPC Political Bureau and chief of the CCCPC
Publicity Department, said at the meeting that they fulfilled
their duty with loyalty and dedication to the motherland, and
demonstrated the well-established spiritual and moral superiority
of Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
Ding expressed condolences to the families of the three
journalists and paid respect to those still working in war-torn
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Since March 24, a number of Chinese journalists have been
working in Yugoslavia amid the NATO bombing, telling the world the
facts and the truth and making important contributions to the
fight against power politics and to the safeguarding of peace,
Ding said.
</P>
<P>
He called on all Chinese journalists to study earnestly
President Jiang Zemin's speech which honored the embassy staff and
journalists working in Yugoslavia, and learn from the three killed
journalists to better serve the people and socialism.
</P>
<P>
He asked Chinese journalists to turn their grievances and grief
into strength, and closely rally around the CCCPC with Jiang Zemin
at the core, hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, work
and study hard, and dedicate themselves to the motherland and its
people.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: One Israel's Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May (Xinhua) -- To win the May 17 general
elections, Israel's main opposition party Labor formed an alliance
with Gesher and the moderate right-wing religious movement Meimad
with Labor Party leader Ehud Barak as the alliance's leader.
</P>
<P>
Barak, a candidate for prime minister, named the alliance One
Israel and formulated its platform based on Labor's policies and
principles for the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The platform says One Israel will move the peace process
forward based on the peace accords and agreements that Israel has
signed with all parties concerned, a position that is supported
by the overwhelming majority of the Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
It stresses the importance of reaching peace arrangements with
all neighbors and also the importance of fighting terrorism
targeted at Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the peace talks with the Palestinians, it says the
Jerusalem issue can not be discussed, saying "Jerusalem was, is,
and will remain the united capital of Israeli nation."
</P>
<P>
One Israel will keep the Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip under Israel's sovereignty and promises no return
to the 1967 boundaries with Palestine, according to the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
It supports the principle of physical separation between
Israel and the Palestinian autonomous areas as the primary
guarantee of the final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
One Israel favors unconditional implementation of the signed
agreements with the Palestinians to move the process forward.
</P>
<P>
But it opposes to a unilateral declaration of an independent
Palestinian state in the territories right now, saying such move
may only hinder the discussions on final status talks.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Syrian track, it says negotiations with Syria
should be renewed on the basis of the principle that "the extent
of withdrawal will match the extent of peace."
</P>
<P>
Only when Israel is certain that Syria is ready for peace with
Israel can consideration be given on the possibility of
territorial compromise on the Golan Heights, which Israel captured
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war, the platforms says.
</P>
<P>
The territorial compromise will not materialize until there is
a consensus on the questions to be addressed: the struggle against
terror and the complete disarmament of Hezbollah, control of water
resources and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's troop pullout from south Lebanon, the platform
says One Israel's plan for a phased withdrawal will be based on
guarantees by the Lebanese government to curb terrorism, and broad
international support for Israel's position on guaranteed security
for its northern borders.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic front, it promises to defend the foundations of
democracy, unify the Israeli people, integrate the immigrants into
the Israeli society, open the military service for all, speed up
economic development through more privatization drives and free
market economy, cut the unemployment rate, reform the educational
system and provide better housing and health for all.

<P>
SHENZHEN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Special posters protesting against
NATO's violent acts have attracted considerable public attention
in Shenzhen, one of China's special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
 One of the 50 posters, created by women designer Xi Yi,
displays the portraits of the three journalists killed in NATO's
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7. Beneath them
there are nine empty frames.
</P>
<P>
 "My poster indicates that if U.S.-led NATO doesn't stop its
violent bombing of Yugoslavia more precious lives will be lost!"
said Xi angrily.
</P>
<P>
 The posters were created by a number of artists in the city
who said that they hope to show their works at some international
art exhibitions in a bid to let more people understand the
reaction of the Chinese nation to the violent way the U.S.-led
NATO has behaved.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A fatal disease called cirrhosis
has claimed more than 150 lives in Afghanistan's Herat province, a
U.N. spokesperson said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Bunker said that the disease has erupted in Gulrang
district of Herat province claiming 150 to 200 lives. A number of
people, she said, are still suffering from it.
</P>
<P>
The basic cause of the disease, she said, is a poisonous plant
that grows along with the wheat crop. When the people use the
wheat bread, they suffer from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Bunker said that the U.N. agencies and non-governmental
organizations recently held a meeting in Herat province to evolve
a strategy for coping with the situation.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, a joint team of the World Health
Organization (WHO), Public Health Department and Agricultural
Department of the Taliban authorities and U.N. Foods and
Agricultural Wing visited Gulrang district and examined the
situation in 11 villages.
</P>
<P>
Bunker said that the United Nations with the cooperation of the
Taliban authorities have now dispatched medical supplies to the
disease-hit area in Herat province.
</P>
<P>
The disease had for the first time erupted in Gulrang district
some 25 years ago and now it has broken out for the second time
this year.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Chinese Long for Barrier Free Environment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Lin Hua has never been to any
department store, cinema or bookstore in the past 21 years, since
he accidentally became paralysed and was confined to a wheeled
chair in 1978.
</P>
<P>
What prevents him from taking part fully in the outside world
is nothing but simple flights of stairs.
</P>
<P>
"But ordinary people may never think it a problem. But for me
every step in department stores, theaters, libraries, railway
stations or any other place is almost a mission impossible," the
43-year-old Beijing resident complains. "Those beautiful buildings
don't have facilities for my wheeled chair."
</P>
<P>
Lin's complaints are largely shared by millions of disabled
persons who are visually challenged or have limb deformities. They
often find sidewalks, crossroads and public places an inconvenient
or even dangerous environment due to the lack of helpful
facilities, such as sidewalks with convex designs to guide blind
pedestrians, sloping roads at the entrances of buildings, and
toilets especially designed for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
"We have been promoting barrier free designs in roads, public
buildings and residential communities for more than 10 years. But
lots of new buildings are still inaccessible for disabled people,"
says Ma Yingxin, a worker at the Beijing Disabled Persons'
Federation.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest barrier hindering this work is not the lack of
technology or investment, but the lack of awareness about caring
for the disabled," says Ma, who has devoted herself to pushing
forward barrier free design work for the last five or six years.
</P>
<P>
Ma and her colleagues are taking to Beijing's major roads and
streets today to publicize their activities, calling for better
understanding and more support from the society.
</P>
<P>
The National Day of Helping Disabled People, which falls today,
is also observed around the country with the designated theme "
Barrier Free Design and Sight First".

<TEXT>
<P>
Architectural experts agree that now is a prime time for
barrier free facilities to be introduced because economic
development means there is much construction work underway.
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to create barrier free environments during this
period of mass construction, we will have to rebuild those
facilities in the future and much of money will have been wasted,"
warned architect Zhou Wenlin.
</P>
<P>
"Barrier free also includes the better exchange of information,
which needs the mass media to publish and broadcast information
for the disabled by means of subtitles, sign language or Braille,"
according to Ma.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 central and provincial television stations now
have news programs with additional sign language presenters.
</P>
<P>
China's legislative bodies have been involved in this field
since the late 1980s. According to a national law on protecting
the rights and interests of disabled people, barrier free designs
were necessary for them.
</P>
<P>
An official with the China Disabled Persons' Federation says
that they plan to join up with departments of capital construction
and architectural design to strengthen enforcement of related laws
and regulations. Roads in cities and new buildings without barrier
free designs will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, publication of audio reading materials for the blind
and broadcasting of TV programs with subtitles or sign language
will be encouraged, the official says.

MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The toll of the powerful explosions
that hit the basements of three buildings in the North Ossetian
capital of Vladikavkaz on Sunday has risen to five, the Itar-Tass
reported.
</P>
<P>
The number of the wounded was put at 26 in the blasts that
struck the buildings in the Sputnik military compound, where
servicemen of the 58th army of the North-Caucasian Military
District and their families live.
</P>
<P>
One of the victims killed in the blasts was an 8-year-old girl
died of wounds in a local hospital, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the military district Viktor Kazantsev described
the explosions as a terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
He said the perpetuators of the latest attack might be
connected with the explosion last March 19 in a Vladikavkaz
marketplace that killed 64 people and wounded over 100 others.

Rescuers were continuing their work at the scene, which was
cordoned off by police.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: 60 Burnt to Death in Fire in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 60 people were feared
burnt alive and about 100 others injured when flames of a burning
oil tanker engulfed a village in central Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
Police and eyewitnesses told Xinhua that an oil tanker filled
up to its capacity with highly inflammable petroleum product
caught fire when it turned turtle in a bid to save a cyclist at
the town of Adda Rodu Sultan in district Jhang, 65 kilometers
north of central Punjab town of Multan.
</P>
<P>
The oil started spewing from the vehicle. People from a nearby
village rushed to the scene to collect oil in their utensils and
gallons. But in the meantime, the oil tanker blew up with a bang
and engulfed the entire site.
</P>
<P>
As a result, at least 50 people were burnt to death and around
49 others sustained injuries in the fast spreading flames.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, 30 shops, 15 vehicles and 20 motorbikes
were burnt as fire also hit the surrounding areas. The oil tanker
was reduced to ashes. The fire tenders after hectic efforts of
four hours extinguished the fire and removed the tanker from the
site.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of casualties has not yet been determined as
the entire administration is engaged in rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Emergency has been declared in Jhang. The injured have been
rushed to nearby hospitals for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The fire tenders from all over Faisalabad Division have come to
the rescue and have been trying their best to douse the fire and
clear the area from the hazards.
</P>
<P>
The fire has created a panic in and around the whole area as
many people are seen trying to ascertain the identity of their
relatives. A gloomy atmosphere prevailed all over the area after
the tragic incident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Rafiq Tarar and Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif have expressed shock and grief over the tragic incident and
condoled with the bereaved families.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Slams Bishara, Mordechai for Withdrawing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Sunday lashed out at two candidates for bowing out the
race for premiership on the eve of the May 17 elections as their
withdrawal might dim the prospect of his re-election.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held less than two hours after Center
Party Yitzhak Mordechai announced his withdrawal, Netanyahu
questioned Mordechai's credibility, saying the latter had promised
to stay on in the campaign after the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called on those who had left Likud and joined the
Center Party to back to Likud, saying it was their real "home."
</P>
<P>
Most members of the Center Party are moderate ex-Likuds
dissatisfied with Netanyahu's hard-line policies.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his long-awaited withdrawal, Mordechai said he did
not want to see an extended campaign which might turn into
violence.
</P>
<P>
If no candidates get more than 50 percent of the votes in the
first round, a run-off will be held on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said he made up his mind also because he realized
that he would have no chance to reach his goal of ousting
Netanyahu. He called on his followers to vote for Ehud Barak, the
One Israel leader.
</P>
<P>
Barak is increasing his edge over Netanyahu in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
A former Likud member and serving as defense minister in
Netanyahu's cabinet, Mordechai has been steadily sliding on
opinion polls in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
But he had worked hard to resist pressure from within and
outside his party to give up his candidacy and throw support
behind Barak, partly because he promised during a televised
debate with Netanyahu last month that he would not withdraw
from the race before the voting.
</P>
<P>
His decision came hours after Azmi Bishara, the first Arab
candidate running for Israel's prime minister, announced his
withdrawal from the race Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu suggested at the news conference that Bishara had
reached a deal with Barak before he dropped out of the
campaign, including a promise from Barak that he would release
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails who were involved in
violence against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
If Barak won the elections, he would form a left-wing
government with Arab, Communist, Meretz and other anti-Zionist
parties, Netanyahu warned, adding that he would establish a
national government if he won.
</P>
<P>
It's widely believed that the withdrawal of Bishara and
Mordechai will significantly boost the chance of Barak in the
elections. Polls even suggested that Barak might well win the
race in the first round.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing candidate Benny Begin has said that he would
make a decision on whether to stay on in the race later Sunday.
But analysts said his decision would have no much impact on
the results since he mainly takes votes away from Netanyahu.

SHANGHAI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Early this morning, 69-year-old Li
Amao and her husband and daughter, an ordinary family in Shanghai,
China's leading industrial and commercial city, were busy making
dumplings and some other typical dishes. They were expecting an
American couple for lunch.
</P>
<P>
For them, one of the Shanghai households that are open to
foreign tourists for them to share local people's daily life, this
lunch was not much different from the previous ones they have
offered to thousands of foreigners over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
At 11:30, the couple, the Eddies from Los Angeles, were
welcomed into the house. As Li distributed the food to their
plates they sampled every dish with Mrs. Eddie saying every now
and then," I'm full up."
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, the Arens, another American couple from
Detroit, entered Gong Chahua's home as guests.
</P>
<P>
"I was considering giving up my plan to travel to China three
days ago as I was not sure I would be safe here, but a friend of
mine in Beijing called me and told me there was no need to worry,"
said Mr. Arens who was in China for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"Now I've found there is really no need to worry. Everybody
here is friendly to me," Arens added.
</P>
<P>
Arens said one of his daughters is coming here next week to
work at the Shanghai General Motors Corp.(SGM), the largest Sino-U.
S. joint venture based in Shanghai's Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
"We have no worries about her living here," Arens said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese students started holding demonstrations in major
Chinese cities on May 8 to denounce the U.S.-led NATO's missile
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on May 7 that killed
three and wounded more than 20. This had made some foreigners feel
uneasy.
</P>
<P>
However, at a commodious and tidy workshop of the corporation
where Miss Arens will work, Buick cars keep coming off the
production line one.
</P>
<P>
While making his rounds, Vice General Manager Philip Murtaugh
told Xinhua that none of the 100-odd American employees and
suppliers applied to return to the United States during the week.
</P>
<P>
They felt safe here and nothing abnormal has happened to the
corporation, Murtaugh said.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Reform and Opening Up: Vice-PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said
here today that China will, as always, firmly stick to its reform
and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
Li, meeting with Tim Fischer, Australia's deputy prime minister
and minister of trade, said China will continue to carry out
economic, trade, scientific and other cooperation with other
countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-
existence and the principle of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived in Beijing earlier today as Li's guest,
expressed deep condolences to the families of the three
journalists killed on May 7 during a U.S.-led Nato's attack on the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Li said the missile attack, which seriously damaged the embassy
and caused the loss of lives, openly trampled on the principles of
the UN Charter and relevant international laws, and savagely
infringed upon China's sovereignty, and has thus aroused strong
indignation of all the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's speech and the statement issued by the
Chinese government have fully demonstrated China's solemn stance,
Li said, stressing that the U.S.-led Nato should shoulder all the
responsibilities arising therefrom, and give a full explanation in
accordance with China's demands.
</P>
<P>
"China is a peace-loving country, and the Chinese people can
never be humiliated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that he and the Australian government attach great
importance to relations with China, and the Australian government
and people are looking forward to President Jiang's state visit
to Australia later this year.
</P>
<P>
Li said Jiang's visit will be of great significance and push
forward the overall development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said the economies of the two countries are complementary,
and that there is great potential for further cooperation. China
is willing to keep the momentum for good economic and trade
cooperation, and strive to establish long-term, stable and healthy
bilateral ties with Australia through joint efforts.

<HEADLINE> African Potato Can Cure AIDS: S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- South African traditional
doctors have claimed that they can cure AIDS, a deadly infective
disease, with " Labatheka", namely the African Potato.
</P>
<P>
Local daily City Press Sunday quoted traditional doctor Mondli
Mdungwa as saying that "With the African Potato, you just put into
a pot, pour water over it and let it boil for something like three
hours.
</P>
<P>
"After that you let the water cool down and then you drink the
water. After two to three days you will be completely healed,"
claimed Mdungwa.
</P>
<P>
Saying the African Potato helps to clean Aids patients' blood
and to boosts their immune system, Mdungwa urged the government to
make full use of the traditional herb medicine rather than using
the expensive AZT in curing AIDS disease.
</P>
<P>
AZT was discovered recently as a drug that can minimize the
transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes
AIDS, from the pregnant mother to the child.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest survey, the number of South African
pregnant women with HIV has increased by 34 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Mdungwa expressed belief that more would be achieved if other
players in the health care sector join hands to improve access to
herbs like the African Potato.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Many Nepalese Try Fortune Abroad Without Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Due to poverty and unemployment
at home, many Nepalese have gone to foreign countries to try their
fortune, but few of them have been lucky enough to fulfill their
dreams.
</P>
<P>
India, the Gulf and Southeast Asian nations are the favorable
places for them, the majority of whom being unskilled or
semi-skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
They usually work abroad at hotels, restaurants, construction
sites and factories, the Nepali press said.
</P>
<P>
A Nepalese journalist visited Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates not long ago and met with some Nepalese working there. He
told Xinhua that their conditions were not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Tej Prasad Bhattarai, who had completed the bachelor's degree
in management in Nepal, worked as a cleaner in Doha, capital of
Qatar.
</P>
<P>
He said he came to Qatar after failing to find a job in
Kathmandu. "I had to spend 60,000 rupees (920 U.S. dollars) to get
this job including the airfare, but I came to know when I came
here that it was not necessary to pay anything to the employment
agency," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We get very low salaries in comparison to other countries'
workers," he complained.
</P>
<P>
Narendra Thapa, who worked at a construction company in Doha,
was full of grievances.
</P>
<P>
"The manpower company had told me that I would get a job of
salesman in a supermarket and the salary would be over 1,200
riyals per month, but I did not get that job and salary," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I was compelled to work in the construction company, it is
very difficult to work here. I'm the only son of my parents and I
could earn more than this in Nepal if I work hard," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to work here due to the high temperature
and the dangerous work," he said. "Working in the construction
site is really difficult. You can see my callous hands. I'm
spending the hard days and I will never come to the Gulf countries
again."
</P>
<P>
When narrating his story, the young man sobbed, vowing that he
would go home after earning back the amount given to the manpower
company in Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
"Tell people not to come to this hellish land. I'm trapped,
there is no life. We can earn more than this in Nepal if we do any
business or work with the amount spent for the manpower company,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He advised others not to go through the employment agencies in
Nepal "because they charge a lot of money and prepare fake
documents."
</P>
<P>
The cases of seeking fortunes in foreign countries but landing
in despair are quite common among the Nepalese who seek jobs
abroad due to widespread poverty and unemployment at home.
</P>
<P>
According to the Asian Development Bank, the level of poverty
is 42-50 percent in Nepal; though official unemployment rate was
14 percent in 1997, underemployment was widespread at about 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said that every year tens of thousands of
people cross the open border to big Indian cities for jobs. Others
pay a hefty sum of money to the manpower companies to get
themselves landed in Southeast Asian and Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
The exact figure of the Nepalese working abroad is not
available. According to Nepal's Labor Ministry, around 20,000
Nepalese nationals are working in the Gulf region, and 10,000 in
Malaysia who entered the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali press said most of them find it hard to get ideal
jobs or are ill-treated with women usually being sexually
exploited by the employers. Last year, a Nepalese woman committed
suicide in Kuwait after being sexually abused by her employer.
</P>
<P>
Now women are barred from going to the Gulf region for jobs.
</P>
<P>
Tirth Raj Wagle, second secretary at the Nepalese Embassy in
Saudi Arabia, agreed that the conditions of the Nepalese working
in the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia in particular, were very
pitiable.
</P>
<P>
"Some Nepalese have to work in the desert without salary. They
are threatened," he said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said most of them were cheated by the manpower
agencies in Nepal. They were told that they would get good jobs
and standard salaries but in fact they were sent abroad as
laborers.
</P>
<P>
He said employers in Saudi Arabia did not pay the Nepalese
employees. They argued that the agreements were signed this way
with the Kathmandu-based manpower supply agencies.
</P>
<P>
"How can they get good jobs without qualification, skills,
training and language? But they believe in the manpower agencies,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bal Bahadur Rai echoed. Working as a salesman in Dubai, the
United Arab Emirates, he was among the luckiest. He had a mobile
telephone and a car.
</P>
<P>
He said to get good jobs as salesman, accountant and
receptionist, people should understand that "without any training
and skills, these jobs cannot be found and they cannot work."
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing well, I came here five years ago, I had four years
working experience in a five-star hotel in Kathmandu. We should be
skillful to get a good job," he stressed.

Zenawi, accompanied by Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin, left here

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Paper Slams NATO' Attack on Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- An article carried by official New
Nigerian newspaper Sunday slammed the U.S.-led NATO's missile
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Journalist Charles Onunaiju, in an signed article
titled "U.S., NATO aggression: after China, who next?", suggested
that Nigeria must not sleep with two eyes closed beyond NATO's
attack of the Chinese embassy and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO forces attacked the Chinese embassy with five
missiles in Belgrade last Friday, killing three Chinese
journalists and wounding more than 20 others.
</P>
<P>
Onunaiju expressed his shock at the attack just weeks after
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's official visit to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
He also felt indignant at Nato's "half-hearted" apologies long
after its "tragic mistake," saying that the scope of U.S.- NATO's
aggression has no limit.
</P>
<P>
Now the Chinese and the rest of the world should be fully
alerted that former U.S. President Ronald Reagan's slogan "if you
want peace, you must prepare for war" is a carefully nurtured
long-time strategy, Onunaiju noted.
</P>
<P>
China is put under test by the reckless and irresponsible
attacks on its embassy, he said, adding that Nigeria must not
sleep with two eyes closed beyond America's rhetoric for democracy
and safeguard of human rights.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Netanyahu Slams Bishara, Mordechai for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Sunday lashed out at two candidates who withdrew their
candidacy for premiership on the eve of the upcoming elections
Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a hastely-convened news conference at his office, Netanyahu
suggested that Azmi Bishara, who announced his withdrawal from
the race Saturday night, had reached agreement with his main
rival, One Israel leader Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
He said Barak agreed to release Palestinian prisoners in
Israeli jails who took part in terror attacks against Israelis in
exchange for the support of Bishara, the first Arab Israeli
candidate running for prime minister, for his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
If Barak won the elections, he would form a left-wing
government with Arab, Communist, Meretz and other anti-Zionist
parties, Netanyahu said, adding that he would establish a
national government if he won.
</P>
<P>
With anger in his voices, Netanyahu slammed Center Party leader
Yitzhak Mordechai for breaking his public promises not to quit
before the voting Monday. Mordechai announced his decision to
drop his candidacy Sunday noon and called on his supports to
endorse Barak, who is leading over Netanyahu in polls.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called on those who joined the Center Party, mainly
formed by moderate Likud members dissatisfied with Netanyahu's
hard-line policies, to join and back Likud again.
</P>
<P>
"Go home Go home Likud is your home," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legal Scholars Say Organ Transplant Law Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legal and medical scholars
have suggested that China pass a law on human organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
At a recent national seminar on the law and organ transplants,
in Wuhan, 40 scholars discussed the legislative implications of
organ transplants in China and agreed that, with modern medical
developments, organ transplants are now a widely recognized new
method of treating illnesses and China has improved the level of
its organ transplant technology.
</P>
<P>
Chinese doctors now transplant kidneys, livers, and hearts, as
well as pancreas, spleens, thyroid glands, adrenal gland, bone
marrow, and the thymus.
</P>
<P>
The problem Chinese doctors face with organ transplants is a
lack of donors, according to the scholars.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day seminar, the participants made suggestions
protecting the benefit and rights of both organ donors and the
recipients.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored by the China Internal Organ
Transplant Development Foundation and Chinese Medical Association.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have developed
a new chemical mixture that generates oxygen inside a confined
space and has potential military and civilian applications, Press
Trust of India (PTI) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Based on potassium superoxide, the oxygen-regenerating
composition generates oxygen by simultaneously absorbing carbon
dioxide. One gram of the composition, available in sheet and
granule forms, produces 200 cubic centimeters of pure oxygen.
</P>
<P>
The composition controls humidity, oxidizes all organic gases
released by humans and kills bacteria. It can withstand shock and
vibration and does not ignite or explode during friction. It can
be used in sealed battle tanks, underground control rooms and
bunkers in nuclear, underwater chemical warfare, submarines,
deep-sea diving, underwater operations, deep mines and toxic
chemical plants.
</P>
<P>
The technology for the composition has been transferred to a
Mumbai-based company.

<HEADLINE> China to Persist in Reform and Opening: Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China's top adviser Li Ruihuan,
who is on a three-day visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
Sunday stressed that China will continue its policy of reform and
opening to the outside world, no matter what happens.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what happens and what difficulties we meet, we will
not change our policy of reform and opening to the outside
world," Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said
in his talks with Speaker of the UAE Federal National Council
(FNC) Mohammed bin Khalifa al Habtour.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that reform and opening is a principle that China
will never give up.
</P>
<P>
"It is this important principle that has brought about the
great changes in China," Li said, adding that China has made
significant progress in economic and social development in the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations with the UAE, Li said he was
satisfactory with the cooperation between the two countries in
political, economic, trade, health and other fields, which has
been very fruitful since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC hopes to enhance its cooperation with the FNC in
order to promote the understanding between the two peoples and to
further improve bilateral relations, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Habtour praised China's policy of reform and opening, saying
he was impressed by the great progress China had made in economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the Chinese government and its people would
be able to overcome all the difficulties they might meet in the
process of reform.
</P>
<P>
He said the UAE paid much attention to its relationship with
China since the Asian giant plays an important role in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
Li's visit will certainly help build closer relations between
the two countries and increase their cooperation in all fields,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here on Saturday after ending his official visit to
the Republic of Korea. The four-country tour will also take him
to Oman and Egypt.

ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 people were feared
burnt alive and around 49 others injured when flames of a burning
oil tanker engulfed a village in central Punjab province.

immediately end their war and to implement the 11-point framework
agreement.

<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- Severe doubt was cast Saturday night on NATO claims that it
had attacked a legitimate military target when it dropped eight
bombs on the village of Korisa, killing at least 87 civilian
people and injuring a hundred more in the most deadly blunder of
the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair feels "a very deep sense
of frustration" with U.S. President Bill Clinton after failing to
persuade him to commit ground troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- Doctors will tell the Government this week that too little
is known about the long-term risks of eating genetically modified
(GM) food to guarantee its safety. They will warn that GM crops
pose a potential threat to human health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook will fly to Washington
this week for crisis talks to stiffen Western resolve in the war
against Serbia amid growing British military frustration over
America's reluctance to commit ground troops.
</P>
<P>
The Mail on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
--NATO warplanes are running out of legitimate targets in
Yugoslavia and will soon be forced to bomb previously destroyed

<HEADLINE> Mordechai Quits Race for Premiership in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Center party leader
Yitzhak Mordechai announced on Sunday to rescind his candidacy
for premiership in the Monday elections.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Tel Aviv, Mordechai, one of
the four prime ministerial candidates, said that after
consultations with his party's key members, he decided to quit
the race in order to bring the incumbent Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the ruling Likud party, and his
government down, in the first round of voting scheduled for
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is my second most difficult decisions in my whole life,
the first one was my leaving from the Defense Ministry and this
one of withdrawing from the candidacy of the primership,"
Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said his decision of pulling out is to avoid any
bloodshed or political conflict that might happen during the
elections.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that his withdrawal could enhance the chance for One
Israel leader Ehud Barak to beat Netanyahu in the first round of
voting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Another prime ministerial candidate, Balad leader Azmi Bishara,
announced his pullout of the race Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
And Benny Begin, leader of the right wing National Union party
and another prime ministerial candidate, is still undecided
whether to quit the race.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the real contest for the premiership during Monday's
voting will be carried out between Netanyahu and Barak. The
pullouts by Bishara and Mordechai will definitely enhance Barak's
chance of winning the election in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Weekend polls showed Barak with 44 percent to 48.5 percent of
the votes before a Bishara pullout, and 47 percent to 49.5 percent
of the votes after. With the withdrawal of Mordechai, the polls
indicated, Barak will be on the edge of victory by getting more
than 50 percent of the total votes.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and several key Likud members are holding an urgent
meeting Sunday to discuss the new development. But it may be a
little late for him to hammer the message home, though the Likud
can be counted on to make plenty of noise about the withdrawals
by Bishara and Mordechai.

session Sunday morning in Zhuhai bordering Macao and decided to
report the selected candidate of the first chief executive of the
Macao SAR to the central government of China for appointment.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the appointment is made, the first chief executive
designate will be responsible for handling various affairs related
to constructing the first government of the Macao SAR, which will
be set up on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
The session was convened following the third plenary meeting of

was held.
</P>

election.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee,
delivered a report at the session recounting the entire process of

be taken as the captain who shoulders heavy responsibilities,"
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with the support of the central government and
the people in the motherland, the first chief executive, along

<HEADLINE> Hungary Vexed by Snag in MIG Parts Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Hungary has expressed its
displeasure over Russia's failure to provide spare parts for its
MIG-29 fighter planes, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Describing Moscow as an "unreliable partner," the Hungarian
Defense Ministry noted that by a bilateral pact the spare parts
should have been delivered to Hungary before the end of 1998, said
Interfax, quoting a Russian military source.
</P>
<P>
The source also said that Hungary may decide to reverse its
plan to upgrade the existing 26 MIG-29 fighters, the nucleus of
its air force, which could cost Russia over 80 million U.S.
dollars in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian Defense Ministry said the military
leadership has not "frozen" its military-technical cooperation
with Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Relations have worsened between Russia and Hungary, a new NATO
member, especially after the Atlantic alliance launched air
strikes on Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
In April a convoy of Russian trucks with humanitarian
assistance for Yugoslavia was stranded in Hungary for several days.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Attack on Chinese Embassy Deserves Universal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO's air attack on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade is a diabolical act deserving universal
condemnation, a Bangladeshi scholar told Xinhua on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy clearly
constitutes a gross violation of Chinese sovereignty, said Nurul
Huda Mirza, a China expert.
</P>
<P>
NATO attacked the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia on May 8,
killing three Chinese journalists and injuring over 20 others,
with several of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
There was no precedent for such an attack, and it could not be
unintentional, according to Mirza.
</P>
<P>
The attempt of the U.S. and NATO to cover up their heinous act
by inventing the story of mistaken identify is totally
unacceptable, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"It only further exposes the global aggressive nature and
intentions of the NATO-U.S. military combine," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly support the view of the Chinese government and the
Chinese people that China reserves the right to take appropriate
action against such criminal violation of China's sovereignty," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Cut Defense Spending in Coming Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has planned
to cut down defense spending by 22 percent in the coming financial
year in order to fund other priorities like education, health and
poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Gerald Sendaula has had two meetings with the
concerned members of Parliament on this topic, the New Vision
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Defense expenditure this financial year is expected to top 213
billion shillings (150 million U.S. dollars) and government wants
it drastically cut to 170 billion shillings (121 million dollars)
in the next financial year.
</P>
<P>
However, this year it was meant to be 163 billion shillings
(114 million dollars) but it rose to the projected 213 billion
shillings due to unforeseen expenses.
</P>
<P>
Donors are worried of this rise in defense spending. In March
this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) postponed 20
million dollars disbursements to Uganda, arguing that the country
had not met some of the conditions set in the Extended Structural
Adjustment Facility.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team was in Uganda in February to review the program.
It is expected here soon again to discuss Sendaula's proposed
cuts.
</P>
<P>
One of the IMF findings was that the country's defense spending
had gone up to 2.2 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
instead of the prescribed 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Uganda now has a foreign debt of 3.6 billion dollars and one
third of the annual budget is funded by foreign donors' money.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urged to Open Up Boundaries for Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister of Trade Joseph
Kamotho has urged South Africa to open up its boundaries for the
free flow of trade within the region instead of pursuing
protectionist policies that were hurting its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Kamotho Saturday called for the South Africa government to join
or accede to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) so as to allow for fair competition with the other member
states.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA's policy organs are currently holding meetings in
Kenyan capital Nairobi, aiming to prompt the process of trade
liberalization and regional integration.
</P>
<P>
Although Kenya will not go back to adopt trade controls, the
government was reviewing the trade licensing act to make it sure
that the country does not become a dumping market, the state-run
weekly The Herald Sunday quoted Kamotho as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that a country like South Africa,
which has a strong economy, should be able to help its neighboring
states to develop rather than concentrate on exporting their
products to the region and allowing less products to penetrate
into its market.
</P>
<P>
Kamotho noted that having a more developed economy than the
rest of the other COMESA nations could not be an excuse for South
Africa to practise unfair trade policies at the expense of its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Giving statistics, the minister said trade with South Africa
where Kenya exported goods worth two billion shillings (about 31
million U.S. dollars) and bought goods from it worth 20 billion
shillings (about 310 million dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
This was not an encouraging trend for Kenya, Kamotho said,
adding that his government was addressing this issue meticulously
with a view to ensuring that the country benefited from any trade
with South Africa.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A 25-kilometer "Freedom from
Hunger" Walk was staged in Kenyan capital Nairobi Saturday in a
bid to raise social awareness of hunger among fellow countrymen.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 percent of Kenya's 28 million population are living
under the poverty line in the east African country, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The walk, whose theme was "walk, walk and say no to hunger",
was attended by hundreds of people including students, hawkers,
cabinet ministers and foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Robbing cases were also reported in some sections of the route,
the Daily Nations newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a concert was held in Nairobi to mark the 24-hour
fasting event which aims to help the people affected by famine.
</P>
<P>
Before the walk was flagged off by Kenyan Agriculture Minister
Musalia Mudavadi, he had urged the police to beef up security for
participants.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of agriculture and food
sectors to the realization of Kenya's 2020 industrialization goal.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Barak Gets Boost from Minor Candidate's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Ehud Barak, the most promising
candidate for prime minister in Israel's upcoming elections, has
got an expected boost as an Arab candidate bowed out of the race.
</P>
<P>
Azmi Bishara, the first Arab Israeli candidate competing for
the top government office in Israel, announced Saturday his
decision to drop his candidacy in hope that the result of the
elections will be decided in the first round Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although he said he did not call on his supporters to back
Barak in the voting Monday, it's widely believed that most of his
voters will vote for Barak, leader of the One Israel alliance.
</P>
<P>
At 18 percent of the Israeli population, Arab Israelis are a
key voting bloc in Israel. Traditionally, they tend to vote for
left-wing candidates in Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak has widened his lead over his main rival, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, to as many as 12 percentage points in some
opinion polls over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
But he might lose his edge if a second round is held since
most of the Arab voters may stay at home after voting for their
parties in the first round. One Israel has conducted extensive
negotiations with Bishara to persuade him to quit.
</P>
<P>
A second round will be held on June 1 if no candidates get
more than 50 percent of the votes in the first round.
</P>
<P>
When declaring his candidacy in late March, Bishara, a
43-year-old philosophy professor, admitted that he would have no
chance of winning the elections, but said that his main purpose
is to draw attention to problems facing about the one million
Arab Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Arab Israelis complain that they are discriminated against in
this Jewish country, saying their economic, educational,
employment rights have been ignored by various Israeli
governments.
</P>
<P>
But Bishara's candidacy has caused concern among other Arab
parties. They said his candidacy might split Arab votes, thus
harming Arab interests in Israel's next parliament and hampering
their goals to elect a premier who is more keen on the
Israeli-Arab peace process than hard-line Netanayhu.
</P>
<P>
Under increasing pressure from these Arab parties, Bishara
said earlier this week that he would drop out of the race if he
is convinced that Barak will do more for Israel's Arab minority.
</P>
<P>
One Israel sources said that Barak had outlined a 10-point
program for dealing with the problems in the Arab sector. But
Bishara said Saturday that he still has disputes with Barak over
a lot of issues.
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that Bishara's withdrawal might trigger the
other two minor candidates, right-wing Benny Begin and Center
Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai to leave the race as well, thus
turning the five-way race into a one-to-one dual Monday.
</P>
<P>
Begin suggested Friday that he would announce his withdrawal
Sunday if he could find a reason for doing so. But Mordechai has
vowed to stay on.
</P>
<P>
But polls have shown that with Bishara bowing out of the race,
Barak might have chances to get more than 50 percent of the votes
in the first round, even if Mordechai is still in.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Laud Election of Macao SAR Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- All the major newspapers here Sunday
gave extensive coverage to the election of the first chief
executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region, describing
it as "unprecedented" in the history of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily, the leading local newspaper, devoted its
entire frontpage to the election and printed more than a dozen
color inserts celebrating Edmund Ho Hau Wah's election as the
first chief executive of Macao SAR. Macao will return to the
motherland on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
"The election will... end the history of Macao's administrative
head being appointed by colonialists and marks a day when the
Macao residents feel especially proud and elated," the newspaper
said in a frontage editorial.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the history of Macao that its
administrative head is elected by a Selection Committee comprised
by local residents, marking the beginning of real democracy in
Macao, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Tai Chung Pou, another major newspaper, said the election
has opened the prelude to a new "election culture" in Macao and
ushered in a new epoch of "Macao people governing Macao."
</P>
<P>
It also reflects the spirit of "fairness, impartiality,
openness, honesty, and democracy", the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Jornal Va Kio, another newspaper, said the victory of Edmund Ho
in the election indicates that he commands the "popular support"
of the Macao people. Edmund Ho won 163 out of a total of 199 votes
in Saturday's election.
</P>
<P>
"The election of the chief executive is an unprecedented and
successful event with far-reaching significance," the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao erased the humiliation of Macao being ruled
by outsiders, ushering in a new era of "Macao people governing
Macao," it said.
</P>
<P>
The election has not only enriched the election culture, but
also aroused people's interest in politics, it said, adding that
the Macao residents hope that the chief executive will, among
other things, give his priority to developing the economy and
improving public security.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were killed
and around 50 injured early Sunday morning when an express train
derailed near Multan, central Punjab city, sources from Multan
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that out of 10 apartments, eight were derailed
at 2:45 (21:45 GMT) Sunday morning when the train reached in
between Adam Sawaba and Sadiqabad Railway station, about 215
kilometers south of the central Punjab city of Multan.
</P>
<P>
At least five passengers including a child were killed while
around 50 others sustained injuries, six of them in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Out of total 10 apartments, eight besides the locomotive of the
train have been damaged while the rest two coaches are said to be
safe in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry Mohammad Hafeez, driver of the train, said that he was
negotiating a turn when the engine clipping system broke down and
the engine separated from the train. The engine stopped after
around 40 meters, Hafeez said.
</P>
<P>
Hafeez did rule out terrorist attempt in the accident.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Developing Economies' Involvement Needed in Global Financial Reforms: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANGKAWI, Malaysia, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Finance Minister
Xiang Huaicheng said Sunday that the redesigning of the
international financial architecture should involve economies as
many as possible, especially the wide participation of the
developing economies.
</P>
<P>
What happened in the past two years shows that the new market
economies are most easy to be affected, so the process of
formulating rules and regulations should involve them and respect
their views and opinions, and should not be controlled by a few
countries, the Chinese finance minister said here Sunday at the
on-going APEC finance ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
In fact, this is a practical requirement of the economic and
financial globalization, he said, adding only with broad
participation can the global issues be addressed effectively.
</P>
<P>
Xiang hoped the international community could reach a consensus
as soon as possible on the issue of strengthening the supervision
of short-term capital flows, and to establish at an early date
necessary mechanism and standards for the effective supervision of
short-term and orderless international capital flows and
manipulation activities, particularly the hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
He was also of the view that the private sector's involvement
in the protection and resolution of the crises plays an important
part in strengthening the international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
The transparency and information disclosure of the private
sector need to be strengthened and the international community
should establish relevant mechanism to promote the involvement of
the private sector in the protection and resolution of crises, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The reforms of the international financial architecture was one
of the major topics discussed at the two-day sixth APEC finance
ministers' meeting which opened here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, as host of the meeting, is looking forward to
concrete and practical outcomes on key aspects relating to reforms
of the international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
APEC, formed in 1989, comprises Australia; Brunei; Canada;
Chile; China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; South Korea;
Malaysia; Mexico; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; Peru; the
Philippines; Russia; Singapore; Chinese Taipei; Thailand; the

DHAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance
started a massive campaign against the government on Sunday
morning, to protest against the worsening law and order, water,
power and gas crisis and price hikes of essentials.
</P>
<P>
As part of the program, the major opposition -- the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) -- started its three-day "road march" to
Panchaghar, the district in the northwestern tip of the country,
at 9 a.m. from the capital city, led by the party's chief and
leader of the Opposition in Parliament Begum Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
She will address public meetings at 24 points on the road march
of about 500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaat-e-Islami started its march from Dhaka to Khulna,
southwest of the country, at 8 a.m., led by Party Ameer Professor
Golam Azam.
</P>
<P>
The Jatiya Party (Ershad), headed by Party Chairman H.E.
Ershad, began its long march to Mymensingh, in the north of the
country, while the Islami Oikya Jote was led by its leader
Shaikhul Hadhith Maulana Azizul Haq to march toward northeastern
Sylhet district.
</P>
<P>
The government withdrew on Saturday a ban on the use of
Bangabandhu Bridge for the road march of the BNP after a
negotiation with BNP leaders. The government imposed the
restriction on Thursday, three days before the march, because of
"intelligence reports of possible sabotage" during the march.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 police and four platoons of the para-military
Bangladesh Rifles would be deployed in and around the bridge,
reports said.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Warmly Acclaim Election of MSAR Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers Sunday
warmly acclaimed the election of the first Chief Executive of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Prominent Macao banker Edmund Ho Hau Wah, 44, won 163 of the
199 votes cast Saturday in Macao at the third plenary meeting of
the Selection Committee for the first government of Macao SAR and
became the first Chief Executive of the future MSAR. The Selection
Committee will report the result of the election to the central
government for appointment.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao in its Sunday editorial said that the election of
Ho as the first Chief Executive of MSAR shows that Macao people
want to have a strong government to face up to future challenges.
</P>
<P>
The election was conducted in the principle of fairness,
impartiality, openness, democracy and honesty, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Ridding themselves of the yoke of colonial rule over the past
400 years and becoming masters of Macao for the first time in
history, the Macao people had shown great enthusiasm for the
election and displayed the tradition of loving the motherland and
Macao, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The paper expressed the firm conviction that Ho and the future
MSAR government, with the support from the Central Government,
will earnestly implement the Basic Law of the Macao SAR and carry
out the principle of Macao people ruling Macao, solve all the
problems lying ahead and guide Macao successfully into the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po said in an editorial that the election of the first
Chief Executive for the MSAR has created favorable and necessary
conditions for the formation of the future MSAR government.
</P>
<P>
The election result shows that Ho enjoys strong public support
and is capable of forming a sound government and dealing with all
problems, including the high crime rate.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the MSAR will help further strengthen
relations between Macao and Hong Kong and provide more
opportunities for exchanges between the two regions and promote
the development of the two SARs.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily said that the selection of the first
Chief Executive for MSAR was a big step forward in Macao's smooth
handover to China and in realizing the process of Macao people
ruling Macao. Therefore, it is really worth congratulations.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that over the past 400 years and more, Macao had
experienced 127 Portuguese governors, while the Chinese who
constituted over 96 percent of the Macao population had no say at
all, speaking nothing of taking part in any election. It is only
when China resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Macao and
the principle of "one country, two systems" and the principle of
high degree of autonomy are implemented that the Macao people can
enjoy their rights as masters of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao Daily expressed the confidence that Ho will surely
solve the public security problems and promote the economic
development in Macao. The paper also suggested that while further
developing tourism, the future MSAR should also strengthen links
with the adjacent mainland areas for the development of industry
and commerce and make good use of the handover opportunity to
become a hub in the western part of Guangdong province.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students in Canada Stage Anti-NATO Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Chinese students,
Chinese Canadians and Yugoslav Canadians in Toronto rallied in
front of the U.S. Consulate in the City Saturday afternoon to
protest NATO's missile attack of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
on May 7.
</P>
<P>
Waving Chinese national flags and holding placards reading "
Stop bombing!" "Punish murders!" "Condolence to the Martyr!", the
demonstrators chanted slogans: "Against hegemony!" "Support peace!
" to express their strong indignation and condemnation of the
NATO's attack of the Chinese Embassy, which killed three Chinese
journalists and injured more than 20 people.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was organized by Federation of Chinese
Students and Professionals in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the purpose of the demonstration, Wei Dongpei,
the Chairman of the federation, told Xinhua: "We Chinese in Canada
have felt deep indignation for US-led NATO's barbarous attack on
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and we need to protest against
this provocative action."
</P>
<P>
"We want to show our condolence to the three Chinese
journalists killed in the attack. We don't think that the half-
hearted apology by U.S. and NATO is good enough. We demand that
they make a full investigation and punish those who are
responsible," said the Chairman.
</P>
<P>
In a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton, the Federation
said:" U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy have violated
the U.N. Charter and have trampled the Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic Relations."
</P>
<P>
"We strongly demand that the U.S.-led NATO immediately stop its
aggression and bombing on Yugoslavia, punish the criminals
responsible for the attack on the Chinese people and Yugoslavian
civilians," said the Federation.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, more than 700 Chinese students, Chinese
Canadians and Overseas Chinese in Montreal city also held a
similar rally in the front of the U.S. Consulate in the city.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Protest in Washington NATO's Attack of Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Chinese students
and scholars from 19 universities on the east coast of the United
States Saturday demonstrated in protest against NATO's missile
attack of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The protesters gathered at the Lafayette Park on the north of
the White House with different signs and posters condemning the
brutal attack on the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
They hold signs that read "We Love Peace!" "NATO No More!" and
raised posts with pictures of the three Chinese journalists killed
in the missile attack on May 7.
</P>
<P>
In front of a podium, the crowd stood in silence for three
minutes to pay tribute to the dead.
</P>
<P>
They also chanted the Chinese National Anthem and slogans like
"Stop the Bombing!" "Tell the Truth!" "Full Investigation!" and "
We Want Justice!" Then the protesters marched around the park.
</P>
<P>
On the sidewalk of the Pensylvania Avenue, Ma Kewei, a student
from the Towson State University, read out a letter signed by
associations of Chinese students and scholars from 19 universities
to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of all Chinese students and scholars ...we urge you
to bring those who are responsible to justice; we urge you to take
necessary actions to prevent similar tragedies from occurrence, so
that no more innocent lives, regardless of nationality, would be
lost," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen claimed that NATO targeted
the Chinese embassy by mistake because the alliance was using "an
old map" dated in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The protesters scorned the excuse as ridiculous. "Driving with
99 map. Bombing with 92 map?" read one sign. "Old Map, Who Believe?
" read another.
</P>
<P>
"This is a conspiracy, a strategy. It is deliberate and
intentional," said Liu Desong, "They are trying to intimidate
China, a strong supporter of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
Many Americans also joined the protest. Donald Beck and his
friends asked a Xinhua reporter to tell the American people that
the attack on Chinese embassy is an aggression of the Chinese
sovereignty and a violation of international laws rather than just
a simple mistake.
</P>
<P>
"Our media, like CNN (the Cable News Network), NBC (the
National Broadcasting Company) and others, tell too many lies
about this war. We don't believe them any more," Beck said.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Cannon, the organizer of the International Action
Center (IAC), told the crowd that "China's media reports about the
war are just, objective and perfectly right."
</P>
<P>
Cannon, an American citizen who organized a series of protests
against NATO's bombing on Yugoslavia, said that the U.S.-led NATO
did not care about any international laws at all.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese students and scholars urged the U.S. media "to
cover China unbiasedly; we urge you to make every effort in
establishing a constructive Sino-American relationship," the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
The brutal missile attack aroused nation-wide protests in China
against the United States and NATO. However, the U.S. media, which
gave a little coverage about the attack, accused that the protests
"were organized" by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"We are distressed over the biased coverage of the incident and
the follow-ups, and indifference and callosity manifested by the
media," the students' letter said.
</P>
<P>
The crowd time and time again chanted the slogan of "Stop Lies,
Tell the Truth."
</P>
<P>
"We are more distressed over the unsatisfactory explanations
offered by NATO and the United States government. There appears to
be a total neglect of the innocent lives lost in the incident,"
the letter added.

criminals who are performing international terrorism.

innocent civilians by missiles and other high technologies, which
have brought huge disasters to mankind.

NATO should be responsible for all the evil consequences of its
indiscriminate bombings, including the exodus of refugees and the

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Bank Confident in China's Economic Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The HongKong and Shanghai Banking
Corp. (HSBC) is showing firm confidence in China's economic
potential despite the recent hiccups in the inland areas'
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Guangdong International Trust and
Investment Corp. does not change the bank's views on the enormous
potential, Daniel Lam, manager of the HSBC Shanghai Branch, was
quoted by today's Business Weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bank is searching for a suitable property in Shanghai to
house its China head office and expanding its electronic data
processing center in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
HSBC's network in the inland areas currently includes eight
branches, one sub-branch and three representative offices.
</P>
<P>
HSBC Chairman David Eldon recently told a 50-member delegation
from the New York financial sector visiting Hong Kong that China's
potential was one of the main reasons that HSBC remained confident
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Lam said he believed that China could overcome all those
challenges it is facing, such as keeping unemployment at
acceptable levels, reducing bureaucracy, eliminating corruption
and withstanding the mounting competition from overseas businesses
after its entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Any company that is focusing solely on short-term earnings
will continue to be disappointed, while those making long-term
commitment will be rewarded," Lam said.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalans to Vote on Constitution Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala is ready to hold a
referendum on constitutional reforms Sunday, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's referendum is the first electoral operation in
Guatemala after the signing of a peace accord between the
government and the former guerrillas in 1996, which ended the 36-
year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
More than four million Guatemalans are expected to vote in more
than 7,000 electoral sites set by the Supreme Electoral Court to
ratify or reject 50 reform items to the Constitution, which serves
as the juridical basis of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution will limit the functions of the army and
create the police as the only armed forces to guarantee citizens
security.
</P>
<P>
It also decides to increase the annual financing allocated to
the judicial organ by 2 to 6 percent of the national budget and to
give legislature bigger power to control the executive body.
</P>
<P>
The amendments also include recognition of the rights of
Indians to speak Mayan languages, wear traditional dresses and
practice their religion among other ethnic nations.
</P>
<P>
If the amendments are approved by a simple majority of the
votes, Guatemala will be recognized for the first time as a "pluri-
cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-lingual" nation since the Spanish
conquistadors' arrival in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
About 60 to 65 percent of Guatemala's 11 million people are
Mayan descents. They belong to 22 different linguistic and ethnic
communities.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Improve Soccer Competition System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The All-Indonesian Soccer
Federation (PSSI) held a one-day seminar here on Saturday to
discuss the implementation of a competition system for the
Indonesian league, The Jakarta Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was attended by chairman of the National Sports
Council (KONI) Wismoyo Arismunandar, PSSI chairman Agum Gumelar,
and secretary-general of the Southeast Asia Football Federation
Dato' Paul Mony.
</P>
<P>
A final decision on the competition system to be chosen for the
league will be decided at PSSI's 32nd national congress, scheduled
to be held after the June 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
Agum said the number of clubs competing in the Indonesian
league should be limited in order to save time and money for
staging Indonesian league playoffs (Ligina).
</P>
<P>
He said the numbers of clubs contending the main and first
divisions had always changed because they faced relegations or
were dismissed for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
"The competition has always outlived the period. It disturbs
national team preparations for competition at the sub-regional,
regional and international levels", he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-star general suggested each province should be
represented by one club or team, with one extra club from the
Indonesian Military or the police.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has more than 300 amateur clubs throughout the
regencies, and five professional clubs (Pelita Bakrie, Barito
Putra, Gelora Dewata, Petro Kimia and Pupuk Kaltim) which compete
in Ligina's main, first and second divisions.
</P>
<P>
The playoffs changed their system before switching to the
current system called Ligina, in which amateur and professional
clubs fight their way to the main division to earn the
Presidential Cup.
</P>
<P>
Ligina has been staged five times annually since 1994. In 1997,
it was abruptly disturbed at the end of the preliminary round for
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Agum suggested PSSI regional offices be given more autonomy. He
said PSSI should offer "title sponsors" to each club so they could
find their own contributors.
</P>
<P>
Dato' Paul Mony said a country should consider the number of
clubs, the numbers of competitions held to improve the players'
performance and the period of competition.

Scott, who came into boxing on account of his hero worshipping

STOCKHOLM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Goalie Milan Hnilicka helped the
Czech Republic to a 3-1 victory over Finland in the first of two
final games at the World Ice Hockey Championships in Lillehammer,
Norway, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hnilicka stopped 30 shots and had a shutout going until 5:18
left to play when Juha Lind pulled one back for the Finns.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, the Czechs enter Sunday's second match
needing only a draw to add the world title to the Olympic gold
medal they claimed last year.
</P>
<P>
The Finns meanwhile, can force the mini-series to overtime and
a possible shootout if they bounce back and win game two in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
Frantisek Kaberle collected the only goal of the opening period
when he moved in over the Finnish blueline and struck a wrist shot
off the post past Ari Sulander to put the Czechs 1-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Czech's also accounted for all the scoring in the second,
Montreal Canadiens Martin Rucinsky finishing off a text book two-
on-one with Radek Dvorak.
</P>
<P>
With just five minutes left to play, Juha Lind finally got
Finland on the scoreboard when he crept in behind the Czech
defence and beat Hnilicka on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
Dvorak scored into the empty net to nail down the win in the
final stage.

<HEADLINE> China's Paper Industry to Be Restructured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China's paper-making industry is
expected to implement a restructuring campaign in the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
Solutions are being sought to the industry's major problems,
Huang Runbin, secretary-general of the China Technical Association
of the Paper Industry, was quoted by today's Business Weekly as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the industry's use of raw materials,
product mix and enterprise scale are all irrational.
</P>
<P>
Non-wood fiber is the predominant raw material in the domestic
industry, while wood pulp accounts for only 13 percent, in
contrast with the world average of 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The industry also produces relatively few varieties of paper
products, and their technical content is comparatively low, with
medium- and low-grade products making up 70 percent of total
output.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that there are too many small paper makers
across the country, which reduce the efficiency of the sector and
the quality of its products.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say the key solution is to increase the use of
wood pulp and upgrade production technologies.
</P>
<P>
The government need to plant more quick-growing trees
specifically to supply paper enterprises, while the enterprises
need to establish their own material bases, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Anti-drug Trafficking Campaign Intensified in Amazonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Justice Minister
Renan Calheiros has decided to increase the police force in
Amazonia to fight the drug traffickers, the Jornal Do Brzail
newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the decision to reinforce the police presence
in the zone following a request made by the Federal Police, which
only has 15 men to combat drug traffic in the region of the
Amazonia.
</P>
<P>
Federal Police representative Mauro Sposito said that the
organization needs at least 90 specialized agents and more
resources to counteract the drug traffickers' activities in that
area.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have found that a large amount of drugs enter
the country from Colombia along the Amazonian rivers and the drugs
will be transiting from Brazil to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Two heads of a drug trafficking syndicate have been arrested,
but it is thought that the network could be bigger.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the use of military planes for the
traffic of drugs are being investigated by a Parliamentary
Investigative Commission created last month.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Herbal Medicine Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese business people are
planning to export more traditional herbal medicines to survive
the competition, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jinyan, vice-president of the China Chamber of Commerce of
Medicines and Health Products Importers and Exporters, is quoted
as saying that in order to reach the goal "Chinese enterprises
will upgrade their processing technologies to meet consumers'
requirements".
</P>
<P>
Because of differences in traditions, cultures and dietary
habits between the East and West, traditional Chinese herbal
medicine has much difficulty in being widely accepted by
Westerners, the newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
It adds that traditional Chinese medicines are mainly exported
to Southeast Asian countries, and exports to the American market
are generally treated as health-care products instead of real
medicines with curative effects.
</P>
<P>
However, the traditional Chinese remedies still have strengths
compared with Western drugs, such as their lack of toxicity and
undesirable side effects, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Hat-trick of Sudirman Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shuttlers made a hat-
trick of winning the Sudirman Cup mixed team championships by
beating hosts Denmark 3-1 in the final match Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, which claimed the crown in 1995 and defended
it two years ago, took the final match through women's singles
player Dai Yun, men's singles player Sun Jun and men's doubles
pair Zhang Jun and Yu Jinghao.
</P>
<P>
Dai Yun, fourth in the world rankings, has been a hero in the
day's match and turned the point for the Chinese team after Ge Fei
and Liu Yong lost the first game in the mixed doubles to Ann
Jorgensen and Jon Holst Christensen 10-15 and 8-15.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Dai Yun, from Jiangsu Province, took on Dannish
top women's singles player Camilla Martin in the second game.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first set 5-11, Dai, who lost to Martin three
times in their previous seven meetings, rallied back to level the
score at 1-all by taking the second set 11-9.
</P>
<P>
Martin had a brilliant control of the court at the start of the
third set, when she led the score at 9-2. However, the Dannish
player could not keep it long and gave Dai Yun a chance to trail
at 8-9, 8-10 and 10-all before taking the set and game at 13-11.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team head coach Li Yongbo said after the game that if
Dai had lost the game, China would lost the match at 0-3 to the
Dannish team.
</P>
<P>
"Dai Yun won the match not only tactically, but also mentally,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
For Martin and the Dannish team, it was a big disapointment. "
If we took the women's singles, we would have a big possibility to
win the cup," said Dannish team manager Lund Thomas.
</P>
<P>
Martin, a losing semi-finalist in All England Open two months
ago, felt quite sorry for her teammates. "I am sorry for my
teammates that I lost. There is no comparison with playing for
your team to playing as an individual," she said.
</P>
<P>
"When the final set was at 9-2, I knew that I had to be
careful, but when Dai Yun came back at me, I didn't think I should
change my game. I think she became more relaxed and more
confident -- maybe I played less aggressively," she added.
</P>
<P>
Dai Yun's victory gave Chinese top men's singles player Sun Jun
much confidence going into the third game, when he met world top
ranked player Peter Gade Christensen, in which he lost at 13-15,
13-15.
</P>
<P>
After the game, Gade Christensen said: "I was tired mentally
and physically, and didn't feel fully recovered from my other
mathces. I tried to play just the same as I had the other days
but I didn't have the power in my legs and body and you can't
afford to give Sun Jun an inch."
</P>
<P>
In the men's doubles, Zhang Jun and Yu Jinghao completed
China's achievement by beating Jens Eriksen/Jesper Larsen 15-12
and 15-13.
</P>
<P>
For losers Denmark, these is still something to remember by
becoming the first country out of Asia to play in the mixed team
tournament final.
</P>
<P>
"We have already written a new chapter to play in the final,
and we will write a new chapter in future," Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
"We have proved that we are the second best team in the world,
we've played Indonesia and Malaysia this time," he added.

<HEADLINE> No Impeachment to Yeltsin Good For Russia's Stability, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said here Saturday that the vote in the Russian parliament not to
impeach President Boris Yeltsin could restore the minimum
stability needed there in view of upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press on the sidelines of a European election
rally, Dini said that Russia needed stability "because its
weakness does not help anyone."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Kosovo crisis, Dini said that "Russia certainly
has more cards it can play in mediations, which has been
encouraged by its historic ties with Serbia."
</P>
<P>
However, Dini added that "if Russia's efforts are not
successful then others will have to get involved because we need a
breakthrough for this tragic situation from all points of view."
</P>
<P>
Turning his attention to the calls for a pause in NATO's
bombing campaign, Dini observed that "the next objective of
foreign policy is to obtain a suspension the bombing, but this can
only come after Milosevic opens towards the conditions placed by
NATO and the G8 otherwise it will be impossible."
</P>
<P>
"This is the reason why," he concluded, "we NATO members should
not divide among ourselves, in the hope that the situation will
make a turn for the better as the result of strong diplomatic
initiatives which are currently underway and in which we are all
active."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 New Yorkers took to
the street on Saturday, demonstrating against U.S.-led NATO
bombing of Yugoslavia and demanding an and to the aggression
against a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was staged in solidarity of the Chinese
people angered by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s
barbaric bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7 and
in support of the Yugoslav people fighting against NATO
aggression.
</P>
<P>
The missile attack on the Chinese Embassy, an incident never
seen in human history, killed 3 Chinese journalists housed at the
embassy and injured over 20 Chinese diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators demanded a thoroughful investigation of the
incident and severe punishment against the criminals.
</P>
<P>
"We will be marching in solidarity with demonstration of
millions of people sweeping China who are outraged over the
incident", said Sara Flounders, co-director of the International
Action Center which organized the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
"This large, modern, five-story embassy was hardly a secret
facility. It is even listed in the Belgrade telephone directory,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"This adds to the list of hospitals, refugee convoys, schools,
residential areas, trains, buses, television stations, bridges and
other civilian areas targeted by NATO", Founders said.
</P>
<P>
NATO excuses of "mistakes" and "accidents" are awakening a
firestorm of opposition in countries all over the world, another
speaker at a meeting of demonstrators said.
</P>
<P>
There was an ocean of placards. Some of them read: "Stop the
bombing, stop the war!""Jobs and schools yes, war no!""Punish the
criminals!""Gangs will pay, pay like Hitlers!""Bring U.S. troops
and warplanes home!""Think over Korea War and Vietnam War!""NATO
is the enemy of Albanians, Serbs and the people over the world!"
</P>
<P>
Most of the demonstrators said the United States should use
taxpayers' money to improve education and human rights records at
home instead of aggression and expansion for hegemonist interests.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators marched several kilometers from City Hall to
Brooklin Bridge, where they lined in a 200 miter long human chain
to imitate the way the Yugoslav people defended their bridges
against NATO bombing which has been continuing since March 24.

<HEADLINE> Blair Resets Deadline for N.Irish Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
made another try on Saturday at pushing ahead with Northern
Ireland's stalled peace accord by setting June 30 as the deadline
for the creation of a local ministerial executive to run the
province.
</P>
<P>
Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern have held a series
of talks with pro-British Unionists and pro-Irish Sinn Fein
republicans in recent months which failed to reach a compromise on
IRA (Irish Republican Party) disarmament.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Blair made it clear on Saturday that the prime
minister felt that ten-hour discussions involving all sides at his
London office on Friday held out the promise of an end to the
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"We have made real progress in the last few days and there are
proposals being discussed which we believe will get the process
back on track," Reuters quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Prime Minister has set a deadline of June 30 for the
devolution of power," Blair's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But in a move that could spell trouble for the initiative, a
meeting of UUP (Ulster Unionist Party) politicians failed to back
the proposals just before Blair made his announcement.
</P>
<P>
Creation of the executive has been blocked because the UUP, led
by David Trimble, refuses to sit alongside Sinn Fein unless its
IRA political wing hands in weapons that it used in the 30-year
separatist struggle.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students in U.S. Calls for Full Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese students and scholars on
the east coast of the United States Saturday urged President Bill
Clinton to order a full investigation into the bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
A letter signed by associations of Chinese students and
scholars from 19 universities to Clinton called for a
"comprehensive, thorough, and fair investigation."
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of all Chinese students and scholars...we urge you
to bring those who are responsible to justice; we urge you to take
necessary actions to prevent similar tragedies from occurrence, so
no more innocent lives, regardless of nationality, would be lost,"
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
On the sidewalk of the Pensylvania Avenue, an organizer of a
protest attended by hundreds of Chinese students and scholars read
out the letter to the White House through a loud speaker.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the media to cover China unbiasedly; we urge you to
make every effort in establishing a constructive Sino-American
relationship," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe these actions would be conducive to improving the
United States' image, and setting a good example for the
international community," it added.
</P>
<P>
Late on May 7, the U.S.-led NATO bombed the Chinese embassy
with five missiles from different directions, killing three
Chinese journalists, Shao Yunhuan, Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
claimed that the bombing is "an accident" and they made a "very
bad mistake." But experts analyzed that this brutal act is
deliberate and intentional.
</P>
<P>
The brutal bombing aroused nation-wide protests against the
United States and NATO in China. However, the U.S. media, which
gave a little coverage about the bombing, accused that the
protests "were organized" by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The students and scholars believe that "the hard fact is three
innocent lives were lost right inside Chinese embassy, protected
by the international laws and Geneva Convention."
</P>
<P>
They asked the U.S. government to recall the tragic moment when
the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were attacked last summer
to "feel our hurting, the hurting of those families which lost
their loved ones."
</P>
<P>
"We are distressed over the biased coverage of the incident and
the follow-ups, and indifference and callosity manifested by the
media," the students' letter said.
</P>
<P>
"We are more distressed over the unsatisfactory explanations
offered by NATO and the United States government. There appears to
be a total neglect of the innocent lives lost in the incident," it
added.
</P>
<P>
"If the bombing in itself is not cruel, barbaric, and inhuman,
the responses of NATO, particularly the United States, in the
aftermath of the bombing are," it affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by Chinese students and scholars
communities from the American University, John Hopkins University,
Towson State University, George Washington University and other
universities from at least three states.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people cherish peace and friendship. History has
taught people all over the world never to abuse power. No matter
how powerful and smart the bombs are, force can not solve all the
problems," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"Last but not least, we wish to see a healthy world order
rebuilt upon principle of peaceful coexistence and a new promising
millennium coming to all of us on earth," it concluded.

responsibilities of their dismissed ministers until new ones are
appointed.
