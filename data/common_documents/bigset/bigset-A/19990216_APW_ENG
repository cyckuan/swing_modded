<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A sheriff testified Tuesday that he figured  
out pretty quickly the accident he was investigating was no 
hit-and-run -- especially after a lighter with three interlocking 
K's was found along the bloody trail left by a black man who had 
been dragged to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a brand-new sheriff. I didn't even know the definition of  
a hate crime, but I knew somebody had been murdered because he had 
been black,'' Billy Rowles said. ``Once we saw the KKK emblem on 
the cigarette lighter, that's when we started having some bad 
thoughts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rowles was the first witness as alleged white supremacist John  
William King went on trial Tuesday on murder charges in the 
gruesome death of James Byrd Jr. Byrd, 49, was chained to the back 
of a pickup truck June 7 and dragged for three miles as his body 
was ripped to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	King, a 24-year-old unemployed laborer, is the first of three  
white men charged in the crime to stand trial. He could get the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Guy James Gray said in his opening statement that  
King's tattoos and writings in his apartment show King was an angry 
racist who wanted to form a hate group and ``needed to do something 
dramatic in order to gain in their warped world respect for his 
newly formed gang.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury consists of 11 whites and one black. Jasper County,  
from which the jurors were drawn, is 18 percent black. 
</P>
<P>
	King's attorney, Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs, made no opening  
statement, reserving the option to do so later. ``The evidence, it 
appears overwhelming,'' he acknowledged Monday. ``But you've got to 
prove the accused has done the offense.''

	The sheriff described to jurors what he saw early in his  
investigation. Rowles said the evidence wasn't consistent with a 
routine hit-and-run accident: There were no skid marks, and the 
bloody trail did not run parallel to the tire tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was going through my mind: We've got a problem. Somebody's  
dragging something,'' Rowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighter with three K's forming a triangle was also engraved  
with the word ``Possum,'' the nickname King picked up while in 
prison for burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors were given a folder of photos of Byrd's battered  
remains, which an investigator said were missing a right arm, neck 
and head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like an animal drug down the road,'' Tommy Robinson  
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-year-old Jasper woman, Michelle Chapman, testified that  
during a two-year period while King was in prison, she received 19 
letters from him, some of them filled with racist venom. One 
included the proclamation: ``White is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he got out, Ms. Chapman said, King visited her in June 1997  
and showed the tattoos he got while locked up, including one of a 
black man hanged. Gray, the prosecutor, said the tattoos also 
include a burning cross, a Confederate flag and Nazi swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighter, King's DNA on a cigarette and less than a drop of  
the victim's blood on King's shoes all will link King to the 
killing, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also found handwritten notes in King's apartment  
that included a constitution, bylaws, a code of ethics and a 
membership application for a group to be called the Texas Rebel 
Soldiers of the Confederate Knights of America, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	King showed little reaction in court, responding only with a  
``not guilty, your honor,'' when asked how he pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
	King's ailing father, Ronald, an oxygen tube in his nose, sat  
nearby, as did Kylie Greeney, his girlfriend and mother of the 
couple's infant son. 
</P>
<P>
	As has been the custom, he wore a bulletproof vest as he was  
escorted into the courthouse by deputies. The 110-year-old 
courthouse has been outfitted for the trial with metal detectors, 
package scanners and numerous security cameras. State District 
Judge Joe Bob Golden has barred rallies and signs about the case 
for two blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other men, Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, and Shawn Allen  
Berry, 23, will be be tried later. 
</P>

	Thirteen members of Byrd's family were present when court began,  
but some left, including two of his children. Some burst into tears 
when Byrd's blackened and torn white underwear was introduced into

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials climbed into positive  
territory for the second time this session, but the broad market 
dipped on concerns about Dell Computer's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 25.23 at 9,300.12. The Dow got as high as 9387.40, up 112.51, in 
the first hour of trading, then slid to negative 15 points before 
turning positive a second time in reaction to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader market was not as strong, as investors sold  
computer-related technology shares for the second day on 
nervousness about Dell Computer's earnings, which are scheduled to 
be released after the close of trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 7.67 at 1,237.80, but the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 14.00 at 2,307.89, 
after having tumbled 83.66 points on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance in blue chips was sparked by a rally in U.S. bonds,  
after the Japanese government said it will step up purchases of 
government bonds. The announcement pushed interest rates lower in 
Japan and boosted the Nikkei stock average by 1.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also supported the long end of the U.S. bond market, where  
the benchmark 30-year bond was up nearly a point, pushing its yield 
down to 5.36 percent from late Friday's 5.42 percent. While 
short-term bonds and notes were lower by afternoon, the lower rates 
on the 30-year bond sparked a rally in financial services issues. 
Dow member American Express was up 2 5/8 at 102 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum,  
noted that the Dow's advance is limited to American Express and 
just a few other names. IBM was up 2 1/16 to 174 13/16, despite 
weakness in computer shares. Merck was up 4 at 154 1/2, and WalMart 
was up 3 1/4 at 87 5/8 after its fourth-quarter earnings results beat 
analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	But computer-related technology shares reversed early gains and  
moved lower, in anticipation that Dell Computer's earnings, 
scheduled for release after the close of trading today, will show 
an industry-wide downturn in computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell shares were down 2 5/16 at 87 5/8.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is intense nervousness about Dell's earnings, and that's  
a big part of the technology market,'' Hyman said. ``Should they 
miss (expectations), it would have ramifications for the entire 
tech sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners took over advancing issues and were leading them by  
1,534 to 1,470 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 
529.36 million shares, just under Friday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Army To Create Light Strike Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as the Army struggles to fill its ranks,  
the service is creating light ``strike forces'' to deploy swiftly 
to hot spots worldwide, Army Secretary Louis Caldera said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get to the fight quickly,'' Caldera said of the  
experimental units with 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers each. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't war, however, but peace and providing comfort that's  
straining the Army today with missions in the Balkans and hurricane 
relief efforts in Central America, the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army is three times as busy as during the Cold War, but with  
480,000 soldiers has two-thirds the troops it had then as the 
result of a reduction in the early 1990s that also trimmed the Air 
Force, Navy and Marine Corps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We in the Army need to ask whether the Army is too small,''  
said Caldera, who said he isn't yet suggesting troops be added. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller strike forces will allow the Army to move faster and  
more efficiently and use soldiers to maximum effect, U.S. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we look out toward the future, the Army becomes a power  
projection Army,'' Caldera said, speaking to defense reporters. 
``We need to be a lighter Army, a more agile, more lethal Army.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Army divisions are designed for conventional warfare with  
heavy tank and artillery units and up to 18,000 soldiers. As a 
result, although the Army provides most U.S. ground troops in 
battlefields and for peacekeeping missions, it takes at least weeks 
to move out. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, for example, if Serbs and ethnic Albanians reach a  
peace agreement, Marines would be in the vanguard of U.S. troops in 
any NATO peacekeeping mission. The Army would replace them later. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's really an Army mission,'' Caldera said, noting that  
because of Bosnia, the Army has become well-trained at tricky 
peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	The beach-storming Marines, which have strike forces overseas on  
Navy ships, don't see any conflict with Army plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, we've got the historical task to be the most ready  
when the nation is least ready,'' said Lt. Col. Scott Campbell, a 
Marine Corps spokesman. ``We prepare the way for other forces to 
follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first Army strike force will be created within the year at  
Fort Polk, La., where it will be tested in war games. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike force would typically include 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers  
with lighter, but more technically sophisticated tanks and 
artillery, Caldera said. Soldiers probably would be based in the 
United States, but could move out overseas more rapidly than now, 
nonetheless, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialized equipment and soldiers could be added to any strike  
force depending on the need -- such as deploying an airborne force 
to secure a landing strip or engineers or heavy combat troops, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a Lego set, he said. ``You put in the pieces that  
you need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force also is experimenting with small ``expeditionary''  
units -- about half the size of a normal 2,000-troop unit -- that can 
be deployed anywhere in the world from U.S. bases within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Army restructuring into leaner units, Caldera said, the  
service probably will fall short of its recruiting goal of about 
74,000 soldiers this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the Army is about 2,300 soldiers short in the first  
quarter, which ended Dec. 31, and has started offering $3,000 
sign-up bonuses and $50,000 scholarships to attract more young men 
and women. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera has suggested that the Army eventually drop its high  
school diploma requirement to address the long-term recruiting 
problems. Now, at least 90 percent of recruits must have diplomas. 
Caldera said he plans a pilot program with several thousand 
nongraduates to prove those recruits can be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military traditionally has been one of those places where  
you can turn your life around,'' Caldera said. ``The Army is an 
institution that should not write off young people.''

<HEADLINE> Gramm Makes Bank Overhaul Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new chairman of the Senate Banking  
Committee has jumped into the debate on overhauling financial 
services laws with a proposal more in line with the views of the 
Federal Reserve than those of the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, took the helm of the  
Banking Committee after former chairman Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, 
R-N.Y., lost his re-election bid in November. Gramm unveiled his 
draft legislation Tuesday for lifting the Depression-era barriers 
between banks, securities firms and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	All financial overhaul proposals before Congress would create  
huge financial ``supermarkets,'' offering consumers checking 
accounts, mutual funds, insurance policies and much more. Ralph 
Nader and other consumer advocates have expressed concern that the 
changes could bring a dangerous concentration of economic power in 
fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's proposal calls for most new financial activities to be  
conducted by affiliated companies within bank holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm has said he wants to make enactment of financial overhaul  
legislation his highest priority, even though he blocked such a 
measure last October because of his opposition to federal 
community-lending laws that banks must follow. 
</P>
<P>
	In three days of hearings last week before the House Banking  
Committee, battle lines over financial overhaul legislation were 
drawn clearly and early as Congress began this year's debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed chairman Alan Greenspan extended his public disagreement  
with the administration over the best approach to take. He endorsed 
a bill proposed by Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, 
R-Iowa, that would give the Federal Reserve more power over new 
financial activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks put him at odds again with the  
administration's top economic policymaker, Treasury Secretary 
Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin supported a new, competing version of the financial  
overhaul legislation, which would lift the barriers between 
financial industries but split regulatory authority between the 
Treasury Department and the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's new draft is closer to Greenspan's view.  
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury and the central bank have long been at odds over  
the issue, while agreeing that legislation is needed to keep the 
U.S. financial industry competitive in a fast-changing world. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to let banks diversify through  
subsidiaries of the bank itself, not just through affiliates within 
the same parent holding company. That arrangement would increase 
the power of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, regulator of nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the battle, bills letting banks into other  
kinds of financial activities through a holding company structure 
would expand the independent Fed's role in regulating financial 
services industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent nod to administration concerns that such an  
arrangement would discriminate against smaller banks, Gramm's 
proposal also would allow nationally chartered banks with $1 
billion or less in assets -- the bulk of national banks -- to get 
into the new activities through subsidiaries under certain 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 2,546 banks operating under national charters as of last  
spring, 2,359 had assets of $1 billion or less, according to the 
comptroller's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's proposal also would require the federal banking agencies  
to jointly issue consumer protection rules governing retail sales 
of insurance by banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the Clinton administration and the banking,  
securities and insurance industries said they were still studying 
Gramm's proposal and had no immediate comment.

the victim's blood on King's shoes all will link King to the 
killing, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also found handwritten notes in King's apartment  
that included a constitution, bylaws, a code of ethics and a

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Paramilitary gunmen on Tuesday freed  
eight government investigators abducted while their commission 
sought out common graves that could contain as many as 60 corpses. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight investigators were seized Monday during an ambush by  
right-wing militiamen in the turbulent northwestern state of 
Antioquia. They belonged to a 100-strong group of investigators 
from the prosecutor's office and from DAS, the state security 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was executing a judge's order to examine a series of  
common graves in the town of La Ceja where as many as 60 corpses 
were believed buried -- at least three of which had been exhumed by 
Tuesday, officials said. It was not clear who might have been 
responsible for the deaths. Both paramilitaries and left-wing 
rebels operate in the area.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Five robbers held up an armored  
truck at a Puerto Rican shopping mall Tuesday, netting $180,000 in 
the second such heist in a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the robbers held up the truck at about 10 a.m. as  
its driver unloaded cash at Montehiedra Mall, south of San Juan. 
They escaped in a white minivan that police said had been stolen 
from a nearby neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the robbers were later seen switching to a sport

<HEADLINE> American Red Cross Sued for $34.2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- A man imprisoned in Mexico for eight  
months last year is suing the American Red Cross for $34.2 million, 
saying the agency was responsible for his imprisonment and did 
nothing to get him out. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbert Andrews, 50, an El Paso businessman who once sold  
medical equipment, was released from a Mazatlan prison in December 
after fraud charges against him were dropped due to lack of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit doesn't name former Red Cross President Elizabeth  
Dole as a defendant, but Andrews accuses her and other Red Cross 
officials of ``unconscionable and egregious'' conduct in failing to 
get him out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit evolved from a $130,000 deal between Andrews and the  
Mazatlan chapter of the Mexican Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews contends Red Cross officials in Mexico and the United  
States conspired to avoid import tariffs. To do so, the American 
Red Cross indicated in a letter that it was donating the $130,000 
worth of medical equipment, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews was accused of embezzling the $130,000. Mazatlan Red  
Cross officials said they filed a criminal fraud complaint because 
much of the equipment was broken and useless when it arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said he took that money and did not give them anything in  
return,'' said Andrews' lawyer, Christopher Antcliff said. ``Their 
(the American Red Cross) actions caused him to spend 242 days in a 
Third World prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Named as defendants are the American Red Cross, the El Paso  
chapter of the American Red Cross and its former local director, 
Carmen Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ms. Ruiz nor Mrs. Dole's spokeswoman Joyce Campbell  
returned telephone calls from The Associated Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Blaul, spokesman for the American Red Cross, said Andrews'  
dispute should be with the Mexican Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Andrews' case is without merit,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Young Snowboarders New Ski Hazard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRECKENRIDGE, Colo. (AP) -- The generation gap has become a  
crevasse at the nation's ski resorts, with young, thrill-seeking 
snowboarders and skiers slamming into older enthusiasts with 
sometimes tragic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	A spate of deaths in New England and Colorado, some of them the  
result of collisions attributed to reckless skiing, has refocused 
resorts on safety. Over the long holiday weekend, a new patrol 
squad aimed at stopping reckless skiing made its debut at Vail 
Resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that clearly road rage exists on the slopes,'' said  
John Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country USA, a trade group. 
Frew said ski resorts all over the country are seeing a decline in 
courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime skier Don Rooks of Colorado Springs, 64, said he is  
being driven off the slopes by young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people just don't give a damn. It's no fun when you have  
to watch your backside. They need to kick these people off the 
mountain,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail Resorts, operator of the nation's two busiest ski resorts,  
has been inundated with complaints by longtime skiers. After six 
deaths this year at its resorts, Vail announced the creation of the 
special safety and courtesy patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	New England resorts saw four deaths in three days last month,  
but icy conditions seemed to be the main culprit there. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a snowboarder was killed when he was hit by a  
15-year-old skier who went airborne during a steep descent in 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Fortner, head of mountain security at Camelback in  
Pennsylvania's Poconos, said Vail is on the right track. His 
mountain has had a mostly volunteer force of speed controllers, led 
by a former state trooper, since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it has cut our collision rate,'' said Fortner, whose  
mountain draws up to 8,500 skiers on peak days. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, Snowmass Village residents were so outraged by a  
hit-and-run ski accident three years ago they set up a $1,000 
reward for information about rogue skiers. But there have been no 
payouts so far. 
</P>
<P>
	For the younger set, the mountain is there to be conquered.  
</P>
<P>
	``You only live once. Its an adrenalin-based sport,'' said Steve  
Stasiuk, 27, of Aspen. ``That's how I get my kicks.'' He added: 
``It would totally annoy me if they want to hold us back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figures on ski deaths do not support the perception that skiing  
is becoming more dangerous. Last season there were 26 deaths at 
U.S. resorts, the lowest toll since the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But catastrophic injuries have been way above average for the  
past two seasons, with 45 in 1996-97 and 42 in 1997-98. The average 
for the previous 12 seasons was only 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Some blame better ski equipment that has increased speeds.  
Others attribute it to snowboarding, which has brought out more 
young men, the group involved in most accidents. Snowboarders 
barrel down slopes, often performing aerobatic maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
	High-speed ski lifts also put more people on the hill at once  
and allow people to make more runs, perhaps pushing them to the 
limits of their endurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Some argue the law too often absolves resorts of responsibility.  
In many states, the law specifies that since skiing is inherently 
dangerous, resorts are not responsible for accidents unless they 
result from negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	John M. Van Dyke, a lawyer, had to go to a California appeals  
court to get permission to sue Bear Mountain after suffering 
injuries that left him a paraplegic. Van Dyke hit a resort sign he 
said he couldn't see in time. 
</P>
<P>
	The sign said: ``Be Aware -- Ski With Care.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Is Seeking Explanations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Letters are on the way to IOC members  
implicated in Salt Lake City's bribery scandal telling them they 
have until the end of the month to say why they shouldn't be 
expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, a member of a six-man IOC inquiry commission,  
said those implicated will be asked to reply by the last week of 
February. The commission will meet in late February or early March 
and make recommendations to the executive board, which can order 
further expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	Any expulsions would go before the full general assembly at the  
March 17-18 emergency session dealing with the corruption crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee's ethics panel issued a  
report last week that blamed two bid committee leaders for 
dispensing $1 million in cash, scholarships, medical treatment and 
other favors during the successful effort to win the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake report, which was reviewed by the IOC inquiry  
commission during the weekend, implicated 24 IOC members -- a fifth 
of the total roster. The report cited 10 names that were not 
included in the list of 14 implicated earlier during the IOC's 
internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	After the IOC panel sent letters demanding explanations from 13  
members (one, Cameroon's Rene Essomba, has died), nine members 
resigned or were ousted by the executive board. Three others remain 
under investigation; one received a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the IOC panel, headed by vice president Dick Pound,  
would follow the same procedure in dealing with new names and 
evidence contained in the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone mentioned in the ethics report, except those who have  
already resigned, will receive a letter asking for a reply,'' he 
said in a telephone interview Monday from Belgium. ``They have the 
right to respond in writing or to appear before the commission in 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those already investigated by the IOC will receive second  
letters if there is new evidence in the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Monday, the deadline passed for Olympic  
bid cities to report rule-breaking, and a Utah group opposed to 
state involvement in the Olympics launched its petition drive 
demanding taxpayers be protected from having to pay if the Games 
finish in the red. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that's something the Legislature has refused to talk  
about and believe it's the type of question that needs to be 
answered,'' Stephen Pace, head of Utahns for Responsible Public 
Spending, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt raised questions last month regarding whether  
the state could, under Utah's Constitution, protect the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee against financial losses should the games run 
a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he said he believes there is a moral obligation to  
abide by a promise made by his predecessor, Gov. Norm Bangerter, 
and renewed by him to provide financial protection to the games and 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	If an agreement the city signed with SLOC is unconstitutional,  
the Legislature would have to appropriate money to cover the debt 
through its normal appropriations process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pace's initiative would force an election on the indemnification  
issue. The ballot proposition would state: ``The State of Utah 
shall not indemnify, guarantee or reimburse the debt or obligations 
incurred by an organization, public or private, to host, solicit, 
organize, schedule, conduct, book or operate the Olympic Winter 
Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order to force the Legislature to consider the initiative,  
the group would have to collect 33,594 signatures in 20 of Utah's 
29 counties. To put it directly on the ballot, twice that number of 
signatures is required. 
</P>
<P>
	The worry over the possibility of the 2002 Games going into the  
red comes at a time when restless corporate Olympic sponsors are 
demanding the IOC carry through with decisive action to deal with 
the crisis or face a rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, the IOC marketing director who felt the wrath of  
sponsors at a meeting in New York last Friday, said the IOC was 
aware of the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors are saying, `Are you sure you really will deliver  
the cleaning of the house, and the reforms, in March? If this drags 
on beyond March, it impacts on our marketing programs. If we miss 
that March window, it's a big problem,''' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're telling the sponsors that cleaning the house is the  
first step. That's the line in the sand. Clearly there are things 
that are broken and need to be fixed. This is an opportunity to 
make changes. The IOC has the resolve to go all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors have been critical of the IOC leadership, while  
stopping short of calling for Samaranch's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have understood that, for the time being, while pushing  
through expulsions and reforms, it would not be helpful to have a 
presidential election,'' Payne said. ``It would destabilize the 
situation. I think that's understood by all of those who closely 
follow the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung Electronics Co. denied Monday that it was considering  
abandoning its $45 million sponsorship of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are worried the commercial values of the Olympics have  
suffered because of these scandals,'' spokeswoman Cho Sung-in said. 
``But we remain committed to our sponsorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cho spoke in reaction to an Australian newspaper report that  
Samsung's sponsorship was in doubt because of vote-buying scandals 
and other allegations of misconduct involving members of the 
International Olympic Committee. Cho said The Sydney Morning Herald 
report Monday was ``far too exaggerating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta failed to make Monday's deadline for Olympic bidders to  
tell of rule-breaking behavior by IOC members or by bid cities. 
However, Atlanta bid officials said they did not find any 
wrongdoing during an internal review. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Monday it had no word yet on how many cities had  
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``ACOG has advised us they have no information relevant to the  
IOC request,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Atlanta response had been overshadowed by the USOC's  
need to get information to the other investigations into the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC president Bill Hybl would forward the Atlanta response to  
the IOC ``as soon as possible. We anticipate no problem,'' Moran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney 2000 Olympics bid leader John Fahey told the IOC that  
there is no fresh evidence of wrongdoing by IOC members during the 
city's successful quest for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every director has responded in writing and all directors,  
with one exception, have stated that they have no evidence of any 
improper conduct by any IOC member with regard to the Sydney bid,'' 
Fahey said in a statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	Former bid member Bruce Baird previously told the IOC Executive  
Committee of a matter concerning an IOC member, whom Fahey said has 
since resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC has been conducting its own ethics investigation, and  
criminal probes are under way by the U.S. Justice Department and 
the Utah Attorney General's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Utah Attorney General Reed Richards said Monday that  
the state investigation might take another couple of months to wrap 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	He said SLOC's ethics investigation was a good start. ``They've  
done quite a lot of work,'' he said. ``There may be some of those 
people that we would want to talk to again -- undoubtedly there will 
be. And there's some they did not talk to that we will want to talk 
to.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Pinpoint Contamination Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Processed food from a Michigan plant may have  
become contaminated with listeriosis because of construction work 
on the plant's air conditioning system, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak of listeriosis was traced to hot dogs and cold cuts  
at Michigan's Bil Mar Foods plant in December. It has killed at 
least 12 people and made more than 80 sick in 19 states, according 
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that healthy people  
usually fight off, but it sometimes can kill. Those at risk are 
pregnant women and the newborn, older adults and those with 
weakened immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plant's air conditioning system was being repaired and  
that may have generated dust, which may have contaminated the 
plant,'' Tom Skinner, a CDC spokesman, said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers' Dr. Paul Mead has said the ``working hypothesis is  
that construction led to dust that contaminated the equipment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC expects to release a report on what happened at the  
plant in the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The maintenance construction at the plant occurred over the July  
4 weekend, Mead said. But he added, ``We do not have an absolute 
answer about what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A USDA memo said testing for listeria on floors and equipment at  
the plant's hot dog lines after the July 4 construction showed a 
spike in which 27 of 34 samples taken by investigators were 
positive. The samples were taken from July 5 through Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, only three of 12 samples taken between May 26 and  
July 4 were positive. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar result was detected on the chicken processing lines,  
CDC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Agriculture Department officials stress it is unclear  
what the spike in positive tests means because the testing was for 
listeria generally but did not indicate whether listeria 
monocytogenes was present, the species of listeria that caused the 
outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Six species of listeria exist, but listeria monocytogenes ``is  
the only one that is a public health concern,'' said Elliot Ryser, 
a Michigan State University assistant professor and expert on 
listeria. 
</P>
<P>
	A USDA memo by investigators dated Dec. 21 said listeriosis  
``has never been documented to be transmitted in airborne 
particles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Airborne contamination of both the frank and chicken lines is  
difficult to imagine,'' the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ryser said, in general, it would be possible for  
listeria to blow out through an air duct and settle on hot dogs 
after they are cooked, infecting the meat before it is packaged and 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Plant officials at Bil Mar voluntarily recalled about 35 million  
pounds of hot dogs and lunch meat on Dec. 22 in what agriculture 
officials are calling one of the largest recalls ever.

<HEADLINE> Gooden Throws at Yankees Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Dwight Gooden was throwing at the New York  
Yankees spring training complex Tuesday -- even though he's with the 
Cleveland Indians these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, who lives in nearby St. Petersburg, was looking for a  
place to throw during the offseason and asked the Yankees if he 
could use their fields. His previous workout facility wasn't 
exactly fancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throwing was tough ... make three throws and jump out of way  
of the car,'' Gooden joked. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander has been throwing three times a week since  
December and reports no problems stemming from hernia injuries that 
have slowed him the past two season.

<HEADLINE> Jeter Beats Yankees in Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The only time the New York Yankees lose is when  
they take on their own players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be lying if I said it made no difference if you win or  
lose,'' Derek Jeter said Tuesday after beating the World Series 
champions in salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star shortstop became the first player to win an  
arbitration case this year, and will get $5 million under the 
decision issued by a three-man panel. The team's offer was $3.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over with. It's the business side, the ugly part,'' Jeter  
said on his way to Newark Airport for a flight to spring training 
in Tampa, Fla. ``If you play well on the field, everything will 
take care of itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, who made $750,000 last year, was eligible for arbitration  
for the first time. He can become a free agent after the 2001 
season, but the Yankees haven't made any proposals for a long-term 
deal since Jeter rejected a $31 million, five-year offer last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter doesn't expect New York to give him another multiyear  
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing they've done that would have us anticipate  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball's in their court,'' said Jeter's agent, Casey Close.  
``It's an organization that has the resources and the opportunity 
to do something special for a special player. They've rolled those 
dice before and found out what happened with Bernie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Williams had been the last Yankee to go to arbitration,  
winning his case for a $3 million salary in 1996. Williams rejected 
several multiyear offers that he deemed too low, went year by year 
and became a free agent last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	He nearly signed with the Boston Red Sox, citing the way he felt  
the Yankees had treated him, and stayed with New York only after 
owner George Steinbrenner, in the final hours of talks, increased 
his offer from $50 million over five years to $87.5 million over 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Close offered to settle before Monday's hearing at the midpoint  
of $4.1 million but the Yankees refused. After the sides exchanged 
arbitration numbers in January, the team offered $3.5 million. That 
turned out to be New York's final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they were prepared to recognize the market  
Bernie went into,'' Close said, ``or that Derek would be the type 
of player going into the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, whose case was decided by arbitrators Nicholas Zumas, Ira  
Jaffe and Gil Vernon, matched Ruben Sierra's 1992 salary with Texas 
as the second-highest ever awarded in arbitration. The only higher 
award is the $5.3 million pitcher Jack McDowell got from the 
Chicago White Sox in 1994 -- when he lost his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, 24, is eligible for free agency one year after Seattle  
shortstop Alex Rodriguez becomes eligible, which could lead to a 
record deal. Close said Tuesday's decision changes the price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously this puts a new light on any future contract,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter hit .324 last season with 19 homers, 84 RBIs and 30  
steals. He was fifth in the AL in batting average and first in runs 
with 127. 
</P>
<P>
	At an award ceremony on Monday night, he and Steinbrenner joked  
about the arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Derek's vital to the ballclub and is a tremendous person,''  
Steinbrenner said after the decision. ``I just hope he's in the 
right frame of mind to get the job done. ... I'm not upset at all -- 
I'm very happy. A little lighter in the purse, but very happy. You 
never like to lose -- show me a gracious loser and I'll show you a 
loser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there's anyone Steinbrenner is angry at, it probably is  
general manager Brian Cashman. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won, I lost,'' Cashman said in Tampa. ``I really think  
our case was strong, and I thought the midpoint was irrelevant. 
Obviously, it's not. It's one of those things where the glass is 
half-empty, half-full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners had won the first five hearings this year, defeating  
Montreal infielder Shane Andrews, Boston outfielder Midre Cummings, 
Kansas City outfielder Johnny Damon, Los Angeles shortstop Mark 
Grudzielanek and Detroit outfielder Brian Hunter.

<HEADLINE> France Prepares Tobacco Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-NAZAIRE, France (AP) -- A local branch of the state health  
insurance program said Tuesday it is preparing a suit against four 
tobacco companies for up to $90 million, blaming them for 
smoking-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit would be a first in France where smoking remains  
widely tolerated and socially acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	The major tobacco companies in the United States have agreed to  
pay the states $246 billion over 25 years to settle their claims 
for the government's costs for treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department is considering filing a similar suit  
against the tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The social security office in this coastal city will sue tobacco  
companies Philip Morris, Rothmans, Reynolds and the French company 
Seita. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance agency said it hopes to recover the cost of  
treating the 500 people afflicted with smoking-related illnesses in 
the Saint-Nazaire area, on France's Atlantic coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smoking has a huge impact on the health of a person. One in  
two smokers will die from tobacco-related causes and half of those 
will die before the age of 69,'' Guy Couillaud, president of social 
security branch, said. ``We believe that tobacco is a highly 
dangerous substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French tobacco industry officials dismissed the action as ``a  
local attempt to apply American judicial concepts ... in a totally 
different context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the latest step in vilifying smokers and the tobacco  
industry, which is a perfectly legal enterprise,'' said Jean-Paul 
Truchot, spokesman for the Center for Documentation and Information 
on Tobacco which represents the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is to be filed in Saint-Nazaire by the end of March.  
</P>
<P>
	Pierre Rousseau, a director of the social security office known  
as the Caisse Primaire d'Assurance Maladie, said that the office in 
the southern city of Avignon may follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the action is aimed at proving before the courts that  
manufacturers are responsible for the health consequences of 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Rousseau estimated the cost of tobacco-related diseases in  
France at aboit $1.8 billion per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to show that it is the manufacturers who are  
responsible,'' he said. ``We are not playing on people's 
consciences. This suit is not against smokers but for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Truchot said the action amounts to the state suing the  
state. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the plant to the packet, from the seed to the consumer,  
everything is owned by the state. It is a public service,'' he said 
in a telephone interview, claiming that income from taxes on 
tobacco products far outweigh the cost of treating smoking-related 
diseases.

<HEADLINE> First Lady To Consider Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday she would  
give ``careful thought'' to running for a U.S. Senate seat from New 
York. Three confidants said she was talking with supporters about 
what it would take to run a serious campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady promised to make her decision later this year.  
President Clinton said on Monday she would be ``terrific in the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's statement drew a quick response from the camp of  
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a possible Republican rival. ``If 
Hillary Clinton announces a run for Senate, that would encourage 
the mayor to consider his candidacy for the Senate as well,'' a 
Giuliani spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly elected Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer sounded a note of  
caution for the first lady. ``I think she would be an extremely 
formidable candidate. I guess she'd have to be the favorite, but 
favorites don't always win,'' Schumer said at a news conference in 
Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she was deeply gratified by ``the large number  
of people who have encouraged me to consider running'' for the 
Senate seat being opened by the retirement of Democratic Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Just four days after the end of her husband's impeachment  
ordeal, Mrs. Clinton said she had not been able to give much 
thought to a potential candidacy but would be able to focus on it 
now. She said she would make her decision later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the meantime,'' she said in a three-sentence statement, ``I  
intend to continue to focus my attention on the issues central to 
the president's agenda and on which we have worked together for so 
many years.'' White House officials were delighted that the 
attention on Mrs. Clinton was taking attention away from the 
president's now-concluded impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry, her press secretary, said she could not elaborate  
on the timing of Mrs. Clinton's decision. ``I can't be any more 
specific than that because she doesn't know. She's going to talk to 
people, those who want her to do it and some who don't, and hear 
them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colleen Roche, press aide to Giuliani, said in response to Mrs.  
Clinton's statement, ``We are told that her candidacy would be the 
singular biggest unifying force in the Republican party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has made it clear he has ambitions beyond City Hall and  
has not ruled out a run for the Senate. He has a strong base, is a 
solid fund-raiser and would be a formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to be the star attraction at a New  
York fund-raiser for the Democratic Party's Women's Leadership 
Forum in the first week of March, providing one opportunity to 
announce her decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Monday he would enthusiastically support whatever  
decision she makes. 
</P>
<P>
	Three confidants of Mrs. Clinton, all speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said she has begun returning telephone calls to 
supporters and asking for information about what it would take to 
run a campaign -- from the amount of money she would have to raise 
to the availability of campaign talent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, these advisers echoed the sentiments of associates of  
Mrs. Clinton, who have been saying for weeks that they suspect she 
will eventually decide against making the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton talked over lunch Friday with former White House  
deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes, who is well versed in New York 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Mrs. Clinton was issuing the statement now, Berry  
said, ``She wanted to let you all know what she is thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton headlined a White House  
announcement on relief aid for Central America. As she left the 
room, a reporter shouted: ``Mrs. Clinton, everybody wants to know 
if you're going to run for the Senate!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton raised her arm, waved mechanically and smiled at  
the reporter, but she said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Her statement touched on her previous inability to focus on any  
decision about running. ``Until now, I have not been able to do so, 
but I will give careful thought to a potential candidacy in order 
to reach a decision later this year,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residency requirements vary among states. In New York a  
candidate need only have purchased or rented a residence by 
Election Day to meet residency requirements for running for office, 
according to Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the state Board of 
Elections. Robert Kennedy was a latecomer to New York when he won a 
Senate seat in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democratic ally of the Clintons, is  
going about the motions of a candidacy herself with forays to 
Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo -- all well outside her own district. 
But Lowey is a lady in waiting. Said her chief of staff, Howard 
Wolfson: ``If Mrs. Clinton wants to run, she will be the candidate. 
And, Nita will support her enthusiastically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats have expressed concern that others might have a  
tough time raising money as long as Mrs. Clinton was viewed as 
interested, but undecided. Polls show Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani 
in a theoretical matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released early this month from Quinnipiac College's  
Polling Institute, had Mrs. Clinton favored by 51 percent of 
registered voters to 42 percent for the mayor. Six percent of 
voters were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 53 percent to 42 
percent.

<HEADLINE>  US Mediator Meets With Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- The top U.S. mediator at the Kosovo  
peace talks flew to Serbia on Tuesday with an ultimatum for 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic: Agree to a U.S.-backed deal 
or else. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright telephoned Milosevic from  
Washington on Tuesday and told him that the ethnic Albanians appear 
ready to sign an agreement, according to spokesman James P. Rubin. 
He said Albright expects Milosevic to sign off on the deal as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, met with  
Milosevic on Tuesday night. Western sources at the talks in France 
said Hill was expected to tell Milosevic that if he doesn't accept 
an agreement by noon Saturday, he will suffer NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	International mediators, led by the United States, have brought  
Serbs and ethnic Albanians to the negotiating table to end a 
conflict that has cost an estimated 2,000 lives and driven hundreds 
of thousands from their homes in Kosovo, located in southern 
Serbia, the dominant of two republics in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
say there is little actual negotiating going on. Delegates, rather, 
are only making minor changes to a largely take-it-or-leave-it 
American deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright visited the talks over the weekend and was sharply  
critical of the Serb side, blaming them for the lack of progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, the leader of the Serbian  
delegation at the talks, said Monday that everything in the 
proposed peace agreement was negotiable except the question of 
foreign troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs were counting on Russia to back up their position, but  
on Tuesday, Russian officials did not block the plan to send 
NATO-led troops as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
Russians have told the 16-nation military alliance they are willing 
to go along with a NATO deployment as part of a three-year interim 
peace deal in Kosovo, where 90 percent of the 2 million inhabitants 
are ethnic Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would also compel Serbia to withdraw most of its troops  
from Kosovo and set up elections to clear the way for some autonomy 
for ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The source also said Russians may eventually participate in a  
peacekeeping operation, as they do in the NATO-led force in Bosnia. 
The Russia-NATO Permanent Joint Council is meeting in Brussels, 
Belgium, on Wednesday to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russian officials still oppose NATO airstrikes against  
Yugoslavia in the event the peace talks fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb sources close to the talks said the negotiating team has  
received no clear instructions from Milosevic on the NATO force 
issue, perhaps sparking Hill's trip to Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, NATO military planning for deployment is virtually  
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Advance troops could be in place in Kosovo in a matter of hours  
with 6,000 to 8,000 more troops quickly following, officials said. 
The first forces to arrive will probably be 2,200 U.S. Marines 
currently in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for the deployment of the main 28,000-man force are  
expected to be finished by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Any American peacekeepers sent to Kosovo would remain until a  
system of self-rule is ``up and running'' and stability is 
restored, the Clinton administration said Tuesday. However, other 
administration officials said the aim is to get the job done within 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, Andy Holmes of the Organization for Security and  
Cooperation in Europe said there was ``tit-for-tat firing'' and 
``small ongoing bursts'' of fighting in the area during the past 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbian Media Center said rebel snipers shot and wounded a  
Serb policeman Tuesday near the village of Lapusnik, 15 miles west 
of Kosovo's capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebels also claimed Yugoslav army troops fired at them near  
Lapastica, 20 miles north of Pristina. 

</P>
<P>
	The six-nation Contact Group is pushing Serb-led Yugoslavia to  
grant autonomy to the ethnic Albanian majority of Kosovo. The 
Americans say any Kosovo settlement must be guaranteed by a NATO 
force. The Kosovo Albanians seem ready to sign a three-year interim 
agreement and tone down their demands for independence, but they 
want a NATO presence to protect them from any threat by Yugoslav 
forces.

	A NATO peacekeeping force of 25,000 troops, including about  
4,000 Americans, would take charge of collecting weapons and 
storing them while keeping the sides apart so the election could 
proceed in a secure environment.

<HEADLINE> Valdez Skipper To Begin Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Former Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph  
Hazelwood can look forward to a month in Alaska each summer for the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But it won't be a vacation.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the veteran tanker captain will don a reflective vest  
to pick up trash along Anchorage highways and clean up litter in 
parks as part of a 10-person work crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood is scheduled to begin serving 1,000 hours of community  
service this year for his 1990 conviction on a charge of negligent 
discharge of oil stemming from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence had remained on hold during eight years of appeals.  
Under an agreement reached with prosecutors in November, Hazelwood 
will serve 200 hours a year through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Hazelwood who ordered the 984-foot tanker to shift  
position to avoid icebergs in Valdez Arm. Hazelwood then went below 
to his cabin, leaving 3rd Mate Gregory Cousins in control of the 
vessel. Cousins ran the vessel onto Bligh Reef just after midnight 
on March 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-million-gallon spill, which remains the nation's worst,  
polluted more than 1,000 miles of Alaska shoreline, killed tens of 
thousands of birds and marine mammals and disrupted fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 1990 criminal trial in state court, a jury acquitted  
Hazelwood of several misdemeanors, including operating a tanker 
while intoxicated, and one felony count of second-degree criminal 
mischief, but found him guilty of the misdemeanor charge of 
spilling oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Karl Johnstone ordered Hazelwood to do 1,000 hours of  
community service, which Johnstone said should include scrubbing 
oiled rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But beach cleanup efforts ended long ago, so Hazelwood won't be  
doing his time in Prince William Sound, said Fred Fulgencio, 
community service supervisor for Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's out of my jurisdiction, unless the state wants me to go  
down there and supervise him,'' Fulgencio said. As of Tuesday, 
Fulgencio had not yet received the sentencing order from the court 
and has not yet contacted Hazelwood to schedule his work service. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood lost his job with Exxon following the wreck. Since  
1992, he has worked as a claims adjuster for a New York City law 
firm.

<HEADLINE> Guard Units To Combat Y2K Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- National Guard units around the country are  
being trained to deal with phone-system outages and other chaos 
that could result from computer crashes when the year 2000 begins. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington state, half of the guard's ground troops will be  
on duty Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. Other states plan to have units on 
standby in case of blackouts, looting or other problems that might 
occur if computers shut down because they can't comprehend the date 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business we're in is to help communities when they're  
overwhelmed by an event, a blizzard, riot or other natural or 
manmade disasters,'' said Lt. Col. Tim Donovan, spokesman for the 
National Guard in Wisconsin. ``We have the resources. And many of 
the consequences being speculated about Y2K are not unlike the 
things we've been doing for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The potential problem stems from how computers deal with the  
date. Since most computers only recognize the last two digits of a 
date, such as the 99 in 1999, some of them are likely to interpret 
00 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Most government officials expect only minor problems from the  
so-called Y2K bug and say training the National Guard is merely a 
precaution. But some people are hoarding canned goods and planning 
to withdraw their money from banks in case deliveries can't be made 
and bank machines can't operate. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are predicting shutdowns of airports, train stations and  
power generators. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case, the adjutant general in Washington state  
rescheduled a drill so that 3,000 guardsmen would be on duty on New 
Year's Eve and Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to call out the Guard in each states rests with the  
governor. If troops are mobilized, they likely would be called to 
aid civilian law-enforcement, transportation agencies and emergency 
medical crews. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Mexico, officials plan to keep all 28 state armories open  
on New Year's Eve, said Guard spokesman Tom Koch. In Rhode Island, 
the Guard's adjutant general chairs regular meetings with state 
agency representatives to discuss contingency plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general has asked all department heads, all heads of local  
emergency management agencies to go back and examine their plans 
based on a worst-case scenario estimate and come back with any kind 
of situation that they might not be able to handle,'' said 1st Lt. 
Gloria Haggarty, a Guard spokeswoman. ``Based on that information, 
we're going to develop additional plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maintaining communication will be vital if problems do occur,  
said Lt. Col. Tom Schultz, a National Guard Bureau spokesman. In 
May, the National Guard will conduct the first national 
communications drill to simulate the loss of telephone service and 
to test its high-frequency radio system. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Neal O'Brien, a spokesman for the Ohio Guard, said states  
are used to handling dire emergencies. In the last five years 
alone, guardsmen were called on to deal with floods, blizzards and 
a prison riot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference between Y2K and all those were that we have a  
year's notice on this one,'' O'Brien said. ``It gives us the 
opportunity to plan in advance, and that is an opportunity that we 
typically don't have for an emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin's Legislature has come under fire recently for a  
proposal to have the National Guard respond if there is a computer 
crisis. State Rep. Marlin Schneider said the measures make a simple 
word change that would authorize the governor to mobilize troops 
for a Y2K-caused problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not expecting civil disorder or anything,'' he said.  
``It is just so he can activate them in advance so they'll be 
prepared. They're getting ready now anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Guard's Donovan agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``When a tornado rips into a Wisconsin community, we never see  
it coming three years out,'' he said. ``But we're taking advantage 
of this storm warming, if you will, and making sure that we're 
going to be able to respond effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're even asked to.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Gets $3.2M Award Vs. Wal-Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSKEGEE, Ala. (AP) -- A jury ordered Wal-Mart to pay $3.2  
million to a woman who said she was wrongly accused of stealing a 
telephone and handcuffed in front of her children. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury in rural Macon County returned the verdict Friday in  
favor of LaShawna Goodman of Opelika, who was arrested Christmas 
Eve 1995 at the Wal-Mart in her town. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Goodman was awarded $3 million in punitive damages, which  
are meant to punish and deter wrongdoing, and $200,000 in 
compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Maher, a spokesman for Wal-Mart in Bentonville, Ark., said  
Tuesday: ``The facts of the case and the amount the jury awarded 
are on two separate planets. We will exhaust every legal remedy to 
right something which we believe is totally wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses testified that Miss Goodman entered the Wal-Mart with  
her two young children to exchange a phone she had bought a week 
earlier. She presented a receipt. Unable to find another phone she 
wanted, Miss Goodman said, she retrieved the initial purchase, 
bought some motor oil and left. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, she was detained and accused of stealing the phone,  
even after she offered the receipt as proof of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Goodman was later acquitted of shoplifting and sued  
Wal-Mart for malicious prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyers contended Wal-Mart security personnel have a quota  
for making arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Maher said there is no such quota. He said there were questions  
over the authenticity of the receipt Miss Goodman presented.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Sees U.S. Cultural War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A prominent conservative, giving voice to  
frustration within the Republican Party over President Clinton's 
acquittal, is telling conservative leaders that American society is 
``approaching barbarism'' and is out of step with their political 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I no longer believe that there is a moral majority,'' Paul  
Weyrich wrote in a letter dated Tuesday to several hundred 
conservatives. ``I do not believe that a majority of Americans 
actually share our values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation in Washington,  
argues that it may be time to ``drop out of this culture'' -- 
perhaps even abandoning efforts to influence the American political 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some sort of quarantine,'' he wrote in the letter  
obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no other leading conservatives have gone that far,  
Weyrich's letter underscores the level of resentment and anger over 
Clinton's acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there really were a moral majority out there, Bill Clinton  
would have been driven out of office month ago,'' Weyrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are angry that he got off,'' said Phyllis  
Schlafly, head of the Eagle Forum. ``They just don't understand it. 
They're shaking their heads: What is the problem?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Coalition director Randy Tate said there is  
``considerable frustration'' over the acquittal because ``it makes 
it tough to teach kids right from wrong, in the sense that the 
president doesn't know right from wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde, who led the  
prosecution team against Clinton, told senators toward the end of 
the trial, ``I wonder if, after this culture war is over that we 
are engaged in, an America will survive that will be worth fighting 
to defend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Weyrich goes further than most other conservative  
leaders, criticizing not only the president and GOP leaders in 
Congress -- but society in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Tate, for example, said conservatives ``are increasingly part of  
the mainstream,'' even on issues such as abortion, because they 
have increased efforts to influence the political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlafly, also departing with Weyrich, said a majority of  
Americans still embrace conservative values. And she says Clinton's 
victory had more to do with politics than morality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only partially a moral problem. I think there is so much  
the Republican Congress can do in so many ways to grab the 
leadership and yet they continue to play a defensive game,'' she 
said. ``Republicans have had Congress since January 1995 and what 
do we have to show for it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich is plowing relatively new ground by suggesting that the  
conservative movement cannot succeed in today's culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The culture we are living in becomes an ever-wider sewer. In  
truth, I think we are caught up in a cultural collapse of historic 
proportions, a collapse so great that it simply overwhelms 
politics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing that it may be time for ``separation'' from society,  
Weyrich points to conservatives who teach their children at home, 
form private courts or get rid of their televisions. ``I think that 
we have to look at a whole series of possibilities for bypassing 
the institutions that are controlled by the enemy,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He offered to hold a meeting to discuss the movement's next  
step. ``I don't have all the answers or even all the questions. But 
I know that what we have been doing for 30 years hasn't worked, 
that while we have been fighting and winning in politics, our 
culture has decayed into something approaching barbarism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Weyrich said he was not suggesting that  
conservatives stop fighting. ``I'm just suggesting that the chance 
of victory that we thought was excellent is now not in the cards,'' 
he said. ``We have to take the appropriate action.''

<HEADLINE> What Will Talk Radio Talk About? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- The callers have phoned from cars, kitchens  
and doughnut shops, and their words condemn. Sleazy, slimy, 
immoral. Indefensible. Reprehensible. Liar, they spit into the 
airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	They've ranted about Bill. They've jabbered about Monica.  
They've talked and talked and talked about sex in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen months of sizzling presidential scandal have fueled  
talk radio with angry words and big ratings, and show hosts predict 
they'll be talking about it for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like manna from heaven for talk radio,'' said Jack  
Cashill, the conservative voice of KMBZ in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been Monica all day and every day for the most part,''  
said Mary O'Halloran, his liberal counterpart on ``Talk Back with 
Mary and Jack,'' where ratings are up. ``I think the interest will 
just increase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk show callers and hosts have joked about the Gap dress and  
snickered over the cigar. Some called President Clinton the target 
of a witch hunt, others called him a danger to women everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In the heart of the country, most of those callers are  
conservatives. They tend to consider talk radio their territory, 
said Ms. O'Halloran, whose show is followed by the king of the 
radio right, Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative gray-haired men who form the breakfast club at  
Anne's Daylight Donuts in Tulsa see no reason why talk radio 
shouldn't be their territory. 
</P>
<P>
	No pollsters ever called them. They never saw their disgust with  
Clinton's ``sin and spin'' aired on the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
	When the dozen-or-so regulars conduct Clinton polls over cups of  
black coffee and smoldering cigarettes, they have their own voice 
willing to air the results. It hits northeastern Oklahoma every 
morning at 50,000 watts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Erling in the morning!'' KRMG host John Erling belts into  
the pre-dawn darkness before promising more talk when ``William 
Jefferson Clinton does something stupid again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the kind of talk that appeals to Jim Addington. Without  
talk radio, ``Clinton would never have been impeached,'' the 
71-year-old notes to the nods of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	The callers have urged their leaders to do what's best for the  
country. Step down. Stay put. Convict. Censure. Just leave it all 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	But the listeners themselves can't leave it alone.  
</P>
<P>
	Ronn Owens at KGO radio in San Francisco tries other topics, but  
none have the same ``umpfh,'' even in a city brimming with Clinton 
supporters, he said. Callers like the Clinton scandal because it's 
juicy, shallow and requires nothing more than an opinion on 
character issues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true that despite everyone's professed boredom, when I  
don't get into it, people are chomping at the bit to talk about 
it.'' Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimates he has devoted about one-third of his shows to the  
story since it broke in 1998, raking in higher ratings in return. 
Owens predicts interest will fade soon, and he isn't sure what will 
captivate listeners next. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what we're going to be talking about, but I bet  
it won't be Kosovo,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kansas City, Ms. O'Halloran hears from callers who feel  
disconnected from Washington politics and are frustrated with 
Congress. She thinks the talk will stay strong as voters seek 
revenge at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	In Clinton's home state, talk show host Pat Lynch at KARN in  
Little Rock, Ark., said he plans to move on with discussions about 
Arkansas highways, kids and guns and more scrutiny of the state's 
governor. But he sees no end to the Clinton story. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will never happen,'' he said. ``We're going to be talking  
about Clinton as long as we live. He is the political Elvis.''

	JACKSON, Mich. (AP) -- Denise B. Cavins, a reporter for the  
Jackson Citizen Patriot for 32 years, died Sunday of cancer. She 
was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	During her career she covered a wide range of stories. She  
worked for two years at the South Bend Tribune in Indiana before 
starting at the Citizen Patriot in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last seven years of her career, Ms. Cavins covered  
government and school news in Blackman Township, the western side 
of Jackson County and eastern part of Calhoun County. She retired

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John D. Ehrlichman, President Nixon's domestic  
affairs adviser who was imprisoned for 18 months for the Watergate 
conspiracy, died Sunday of natural causes. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman, who along with H.R. Haldeman was one of Nixon's two  
top advisers, resigned from his White House post in April 1973 and 
was convicted two years later for obstruction of justice, 
conspiracy and perjury in the attempted cover-up of the burglary of 
the Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate complex 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	As the cover-up began to unravel and pressure mounted, Nixon  
summoned Haldeman and domestic counsel John Ehrlichman to the 
presidential cabin at Camp David, Md., in April 1973 and told them 
they would have to resign. The next day, he fired White House 
counsel John Dean, and accepted the resignations of Haldeman, 
Ehrlichman and Attorney General Richard Kleindienst. 
</P>
<P>
	Under threat of impeachment, Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974. He  
was later pardoned by President Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman spent 18 months at Swift Trail Camp, a  
minimum-security federal prison south of Safford, Ariz., and was 
released in 1978. Haldeman also served 18 months in prison and died 
in November 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	After getting out of prison, he moved to Santa Fe, N.M., where  
he began a new career as an artist, writer and commentator. 
Ehrlichman wrote four novels: ``The Company'' 1976; ``The Whole 
Truth'' 1979; ``The China Card'' 1986; (co-author) of ``The Rigby 
File'' 1989. He also wrote a memoir that was published in 1983, 
``Witness to Power: The Nixon Years.''

	GARY, Ind. (AP) -- Gerald ``Bounce'' Gregory, the bass singer who  
hit the distinctive low notes on The Spaniels' 1950s classic 
``Goodnight Sweetheart, Goodnight,'' died Friday at age 64. 
</P>
<P>
	While the doo-wop group didn't hit it big nationally, their  
signature song, penned by lead singer James ``Pookie'' Hudson, was 
covered by several bands during the 1950s, notably The McGwire 
Sisters and Pat Boone. 
</P>
<P>
	Sha-Na-Na sang ``Goodnight Sweetheart, Goodnight'' to close its  
television show each week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniels were made up of students from Gary's Roosevelt High  
School. Gregory, Hudson, Willie C. Jackson, Opal Courtney Jr. and 
Ernest Warren formed the group in 1952. The group later signed with 
Chicago record label Vee Jay Records. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniels were awarded the Pioneer Award from the Rhythm &AMP;  
Blues Foundation of the Smithsonian Institution in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's career was at its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, but  
the Spaniels, with some replacement members, continued to perform 
around the country. Gregory's last performance with the group was

</P>
<P>
	Knox penned his biggest hit, ``Party Doll,'' as early as 1948.  
Seven years later, he formed the Rhythm Orchids with Jimmy Bowen on 
bass and Don Lanier on guitar. Studio owner Norman Petty cut 
``Party Doll'' and Bowen's ``I'm Stickin' With You'' on the local 
Triple-D label in 1956, using a cardboard box instead of drums.

<P>
	The tunes were later picked up by Roulette's then-new NYC label,

<HEADLINE> Tonya Harding Announces Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Tonya Harding announced her latest  
comeback to skating Tuesday, saying there has been a recent easing 
of her lifetime ban from the sport for her role in the 1994 Nancy 
Kerrigan knee whacking. 
</P>
<P>
	That was news to the U.S. Figure Skating Association, which  
emphasized that absolutely nothing has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not changed our stance on a lifetime ban for Tonya  
Harding,'' USFSA spokesman Bob Dunlop said. ``That's about as 
simple as I can make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harding revealed her plans Tuesday on KPTV's breezy ``Good Day  
Oregon'' morning show. Between hugs with her dog, Dakota, and talk 
of a new man in her life, Harding said the USFSA had a meeting last 
week in which officials said she could skate professionally with 
their skaters in competitions and shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say I can skate with their skaters and in shows,''  
Harding said, adding that she has turned her life around and wants 
to return to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Skating always been my whole life,'' she said. ``I just love  
it. I miss my old friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunlop said Harding continues to be banned from all USFSA  
sanctioned events, including the popular televised Champions on 
Ice, featuring such stars as Michelle Kwan. Non-sanctioned events 
are the only venues in which Harding can skate professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what she's aiming at, said Michael Rosenberg, Harding's  
former manager who is now acting as her adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg said he spoke informally with USFSA officials last  
week to clarify that the ban included no reprisals against other 
skaters who appeared in professional events with Harding. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last five years, skaters have been worried that if  
they skated on the same ice with Tonya, they would never be invited 
to a pro-am event,'' Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that in the past five years, Harding has tried other  
comebacks but no promoters or tour producers ever approached her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been like a pariah in the skating world,'' Rosenberg  
said. ``She's tried to sing, she's tried to wrestle, she's done 
interviews for money... That's how she's scraped out a living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She should be able to resume her life and do what she was born  
to do,'' Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding, 28, was convicted of hindering prosecution in the  
attack on Kerrigan at the USFSA national championships in Detroit. 
She was fined $110,000 and ordered to perform community service. 
Her ex-husband and two other men were convicted and served time for 
planning and carrying out the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``She paid the fine, did the community service, and was banned  
from her sport for five years,'' Rosenberg said. ``That's more than 
paying for what she did.''

<HEADLINE> Steel Industry Files Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leading U.S. steel companies and the United  
Steelworkers Union filed more import complaints Tuesday, accusing 
eight countries of dumping steel at below production costs and home 
market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The action against Czech Republic, France, India, Indonesia,  
Italy, Japan, Macedonia and South Korea came just days after the 
industry won a ruling that Japan and Brazil had illegally dumped 
hot-rolled steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The new anti-dumping complaints involve a different type of  
steel, cut-to-length plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of that steel product have increased by 521 percent from  
those eight countries since 1995, the industry said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint news release, Bethlehem Steel Corp., Gulf States  
Steel Inc., IPSCO Steel, Inc., Tuscaloosa Steel Co., USX Corp. and 
the union said those eight countries were responsible for pushing 
down prices that forced American factories to significantly cut 
back production. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions of these foreign producers have caused serious  
injury to our domestic industry,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission has 45 days and the  
Commerce Department 160 days to make a preliminary determination of 
injury that could lead to new tariffs on steel exports from those 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Still pending is a Clinton administration decision on a deal  
with Russia that could allow that nation to avoid tariffs on its 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a deal would anger the American steel industry, which does  
not want to see Russia given a guaranteed price or slice of the 
U.S. market, but the administration is reluctant to impose a 
trading penalty that could aggravate Russia's troubled economy.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Negotiating With Meares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates are negotiating with  
free agent infielder Pat Meares, who was seeking $4 million a year 
but may take closer to $1 million after failing to get a long-term 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Pirates sign Meares to temporarily play shortstop, it  
could clear the way for them to trade second baseman Tony Womack 
and outfielder Al Martin to Arizona for outfielder Bernard Gilkey 
and another player. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking,'' Steve Comte, Meares' agent, said Tuesday.  
``But the Pirates aren't the only team we're talking to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meares turned down a contract proposal from the Minnesota Twins  
last fall, saying he wanted a multiyear deal worth $4 million a 
year. But the Twins failed to offer him a 1999 contract by the Dec. 
20 deadline, making him a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates, as did several other teams, were interested at the  
time but apparently were scared off by Meares' contract demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares batted .260 with nine home runs and 70 RBIs last season  
with Minnesota, or 20 more RBIs than the combined total of Pirates 
shortstops Kevin Polcovich, Lou Collier and Abraham Nunez. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates' offer to Meares is thought to be in the $1.25  
million range. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade with Arizona still was being worked out Wednesday  
night, according to baseball sources, with the hangup being the 
millions owed Gilkey in deferred money. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilkey's contract is worth $2.5 million this season and $2.5  
million in 2000, with an additional $2.5 million deferred each 
season. The deferred money is paid out at $1 million a year for 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash-thin Pirates have never taken on such a contract, and  
apparently want Arizona to pick up most of the deferred money. Also 
uncertain is where they would play Gilkey, since they are set in 
the outfield with Brian Giles in left, Brant Brown in center and 
Jose Guillen in right. 
</P>
<P>
	After sliding to a 69-93 record last season, the Pirates traded  
for Giles and Brown to upgrade their offense, add more power and 
give them more defensive stability. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates are trying to trade Martin partly because they don't  
want their highest-paid player -- he will make $2.8 million this 
season -- to be a reserve outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Pirates deal for Gilkey, they may try to trade him  
immediately for a prospect or two, or hold onto him for half a 
season and attempt to deal him to a contender in July or August. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Cam Bonifay declined to speculate whether a deal  
was close -- either with Arizona or Meares, who likely would play 
shortstop until the slick-fielding Nunez is ready offensively to 
play in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	If Womack is dealt, Mike Benjamin probably would play second  
until rookie Warren Morris is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he would welcome a trade to Arizona, where he lives  
during the offseason, even if he wasn't guaranteed a starting job 
there. He likely would compete in right field with Womack, whom the 
Diamondbacks would move to the outfield.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Talk of Kosovo Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Serb negotiators were getting  
pressure from the East and West to back away from their refusal to 
allow NATO troops in Yugoslavia to monitor any peace agreement 
reached for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, which had backed Serbia in its opposition to foreign  
troops, now has apparently changed its position. While Moscow may 
not approve a NATO force, it at least will not block it, diplomatic 
sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Under heavy pressure from the United States and five European  
nations to sign an American-sponsored political settlement by 
Saturday, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic said Monday he 
wouldn't compromise on the proposal to station NATO troops in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think that the troops are needed if the agreement is  
good and acceptable to the majority of people living in Kosovo,'' 
Milutinovic said, insisting that abandoning plans for a NATO 
peacekeeping force would be a ``precondition'' for any peace 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-nation Contact Group is pushing Serb-led Yugoslavia to  
grant autonomy to the ethnic Albanian majority of Kosovo. More than 
2,000 people have been killed in fighting in the southern Yugoslav 
province over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans say any Kosovo settlement must be guaranteed by a  
NATO force. The alliance is completing plans to dispatch as many as 
30,000 troops to Kosovo, including up to 4,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo Albanians seem ready to sign a three-year interim  
agreement and tone down their demands for independence, but they 
want a NATO presence to protect them from any threat by Yugoslav 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has threatened airstrikes against Yugoslavia if an  
agreement is not reached at the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs seem to have been backed into a corner, and their  
options were fraught with complications. 
</P>
<P>
	If Serbs sign a peace deal, they would almost certainly face a  
public backlash for caving in on Kosovo, which is considered the 
cradle of Serbia's civilization and religion. If they fail to sign, 
they must prepare for NATO to unleash its missiles and bombs on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since the Kosovo conference started Feb. 6,  
Milutinovic on Monday indicated the Serbians were willing to give 
up most of their demands that have stalled the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Milutinovic said that  
the proposed NATO deployment was the major sticking point and that 
the rest was negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
	Any NATO deployment would ``badly damage our sovereignty,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE>  Trial Opens in Dragging Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A sheriff testified Tuesday that he figured  
out pretty quickly the accident he was investigating was no 
hit-and-run -- especially after a lighter with three interlocking 
K's was found along the bloody trail left by a black man who had 
been dragged to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a brand-new sheriff. I didn't even know the definition of  
a hate crime, but I knew somebody had been murdered because he had 
been black,'' Billy Rowles said. ``Once we saw the KKK emblem on 
the cigarette lighter, that's when we started having some bad 
thoughts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rowles was the first witness as alleged white supremacist John  
William King went on trial Tuesday on murder charges in the 
gruesome death of James Byrd Jr. Byrd, 49, was chained to the back 
of a pickup truck June 7 and dragged for three miles as his body 
was ripped to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	King, a 24-year-old unemployed laborer, is the first of three  
white men charged in the crime to stand trial. He could get the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Guy James Gray said in his opening statement that  
King's tattoos and writings in his apartment show King was an angry 
racist who wanted to form a hate group and ``needed to do something 
dramatic in order to gain in their warped world respect for his 
newly formed gang.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury consists of 11 whites and one black. Jasper County,  
from which the jurors were drawn, is 18 percent black. 
</P>
<P>
	King's attorney, Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs, made no opening  
statement, reserving the option to do so later. ``The evidence, it 
appears overwhelming,'' he acknowledged Monday. ``But you've got to 
prove the accused has done the offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff described to jurors what he saw early in his  
investigation. Rowles said the evidence wasn't consistent with a 
routine hit-and-run accident: There were no skid marks, and the 
bloody trail did not run parallel to the tire tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was going through my mind: We've got a problem. Somebody's  
dragging something,'' Rowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighter with three K's forming a triangle was also engraved  
with the word ``Possum,'' the nickname King picked up while in 
prison for burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors were given a folder of photos of Byrd's battered  
remains, which an investigator said were missing a right arm, neck 
and head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like an animal drug down the road,'' Tommy Robinson  
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-year-old Jasper woman, Michelle Chapman, testified that  
during a two-year period while King was in prison, she received 19 
letters from him, some of them filled with racist venom. One 
included the proclamation: ``White is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he got out, Ms. Chapman said, King visited her in June 1997  
and showed the tattoos he got while locked up, including one of a 
black man hanged. Gray, the prosecutor, said the tattoos also 
include a burning cross, a Confederate flag and Nazi swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighter, King's DNA on a cigarette and less than a drop of  
the victim's blood on King's shoes all will link King to the 
killing, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also found handwritten notes in King's apartment  
that included a constitution, bylaws, a code of ethics and a 
membership application for a group to be called the Texas Rebel 
Soldiers of the Confederate Knights of America, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	King showed little reaction in court, responding only with a  
``not guilty, your honor,'' when asked how he pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
	King's ailing father, Ronald, an oxygen tube in his nose, sat  
nearby, as did Kylie Greeney, his girlfriend and mother of the 
couple's infant son. 
</P>
<P>
	As has been the custom, he wore a bulletproof vest as he was  
escorted into the courthouse by deputies. The 110-year-old 
courthouse has been outfitted for the trial with metal detectors, 
package scanners and numerous security cameras. State District 
Judge Joe Bob Golden has barred rallies and signs about the case 
for two blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other men, Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, and Shawn Allen  
Berry, 23, will be be tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen members of Byrd's family were present when court began,  
but some left, including two of his children. Some burst into tears 
when Byrd's blackened and torn white underwear was introduced into 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get closure to what happened to my father,''  
said Renee Mullins, 28, who stayed in court. ``I feel obligated to 
be here.''

<HEADLINE> American Flights Nearly All Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Operations at American Airlines are expected to be  
almost normal today, a sharp contrast to the past 10 days during 
which more than 6,000 flights were canceled due to a pilot sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth-based airline has canceled only 17 flights  
scheduled for today, spokesman John Hotard said. 
</P>
<P>
	American's parent company, AMR Corp., and the Allied Pilots  
Association have begun negotiating again over the integration of 
the recently purchased Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks broke down earlier this month over a dispute over how the  
Reno pilots were being paid caused pilots to start calling in sick 
and refusing to work overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 800 of American's 9,400 pilots were still listed as  
sick Monday, compared to the nearly 2,500 who declared themselves 
unfit to fly Thursday and Friday, American officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, pilots have been taking themselves off  
the sick list at a rapid rate since Saturday after a federal judge 
ruled held the union and two top board members in contempt and 
promised sizable fines against them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 -- or roughly 11 percent -- of the 2,250 flights  
scheduled were canceled Monday because some pilots weren't 
immediately available for flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotard compared the impact on the airline's flight system to bad  
weather over the airline's Chicago, Miami or Dallas-Fort Worth 
hubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pilots complained that the number of pilots on the sick  
list could have been inflated because they had been trying to 
remove themselves, but normal procedures were suspended. Instead, 
they were told they had to meet with their chief medical officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotard said that was true for only 12 or 13 pilots who face  
possible disciplinary action for flying as passengers while they 
were on the sick list. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall threatened a ``significant''  
fine against the pilots' union Saturday, saying that the union did 
not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after he 
ordered the union to end the sickout last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge required the union place $10 million, or one-quarter  
of the union's net worth, with the court in preparation of making 
his final decision this Wednesday. He also ordered union president 
Rich LaVoy and vice president Brian Mayhew to remit a total of 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 6,000 flights have been canceled since the work action  
began, costing American between $67 million and $90 million, 
according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR Corp. The final 
total has not been projected. 
</P>
<P>
	American also will see revenue reductions in the future. The  
airline said it will reduce its schedule 2 percent in the spring, 
or about 45-50 flights a day, because it does not believe pilots 
will volunteer for extra overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute is over how Reno Air pilots have been paid since AMR  
took control of the low-cost carrier last December. AMR wants to 
pay the pilots higher rates as they are retrained, but the union 
believes their contract guarantees the pilots are paid more from 
the purchase date. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot is paid. AMR said the pilot union's 
demands to add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale quickly would 
cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said the sickout had not changed their original  
negotiating positions. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, neither the company or union has requested a federal  
mediator or binding arbitration in the dispute.

husband-trainer Sonny, was a unanimous selection, getting the votes 
of the National Turf Writers Association, Daily Racing Form and 
racing secretaries of National Thoroughbred Racing Association 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The big gray horse, winner of his first seven starts, which  
stretched his victory streak to nine, beat Awesome Again, who won 
all six starts and beat Skip Away in the Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards were announced at the NTRA's Eclipse Awards dinner at  
Miami Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away, who was 5, beat Awesome Again, who was 4, as best  
older horse or gelding. Frank Stronach, Awesome Again's owner, was 
voted the top owner of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away, 3-year-old champion in 1996 and best older horse and  
gelding and runnerup for Horse of the Year in 1997, obviously won 
racing's top honor on the strength of his schedule. Of his seven 
straight wins, five of them were Grade I stakes, one of them was a 
Grade II and the other was a Grade III. He finished third in the 
Grade I Woodward, then sixth in Grade I BC Classic, finishing with 
$2.74 million for the year and $9,612,36660 for his career, second 
only to Cigar ($9,999,815). 
</P>
<P>
	Awesome Again won two Grade I stakes -- the Whitney Handicap and  
the BC Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Another big winner was Bob Baffert. He got an Eclipse Award as  
trainer of the year and two of his charges won divisional 
championships -- Real Quiet, winner of the Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness, 3-year-old, and unbeaten Silverbulletday, 2-year-old 
filly. 
</P>
<P>
	Every winner was a unanimous first-place selection of each of  
the three voting organizations. The outstanding breeder award, 
given to Mr. and Mrs. John C. Mabee, was selected by a special 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Other equine winners were Answer Lively, 2-year-old colt or  
gelding; Banshee Breeze, 3-year-old filly; Escena, older filly or 
mare; Buck's Boy, male turf horse; Memories of Silver, female turf 
horse; Flat Top, steeplechaser.

<HEADLINE> First Lady To Consider Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday she would  
give ``careful thought'' to running for a U.S. Senate seat from New 
York. Three confidants said she was talking with supporters about 
what it would take to run a serious campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady promised to make her decision later this year.  
President Clinton said on Monday she would be ``terrific in the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she was deeply gratified by ``the large number  
of people who have encouraged me to consider running'' for the 
Senate seat being opened by the retirement of Democratic Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Just four days after the end of her husband's impeachment  
ordeal, Mrs. Clinton said she had not been able to give much 
thought to a potential candidacy but would be able to focus on it 
now. She said she would make her decision later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the meantime,'' she said in a three-sentence statement, ``I  
intend to continue to focus my attention on the issues central to 
the president's agenda and on which we have worked together for so 
many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry, her press secretary, said she could not elaborate  
on the timing of Mrs. Clinton's decision. ``I can't be any more 
specific than that because she doesn't know. She's going to talk to 
people, those who want her to do it and some who don't, and hear 
them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first week of March, Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to be the  
star attraction at a New York fund-raiser for the Democratic 
Party's Women's Leadership Forum, providing one opportunity to 
announce her decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Monday he would enthusiastically support whatever  
decision she makes. 
</P>
<P>
	Three confidants of Mrs. Clinton, all speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said she has begun returning telephone calls to 
supporters and asking for information about what it would take to 
run a campaign -- from the amount of money she would have to raise 
to the availability of campaign talent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, these advisers echoed the sentiments of associates of  
Mrs. Clinton, who have been saying for weeks that they suspect she 
will eventually decide against making the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton talked over lunch Friday with former White House  
deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes, who is well versed in New York 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Mrs. Clinton was issuing the statement now, Berry  
said, ``She wanted to let you all know what she is thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton headlined a White House  
announcement on relief aid for Central America. As she left the 
room, a reporter shouted: ``Mrs. Clinton, everybody wants to know 
if you're going to run for the Senate!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton raised her arm, waved mechanically and smiled at  
the reporter, but she said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Her statement touched on her previous inability to focus on any  
decision about running. ``Until now, I have not been able to do so, 
but I will give careful thought to a potential candidacy in order 
to reach a decision later this year,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residency requirements vary among states. In New York a  
candidate need only have purchased or rented a residence by 
Election Day to meet residency requirements for running for office, 
according to Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the state Board of 
Elections. Robert Kennedy was a latecomer to New York when he won a 
Senate seat in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democratic ally of the Clintons, is  
going about the motions of a candidacy herself with forays to 
Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo -- all well outside her own district. 
But Lowey is a lady in waiting. Said her chief of staff, Howard 
Wolfson: ``If Mrs. Clinton wants to run, she will be the candidate. 
And, Nita will support her enthusiastically.''

<HEADLINE> Dell Quarterly Profit Jumps 49 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fourth-quarter revenue for Dell Computer Corp.  
fell short of Wall Street expectations, though the computer company 
still managed a 49 percent profit increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The revenue disappointment was unusual for Dell, the  
third-largest seller of computers that has set a scorching industry 
pace with its unconventional tactic of selling machines directly to 
customers and avoiding the middleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have been more aggressive in pricing in our  
product,'' Dell chief financial officer Thomas Meredith said in a 
phone interview from the company's Round Rock, Texas headquarters. 
He said the company may become a more vigorous cost cutter as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell has held fast with its strategy of refusing to compete on  
price with other major makers, such as Compaq Computer Corp. and 
International Business Machines Corp. Instead, Dell has focused on 
higher-end machines with bigger margins, managing to post 
consistently strong income even as rivals' narrowed. 
</P>
<P>
	That strategy resulted in a profit of $425 million, or 31 cents  
a share, meeting analysts' forecasts for the company's fourth 
quarter, ended Jan. 29. That was up from a profit of $285 million, 
or 20 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That increase was partly due to slower rate of cost increases in  
the quarter as revenue grew only 38 percent, to $5.17 billion from 
$3.74 billion. That was about $200 million less than analyst 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell was able to hold the line on higher costs in part by  
boosting its Internet business, which requires fewer staff than 
conventional sales. Dell sold $14 million a day in computers over 
the Internet in the quarter, up from $10 million daily the quarter 
before, Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dell's full fiscal year, profit grew 55 percent to $1.46  
billion, or $1.05 a share, from $944 million, or 64 cents a share. 
Revenue rose to $18.24 billion from $12.33 billion.

<HEADLINE> Weiland Told To Enter Drug Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland has  
been ordered back into drug rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiland pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug possession Tuesday in  
connection with an arrest last June, when police found him in a 
city housing project with $100 worth of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have faced up to a year in jail. But Criminal Court  
Judge Neil Ross sentenced Weiland to a conditional discharge and 
told him to complete a California drug program that a judge there 
ordered him to finish after a 1995 narcotics arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge will dismiss Weiland's case after a year if he  
complies with the court's orders and does not get arrested again. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiland's lawyer, Robert Kalina, said the drug program is very  
intensive. Weiland will remain in the program until the people who 
run it tell him he can leave, Kalina said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stone Temple Pilots won a Grammy in 1994 in the hard rock  
performance with vocal category for the song ``Plush.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Japan Bankruptcies Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Individual bankruptcies in Japan soared 40 percent  
last year to a record high amid rising corporate failures and 
restructuring, a news report said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 103,800 people filed for court protection in 1998, the  
third straight record high year for personal bankruptcies, Kyodo 
News reported, quoting data released by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 11,300 individuals filed for bankruptcy in December  
alone, compared to 11,273 for 1990, Kyodo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment in Japan is 4.3 percent as the country struggles  
through its worst recession in decades. Last month, a Tokyo think 
tank said corporate bankruptcies in 1998 rose 17.1 percent to 
19,171 cases, the second-highest level since World War II.

<HEADLINE> Cecilia Bartoli Breaks Right Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cecilia Bartoli broke her right ankle slipping  
on ice outside the Zurich Opera but still intends to sing her first 
Donna Elvira in Mozart's ``Don Giovanni'' this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old mezzo-soprano injured herself last week when  
leaving the opera house after a rehearsal, said her New York-based 
publicist, Edgar Vincent. Miss Bartoli missed two performances of 
Rossini's ``The Barber of Seville'' as a result of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday she rehearsed in a wheelchair,'' Vincent said  
Tuesday. ``Today she graduated to crutches. She is intent on doing 
the opening night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Bartoli has sung Zerlina in ``Don Giovanni'' but never  
Donna Elvira. She is scheduled to perform the role eight times 
through March 16 in the new Juergen Flimm production, which is 
conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and has Rodney Gilfrey in the 
title role.

<HEADLINE>  Mike Utley Takes a Few Giant Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Mike Utley's legs buckled under him a couple of  
times, and he had to be steadied by two friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the wobbly steps that Utley took Monday represented an  
emotional triumph after seven years of unfailing optimism and 
exhausting physical therapy in the face of overwhelming odds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 17, 1991, Utley, a third-year offensive lineman for the  
Detroit Lions, was paralyzed with two crushed vertebrae, a 
horrifying injury suffered in a game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has vowed to someday walk off the Silverdome turf  
in Pontiac, Mich., from the exact spot where he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he took his first public steps toward that goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``By standing up, you feel who you are,'' he said. ``I was 315  
pounds and 6-foot-6. I was proud to be as big as I was. I was proud 
to be as tall as I am. I want it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towering over everyone as he did so long ago, wearing a Lions  
T-shirt, Utley slowly struggled down a wooden walkway, painfully 
swinging one leg ahead, then the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice his legs gave way, and the two buddies on each side,  
retired NFL center Bill Lewis and Lions linebacker Rob 
Frederickson, had to catch him. Girlfriend Dani Andersen helped by 
steadying the lower leg braces that kept his ankles from rolling 
inward. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it 10 feet or so.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was awesome to see him up there,'' Lewis said. ``Yesterday  
when we rehearsed, I was practically in tears. It's nothing short 
of miraculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he finished his news conference, just before he wheeled out  
of the room, he gave a ``thumbs up'' sign to a boy sitting on a 
man's shoulders in the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The gesture has become his trademark, just as Utley has come to  
symbolize grit, determination and optimism in the face of grim 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley, 33, is paralyzed from the chest and elbows down. His  
upper arms still are the bulging biceps of a football lineman. But 
he has only partial control of his hands and lower arms. About two 
years ago, he began to feel some sensations in his legs. He can 
feel his toes, describing it as the way you'd feel on an extremely 
cold day. 
</P>
<P>
	He began working with biofeedback, trying to identify the  
connection between his brain and those few alive nerves in his 
legs. He kept up daily, grueling physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rehabilitation is a lifestyle,'' he said. ``It's not something  
you just do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for his public display, and the pressure that  
came with it, on Monday was his desire to raise more money for his 
Mike Utley Foundation, dedicated research aimed at finding a cure 
for spinal cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley was quick to point out that no two spinal cord injuries  
are the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing you can control is your mind,'' he said. ``I'm  
not saying everyone will get as far as I've gotten. But they can do 
something today they didn't do yesterday. Maybe they can go 
outside. Maybe they can wheel themselves around the block, and 
maybe tomorrow they can do two blocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley credits his positive attitude for everything he has  
accomplished, whether it was snow skiing, scuba diving, driving his 
specially equipped van or taking those few steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken a few more steps before, but I've never gone this  
far,'' he said. ``I want to walk off that Silverdome, and one day I 
will. It might not be tomorrow, but someday I will. I guarantee 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, who once told him he'd never walk again, now look on  
Utley as a great asset. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives their new patients hope,'' Utley said. ``If you take  
hope away, if you take dreams away, you lose them forever. But it 
goes back to the person. If you're a champion before you got hurt, 
you're a champion now. But you have to work at it. You have to have 
goals. I will never be number two, not today, not tomorrow, not 
ever. Why? Because I believe in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He talked of going to hospitals to visit children stricken by  
paralyzing injuries, seeing their family's in pain and solidifying 
his determination to find a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see moms and dads cry anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before he rose for that moment on his feet, he explained why he  
decided to take these steps publicly. He wanted to show doctors, 
insurance companies and the health industry in general that 
rehabilitation is a lifelong process, something a seriously injured 
person needs to do until he dies. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a more personal reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do it for my family and the people who have given me  
support from the first day when I came off that field and gave that 
thumbs up,'' he said, ``everyone in the Detroit organization, the 
friends I've made since I've been hurt. I will show them that I 
have never quit. I will never quit until I am completely free of 
this spinal cord injury.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Finds Too Many Crime Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The avalanche of new laws Congress has passed  
since 1970 to make America's streets safe has failed, a report 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no persuasive evidence that federalization of local  
crime makes the streets safer for American citizens,'' says a 
report prepared by a blue-ribbon task force sponsored by the 
American Bar Association and chaired by former Attorney General 
Edwin Meese III. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crime legislation is popular. Most of the time it's just  
feel-good legislation'' because existing state and local laws are 
sufficient to address the targeted problems, Meese told reporters 
today as the report was made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Such duplication ``undermines the critical role of the states  
and local law enforcement,'' said Meese, the nation's top 
law-enforcement officer during the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-member task force says a Congress worried about being  
called ``soft on crime'' actually may be hurting the fight against 
street violence by passing federal laws that duplicate state and 
local efforts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-page report, backed up by hundreds of pages of  
statistical findings, calls on Congress to resist its political 
impulses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an understandable pressure on Congress not to vote  
against crime legislation even if it is misguided, unnecessary and 
harmful,'' the report's executive summary says. ``But there must be 
a recognition that a refusal to endorse a new federal crime is not 
a sign that a legislator is soft on crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The product of a two-year study, the report notes with alarm  
that more than 40 percent of all federal criminal laws enacted 
since the Civil War were passed since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``Highly publicized criminal incidents are frequently  
accompanied by proposals for congressional responses for no reason 
other than that the conduct is serious, even if the activity is 
already handled by state law,'' the summary says. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Federalization of Criminal Law'' report mirrors criticism  
raised by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in his year-end report 
on the federal judiciary in December. He blamed the trend on 
pressure in Congress ``to appear responsive to every highly 
publicized societal ill or sensational crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report states: ``Increased federalization is rarely, if  
ever, likely to have any appreciable effect on the categories of 
violent crime that most concern Americans, because in practice 
federal law enforcement can reach only a small percent of such 
activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State law enforcement accounts for about 95 percent of all  
prosecutions nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inappropriate federalization'' can contribute to ``long-range  
damage to real crime control'' by diverting federal money better 
spent on state law-enforcement systems, the report says, and can 
deplete funding of federal law-enforcement efforts not duplicated 
by the states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expanding coverage of federal criminal law, much of it  
enacted in the absence of a demonstrated and distinctive federal 
justification, is moving the nation rapidly toward two broadly 
overlapping, parallel and essentially redundant sets of criminal 
prohibitions. ... Such a system has little to commend it and much 
to condemn it,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sampling of the latest available statistics demonstrates that  
several recently enacted federal statutes, championed by many 
because they would have a claimed impact on crime, have hardly been 
used at all,'' the task force found. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the laws cited dealt with drive-by shootings, interstate  
domestic violence, failure to report child abuse and murder by 
escaped prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Simpson's Heisman Sold for $230,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson's Heisman Trophy fetched  
$230,000 Tuesday night at auction to benefit the estates of the 
former football star's slain ex-wife and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Simpson items were sold for between $10 and $10,000 at the  
auction held at Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield. Bidders were allowed to 
make offers by phone, in person and over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items sold were a life-sized metal statue of Simpson  
for $3,250, a glass University of Southern California Hall of Fame 
award for $1,800, and a player of the year trophy give by ABC Wide 
World of Sports in 1973 for $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction proceeds, estimated to be above $300,000, came  
nowhere close to satisfying a $33.5 million judgment owed to the 
estate of Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and the family 
of Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	The judgment stems from a civil wrongful death suit in which a  
jury found Simpson liable for the killings of Ms. Simpson and 
Goldman. Simpson was acquitted of murder in an earlier criminal 
trial.

	The high bid for the Heisman Trophy was made over the telephone.  
No other information was immediately available on the winning 
bidder.

<P>
	Another bidder told reporters afterward that he spent $16,000  
and plans to burn everything, including a $10,000 Hall of Fame

<HEADLINE> Track Chief Supports Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The powerful president of world track and field  
offered his first formal support Tuesday for embattled IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Primo Nebiolo's statement was issued through the Council of the  
Association of Summer Olympic International Federations, over which 
he presides. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Council is convinced that Samaranch is exceptionally  
qualified to navigate the IOC through these troubled waters,'' the 
statement said. ``At a time like this when strength, wisdom and 
determination are absolutely necessary to reinforce faith in the 
Olympic Movement, his experience and leadership cannot be 
questioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has faced numerous calls to resign from outside the  
International Olympic Committee as a result of the corruption 
scandals surrounding the Olympic bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo, who is an IOC member and president of the International  
Amateur Athletic Federation, has been unusually quiet on the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The quotes in the press release were attributed to an ASOIF  
spokesman and not Nebiolo himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Nebiolo, the other members of the ASOIF Council  
are: George Killian, United States (basketball); Aldo Notari, Italy 
(baseball); Rene Roch, France (fencing); Lu Shenrong, China 
(badminton); Paul Henderson, Canada (sailing); and Juan Angel 
Calzado, Spain (field hockey).

<HEADLINE>  Mike Utley Takes a Few Giant Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Mike Utley's legs buckled under him a couple of  
times, and he had to be steadied by two friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the wobbly steps that Utley took Monday represented an  
emotional triumph after seven years of unfailing optimism and 
exhausting physical therapy in the face of overwhelming odds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 17, 1991, Utley, a third-year offensive lineman for the  
Detroit Lions, was paralyzed with two crushed vertebrae, a 
horrifying injury suffered in a game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has vowed to someday walk off the Silverdome turf  
in Pontiac, Mich., from the exact spot where he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he took his first public steps toward that goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``By standing up, you feel who you are,'' he said. ``I was 315  
pounds and 6-foot-6. I was proud to be as big as I was. I was proud 
to be as tall as I am. I want it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towering over everyone as he did so long ago, wearing a Lions  
T-shirt, Utley slowly struggled down a wooden walkway, painfully 
swinging one leg ahead, then the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice his legs gave way, and the two buddies on each side,  
retired NFL center Bill Lewis and Lions linebacker Rob 
Frederickson, had to catch him. Girlfriend Dani Andersen helped by 
steadying the lower leg braces that kept his ankles from rolling 
inward. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it 10 feet or so.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was awesome to see him up there,'' Lewis said. ``Yesterday  
when we rehearsed, I was practically in tears. It's nothing short 
of miraculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he finished his news conference, just before he wheeled out  
of the room, he gave a ``thumbs up'' sign to a boy sitting on a 
man's shoulders in the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The gesture has become his trademark, just as Utley has come to  
symbolize grit, determination and optimism in the face of grim 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley, 33, is paralyzed from the chest and elbows down. His  
upper arms still are the bulging biceps of a football lineman. But 
he has only partial control of his hands and lower arms. About two 
years ago, he began to feel some sensations in his legs. He can 
feel his toes, describing it as the way you'd feel on an extremely 
cold day. 
</P>
<P>
	He began working with biofeedback, trying to identify the  
connection between his brain and those few alive nerves in his 
legs. He kept up daily, grueling physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rehabilitation is a lifestyle,'' he said. ``It's not something  
you just do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for his public display, and the pressure that  
came with it, on Monday was his desire to raise more money for his 
Mike Utley Foundation, dedicated research aimed at finding a cure 
for spinal cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley was quick to point out that no two spinal cord injuries  
are the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing you can control is your mind,'' he said. ``I'm  
not saying everyone will get as far as I've gotten. But they can do 
something today they didn't do yesterday. Maybe they can go 
outside. Maybe they can wheel themselves around the block, and 
maybe tomorrow they can do two blocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley credits his positive attitude for everything he has  
accomplished, whether it was snow skiing, scuba diving, driving his 
specially equipped van or taking those few steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken a few more steps before, but I've never gone this  
far,'' he said. ``I want to walk off that Silverdome, and one day I 
will. It might not be tomorrow, but someday I will. I guarantee 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, who once told him he'd never walk again, now look on  
Utley as a great asset. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives their new patients hope,'' Utley said. ``If you take  
hope away, if you take dreams away, you lose them forever. But it 
goes back to the person. If you're a champion before you got hurt, 
you're a champion now. But you have to work at it. You have to have 
goals. I will never be number two, not today, not tomorrow, not 
ever. Why? Because I believe in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He talked of going to hospitals to visit children stricken by  
paralyzing injuries, seeing their family's in pain and solidifying 
his determination to find a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see moms and dads cry anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before he rose for that moment on his feet, he explained why he  
decided to take these steps publicly. He wanted to show doctors, 
insurance companies and the health industry in general that 
rehabilitation is a lifelong process, something a seriously injured 
person needs to do until he dies. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a more personal reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do it for my family and the people who have given me  
support from the first day when I came off that field and gave that 
thumbs up,'' he said, ``everyone in the Detroit organization, the 
friends I've made since I've been hurt. I will show them that I 
have never quit. I will never quit until I am completely free of 
this spinal cord injury.''

<HEADLINE> McCarver Joins Yanks Broadcast Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- George Steinbrenner promises he won't be upset  
if Tim McCarver criticizes him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim has been tough on me in the past, but that's OK,'' the New  
York Yankees owner said Tuesday. ``I think he's one of the best in 
the business. If he wants to take his shots, that's good. Just as 
long as he's fair -- and he's always been fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver was introduced as a new TV analyst for the Yankees, who  
hired him two weeks after the New York Mets let him go. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner and manager Joe Torre were instrumental in  
McCarver's hiring. Some people in the Mets' organization were upset 
by McCarver's criticism, but the team said he was fired only 
because Tom Seaver was available as a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Mets lost their final five games and missed the  
playoffs, it'll be harder for McCarver to find nits to pick with 
the World Series champions, who set an AL record for wins, swept 
San Diego in the Series and finished 125-50. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have to get behind the mike to criticize me,''  
Torre said. ``When we were teammates, he used to criticize me. It 
won't be anything new. But the thing with Timmy is that he doesn't 
disappear or hide from anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver, who has been nominated for 10 Emmys and has called 10  
of the past 12 World Series, said his opinionated image and been 
blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has been lifted out of my resume as a broadcaster is that  
I'm too critical,'' he said. ``I hope that I'm much more than that. 
I challenge anyone to say that I'm not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had been with the Mets for 16 seasons, and the decision to  
replace him with Seaver angered some fans, who booed manager Bobby 
Valentine at the annual dinner of the baseball writers, blaming him 
for the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not shocked to be let go by the Mets, but was  
surprised,'' McCarver said. ``More surprised about the timing than 
anything. But the way it worked out, I couldn't be more grateful 
for the Mets for allowing this to happen. I was never given a 
reason why I was let go by the Mets, but I think the overriding 
premise was that I was too opinionated and critical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver is also Fox Sports' lead national baseball analyst and  
will be paired with ex-Yankees outfielder Bobby Murcer on the 
Channel 5 telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Due to his obligations with Fox, McCarver is expected to work  
about 42 Yankees games. He will make his debut with WNYW on April 5 
for the season opener against the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his Fox national duties, he is no stranger to the  
defending champs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe Buck and I did more Yankees broadcasts than any other team  
at Fox last year,'' McCarver said. ``I'm very familiar with their 
ballclub and they're a very, very good team. You have to be to win 
125 games.''

<HEADLINE>  First Lady To Consider Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday she would  
give ``careful thought'' to running for a U.S. Senate seat from New 
York. Three confidants said she was talking with supporters about 
what it would take to run a serious campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady promised to make her decision later this year.  
President Clinton said on Monday she would be ``terrific in the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's statement drew a quick response from the camp of  
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a possible Republican rival. ``If 
Hillary Clinton announces a run for Senate, that would encourage 
the mayor to consider his candidacy for the Senate as well,'' a 
Giuliani spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly elected Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer sounded a note of  
caution for the first lady. ``I think she would be an extremely 
formidable candidate. I guess she'd have to be the favorite, but 
favorites don't always win,'' Schumer said at a news conference in 
Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she was deeply gratified by ``the large number  
of people who have encouraged me to consider running'' for the 
Senate seat being opened by the retirement of Democratic Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Just four days after the end of her husband's impeachment  
ordeal, Mrs. Clinton said she had not been able to give much 
thought to a potential candidacy but would be able to focus on it 
now. She said she would make her decision later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the meantime,'' she said in a three-sentence statement, ``I  
intend to continue to focus my attention on the issues central to 
the president's agenda and on which we have worked together for so 
many years.'' White House officials were delighted that the 
attention on Mrs. Clinton was taking attention away from the 
president's now-concluded impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry, her press secretary, said she could not elaborate  
on the timing of Mrs. Clinton's decision. ``I can't be any more 
specific than that because she doesn't know. She's going to talk to 
people, those who want her to do it and some who don't, and hear 
them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colleen Roche, press aide to Giuliani, said in response to Mrs.  
Clinton's statement, ``We are told that her candidacy would be the 
singular biggest unifying force in the Republican party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has made it clear he has ambitions beyond City Hall and  
has not ruled out a run for the Senate. He has a strong base, is a 
solid fund-raiser and would be a formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to be the star attraction at a New  
York fund-raiser for the Democratic Party's Women's Leadership 
Forum in the first week of March, providing one opportunity to 
announce her decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Monday he would enthusiastically support whatever  
decision she makes. 
</P>
<P>
	Three confidants of Mrs. Clinton, all speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said she has begun returning telephone calls to 
supporters and asking for information about what it would take to 
run a campaign -- from the amount of money she would have to raise 
to the availability of campaign talent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, these advisers echoed the sentiments of associates of  
Mrs. Clinton, who have been saying for weeks that they suspect she 
will eventually decide against making the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton talked over lunch Friday with former White House  
deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes, who is well versed in New York 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Mrs. Clinton was issuing the statement now, Berry  
said, ``She wanted to let you all know what she is thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton headlined a White House  
announcement on relief aid for Central America. As she left the 
room, a reporter shouted: ``Mrs. Clinton, everybody wants to know 
if you're going to run for the Senate!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton raised her arm, waved mechanically and smiled at  
the reporter, but she said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Her statement touched on her previous inability to focus on any  
decision about running. ``Until now, I have not been able to do so, 
but I will give careful thought to a potential candidacy in order 
to reach a decision later this year,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residency requirements vary among states. In New York a  
candidate need only have purchased or rented a residence by 
Election Day to meet residency requirements for running for office, 
according to Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the state Board of 
Elections. Robert Kennedy was a latecomer to New York when he won a 
Senate seat in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democratic ally of the Clintons, is  
going about the motions of a candidacy herself with forays to 
Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo -- all well outside her own district. 
But Lowey is a lady in waiting. Said her chief of staff, Howard 
Wolfson: ``If Mrs. Clinton wants to run, she will be the candidate. 
And, Nita will support her enthusiastically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats have expressed concern that others might have a  
tough time raising money as long as Mrs. Clinton was viewed as 
interested, but undecided. Polls show Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani 
in a theoretical matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released early this month from Quinnipiac College's  
Polling Institute, had Mrs. Clinton favored by 51 percent of 
registered voters to 42 percent for the mayor. Six percent of 
voters were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 53 percent to 42 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Protest in California Over Ho Poster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- Rows of police in helmets and flak  
jackets faced off against hundreds of demonstrators angry over the 
rehanging of a poster of communist leader Ho Chi Minh. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Saigon video shop owner Truong Van Tran had announced his  
intention to return to his Hi Tek video store on Monday and replace 
the wall-sized portrait. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating Tran's return, about 600 demonstrators gathered  
outside the store, many waving the yellow and red flags of what was 
once South Vietnam. Two men built symbolic ``cages'' and climbed 
inside to demonstrate what they said was done to prisoners during 
the Vietnam war. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran later told a television reporter that he didn't return to  
the store because he was told he would be arrested. But hundreds 
remained just in case, standing vigil outside the strip mall store. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran's poster of the late communist leader outraged many in  
Little Saigon, home to 200,000 Vietnamese-Americans. Some fled 
South Vietnam in 1975 after it fell to communist North Vietnam, and 
others left nearly a decade later when they were freed from prison 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-communists have picketed the shop almost daily since  
community leaders learned last month that Tran had placed the 
poster beside a flag of communist Vietnam in his shop window. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a judge affirmed Tran had a First Amendment right to  
display them. However, after Tran tried to rehang the poster after 
the court ruling, he was attacked by protesters and hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were arrested during Monday's protest for failing  
to disperse, police said. The demonstrations occurred at the start 
of the Vietnamese Tet Festival, the celebration of the Lunar New 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Protester Hai Long said he does not mind giving up a celebration  
to demonstrate against the communist display. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tet is important, but it cannot be a good time with this sort  
of thing in our community,'' said Long, who lost his right arm in 
battle and was imprisoned for 13 years in Vietnam from 1975 to 
1987. ``Fighting communism matters more than celebration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tran has said he is not a communist and does not support the  
communist leadership in Vietnam. He has never publicly explained 
why he set up the display.

registered voters to 42 percent for the mayor. Six percent of 
voters were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 53 percent to 42 
percent.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton Plays Golf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the impeachment trial behind him,  
President Clinton played golf course Tuesday for the first time 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The president played 18 holes at Army Navy Country Club in  
Arlington, Va., with brother-in-law Tony Rodham and Democratic 
fund-raiser Terence McAuliffe. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton resisted golf during the Senate impeachment trial, maybe  
to avoid irritating senators confined to the Capitol for five weeks 
of legal arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Republicans said they were angered by seeing  
Clinton on television playing golf near Camp David, Md., while they 
waited three weeks for his answers to 81 questions posed by the 
House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday was sunny and unseasonably warm, and Clinton appeared  
relaxed in a short-sleeve shirt and baseball hat. The last time he 
played golf was on New Year's Eve at Hilton Head Island, S.C.

	The original Stockton-Malone combination is still better than  
the upstart impersonators from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	John Stockton and Karl Malone held off a spirited charge from  
Jason Williams and Chris Webber as the Utah Jazz beat the Kings 
120-112 in overtime Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento appeared ready to upset the Jazz thanks primarily to  
standout efforts from rookie point guard Williams and new 
acquisition Webber that sparked memories of Stockton and Malone in 
their early days. 
</P>
<P>
	In just his fifth pro game, Williams had 19 points and seven  
assists, while Webber had 26 points and 11 rebounds before fouling 
out early in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``He plays with a lot of confidence, but their whole team  
does,'' Stockton said of Williams. ``They're going to beat some 
people this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not Monday night. Malone hit five free throws in the final  
minute of regulation to force overtime, and the Jazz made a 9-2 run 
to start the extra period and run their record to a franchise-best 
6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take the win and not dwell on the rest,'' said Stockton,  
who scored eight of his 10 points in the fourth quarter and had 15 
assists. ``Karl is our guy. He made huge free throws all night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the moral victories, however, belonged to the Kings (2-3  
with just one home game so far), who appear transformed from the 
moribund franchise that has made the playoffs just once in the last 
12 years. And with Williams and Webber, they may have a young go-to 
combination similar to the one that has served the Jazz so well for 
so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel some good about it, but we need to win some of these  
games,'' Kings coach Rick Adelman said. ``We have a lot of road 
games (14 of their first 21), and it's a tough stretch for any 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere Monday, it was New York 78, Detroit 69; Miami 95, New  
Jersey 72; Phoenix 115, Denver 106; Portland 99, Dallas 84; and 
Golden State 101, Minnesota 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryon Russell and Shandon Anderson combined for 12 points in  
overtime as Utah remained one of two undefeated teams heading into 
tonight's showdown with Seattle (5-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, despite shooting just 8-for-20 from the field, led the  
Jazz with 26 points and nine rebounds. Russell had 25 points -- 
seven in overtime -- and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Knicks 78, Pistons 69    	
</P>
<P>
	At New York, Grant Hill scored 31 points, but the Knicks held  
the rest of Detroit's players in check. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston scored 19 points, Patrick Ewing had 14, Larry  
Johnson 12 and Charlie Ward 10 for the Knicks, who double-teamed 
Hill near midcourt whenever they could. The strategy worked as New 
York held the Pistons to 36 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Miami 95, New Jersey 72    	
</P>
<P>
	At Miami, Alonzo Mourning had 34 points, 17 rebounds and seven  
blocks as the Heat handed New Jersey its third straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	P.J. Brown chipped in 12 points and nine rebounds for Miami,  
which has won 12 of its last 14 games against New Jersey.

</P>
<P>
                        *Suns 115, Nuggets 106    	
</P>
<P>
	Jason Kidd had 28 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds and George  
McCloud added 24 points as Phoenix won at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd was 9-for-17 shooting and posted his 20th triple-double as  
the Suns beat the Nuggets for the eighth consecutive time and 
second time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant Stith scored 23 points and Nick Van Exel added 21 for the  
Nuggets. Antonio McDyess, who played for the Suns last season, had 
20 points and 12 rebounds.

<P>
                    *Trail Blazers 99, Mavericks 84

game-winning tip-in with four seconds left, as Golden State won at 
home against Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Stocks End Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Enthusiasm for lower interest rates carried  
blue-chip stocks higher on Tuesday, but Nasdaq stocks took another 
beating amid concerns about computer-company earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended a volatile session 22.14  
points higher, at 9,297.03. The Dow shot up 112 points in the first 
hour as interest rates in the bond market declined. It retreated to 
a 15-point loss, then turned positive again in mid-afternoon. The 
index flitted between positive and negative for the remainder of 
the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader market was weaker. For the second session in a row,  
investors sold shares of Dell Computer over concerns that the 
personal computer maker's earnings, scheduled to be released after 
the close of trading Tuesday, would show a downturn in computer 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In its after-market report, Dell confirmed those worries even as  
profits soared. Dell shares fell 1 1/8 to 88 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 8.02 at  
2,313.87, after tumbling 83.66 points on Friday. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index fared better, closing up 11.74 at 1,241.87. 
</P>
<P>
	Some computer companies fared far better than Dell. Also after  
the close of trading, Hewlett-Packard reported net earnings of 92 
cents per share, soundly beating analysts' expectations of 83 
cents. Applied Materials reported earnings of 14 cents a share, 
beating estimates of 6 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard shares closed down 3/16 at 16 7/16. Applied  
Materials' shares closed at 67 7/8, up 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance in blue chips was sparked by a rally in U.S. bonds,  
after the Japanese minister of finance said the government will 
step up purchases of Japanese government bonds. The announcement 
pushed interest rates lower in Japan and boosted the Nikkei stock 
average by 1.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also supported the U.S. bond market, where the benchmark  
30-year bond was up $11.25 per $1,000 of valuation, pushing its 
yield down to 5.34 percent from late Friday's 5.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower rates on the 30-year bond sparked a strong rally in  
financial services stocks. Chase Manhattan shares gained 3 5/8, to 77 
11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was carried higher by Merck, which gained 3 7/16 to 153  
15/16. Merck and Johnson &AMP; Johnson announced that their joint 
Consumer Pharmaceuticals enterprise introduced an improved liquid 
formula of the popular Mylanta antacid. Johnson &AMP; Johnson's shares 
gained 2 to 86 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Wal-Mart rose 3 3/16 at 87 9/16, pulling other  
retail stocks with it, after its fourth-quarter earnings results 
beat analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	While investors, buoyed by the fattening of their stock  
portfolios, continue to make retail purchases at places like 
Wal-Mart at breakneck speed, there are signs that they are pulling 
back from their investments, said William Meehan, market strategist 
at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individuals seem to have curtailed their investment  
substantially over the last couple of weeks, and most portfolio 
managers have very little cash. What we have here is a situation 
where it's not really the economy that's driving the stock market, 
but the stock market that's driving the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other market action, the NYSE composite index rose 5.27 to  
586.73, and the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.28 
to 695.84. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.37 to 
396.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,550 to 1,539 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 473 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 792.65 million shares, down from 683.61  
million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, London's FT-SE 100 index gained 1.42  
percent, the DAX in Frankfurt rose 0.52 percent, but the CAC in 
Paris declined 0.32 percent.

<HEADLINE> White House Defends Rights Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Tuesday rejected calls that  
President Clinton nominate an alternative to Bill Lann Lee as the 
nation's top civil rights enforcer, saying Lee's critics have ``a 
demonstrable lack of knowledge'' of his performance in the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton appointed Lee, a former NAACP lawyer, as acting  
assistant attorney general for civil rights in December 1997, after 
it became clear the Senate Judiciary Committee would not send Lee's 
nomination forward. The move angered Senate Republicans who vowed 
to monitor Lee's work on affirmative action closely. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, urged Clinton on  
Tuesday to nominate ``a confirmable candidate'' for the civil 
rights post, saying Lee has already been considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``During Lee's tenure, the Justice Department has advocated the  
same policies that initially led to his failure to be confirmed as 
assistant attorney general,'' Hatch said. He said he told deputy 
attorney general Eric Holder last week that Lee's temporary 
appointment has exceeded 14 months in violation of a law on federal 
vacancies that Clinton signed in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Two conservative groups, the Institute for Justice and the  
Center for Equal Opportunity, issued a report Tuesday concluding 
that, under Lee, the Justice Department has ``continued to defend 
the constitutionally indefensible'' when it comes to affirmative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not suggest that every action ... exceeds Lee's proper  
discretion as the nation's foremost civil rights law enforcement 
official,'' the report said. ``But the pattern is unmistakable: Lee 
sides with racial classifications in government contracting, 
employment, voting and education in nearly every instance, placing 
the federal civil rights arsenal at odds with the U.S. Supreme 
Court's repeated pronouncements that racial classifications are 
presumptively impermissible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said while Clinton has yet to  
offer a nomination, he feels Lee ``has done an excellent job'' and 
is not inclined to listen to such critics, some of whom have 
labeled Lee a ``quota king.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have heard that several times ... from people who, I think,  
speak with a demonstrable lack of knowledge of Mr. Bill Lann Lee's 
background, his abilities, what he has been able to get done,'' 
Lockhart said. ``I think it's a political slogan, rather than an 
attempt to understand the impact and the importance of the work he 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clint Bolick, litigation director at the Institute for Justice,  
said: ``We're not fighting this nomination with slogans. We're 
fighting with substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could not find a single instance in which Lee concluded  
that a racial preference has gone too far,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their report, Bolick and co-author Roger Clegg also cited a  
``symbiotic relationship'' between Lee and the NAACP Legal Defense 
Fund on consent decrees in school desegregation cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Shaw, associate director-counsel of the NAACP's fund, denied  
that, saying his group has differences with Lee's agency ``over 
substance and tactics at times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Criticisms of Lee are ``part of the pattern of smear and  
distortion'' used against civil rights nominees, particularly when 
they have a background in the NAACP, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When somebody goes into government from the Legal Defense  
Fund, they're not ours anymore,'' he said. ``They represent the 
United States. The bottom line is, it doesn't matter what Bill Lee 
did or how Bill Lee did it. They were going to write a report like 
this.''

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Share prices surged in Tokyo on Tuesday after  
the government said it would take strong actions to control 
long-term interest rates. Many other Asian markets were closed for 
the Chinese New Year holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark No. 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 177.92  
points, or 1.27 percent, to close at 14,232.64. On Monday, the 
average closed up 81.03 points, or 0.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 117.02 yen, up 2.94 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo. U.S. markets were closed Monday for the 
Presidents Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose after Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa confirmed  
that the government plans to take aggressive steps to keep 
long-term interest rates in check in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa told reporters that the government will reduce the  
amount of 10-year government bond issuances to around 1.4 trillion 
yen ($12 billion) in March -- a cut of 400 billion yen ($3.42 
billion) from recent levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``These steps should have a positive impact on long-term  
interest rates,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates tend to reduce borrowing costs for  
companies, and could help spur economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were closed in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore,  
Malaysia, and South Korea for the Chinese New Year holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher as local  
bargain-hunters bought selected low-priced blue-chip shares on 
anticipation that they'll rebound after the Chinese New Year 
holidays. The Composite Index rose 1.924 points, or 0.5 percent, to 
398.848. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 4.32 points, or 0.2 percent, 
to 2,151.50. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed marginally higher in thin  
trading, with bargain- hunting and sliding interest rates 
supporting the market. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange 
index rose 8.57 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,918.87. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower, dragged down by  
sagging commodity prices. The All Ordinaries Index fell 18.4 
points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,859.4. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher local investors bought  
banking and finance stock in low-volume trade. The SET index rose 
5.40 points, or 1.6 percent, to 350.36.

<HEADLINE> Dominican Olympics Head Denies Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- The head of the  
Dominican Republic's Olympic Committee on Tuesday denied a 
newspaper report that he received inflated travel expenses from 
Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic committee chief Roque Napoleon Munoz said he was  
reimbursed for a trip he took to Stockholm with his wife to 
evaluate that city's bid for the 2004 Olympics, but said the trip 
did not cost more than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish documents cited by Stockholm's Dagens Nyheter newspaper  
indicate more than $18,000 was spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``(As for) the rest of the money, because they're talking about  
$18,040, they'll have to find out who used that money,'' Munoz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported last week that Stockholm's promoters  
showered Olympics officials with gifts, medical care and other 
perks that exceeded limits set by Swedish anti-bribery laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Munoz has headed the Dominican Republic's Olympic committee for  
12 years since 1974, and he became a member of the International 
Olympic Committee in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he attacked the giving of gifts by supporters of  
cities trying to win the Olympic games. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigations into Salt Lake City, Utah's successful bid for  
the 2002 Winter Olympics have led to allegations of widespread 
bribery in the International Olympic Committee. Munoz said such 
favors have long posed ethical problems, and he predicted an 
internal investigation would result in a cleaner site selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an old situation, but now it's coming to public  
light,'' Munoz said. ``In the end, what has happened to the 
(International Olympic Committee) will be beneficial to the entire 
international Olympic movement.''

<HEADLINE> Audit Uncovers Idle DC Phone Lines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The District of Columbia government pays  
almost $2 million for telephone lines it never uses, a city audit 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 9,000 telephone lines in the city government's  
28,000-line system are dormant, according to the inspector 
general's audit released Tuesday. In one facility used for Job 
Corps, police cadet, and Americorps training the audit identified 
124 of 142 lines as unused. 
</P>
<P>
	The unused service accounts for about 9 percent of the city's  
telecommunications budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has sought federal help to modernize its telephone  
system and upgrade computer systems to bridge a technology gap 
blamed for some government inefficiency. Police Chief Charles 
Ramsey has complained his department operates using obsolete rotary 
phones at many facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mayor Anthony Williams promised in his campaign to make  
government work better and has said repeatedly since his election, 
``We've got to believe we can answer the phones.''

	SAVING AT A YOUNGER AGE: The nation's younger adults seem to be  
much more cognizant of the need for retirement savings than their 
elders were at the same age. A survey commissioned by Lincoln 
Financial Group and Money magazine found 64 percent of Americans 
ages 18 to 34 are saving for retirement, and the average age when 
they started to save was 23. That's 13 years earlier than people 
who are now 65 or older, and four years earlier than the average 
Baby Boomer. But many of the young adults surveyed said they 
believe they're not socking away as much as they should -- they're 
worried that Social Security might not be able to provide for them 
when they reach retirement age.

Also, futon mattresses for those all-nighters and Nerf basketball

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 109 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices soared in early trading on Wall Street  
today as technology stocks recovered from Friday's selloff and led 
the rest of the market higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said financial stocks also rose on encouraging interest  
rate trends. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 109.17 at 9,384.06. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also jumped in the early going. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 18.77 at 1,248.90, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 39.60 to 2,361.49 
after having tumbled 83.66 points on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The market, which was closed Monday for Presidents Day, again  
followed the example of technology stocks, which looked much more 
attractive to bargain-hunters today. IBM, a Dow component, was up 
4 3/8 to 177 1/8, while Dell Computer rose 3 7/8 to 93 3/4 and Intel picked up 
3 7/16, rising to 129 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop in interest rates in the bond market helped financial  
services stocks. BankAmerica was up 2 1/6 to 64 15/16 as the yield 
on the Treasury's 30-year bond fell to 5.37 percent from late 
Friday's 5.42 percent 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 89.34 million shares, 
just under Friday's pace of 90.89 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 8.16 at 589.62, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.74 to 701.86.

<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.27 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.65 percent,

<HEADLINE> Study: Neanderthals Couldn't Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Could Neanderthals talk?  
</P>
<P>
	That's a question that has scientists challenging each other's  
research and analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at Duke University reported in April that a bony  
canal in the skulls of Neanderthals indicated they may have had the 
nerve complex needed to control the subtle and varied movement of 
the tongue required for speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But a team from the University of California, Berkeley, is  
challenging that finding in a paper appearing in today's 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the size of the hypoglossal canal is not a  
reliable indicator of speech. Therefore the timing of the origin of 
human language and the speech capabilities of Neanderthals remain 
open questions,'' said the California team headed by David DeGusta. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got an interesting point of view and it's stirring the  
pot,'' responded Richard F. Kay, one of the Duke researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If their argument is taken at its face value, we couldn't say  
humans have evolved toward having an increased brain size over the 
last million years,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The two studies have some similar findings but differ sharply in  
their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke study speculated that Neanderthals might have been able  
to talk, based on findings that the average size of their 
hypoglossal canal was similar to that of modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The canal, carrying the nerve that directs the tongue, is  
smaller in apes, which are incapable of complex speech, the Duke 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Neanderthals, named for the Neander valley in Germany where  
their remains were first found, evolved around 300,000 years ago. 
If they could talk, it would indicate speech evolved significantly 
earlier than has been thought. Researchers have long believed that 
the ability to make modern human speech sounds did not develop 
until about 40,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While modern humans came along after the Neanderthal, some may  
have lived at the same time and place as the final generations of 
those early people. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGusta said his Berkeley group tested 30 nonhuman primates,  
compared with just two in the Duke study, and found 15 of them had 
hypoglossal canal sizes larger than humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because nonhuman primates are not known to speak, their  
hypoglossal canals should be smaller than those in modern humans,'' 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``many nonhuman primate specimens have hypoglossal canal  
areas that fall within the range of our modern human sample,'' 
their paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average gibbon's canal is twice as large as a modern  
humans,'' DeGusta said in a telephone interview, ``so we suggest 
you cannot use canal size'' to indicate the ability to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Berkeley paper notes that some very ancient hominids  
had average canal sizes close to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to the criteria (of the Duke study) modern human  
speech capabilities originated at least 3.2 million years ago in 
Australopithecus afarensis, a species not previously noted for 
(brain development), symbolic capacity or even stone tool making,'' 
they said. Australopithecus afarensis is the family of the famous 
African fossil Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGusta said the Berkeley researchers concentrated on the range  
of canal measurements rather than their average, concluding that 
``an individual's ability to speak can depend only on its own canal 
size, not the mean size for its species.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kay defended his group's use of average size by comparing  
studies of brain size in ancient and modern species. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern humans have a brain capacity of about 1,250 cubic  
centimeters (76.3 cubic inches), he said, though in some 
individuals it is as small as 800cc (48.8 cubic inches). By 
comparison the extinct species Homo erectus a million years ago 
averaged about 800cc, with some larger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are saying, you can say something from this average,'' Kay  
said. The Berkeley researchers' contention that you cannot draw 
conclusions from averages means we ``couldn't say humans have 
evolved toward having an increased brain size over the last million 
years.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Be Cited in Jones Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In a sign that President Clinton's  
legal troubles aren't over, a federal judge said Tuesday she is 
prepared to consider whether he should be found in contempt of 
court for his testimony about Monica Lewinsky in the Paula Jones 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright said she waited to  
address the issue because of the impeachment trial and the fact 
that Mrs. Jones' case was before an appeals court. It was settled 
in December for $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accordingly, I believe that now it is time for the court to  
address the contempt issue,'' she said in an order issued Tuesday 
after a conference with lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also said she would step aside from the case if she were  
asked to do so by attorneys because of her contact with a House 
impeachment case manager. She gave lawyers until Friday to file a 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House referred all requests for comment to Clinton's  
private lawyer in the case, Robert Bennett. Bennett did not 
immediately return a call to his office seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' spokeswoman, Susan Carpenter-McMillan, said she had  
not talked with Mrs. Jones, but added that Clinton should be held 
for contempt. ``My God, he lied,'' she said. ``If he can get away 
with not being held for contempt, I suppose we could all lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright raised the possibility of contempt in a footnote to her  
decision on Sept. 1 to release a transcript of Clinton's testimony 
in a deposition in the Jones sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Wright said she ``has concerns about the nature of  
the president's January 17, 1998, deposition'' but ``makes no 
findings at this time regarding whether the president may be in 
contempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition, Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual  
relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' He acknowledged Aug. 17 before a 
federal grand jury -- and again in a nationally televised address -- 
that he had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group in  
Washington, filed a formal petition with Wright months ago seeking 
a court hearing on whether Clinton was in contempt of court because 
of what the private organization called his ``apparently false 
testimony.'' The foundation said ``the court has the right, if not 
the duty, to defend itself against obstructive acts committed in 
its presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In saying she would step down, Wright disclosed Tuesday she had  
contact with Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and her law clerk 
provided an affidavit for possible use in the impeachment case. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Hutchinson wanted her testimony about Clinton's  
demeanor during his deposition testimony, including where his 
attention was directed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified to the grand jury that he might not have been  
paying attention when his lawyer told the judge about Ms. 
Lewinsky's affidavit and said there was no sex of any kind with 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said she was not willing to be a witness in the  
impeachment proceeding and suggested that other people could 
provide the same evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Her law clerk, Barry Ward, later provided an affidavit about  
Clinton's deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said she didn't think those were reasons for her to  
step aside. If that happens, the contempt matter would be decided 
by another judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones filed her lawsuit in 1994. Wright dismissed the  
lawsuit April 1, but Mrs. Jones appealed the decision. The appeal 
was pending when she and Clinton reached the settlement Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawsuit brought to light the president's affair with  
Ms. Lewinsky and set in motion a criminal investigation that 
resulted in the House vote to impeach Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones alleged that Clinton, when he was governor of  
Arkansas, made a crude advance in a room at a Little Rock hotel in 
1991. She was a state worker at the time. Clinton denies her 
accusation.

<HEADLINE> Cautionary Tale of Finance Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- To get an idea of how suddenly a hot category of  
mutual funds can turn cold, take a look at the recent performance 
of financial services funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last summer, these funds specializing in bank, insurance,  
mortgage and investment-firm stocks had been one of the standout 
groups of the 1990s. Their performance results often came in better 
than even the celebrated technology funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But all that changed abruptly in the third quarter of last year,  
as a default by Russia and other international debt and currency 
problems stirred fears of a worldwide financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	In August alone, the average financial-services fund tumbled 21  
percent, according to the Morningstar Mutual Funds research 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	As the dust settled at the end of 1998, Morningstar's average of  
55 financial services funds, with aggregate assets of about $20 
billion, managed to post a 6.43 percent gain for the year -- about 
22 percentage points short of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock 
composite index's rise. Technology funds, by contrast, jumped more 
than 51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That 6.43 percent return marked a big comedown from gains of 44  
percent in 1997, 27 percent in 1996, and 40 percent in 1995. In 
each of those years, financial funds outgained technology funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, as of mid-January, financial funds still showed  
annualized returns of better than 20 percent for the last five and 
10 years, less than a percentage point shy of technology funds' 
results for the same periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the first few weeks of 1999, however, the group once again  
drifted lower, as problems in Brazil kept investors uneasy about 
the international financial outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the new worries, the main story behind financial  
funds' decade-long popularity hasn't changed much. An aging 
generation of baby boomers in this country is expected to generate 
big demand for financial services for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong economy keeps pumping money through the U.S. financial  
system, while nearly dormant inflation allows for relatively low 
interest rates. A steady pace of mergers in the financial 
industries, meanwhile, creates additional profit opportunities in 
the stocks of the companies involved. 
</P>
<P>
	International worries have clearly thrown cold water on some of  
the highest hopes investors had built up. But some stubborn 
optimists say the setback may not go too much further. 
</P>
<P>
	As Jeffrey Warantz at the Wall Street firm of Salomon Smith  
Barney put it in a recent report, ``The performance of the sector 
has been hurt severely by the global financial crisis and its 
reverberations. It appears that the negative reaction to this 
crisis may have been a bit excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Underlying fundamentals remain intact. The U.S. economy is  
still strong, interest rates remain low, and the monetary 
environment remains positive. These conditions typically bode well 
for financial stocks. Finally, the dramatic reduction of earnings 
estimates within the sector as a result of the panic sets the stage 
for what we believe will be a large number of positive surprises in 
the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the damage has been done and the worst is now  
behind the financial sector. Earnings estimates are now improving, 
economic fundamentals remain attractive, and the sector is 
inexpensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But whatever they do next, financial-services funds have clearly  
shown what can befall investors in funds that concentrate on a 
single industry or sector of the economy. It's a story worth 
heeding for fans of other standout sectors, like Internet-focused 
technology funds and health-care funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if a convincing story supports enthusiasm for such a group,  
an investment in a fund of this type can be subject to wrenching 
volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	Observed the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey in its most recent  
look at financial-services funds, ``On the bright side, the 
downturn may have resulted in an attractive entry point for 
prospective investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``All investors, however, should realize that the industry's  
highly cyclical nature makes it best suited for risk-tolerant 
investors able to stomach any upturns and downturns of the domestic 
economy.''

other regional information. Financial terms were not disclosed. Rod 
Schrock, president and chief executive of AltaVista, said the cash 
deal was worth more than the $220 million Compaq paid last year for 
Internet retailer Shopping.com. Compaq shares fell 1/8 to 42 7/8.

	Levi Sales Down 13 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Levi Strauss' sales fell 13 percent last  
year as teen-agers continued to shun its classic five-pocket jeans 
for trendier styles by rival designers. The company said that its 
sales were $6 billion for the fiscal year ended last November, 
compared with $6.9 billion in 1997. The company saw record sales in 
1996 of $7.1 billion.

	Consumers Said Losing on Banks

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are losing tens of billions of  
dollars in interest each year by keeping their money in traditional 
bank savings accounts instead of certificates of deposit and credit 
union accounts, the Consumer Federation of America and a credit 
union industry group said today. Switching to certificates of 
deposit and from banks to credit unions ``is really a no-brainer. 
People ought to be doing it,'' Stephen Brobeck, executive director 
of the Consumer Federation, said.

video, shown to the judge last week, glossed over the process ``to 
save time.'' Microsoft shares fell 1 1/2 to 156 1/4.

	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Campbell Soup's earnings for the latest  
quarter fell 24.6 percent from a year ago, matching Wall Street 
expectations. The food company announced last month that 
cost-cutting changes in its supply chain system -- streamlining 
purchasing decisions, using storage more efficiently and cutting 
shipping costs -- would result in lower second quarter and full year 
earnings. Campbell Soup shares were up 7/16 to 40 11/16.

the world's largest retailer continued to attract shoppers with its 
affordable prices and wide selection. Wal-Mart said it earned $1.56 
billion, or 70 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, 
compared with $1.29 billion, of 57 cents a share, in the same 
period a year ago. Wal-Mart shares were up 3 3/16 to 87 9/16.

	Clinton May Be Cited in Jones Case  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright  
said she is prepared to consider whether President Clinton should 
be found in contempt of court for his testimony about Monica 
Lewinsky in the Paula Jones lawsuit. In a deposition for the Jones 
suit, Clinton said he had not had sexual relations with Monica 
Lewinsky. He later acknowledged an ``inappropriate'' relationship 
with the former intern during testimony before a federal grand 
jury. Also today, Webber said she would step aside from the case if 
she were asked because of her contact with Rep. Asa Hutchinson, a 
House prosecutor, during the course of the impeachment 
investigation.

	Turkey Arrests Kurdish Rebel Leader  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Kurds, outraged by the arrest of Abdullah  
Ocalan, took out their fury on Greece today, accusing it of 
allowing the rebel leader to be taken out of hiding from the Greek 
Embassy in Kenya and transported to Turkey for arrest. Breaking 
down doors and smashing windows, Kurdish protesters occupied Greek 
embassies and consulates in at least 21 European cities, and 
briefly occupied consulates in Vancouver, British Columbia, and 
Sydney, Australia. Nearly all the takeovers had ended by late 
today. Turkey was expected to put Ocalan on trial for terrorism 
charges for his 14-year guerrilla war for autonomy.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic  
rejected deployment of NATO troops to Kosovo -- a key element of a 
U.S.-sponsored peace plan for the Serbian province. The statement 
came after a four-hour meeting with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, 
who had been at the peace talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians 
in Rambouillet, France. Sources said Hill flew in to tell Milosevic 
that if he doesn't accept the Kosovo agreement by noon Saturday, he 
will suffer NATO airstrikes.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and key  
diplomats today negotiated assurances for Libya if it hands over 
two Libyan suspects for trial in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am 
jetliner. A letter reportedly to be sent to Libyan leader Moammar 
Gadhafi promises that his government will not face any intimidation 
or investigation as a result of any information revealed during a 
trial. In August, Libya accepted in principle a U.S.-British 
proposal for a trial in the Netherlands, but has failed to turn 
over the suspects.

give ``careful thought'' to running for a U.S. Senate seat from New 
York, promising to make her decision later this year. The first 
lady said she was deeply gratified by ``the large number of people 
who have encouraged me to consider running'' for the Senate seat 
being opened by the retirement of Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan in 2000. Senate candidates in New York need only have 
purchased or rented a residence by Election Day to meet residency 
requirements for running for office.

	Survey: Eating Out Is on the Rise

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans eat out twice as often as they did  
in the late 1970s, a government survey found. Americans do a good 
job making sure their meals are high in nutrients when they cook at 
home, according to the report by the Agriculture Department. But 
the proportion of meals eaten away from home has nearly doubled -- 
from 16 percent in 1977-78 to 29 percent in 1995 -- and those meals 
haven't kept pace with nutritional improvements.

missed a tough driving layup with 19 seconds left, the Bucks called 
timeout with 14 seconds to play. Robinson took a pass from a 
driving Ray Allen, who couldn't get off a shot in the lane, and hit 
the game-winner from the left corner.

center Jake Voskuhl for almost the entire second half. Voskuhl 
suffered a sore left foot. The Huskies (23-1, 14-1 Big East) broke

<HEADLINE> Search Resumes for Earhart's Bones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- A hunt is about to begin in musty corners of  
the buildings of the Fiji Medical School for bones that may be the 
remains of missing American aviator Amelia Earhart. 
</P>
<P>
	The government today said it had authorized a search of  
storerooms in the medical school and Suva's central hospital for 
the pioneer aviator's remains. She vanished in 1937 while trying to 
become the first woman to fly around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Most authorities believe Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan,  
lost their bearings, ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific 
while flying between Papua New Guinea and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Navy conducted an elaborate search and picked up  
signals suggesting Earhart's plane went down somewhere in the 
region of the Gilbert Islands in the central Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1940, a Fiji naval officer, Stanley Brown, was sent on a  
reconnaissance mission to uninhabited Nikumaroro, a desolate 
Gilbert atoll about 1,000 miles north of Suva, and reported 
accounts of finding the bones of two people of possible European 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
	The bones were sent to British headquarters in Tarawa, where a  
physician concluded they belonged to a man. The bones were ordered 
into storage, but the crate containing them vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Gillespie, director of the International Group for  
Historic Aircraft Recovery, a nonprofit organization that has 
searched for evidence of Earhart's fate for 10 years, recently 
found records of the examination in Tarawa and Britain, the Los 
Angeles Times reported in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts who examined the records said the skeleton was  
that of a white female of northern European background. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fiji Museum said there are records of two wooden boxes  
arriving about 1940 and possibly containing the bones of the 
missing fliers.

<HEADLINE> Report: Weapons Sold Without Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of old Army rifles have been sold to  
civilians in the past few years without required criminal 
background and U.S. citizenship checks, according to congressional 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lawmakers who asked for the audit of the longtime Civilian  
Marksmanship Program, which has been run by a private group since 
1996, pledged Tuesday to introduce legislation requiring greater 
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows whose hands wound up on those triggers?'' Rep.  
Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said in a statement released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said he was appalled by the  
findings of the General Accounting Office. ``The GAO investigation 
showed that privatization meant the end of Army controls on gun 
buyers, so even felons could purchase M-1 rifles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 law handed over administration of old Army rifle and  
pistol sales to a private group created by the legislation, the 
Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms 
Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, designed to promote and monitor marksmanship  
training through affiliated gun clubs, had been in existence since 
1903, with the Army selling old firearms instead of destroying 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law required the corporation to make sure buyers were  
U.S. citizens and didn't have felony records. The old Army rifles 
were to be sold only to club members or clubs as well. But the GAO 
audit found the corporation had not routinely conducted such 
background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	After a review of 6,400 M-1 rifle sales between July 1997 and  
August 1998, the GAO estimated the corporation sold 1,200 to 2,200 
of the World War II-era semiautomatics without checks, or 19 
percent to 34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the audit, the corporation said it has improved  
scrutiny of buyers by sending applicants' names through the Justice 
Department's national instant background check system. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation, based at Fort Clinton, Ohio, also promised to  
audit sales each year to ensure criminal background checks are 
conducted and that guns go to only its club members and U.S. 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report is focused on yesterday's deficiencies,'' said  
Charles Maddox, chairman of the corporation's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO didn't say there was evidence that the Army firearms  
were used to commit any crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Sen. Lautenberg and Rep. Maloney said the law needs  
to be changed to require such audits. The lawmakers also are 
considering requiring a government agency -- perhaps the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms -- to provide oversight. Returning the 
program to the Army is not under consideration, a spokesman for 
Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Stewart, assistant GAO director who worked on the January  
report, said the 1996 law excluded the program from ATF scrutiny 
since the corporation was supposed to conduct its own checks on 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were examples where the corporation followed the law,  
but, as the audit shows, we found quite a few times when it 
didn't,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO recommended the corporation audit its firearms sales and  
that Congress amend the law to require such action. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Army has transferred more than 56,000 firearms to  
the corporation, including M-1 Garands, M-1 Carbines, M-14s, 
.22-caliber rifles and pistols, according to the GAO. As of Sept. 
30, the Army had in storage another 230,000 M-1s, 35,000 
.22-caliber rifles and more than 4,000 other firearms that the 
corporation will receive. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation, in turn, sold 22,584 weapons from the Army  
stock in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 -- 16,339 of them M-1 rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army charges the corporation about $100 per weapon to handle  
costs such as storage and transportation, a GAO spokesman said. The 
corporation then sells the arms for $450 to $750 each.

<HEADLINE> Beaten Marine To Face His Attackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Carlos Colbert, a black Marine who was  
paralyzed after five drunken white men beat him and broke his neck 
at a Memorial Day party, can move his left hand only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	He turns on a television with a device he manipulates with his  
mouth. Doctors say the 21-year-old Colbert will never walk again 
and will need constant care. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Colbert will face his attackers at their  
sentencing and tell them how they've changed his life, prosecutor 
Craig Rooten said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Brian Lawson, 20; Trenton Joe Solis, 18; Robert Rio, 23;  
Jed Allen Jones, 21; and Steven Lawrence Newark III, 18, pleaded 
guilty last month to felony assault, avoiding possible life 
sentences if the case had gone to trial and they had been convicted 
of committing a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of people involved and there was a lot of  
alcohol involved, making it a difficult case to sort out,'' Rooten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colbert was one of just a few blacks who attended a mostly white  
party last May at the home of Tim Bullard, a fellow Camp Pendleton 
Marine. At least 100 people packed the small house at Santee, a 
rural community 20 miles northeast of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	When a fight broke out in the front yard, there were no  
streetlights to illuminate what was happening and most of the 
people were drunk, Rooten said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rooten said one common denominator was that the attackers  
punched and kicked Colbert while shouting racial slurs and ``white 
power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing last month, Judge Frederic Link asked Lawson if he  
beat Colbert because he was black and he tearfully said: ``That is 
correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawson's admission means he faces two to 11 years in prison. The  
others face a five-year probation with one year in jail. They will 
receive credit for jail time already served. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of some of the attackers recently went on a radio  
talk show, saying their sons were coerced into confessing that the 
crime was racially-motivated, and it really was just a drunk brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Colbert spent several months at a Veteran's Administration  
hospital in Long Beach before moving to a Virginia hospital closer 
to his family's home in Maryland, and now a home modified for his 
wheelchair, Rooten said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Be Cited in Jones Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In a sign that President Clinton's  
legal troubles aren't over, a federal judge said Tuesday she is 
prepared to consider whether he should be found in contempt of 
court for his testimony about Monica Lewinsky in the Paula Jones 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright said she waited to  
address the issue because of the impeachment trial and the fact 
that Mrs. Jones' case was before an appeals court. It was settled 
in December for $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accordingly, I believe that now it is time for the court to  
address the contempt issue,'' she said in an order issued Tuesday 
after a conference with lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also said she would step aside from the case if she were  
asked to do so by attorneys because of her contact with a House 
impeachment case manager. She gave lawyers until Friday to file a 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House referred all requests for comment to Clinton's  
private lawyer in the case, Robert Bennett. Bennett did not 
immediately return a call to his office seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' spokeswoman, Susan Carpenter-McMillan, said she had  
not talked with Mrs. Jones, but added that Clinton should be held 
for contempt. ``My God, he lied,'' she said. ``If he can get away 
with not being held for contempt, I suppose we could all lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright raised the possibility of contempt in a footnote to her  
decision on Sept. 1 to release a transcript of Clinton's testimony 
in a deposition in the Jones sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Wright said she ``has concerns about the nature of  
the president's January 17, 1998, deposition'' but ``makes no 
findings at this time regarding whether the president may be in 
contempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition, Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual  
relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' He acknowledged Aug. 17 before a 
federal grand jury -- and again in a nationally televised address -- 
that he had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group in  
Washington, filed a formal petition with Wright months ago seeking 
a court hearing on whether Clinton was in contempt of court because 
of what the private organization called his ``apparently false 
testimony.'' The foundation said ``the court has the right, if not 
the duty, to defend itself against obstructive acts committed in 
its presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In saying she would step down, Wright disclosed Tuesday she had  
contact with Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and her law clerk 
provided an affidavit for possible use in the impeachment case. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Hutchinson wanted her testimony about Clinton's  
demeanor during his deposition testimony, including where his 
attention was directed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified to the grand jury that he might not have been  
paying attention when his lawyer told the judge about Ms. 
Lewinsky's affidavit and said there was no sex of any kind with 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said she was not willing to be a witness in the  
impeachment proceeding and suggested that other people could 
provide the same evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Her law clerk, Barry Ward, later provided an affidavit about  
Clinton's deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said she didn't think those were reasons for her to  
step aside. If that happens, the contempt matter would be decided 
by another judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones filed her lawsuit in 1994. Wright dismissed the  
lawsuit April 1, but Mrs. Jones appealed the decision. The appeal 
was pending when she and Clinton reached the settlement Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawsuit brought to light the president's affair with  
Ms. Lewinsky and set in motion a criminal investigation that 
resulted in the House vote to impeach Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones alleged that Clinton, when he was governor of  
Arkansas, made a crude advance in a room at a Little Rock hotel in 
1991. She was a state worker at the time. Clinton denies her 
accusation.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Sink / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Tuesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as weak export demand continued to 
pressure prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell sharply as investors ignored reports Egypt  
was purchasing 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat. Market 
participants said the low selling price indicates farming profits 
will continue to shrink as exporters attempt to beat competitors 
for scant demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans tumbled after the National Oilseed Processors  
Association reported that soybeans crushed into oil and beans fell 
7.21 million bushels between December and January and were sharply 
below crushing levels of a year earlier, indicating demand remains 
weak in the face of a global economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also were pressured by expectations Brazil will harvest a  
near-record competing soybean crop after a season of ideal growing 
weather. That crop is expected to compete heavily against ample 
U.S. supplies for scant export business. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn fell in sympathy with soybeans and wheat.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 5 1/4 cents to $2.52 1/4 a bushel; March  
corn fell 1 cent to $2.14 a bushel; March oats fell 2 3/4 cents to 
$1.01 a bushel; March soybeans fell 4 cents to $4.87 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeder cattle futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while live cattle finished mixed. Pork futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle was unchanged at 67.57 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose .02 cent to 74.62 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell 1.35 cents to 45.42 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 
1.30 cents to 55.10 cents a pound.

</P>
<P>
	Carole Black, president and general manager of KNBC-TV, the Los  
Angeles NBC station, was named Lifetime's chief on Monday, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Black had worked at KNBC since 1994. Before that she worked  
at the Walt Disney Co. for eight years, rising to senior vice 
president of marketing for the television production division. She 
has no cable television experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Black will replace Doug McCormick, who was at the helm of  
Lifetime for six years and was credited for building the station's 
subscriber base up to 73 million and its value to more than $3 
billion. Lifetime owners did not renew McCormick's contract when it 
expired in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in leadership comes as Lifetime prepares to face  
direct competition from talk show host Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey is 
teaming up with Geraldine Laybourne, who is credited with building 
the children's cable channel Nickelodeon, and producers behind 
Carsey-Werner-Mandabach, which produced hit shows like ``Third Rock 
From the Sun'' and ``The Cosby Show'' -- to develop a women's cable 
channel to debut next January. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel's debut comes as contracts covering more than half  
of Lifetime's subscribers comes up for renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifetime is a joint venture between Walt Disney Co. and Hearst  
Corp.

<HEADLINE> Jeter Beats Yankees in Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Derek Jeter became the first player this year to beat a club in  
salary arbitration when he was awarded $5 million today. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after hearing arguments at Tampa, Fla., the three-man  
panel rejected the New York Yankees' offer of $3.2 million to the 
All-Star shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter matched Ruben Sierra's 1992 salary with Texas as the  
second-highest ever awarded in arbitration. The only higher award 
is the $5.3 million pitcher Jack McDowell got from the Chicago 
White Sox in 1994 -- when he lost his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, who made $750,000 last year, was eligible for arbitration  
for the first time. The case was decided by arbitrators Nicholas 
Zumas, Ira Jaffe and Gil Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bernie Williams became a free agent last autumn, he said  
that anger from his 1996 arbitration hearing lingered. Williams, 
the last Yankee to go to a hearing before Jeter, nearly signed with 
Boston but instead stayed with New York, agreeing to an $87.5 
million, seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, 24, is eligible for free agency after the 2001 season,  
one year after Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez becomes eligible, 
which could lead to a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter hit .324 last season with 19 homers, 84 RBIs and 30  
steals. He was fifth in the AL in batting average and first in runs 
with 127. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners had won the first five hearings this year, defeating  
Montreal infielder Shane Andrews, Boston outfielder Midre Cummings, 
Kansas City outfielder Johnny Damon, Los Angeles shortstop Mark 
Grudzielanek and Detroit outfielder Brian Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mets reliever Armando Benitez, scheduled for a hearing  
today, agreed to a one-year contract worth $1,987,500, up from $1.1 
million last year. The settlement was halfway between the $2.4 
million he had sought and the $1,575,000 the Mets had offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Benitez, ontained from Baltimore during the offseason, with 5-6  
with a 3.82 ERA and 22 saves for the Orioles last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Ray Durham, scheduled for a hearing Monday,  
instead agreed to a $20 million, four-year contract with the 
Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Durham made $1,935,000 last year and asked for $4.3 million in  
arbitration after hitting .285 with 19 homers, 67 RBIs and 36 
steals last season, all career highs. Chicago offered $3.35 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	He will receive salaries of $3.4 million this season, $4.9  
million in 2000, $5.9 million in 2001 and $5.8 million in 2002.

<HEADLINE> American Restores Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- As American Airlines restores operations to  
normal, the nation's second-largest airline is expected to take 
steps to win back the business of passengers alienated by 
cancellations during a pilots sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	But experts say that because of high demand for seats, travelers  
shouldn't expect big fare cuts after this labor dispute. What's 
more, American cut back its spring flight schedules in anticipation 
that pilots would refuse voluntary overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer frequent-flier  
magazine, said he expects the airline to use frequent flier miles 
as an apology rather than money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're going to see a lot of big fare slashes.  
American is more conservative. They don't like to do things 
everyone else would match,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hotard, a spokesman for American's parent company, AMR  
Corp., said because of federal requirements he could not comment on 
whether there would be a fare sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline saw more than 6,000 of its  
flights canceled over the past 10 days due to a dispute with its 
pilots union that degenerated into a sickout. About 600,000 
travelers were inconvenienced by scrubbed takeoffs and delays on 
American flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The work action has cost American between $67 million and $90  
million, according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR Corp. The 
final total has not been projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Martin returned home to Miami Tuesday on a United  
Airlines flight. Delays and cancellations prompted her to scrap 
plans to return from Puerto Rico on an American flight Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really doubt I would ever fly American again,'' Martin said.  
``I know it will be an inconvenience to myself and it probably 
wouldn't make a difference to their business but I think I owe it 
to myself to stop flying American after what we've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, airlines regularly coaxed customers back with  
reduced prices. Northwest Airlines ran an extended fare sale last 
year while it weathered months of labor unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, American has usually used frequent flier miles to entice  
travelers. When pilots briefly walked off the job on Valentine's 
Day in 1997, the airline offered double bonus miles rather than 
cost reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the savviest in using those miles and programs to  
satisfy people's complaints,'' said Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
	To appease travel agents who have been overwhelmed by the  
changes in schedules, American on Monday decided to pay commissions 
for tickets that were later refunded because of the sickout. 
Commissions are not usually paid in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism experts expect the public and travel agents to continue  
to book with American. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think memories are short lived in these situations.  
Travelers will base their choice on price rather than short-term 
problems with service,'' said Sheryl Spivack, a tourism specialist 
at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Monroe of Boston, who was boarding an American flight at Los  
Angeles International Airport Tuesday, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``American Airlines is usually my first choice. It won't change.  
I've had good experience with them in the past, plus I'm in their 
frequent flier program,'' Monroe said. ``I don't hold it against 
the airline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While passengers saw flight schedules return to normal on  
Tuesday, the airline continued to negotiate with the Allied Pilots 
Association over the issue that started the whole scheduling snarl 
to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
	There was finally some movement on the core issues for the  
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The company on Tuesday offered to immediately increase pay up to  
56 percent for pilots of Reno Air, which was purchased by AMR in 
December. American also said it would shorten the overall period 
for training and integrating both airline operations and pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot union president Rich LaVoy said Tuesday evening that  
negotiators have agreed on a training and transition program that 
would take up to 18 months. ``Both sides were already in that 
ballpark,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sticking point continues to be when Reno pilots will get  
their raise. American is willing to do it immediately; the union 
wants it to be retroactive to the day Reno was purchased. ``They 
still haven't met our core principle of pay equity from Dec. 23,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, the company questioned the union's willingness  
to compromise. ``During this entire negotiation, the union has 
shown a complete unwillingness to move off its original position,'' 
the company said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, the pilots followed a federal judge's order and placed  
$10 million, or one quarter of the union's assets, with the court. 
The money will go toward a fine that is expected to be levied 
against APA at a scheduled hearing on Wednesday. U.S. District 
Judge Joe Kendall ruled on Saturday that the union did not do 
enough to prevent the sickout once he ordered pilots to return to 
their cockpits. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of difficulties during the talks, American Airlines has  
cut 20 flights a day from its schedule. The company initially 
thought it would need to cut more flights, but has settled on about 
1 percent of its schedule. The airline says it does not believe 
pilots will volunteer for extra overtime even though the union 
leadership is saying it is not encouraging pilots to refuse the 
extra flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots can be contractually scheduled to fly up to 78 hours a  
month. They can voluntarily fly five additional hours during the 
same time period.

	Dragging Death Case Begins  
</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Prosecutors claim John William King  
participated in the deadly beating and dragging of a black man 
because he was trying to gain attention in the white supremacist 
world. King is accused along with two other men of chaining James 
Byrd Jr. to the back of a pickup truck and dragging him for three 
miles. Byrd's body was shredded, and his head and an arm were 
severed from his torso. The sheriff of Jasper says the clues that 
turned up after Byrd's death convinced him that Byrd was killed 
because he was black. Prosecutors say that King is a racist and has 
a tattoo showing a black man hanging from a tree.

	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright

President Slobodan Milosevic on progress at the Kosovo peace 
conference. Albright told Milosevic that the Kosovo Albanians 
appear ready to sign an American-backed peace deal, but that the 
Serb side remains the obstacle, officials said. No deal on Kosovo 
can be reached without Milosevic's approval. The United States and 
five other nations are pushing Yugoslavia to grant autonomy to

Abdullah Ocalan's capture may bring an end to fighting that has

flight. Lee Thresher ran amok aboard flight BA009 from London to 
Bangkok. Prosecutors say Thresher attacked a young woman who 
resisted his advances and a doctor who had stood up to let his wife 
go to the bathroom. Then he punched out a plastic window at the 
rear of the 747 jet as it cruised at 35,000 feet. Crew members

Witnesses testified that Miss Goodman entered the Wal-Mart with her 
two young children to exchange a phone she had bought a week

wanted, Miss Goodman said, she retrieved the initial purchase, 
bought some motor oil and left. She was then detained and accused 
of stealing the phone.

<HEADLINE> Brown Basketball Coach To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Frank Dobbs will resign as Brown  
University's men's basketball coach at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs will leave after the team's final four games, according to  
Brown sports information director Chris Humm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears are 4-18 this season, including a 2-8 Ivy League  
record. The 36-year-old Dobbs has compiled a 67-137 record during 
eight years at Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Brown athletic director David Roach praised Dobbs.  
</P>
<P>
	``Since coming to Brown eight years ago, Frank Dobbs has been a  
tremendous asset to Brown University, the state of Rhode Island and 
the Providence community,'' Roach said in a written statement. ``He 
is an outstanding young man, who will always have the support, 
respect and admiration of those who know him.''

<HEADLINE> NFL To Add Los Angeles or Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFL will most likely add a 32nd team in  
Houston or Los Angeles in March, returning to a city that lost a 
franchise this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Tuesday the 31 owners seem in  
agreement on the plan and will vote on it next month in Phoenix. 
The team, which would be the NFL's fourth expansion club this 
decade, could begin play in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville and Carolina joined the league in 1995 and the new  
Cleveland Browns begin play this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are getting to the point where they understand  
that, as we go into the 21st century, we've certainly got to have a 
32-team league,'' Tagliabue said after a four-hour meeting with the 
expansion committee at an Atlanta airport hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the L.A. and Houston markets have fan interest, large  
populations and television appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The main difference is there is only one group, headed by Robert  
McNair, vying for the franchise in Houston, and it has a plan for a 
new retractable-roof stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Two rival groups in Los Angeles are bidding for the expansion  
franchise, each with its own stadium plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz has lined up an all-star roster of  
investors, including actors Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner, to build 
a combined stadium and shopping mall in Carson, 21 miles south of 
downtown. Developer Ed Roski Jr. and billionaire Eli Broad are 
proposing to renovate the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has been without a franchise since the Raiders  
returned to Oakland and the Rams moved to St. Louis before the 1995 
season. The Houston Oilers left for Tennessee in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said the league may assist in the funding of the Los  
Angeles stadium, but the money would go toward one of the plans 
already proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say if the league is committed to picking one of  
the two ownership groups, indicating there is some trepidation 
among the owners about the warring bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got two different ownership groups and two different  
stadium plans,'' he said. ``That's something we've got to work 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion decision likely will spawn a whole new set of  
issues, with realignment at the head of the list. Tagliabue said 
the expansion committee discussed various scenarios Tuesday, using 
both Los Angeles and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Realignment is a hot-button issue in a league where Arizona and  
Dallas are part of the NFC East, Atlanta and Carolina are members 
of the NFC West, and the three teams in Florida are spread over 
three separate divisions in both conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	On another matter, the league's finance committee decided it  
needs more information about an $800 million bid by Howard Milstein 
to purchase the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wants to ensure that Milstein is not violating the  
rule against borrowing more than $100 million using the team as 
collateral to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving as promptly as we can. It's important to  
Washington and important to the league,'' Tagliabue said. ``But 
it's not as important that we complete this deal today or tomorrow 
as it is to make the right decision for the next quarter-century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Joe Browne said Tagliabue also hopes to have a  
decision by the March meeting on whether Edward DeBartolo Jr., 
owner of the San Francisco 49ers, can resume active control of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo ceded day-to-day control to his sister, Denise  
DeBartolo York, when he was targeted in a Louisiana gambling fraud 
probe. He pleaded guilty in October to failing to report a felony 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said the NFL is still committed to having the 2003 Super  
Bowl in San Francisco -- if a new stadium is built to replace 3Com 
Park. That issue will be discussed next month, as well, with the 
owners having the option of taking away the title game.

<HEADLINE> Dell Quarterly Profit Jumps 49 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. posted a 49 percent jump in  
quarterly profit Tuesday but sales fell short of Wall Street 
predictions as Dell lost customers to rival sellers of lower-priced 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The revenue disappointment was unusual for Dell, the  
third-largest seller of computers that has set a scorching industry 
pace with its unconventional tactic of selling machines directly to 
customers and avoiding the middleman. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell has held fast with its strategy of refusing to compete on  
price with other major makers, such as Compaq Computer Corp. and 
International Business Machines Corp. Instead, Dell has focused on 
higher-end machines with bigger margins, managing to post 
consistently strong income even as rivals' narrowed. 
</P>
<P>
	That strategy resulted in a profit of $425 million, or 31 cents  
a share, meeting analysts' forecasts for the company's fourth 
quarter, ended Jan. 29. That was up from a profit of $285 million, 
or 20 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That increase was partly due to slower rate of cost increases in  
the quarter as revenue grew only 38 percent, to $5.17 billion from 
$3.74 billion. That was about $200 million less than analyst 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have been more aggressive in pricing in our  
product,'' Dell chief financial officer Thomas Meredith said in a 
phone interview from the company's Round Rock, Texas headquarters. 
He said the company may become a more vigorous cost cutter as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's results were released Tuesday after the close of  
financial markets, where Dell's stock fell $1.12 1/2 a share to $88.75 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell was able to hold the line on higher costs in part by  
boosting its Internet business, which requires fewer staff than 
conventional sales. Dell sold $14 million a day in computers over 
the Internet in the quarter, up from $10 million daily the quarter 
before, Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dell's full fiscal year, profit grew 55 percent to $1.46  
billion, or $1.05 a share, from $944 million, or 64 cents a share. 
Revenue rose to $18.24 billion from $12.33 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks of a ``New Season'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For President Clinton, this appears a time of  
self-renewal and forward focus as he claims the world stage -- and 
New Hampshire's familiar political terrain -- with talk of a ``new 
season'' and ``this tide of spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's words as he sat opposite Mexican President  
Ernesto Zedillo on Monday were not new. The aftermath of his 
impeachment and acquittal should, for the nation, be a ``time for 
reconciliation and renewal,'' Clinton reiterated during his quick 
trip to Merida, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	But his brimming confidence this time suggested he feels he's  
won not only a second chance but a stronger hand. Clinton took off 
work today and, after a long abstinence, took to the golf course 
with brother-in-law Hugh Rodham and top Democratic fund-raiser 
Terence McAuliffe. 
</P>
<P>
	From commanding the world stage on his 23-hour mission to  
Mexico, Clinton takes the policy helm of his Democratic Party on 
Wednesday, with a Social Security forum at the White House -- the 
centerpiece of a day when Democrats fan out to Social Security town 
meetings nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, he welcomes French President Jacques Chirac at the White  
House and is planning his first news conference since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, Clinton will spend all of Thursday making stops  
around New Hampshire, where in the 1992 campaign he coined his own 
nickname as ``The Comeback Kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw him act like a man in trouble in the first  
place,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said Monday evening as he 
boarded Air Force One behind Clinton en route home from Mexico. 
``But he sure had a great day today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands and thousands of Mexicans, many setting up  
mariachi-style bands on the sidewalk, lined the streets of Merida 
to cheer Clinton's motorcade with flags and banners wishing him and 
``su esposa (your wife) Hillary'' happy returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This joy, this warmth, this affection is reserved only for our  
dearest friends,'' Zedillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton basked in that affection.  
</P>
<P>
	He thanked the congressional delegation with him -- including  
Republican Reps. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, Rob Portman of 
Ohio and Kevin Brady of Texas, each of whom voted in favor of 
Clinton's impeachment -- for their show of ``America's commitment 
for the common future we will make together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To officials from both Mexico and the United States, Clinton  
proclaimed: ``This tide of spring has brought a new season of 
friendship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was talking about U.S.-Mexican relations, but the sentiment  
appeared to apply more broadly. 
</P>
<P>
	On the return flight to Washington late Monday, Clinton lingered  
with members of Congress in the guest cabin. While the president 
signed pages of Air Force One stationery for one guest, others 
showed off to Clinton the T-shirts and other Mexican souvenirs 
they'd picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewards passed out Hemp Golden beer, whose label boasted the  
``smooth, mild, mellow herbal flavor'' of having been brewed with 
hemp seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a comfortable exchange Monday with the same reporters he  
dodged for most of last year, Clinton mused from his seat at the 
lavish Hacienda Temozon (Whirlwind Estate) about his wife's 
political future and his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``She and I both would like to continue to be useful in public  
affairs when we leave office,'' he said in between private meetings 
with Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the prospect that Mrs. Clinton would be a shoo-in to  
replace New York Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ``I think 
she would be terrific in the Senate,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> Inmate Killed in Highway Scuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAND SPRINGS, Okla. (AP) -- A sheriff's deputy fatally shot a  
knife-wielding inmate who attacked him en route to prison Tuesday, 
causing the deputy's car to overturn off the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Elbert Fuller was taking two inmates to state prisons in  
western Oklahoma when one of the men reached from the back seat 
with a knife, placing it against the deputy's neck, Tulsa County 
Sheriff's Maj. Dick Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
	The car veered off U.S. 64 and flipped onto its roof.  
</P>
<P>
	Fuller, hanging upside down by his seat belt in the car, fired  
three shots at the inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old inmate was dead on arrival at a Tulsa hospital.  
The deputy and the second inmate were not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmate who died had been serving time on drug and robbery  
charges. Both men were searched prior to their transfer, and police 
did not know how the knife was acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	The second inmate appeared to have no connection to the apparent  
escape attempt, Okmulgee County Sheriff Dale James said.

<HEADLINE> Tabloid Publisher Sold for $300M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even with Americans overstuffed on gossip and  
scandal, the new owner of the National Enquirer and the Star plans 
a major push for the struggling supermarket tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment firm Evercore Partners announced Tuesday it will  
acquire the tabloids' owner, American Media Inc., for $300 million 
and has hired a veteran magazine executive to revive their sagging 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	David Pecker is stepping down as chief executive of Hachette  
Filipacchi Magazines -- publisher of George, Elle, Mirabella and 25 
other titles -- to lead the new American Media. 
</P>
<P>
	Evercore and Pecker are planning a $50 million marketing  
campaign to boost sales and are considering expanding the tabloids 
into teen and Spanish-language versions and television programming. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a terrific opportunity to build on the strength of  
these brands,'' said Austin Beutner, a principal with Evercore, a 
New York-based firm headed former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger 
Altman. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Enquirer and the Star ``are probably two of the  
most under-marketed and under-promoted papers in the country,'' 
Beutner said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new owners of American Media face the daunting task of  
trying to build a company known for celebrity gossip at a time when 
Americans are increasingly turned off by the mountain of White 
House sex scandal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``If well over two-thirds of the American public wanted just to  
end the entire Clinton-Lewinsky saga ... what that's saying is 
maybe the public's appetite for gossip and sexual peccadilloes of 
celebrities may have ebbed,'' said Jack Cox, president of the 
Foundation for American Communications, a Los Angeles-based 
journalism think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, 80 percent of adults surveyed by the American  
Society of Newspaper Editors complained that newspapers 
overdramatize the news to sell papers and that sensational stories 
get a lot of ink because they are more exciting than important. 
</P>
<P>
	The gossip backlash has helped damage the tabloids' sales since  
the death of Princess Diana, whose every move was front-page news 
on supermarket shelves. The National Enquirer's circulation has 
dipped to 2.24 million at the end of last year from 2.72 million in 
June 1997, while the Star's circulation fell to 1.82 million from 
2.22 million in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	The tabloids, like all newspapers, have also suffered from more  
intense competition amid the dramatic growth of cable news channels 
and Internet news sites in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the recent downturn, the tabloids remain very  
formidable publications. The National Enquirer, for example, has a 
higher circulation than U.S. News &AMP; World Report, which was 2.13 
million at the end of 1998, according to the Audit Bureau of 
Circulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very few brands that combine the high profile and  
high circulation levels of the Enquirer and Star,'' Pecker, who is 
leaving after seven years as Hachette's CEO, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But American Media, based in Lantana, Fla., has been struggling.  
Last month, the company reported that profits for the first nine 
months of its fiscal year dropped 92 percent to $569,000 from $6.8 
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	American Media, which also publishes Country Weekly and Weekly  
World News, said last week it would stop publishing Soap Opera News 
and Soap Opera Magazine, and would sell certain assets and 
trademarks to magazine publisher Primedia Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Evercore is paying $7 per share for American Media and also will  
assume $470 million in debt. Boston Ventures Ltd., which owns 70 
percent of American Media, has already agreed to the sale.

<HEADLINE> French Sailor Rescued Unharmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Her life in peril and her boat destroyed  
by mountainous waves, a star French sailor was rescued unharmed in 
the South Pacific on Tuesday by a heroic rival in the solo 
around-the-world race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean navy said Isabelle Autissier was rescued at 9:37  
a.m. EST by yachtsman Giovanni Soldini of Italy. She was saved 
about 24 hours after sending a distress signal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The French sailor is now safe and in good condition aboard the  
Italian yacht Fila,'' Cmdr. Nilton Duran told The Associated Press 
by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier was the overall leader of the 27,000-mile Around Alone  
race when her 60-foot PRB overturned in fierce weather Monday. The 
Chilean navy said the 42-year-old Frenchwoman's boat was 
``completely lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The boat suddenly turned more than 90 degrees, and I could no  
longer be in the cockpit,'' Autissier said. ``Then it suddenly 
turned over, and I didn't have time to shut the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier sent a mayday and made a brief call to Paris after her  
boat was capsized by 40 mph winds and waves as high as 40 feet, 
race director Peter Rachtman said from Auckland, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very quickly, the mast snapped into pieces,'' she said. ``When  
I saw that, I sent the signal because there was nothing else I 
could do. Then I began to get organized, getting security material 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no known commercial or private shipping in the isolated  
ocean south of Australia, organizers said the fleet represented 
Autissier's best chance for survival. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier was in second place in the third leg before her boat  
capsized, trailing Marc Thiercelin by 38 miles. The rescue came 
2,070 miles west of Punta Arenas, Chile's southernmost city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I calculated that Marc or Giovanni were closest to me, but  
nevertheless realized that it could take at least 24 hours for them 
to arrive,'' Autissier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini was 200 miles and at least 10 hours away when he turned  
south into heavy seas to reach Autissier. Duran said the weather 
had improved at the time of the rescue and winds had slowed to 29 
mph to 31 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am heading for PRB,'' Soldini told the Race Operations  
Center in Charleston, S.C., by radio before heading to Autissier. 
``I'm not letting up until I have found Isa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Soldini found Autissier's yacht, it was upside down and he  
didn't see the Frenchwoman, said Jeanne Aichele, director of 
Charleston Maritime Commission, in Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	After two or three passes, he threw a hammaer at the hull to  
wake her up, Aichele said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She came out of the hatch, got into a life raft and drifted  
downwind to Giovanni,'' she said. ``They are now having wine and 
cheese somewhere on Giovanni's boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean navy kept contact with stations in Hawaii,  
California and New Zealand during the search and rescue efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran said Fila will stay in the race and is expected to reach  
Uruguay in seven to nine days. The race, which includes a dozen 
boats, began in Charleston in August and is to end there in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other competitors were heading toward Autissier, but  
organizers said the nearest boat was at least three days away. 
</P>
<P>
	At a briefing before the fleet left Auckland last week, skippers  
were told to look after each other.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Sign Brady to Offer Sheet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars signed Kyle  
Brady to an offer sheet Tuesday that would make him the 
highest-paid tight end in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Jets have seven days to match the five-year, $14.4  
million offer because Brady is a transition player. The deal 
reportedly includes a $4 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady caught 30 passes last season for a career-high 315 yards  
and five touchdowns. The Jets selected him with the ninth overall 
pick in 1995 from Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady's deal with the Jaguars would average $2.88 million,  
moving him past the $2.87 million average earned by Denver tight 
end Shannon Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
	New York may have taken a step to prepare for Brady's loss by  
signing two-time Pro Bowler Eric Green on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Green caught 34 passes for 422 yards and one touchdown last  
season with the Baltimore Ravens.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Bid Still Being Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- While the Justice Department gathers  
evidence, a former federal prosecutor now working with Salt Lake 
Olympic organizers claimed boosters broke no laws while bidding for 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did consider a lot of the criminal theories and I don't see  
criminal conduct,'' Beth Wilkinson, a leading lawyer on the team 
that prosecuted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of their activities could be seen as unethical,'' she  
said, ``but that's a long way from being criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, which has five prosecutors working the  
case, has been guiding the investigation through the FBI office in 
Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize the importance of getting the focus back on the  
games themselves, so we're interested in getting this completed as 
soon as possible,'' FBI spokesman George Dougherty said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to sources familiar with the investigation,  
prosecutors are looking at possible mail or wire fraud; false 
statements or perjury; tax fraud; and violations of customs laws 
that require declaration of sums of $10,000 or more in cash leaving 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	One former Justice Department official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said Tuesday the high priority given the case may make 
charges more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent ethics panel last week revealed that executives  
of the Salt Lake bid committee gave more than $1 million worth of 
cash payments, free vacations, living stipends, shopping sprees and 
free medical care to International Olympic Committee members and 
their families prior to the 1995 IOC vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The report blamed former Tom Welch, the former president of the  
organizers, and Dave Johnson, fired last month as senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkinson, who left the Justice Department for a Washington law  
firm last September, was retained in December by the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee along with her Los Angeles-based partner, 
Barry Sanders, to conduct an internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders and Wilkinson said their no-crime conclusion pertains  
only to the SLOC, but lawyer Tom Schaffer, who represents Welch, 
says SLOC attorneys don't think his client broke any laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I discussed lots of different scenarios with them on several  
occasions, and the three of us really couldn't come up anything 
that fit,'' Schaffer said. ``There may be other things that Justice 
is looking at that I'm not aware of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel last week said one former bid employee reported  
$30,000 was taken from committee bank accounts to pay for 
legitimate expenses in Budapest in 1995. But the panel, which had 
no power to subpoena bank records, could not determine whether that 
amount was taken out of the United States in cash or travelers 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, Mitt Romney, the new chief executive officer  
for SLOC, received standing ovations when he appeared before the 
Utah House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney promised lawmakers that during his three-year tenure he  
would return the games to the athletes and bring the Olympics in on 
budget.

<HEADLINE> Heart Attack Treatment Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Heart attack victims are dying because hospitals  
around the country aren't using simple treatments such as giving 
patients aspirin, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody gets to decide where they're going to have their heart  
attack,'' said Gerald O'Connor, an epidemiologist with Dartmouth 
Medical School in New Hampshire. ``The real issue is the gap 
between knowledge and practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor and his colleagues looked at the medical records of  
186,000 Medicare patients treated for heart attacks in 1994 and 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, reported in the Journal of the American Medical  
Association, showed substantial differences in the use of 
treatments recommended by the American College of Cardiology, 
American Heart Association and the consensus of experts. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the most basic, low-tech recommended therapies are  
aspirin and beta-blockers. Beta blockers reduce the heart's 
workload; aspirin thins the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers used medical records to identify which patients were  
ideal candidates for certain treatments. They then determined what 
percentage of those patients actually got the treatment in 306 
regions of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, 14 percent of patients for whom aspirin was  
appropriate did not get it, and 50 percent did not get 
beta-blockers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Meyerson, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University  
and spokesman for the American Heart Association, said the study 
offers important information. ``Patients or their families as 
health care consumers need to be their own advocates more than ever 
before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A study published last month in the New England Journal of  
Medicine had similar findings. The study by the Yale-New Haven 
Hospital Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation found that 
heart attack patients fare best in top-rated U.S. hospitals -- not 
because those hospitals use expensive, state-of-the-art treatments 
but because they use beta blockers and aspirin.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Reaches New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar jumped to a two-month high against  
the yen Tuesday as the Bank of Japan unveiled plans that would 
lower the yields of government bonds. Rising yields were behind 
last month's strengthening of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose to a historical high against the euro while  
rising also against other currencies that got caught -- or ignored -- 
in the dollar's action with the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at  
118.74 Japanese yen, up from 115.53 in late European trading 
Monday, when U.S. financial markets were closed because of 
Presidents Day. The dollar hasn't been this high since Dec. 9, when 
it reached 118.75 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.1210, down from $1.1228 in Monday's  
late European trading. During the trading day, the euro reached 
$1.1160, an all-time low for the new currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders jumped at the opportunity to buy dollars and dump yen as  
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced that the 
government was cutting its sales of 10-year bonds by about 22 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Miyazawa said that an agency that manages  
public pension funds would resume buying government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa acknowledged that the moves would lower long-term  
interest rates, which had sent the yen rising against the dollar, a 
threat to Japan's economic rebound from its worst recession in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Japan's influential vice Finance Minister for  
international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, said he welcomed a weaker 
yen, a reversal of his previous positions supporting the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Willmore, senior economist at Barclays Capital, said the  
moves indicated Japan's willingness to tolerate a weak yen, higher 
inflation and a rising trade gap for the sake of economic growth. 
Japan's economic allies in the Group of Seven approved as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the thinking, we're willing to tolerate a larger trade  
gap in exchange for a jump-start on the economy and a recovery in 
Asia,'' Willmore said. ``Now that you've got an official blessing 
out of Japan, (a falling yen) could move pretty fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4255 Swiss francs in New York  
Tuesday, up from 1.4215 in Europe Monday, and 1.4952 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.4936. The British pound rose in New York to 
$1.6337 from $1.6261. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Tuesday's euro rate, and compared with its rate Monday  
in Europe, the dollar was worth 1.7454 German marks, up from 1.7419 
and 5.8515 French francs, up from 5.8422.

<HEADLINE> Japan Says Economy Still Slumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Despite some scattered signs of improvement,  
Japan's economy remains in a slump and could be hurt by rising 
long-term interest rates, the Economic Planning Agency reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic report was released Tuesday as Japanese officials  
disclosed fresh steps to curb the rate rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The governmnet will reduce long-term bond issuance next month  
and resume purchases of bonds by a public investment fund. Both 
measures aim to lower rates by reducing the supply of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``These steps should have a positive impact on long-term  
interest rates,'' Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond has  
soared above 2.0 percent in recent weeks from around 0.7 percent 
last September, pushed higher by expectations of a massive supply 
of bonds to fund the government's fiscal stimulus plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the 10-year bond yield fell to 1.985 percent from  
Monday's finish of 2.140 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision last month by the government to stop buying bonds  
through its Trust Fund Bureau, which manages public pension funds 
and money from the postal savings system, was one factor triggering 
the rise in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In its February report, the Economic Planning Agency said there  
were some bright signs in the economy, such as a pickup in 
residential construction and a declining rate of bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall personal consumption continues to suffer, as workers  
have become increasingly frugal due to falling wages, and the 
economy remains in an ``extremely severe'' state, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency gave the same assessment last month.  
</P>
<P>
	The report said there are few signs of substantial improvement  
in the economy. Though the pace of deterioration has slowed, there 
remain key downside risks. The most pressing risk is the recent 
rise in long-term interest rates, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though the rise in interest rates hasn't had a negative effect  
on the economy yet, a continued rise would pose downside risks for 
the economy,'' said Takashi Omori, director of the national 
economic division at the Economic Planning Agency's research 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising long-term interest rates have raised concern recently  
among some Japanese officials who fear that higher interest rates 
could offset the effects of the government's massive fiscal effort 
to put the economy back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move partly to appease that concern, the Bank of Japan on  
Friday cut its target for the overnight call rate to around 0.15 
percent from an average of 0.25 percent, and announced a range of 
other measures designed to boost money market liquidity and smooth 
corporate funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Omori said the effects of the monetary easing weren't reflected  
in the latest economic report. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts contend the central bank's move will only provide  
minor support for the economy and will do little to cap a further 
rise in long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Economic Planning Agency report noted some  
favorable signs in the economy, private economists have pointed out 
that most of those signs come with caveats. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said that housing investment, for instance, is  
improving in some areas, buoyed by a pick up in sales of apartments 
and residential housing. New housing starts rose 5.6 percent in 
December from the previous month, after falling 5.2 percent on 
month in November. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists said the rise in sales could be attributed to a  
``rush to buy'' before rising interest rates filter through to the 
housing loan market.

<HEADLINE> Cautionary Tale of Finance Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- To get an idea of how suddenly a hot category of  
mutual funds can turn cold, take a look at the recent performance 
of financial services funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last summer, these funds specializing in bank, insurance,  
mortgage and investment-firm stocks had been one of the standout 
groups of the 1990s. Their performance results often came in better 
than even the celebrated technology funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But all that changed abruptly in the third quarter of last year,  
as a default by Russia and other international debt and currency 
problems stirred fears of a worldwide financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	In August alone, the average financial-services fund tumbled 21  
percent, according to the Morningstar Mutual Funds research 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	As the dust settled at the end of 1998, Morningstar's average of  
55 financial services funds, with aggregate assets of about $20 
billion, managed to post a 6.43 percent gain for the year -- about 
22 percentage points short of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock 
composite index's rise. Technology funds, by contrast, jumped more 
than 51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That 6.43 percent return marked a big comedown from gains of 44  
percent in 1997, 27 percent in 1996, and 40 percent in 1995. In 
each of those years, financial funds outgained technology funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, as of mid-January, financial funds still showed  
annualized returns of better than 20 percent for the last five and 
10 years, less than a percentage point shy of technology funds' 
results for the same periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the first few weeks of 1999, however, the group once again  
drifted lower, as problems in Brazil kept investors uneasy about 
the international financial outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the new worries, the main story behind financial  
funds' decade-long popularity hasn't changed much. An aging 
generation of baby boomers in this country is expected to generate 
big demand for financial services for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong economy keeps pumping money through the U.S. financial  
system, while nearly dormant inflation allows for relatively low 
interest rates. A steady pace of mergers in the financial 
industries, meanwhile, creates additional profit opportunities in 
the stocks of the companies involved. 
</P>
<P>
	International worries have clearly thrown cold water on some of  
the highest hopes investors had built up. But some stubborn 
optimists say the setback may not go too much further. 
</P>
<P>
	As Jeffrey Warantz at the Wall Street firm of Salomon Smith  
Barney put it in a recent report, ``The performance of the sector 
has been hurt severely by the global financial crisis and its 
reverberations. It appears that the negative reaction to this 
crisis may have been a bit excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Underlying fundamentals remain intact. The U.S. economy is  
still strong, interest rates remain low, and the monetary 
environment remains positive. These conditions typically bode well 
for financial stocks. Finally, the dramatic reduction of earnings 
estimates within the sector as a result of the panic sets the stage 
for what we believe will be a large number of positive surprises in 
the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the damage has been done and the worst is now  
behind the financial sector. Earnings estimates are now improving, 
economic fundamentals remain attractive, and the sector is 
inexpensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But whatever they do next, financial-services funds have clearly  
shown what can befall investors in funds that concentrate on a 
single industry or sector of the economy. It's a story worth 
heeding for fans of other standout sectors, like Internet-focused 
technology funds and health-care funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if a convincing story supports enthusiasm for such a group,  
an investment in a fund of this type can be subject to wrenching 
volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	Observed the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey in its most recent  
look at financial-services funds, ``On the bright side, the 
downturn may have resulted in an attractive entry point for 
prospective investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``All investors, however, should realize that the industry's  
highly cyclical nature makes it best suited for risk-tolerant 
investors able to stomach any upturns and downturns of the domestic 
economy.''

<HEADLINE> Browns Get Bills LB Chris Spielman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The new Browns are a little like that old  
saying about not liking the weather: Wait five minutes and it will 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	But the expansion Browns seem to be moving even faster than the  
clouds blowing in off Lake Erie. They're shifting and reforming by 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the team had its busiest shopping day yet on the free  
agent market, agreeing to terms with Baltimore offensive tackle 
Orlando Brown and Minnesota defensive back Corey Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Browns closed a deal with Buffalo for linebacker  
Chris Spielman, who hasn't played in 1 1/2 years after sitting out the 
1998 season to be with his wife while she was treated for breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, the Browns are talking with 42-year-old  
quarterback Warren Moon while they prepare for this week's NFL 
college scouting combine in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Browns fans didn't have enough to swallow, Kentucky  
quarterback Tim Couch, Cleveland's possible No. 1 overall pick in 
April's college draft, will be in town later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Expansion sure is fun. It's exciting and exhausting.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a great deal happening,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer  
said. ``So much going on that I can't explain it to you. You just 
have to stay tuned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot has happened in the past week. Before last Tuesday's  
expansion draft, Cleveland's roster consisted of about 20 no-name 
street free agents, many of whom don't figure to be with the team 
beyond summer training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Browns spent only $18 million of their $55 million  
salary cap on 37 players in the expansion draft and entered the 
free-agent signing period with piles of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	They've spent some money, and now with nearly 70 players -- they  
can bring 90 to camp -- the Browns have some quality to go along 
with quantity. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, 33, doesn't exactly fit the player profile Palmer and  
Browns director of football operations Dwight Clark were seeking. 
He's at the end of his career, and he's had injury problems. But 
when a player of Spielman's caliber says he wants to play for your 
team, you bend the rules a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, who is under contract with the Bills through 2000, was  
reportedly acquired for a low-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	His '97 season was cut short when he had to undergo neck fusion  
surgery. Then last year, he chose to be with his wife, Stefanie, 
while she recuperated. When she lost her hair during chemotherapy, 
Spielman shaved his head, too. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some questions about the his playing future, but he  
had a strong workout and passed his physical with the Browns last 
week. Palmer came away impressed by both Spielman's condition and 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's great just to be around and talk with,'' said Palmer, who  
may see the inside linebacker as a mentor for the Browns' 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman's Ohio roots instantly make him the new Browns' star.  
He's played every snap as if it was his last throughout his career, 
and stories of his workout regime as well as his pregame 
preparation rituals are already part of this state's football lore. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a 6-foot-7, 350-pound tackle nicknamed ``Zeus,'' will be  
the second former Browns player to return to Cleveland. Last week, 
the Browns used their final expansion draft pick to select 
cornerback Antonio Langham. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who has reportedly signed a seven-year, $26 million deal,  
gives the Browns three young, quality offensive linemen. The 
28-year-old will join guard Jim Pyne and center Dave Wohlabaugh, 
the former Patriot, who signed a seven-year, $26.25 million 
contract Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller, 27, has 10 interceptions in four seasons, including four  
last season for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller had wanted to stay in Minnesota but the Browns had more  
to offer, $20.6 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't even close,'' Fuller said. ``I gave the Vikings a  
chance to step up, but it wasn't even close. I had to stop messing 
around and make a decision.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 66 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were higher at midday but the rally  
had stalled, after a morning run-up fueled by a drop in interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
66.17 at 9,341.06. The Dow got as high as 9387.40, up 112.51, in 
the first hour of trading, after losing 88.57 points last Friday. 
The financial markets were closed Monday for the President's Day 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 16.90 at 1,247.03, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index rose 27.57 at 2,349.46 after having tumbled 83.66 
points on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's run-up was sparked by a rally in U.S. bonds, after the  
Bank of Japan cut a key bank lending rate on Friday, and the 
Japanese government followed up Tuesday by saying it will step up 
purchases of government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement pushed interest rates lower in Japan and  
boosted the Nikkei stock average by 1.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also supported the U.S. bond market, where the benchmark  
30-year bond was up 27/32 point, pushing its yield down to 5.36 
percent from late Friday's 5.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a big boost in the morning from the bond market,'' said  
Bill Meehan, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. ``Japaniese 
bonds rallied pretty sharply, and that helped put a pretty strong 
bid under the U.S. bond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in interest rates boosted financial services and  
utility stocks. Citigroup was up 1 11/16 at 53 9/16. The Dow Jones 
utility average was up 2.61 points, or .91 percent, at 289.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also returning to technology shares, which had  
been beaten down on Friday following a big sell-off in Dell. 
Analysts warned the computer maker faces tougher competition as 
other PC makers cut costs and shift their business models to 
include more direct sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell shares were up 2 7/8 at 92 3/4. The company is expected to  
release earnings after the close of trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 4 to 3 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 302.46 million shares, just 
under Friday's pace of 316.62 million.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Jets have agreed to terms with a  
pair of former Baltimore Ravens, tight end Eric Green and defensive 
end Mike Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contracts were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Saga Divided Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both parties are pledging to work to repair  
the political damage done to Congress by the wrenching impeachment 
drama. But, with the two chambers all but snarling at each other 
near the end, some hard feelings are likely to linger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would all be wise to cool the rhetoric,'' Sen. Robert Byrd,  
D-W.Va., advised colleagues behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
	But, as the 2000 elections get nearer, emotions could intensify.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of wounds there that have to be healed,'' said  
Gerald Kerns, a professor at the University of Dayton, in Ohio. But 
he sees it as mostly a Republican problem, suggesting Democrats 
emerged from the impeachment drama unusually unified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to have a battle royale within the  
Republican party between the moderates and the right wing,'' Kerns 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate trial came to an end, House managers -- all 13 of  
them Republicans -- were virtually spitting their contempt for the 
Senate, and senators had to be reprimanded for snickering. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that everybody in the country wanted us to go away,''  
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said afterward. ``We could have had a 
better trial; we should have had a better trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vitriol is strongest in the House. In the Senate, the final  
days of closed-door arguments seemed to have a quieting effect on 
members of both parties. ``We spent these countless hours 
together,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trouble with the House: They had a flawed beginning,''  
said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said it more boldly: ``Extreme  
partisanship and prosecutorial zealotry have strained this process 
in its critical early junctures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how messy, some suggested the ordeal demonstrated the  
wisdom of the Founding Fathers in creating bodies that operate on 
such different impulses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing is over, and our institutions are intact,''  
said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan contends that impeachment is potentially destabilizing  
to the American form of government because once set in motion 
``only the Congress is involved,'' without the usual checks and 
balances among the executive, the legislative and judicial branches 
of government. 
</P>
<P>
	The constitutional rules of impeachment also impose more than  
the usual amount of stress on the system. Instead of being equal 
legislative chambers, the House in the impeachment trial became the 
prosecution; the Senate the judge and jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Constitution, in many ways, came alive for me for the  
first time,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	It used to be said by some political scientists that there were  
essentially four parties: congressional Democrats, presidential 
Democrats, congressional Republicans and White House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	But such distinctions are no longer so apparent, said pollster  
Andrew Kohut. Clinton has moved the entire Democratic Party more to 
the center, while Republicans not only have a serious rift -- but 
``are going to have to try to bury the bad taste they've left ... 
by cooperating more with Clinton and the congressional Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The liberal wing of the Democratic party has become smaller and  
less influential; the social-conservative wing of the Republican 
party, meanwhile, has grown larger and more outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohut said there's been an increase since the impeachment  
process began in the House last September among people who identify 
themselves as Democrats; a decrease among those identifying 
themselves as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican party also hasn't had any popular leaders in  
quite some time,'' Kohut said. ``I hate to say it, but the 
Republican party needs a Bill Clinton -- someone who can bridge the 
gap and appeal to the independent voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But James Thurber of American University said the fact that only  
a handful of House Democrats -- and no Senate Democrats -- voted for 
impeachment glosses over the fact that there's still a lot of 
Democratic division, and resentment toward Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're angry he put them through all this. They didn't like  
him to begin with and now they don't trust him,'' Thurber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., cited some advantageous side effects  
of the draining debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave us a chance to get a lot of legislative work done in  
the last five weeks -- just because we had to be here. We've been 
having committee meetings and hearings. We've gotten far more work 
done up to this point than we had a year ago.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Babies Accidentally Switched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORANGE, Calif. (AP) -- Two newborn boys were finally home with  
their biological mothers after they were accidentally switched in 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	One boy went home with the wrong mother for about an hour before  
St. Joseph Hospital discovered the error, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy to see this positive outcome and regret all the  
emotional turmoil this incident has caused,'' said hospital 
spokesman Larry Ainsworth, after DNA tests confirmed the babies 
were now with their correct parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Four nurses were placed on administrative leave after the  
mistake was discovered Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies and mothers at the Orange County hospital wear  
identification wristbands. It is hospital policy for a nurse to 
ensure that the names of new mothers match the bands on their 
newborns, Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a nurse apparently didn't noticed a mismatch when a new  
mother received an infant and was sent home Sunday afternoon. 
Within an hour, the hospital realized the mistake after the other 
mother noticed her newborn's name didn't match. 
</P>
<P>
	New mom Iliana Bravo was called and told the child she had taken  
home wasn't hers. ``I started shaking,'' Mrs. Bravo said. ``I was 
panicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ainsworth said two nurses will now check the wristbands before  
new mothers are discharged. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital handles about 5,500 babies each year. This was the  
first reported mistake of its kind in the 70 years that infants 
have been delivered there, Ainsworth said.

<HEADLINE> French Sailor Rescued Unharmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- French sailor Isabelle Autissier was  
rescued unharmed today after her boat capsized in the South Pacific 
during a solo around-the-world race, the Chilean navy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier was rescued at 9:47 EST by fellow competitor Giovanni  
Soldini of Italy, Cmdr. Nilton Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The French sailor is now safe and in good condition aboard the  
Italian yacht Fila,'' Duran told The Associated Press by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Fila will stay in the race and is expected to reach  
Uruguay in seven to nine days. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier was the overall leader when her 60-foot PRB overturned  
and was lost in the bad weather Monday, Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran said Soldini braved heavy seas for several hours before  
reaching Autissier. The Frenchwoman was rescued 2,070 miles west of 
Punta Arenas, Chile's southernmost city, 1,865 miles from Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier sent a mayday and made a brief call to her Paris  
headquarters after her boat was capsized by 40 mph winds and waves 
as high as 40 feet, said Peter Rachtman, a race director in 
Auckland, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier report on the Around Alone race's official Internet  
page said Autissier's team headquarters had received a radio call 
mid crackling interference shortly before the emergency beacon was 
set off. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini was at least 10 hours away when he turned south into  
heavy seas. Duran said weather had improved at the time of the 
rescue and winds had slowed to 29 mph to 31 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer said the Chilean Navy kept contact with stations in  
Hawaii, California and New Zealand during the search and rescue 
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Bogus Shampoo Is Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Call it a shampoo sham.  
</P>
<P>
	Ten truckloads of counterfeit Paul Mitchell shampoo have been  
destroyed because the product could have marred the integrity of 
the designer brand, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The phony suds also pose a health risk to consumers, said Los  
Angeles County Prosecutor Bill Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows what the next counterfeiter will put in a bottle? It  
is important for people to have confidence in a trademark,'' Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators confiscated nearly $1 million worth of the shampoo  
and made three arrests after tracking the phony suds to a Los 
Angeles-area bottler in February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The bogus product was burned in a New York incinerator earlier  
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are still searching for Joseph F. Thompson, the alleged  
ringleader of the counterfeiting operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 33, ran his own shampoo company until it went out of  
business in 1996. Prosecutors contend he then started relabeling 
generic shampoo as the costlier Paul Mitchell brand.

<HEADLINE> Football's Samuel Bartholomew Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSPORT, Tenn. (AP) -- Samuel Bartholomew, who captained the  
1939 Tennessee team that was undefeated and unscored upon during 
the regular season, is dead at age 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartholomew died Sunday night of pneumonia.  
</P>
<P>
	Bartholomew, a three-year letterman in football and track at  
Tennessee, played one year of professional football with the 
Philadelphia Eagles in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1938 Tennessee team went 11-0 and won the national  
championship. The following year, the Vols were undefeated and 
unscored upon heading into the Rose Bowl, but were beaten 14-0 by 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartholomew, a blocking back, won the Jacobs Trophy for the  
outstanding blocker in the Southeastern Conference in 1938 and 
1939. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, Bartholomew was  
an SEC football official for 15 years, working six Cotton Bowls and 
retiring in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartholomew was a World II veteran, then worked as a  
superintendent for Eastman Kodak Co. in Kingsport, 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Charlene, four children and 10

<HEADLINE> Tabloid Publisher Sold for $300M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two of the nation's best-known tabloids -- the  
National Enquirer and Star -- are part of a struggling publishing 
empire being acquired for $300 million by a New York investment 
firm headed by former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman. 
</P>
<P>
	American Media Inc., the Lantana, Fla.-based publisher that has  
suffered from slipping newsstand sales, is being purchased by 
Evercore Partners, which also is assuming $470 million in debt 
under the deal announced late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a terrific opportunity to build on the strength of  
these brands,'' said Austin Beutner, a principal with Evercore. The 
National Enquirer and Star ``are probably two of the most 
under-marketed and under-promoted papers in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Pecker, chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines,  
which publishes George, Elle and Mirabella magazines, has been 
hired as chairman and chief executive of American Media, which 
keeps its name in the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Pecker is planning a $50 million marketing campaign, to boost  
newspaper sales. The popular tabloids also may be expanded to 
include teen and Spanish language versions and television 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new owners of American Media face the daunting task of  
trying to build a company known for peddling gossip at a time when 
the Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal has left many Americans turned 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	``If well over two-thirds of the American public wanted just to  
end the entire Clinton-Lewinsky saga ... what that's saying is 
maybe the public's appetite for gossip and sexual peccadilloes of 
celebrities may have ebbed,'' said Jack Cox, president of the 
Foundation for American Communications, a Los Angeles-based 
journalism think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	American Media, which also prints Country Weekly and Weekly  
World News, said last week it would stop publishing Soap Opera News 
and Soap Opera Magazine, and would sell certain assets and 
trademarks to Primedia Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	American Media has been hurt by distribution problems and  
lackluster sales -- exacerbated by a drop in circulation after the 
death of Princess Diana, whose every move was dogged by tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Enquirer's circulation has dipped to 2.24 million  
at the end of last year from 2.72 million in June 1997. At the same 
time, The Star's circulation fell to 1.82 million from 2.22 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the company reported that profits for the first nine  
months of its fiscal year dropped 92 percent to $569,000 from $6.8 
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	American Media's stock rose 37 1/2 cents to $6.56 1/4 Tuesday on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Evercore's offer of $7 a share, announced after the market  
closed, represents a 6.6 percent premium. Boston Ventures Ltd., 
which owns 70 percent of American Media, has agreed to the sale.	   While Pecker clearly has his work cut out, he has a solid 
reputation in the publishing world. During his seven years as chief 
executive of Hachette, the company's sales doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very few brands that combine the high profile and  
high circulation levels of the Enquirer and Star,'' Pecker said in 
a statement. ``We feel these publications can be positioned for 
future growth on both the advertising and circulation fronts.''

<HEADLINE>  Jagr Is a Star on His Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux hasn't laced up a pair of skates  
or stared down a goaltender on a breakaway in nearly two years. No 
matter, he thinks the best player in hockey still resides in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux doesn't attend Penguins' games in person -- he's  
embroiled in a dispute with the bankrupt franchise's owner. But he 
watches enough on TV to give Jaromir Jagr this endorsement: ``He's 
the best player in the world -- by far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Jagr has played during the Penguins' 10-game winning  
streak, at a level reached only occasionally by gifted players such 
as Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky, it would be hard to argue otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jagr had four points in a streak-stretching 7-3 victory  
Monday over Washington, Capitals coach Ron Wilson said he yanked 
goaltender Olaf Kolzig with Pittsburgh ahead 5-1, ``As an act of 
mercy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jagr is the best player in the league,'' Canadiens defenseman  
Stephane Quintal said in admiration last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr will say only that Lemieux was the best player he ever saw,  
``And there was only one Mario.'' He won't compare himself to Eric 
Lindros, Pavel Bure or Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jagr is enjoying the crackdown on holding, clutching and  
grabbing, tactics Lemieux long implored the NHL to regulate because 
they allowed players of marginal ability to drag down the quality 
of play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the game has changed since last year,'' Jagr said.  
``It's more open and the stronger, better, faster guys have an 
advantage over the other guys. Last year, there was a lot of 
holding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, there's no holding back Jagr as he tries to win a  
third NHL scoring title in five years. He has 26 points, with six 
games of three points or more, during a 10-game winning streak the 
Penguins hope to extend Wednesday night at the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The only surprising aspect of the Penguins' longest streak since  
they won a league-record 17 in a row in 1993 is it has revealed 
Jagr the leader, not just Jagr the scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr succeeded Lemieux and Ron Francis as the Penguins' captain  
mostly in deference to his ability as a player, rather than as a 
leader of men. But he has stepped forward recently as the Penguins' 
most vocal leader, one capable of rallying his team even when he 
doesn't score. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated the Penguins trailed Buffalo 3-2 on Feb. 2, Jagr  
stood up on the bench and said, ``We're not losing.'' The Penguins 
scored three times in the final 6:01 to win 5-3, with Jagr figuring 
in every goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with the winning streak in danger of ending Saturday in  
Nashville, Jagr implored his teammates to remember they had won 
their previous two games in overtime, yelling, ``Let's do it 
again.'' They did, winning 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, Jagr is not a one-man offense. Kip Miller, who had  
only three points with the Islanders last season, has 10 goals and 
18 points in 11 games since moving up to Jagr's line. Martin Straka 
made the All-Star game, and Alexei Kovalev has 18 goals since 
joining the NHL's league-best offense 2 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But it takes only a few shifts of any game to realize that  
Jagr's speed, playmaking ability, scoring touch and ability to stay 
on his skates even when pummeled by larger defensemen makes the 
Penguins go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Jaromir Jagr gets better every year,'' Penguins  
general manager Craig Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Kevin Constantine agreed, saying, ``You wonder how much  
better the kid can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What even his coach forgets sometimes is Jagr no longer is a  
kid. Jagr turned 27 Monday and is in his ninth season in the 
league, even if it seems like only last week he was an 
impressionable teenager playing alongside Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's possible Jagr might play someday for the now-retired  
Lemieux, who is trying to assemble investors who would rescue the 
Penguins from bankruptcy and keep them in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great,'' Jagr said, clearly enjoying the thought  
that Lemieux might be his boss. ``It would be all offense all the 
time -- just the way we like it.''

<HEADLINE> Why Do Companies Give Freebies? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I bought a box of cereal last week and got a second one free.  
That's a great deal for me, but can companies really make money 
that way? Why don't they just cut their prices in half? 

</P>
<P>
	A. ``Buy one -- get one free'' offers are attention-grabbers.  
</P>
<P>
	A company making such an offer can usually convince a grocer or  
other retailer to advertise the deal and display the cereal, soda 
pop or potato chips more prominently to draw more customers into 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
	Such offers can drive sales six or seven times higher than  
normal, says Paul Theroux, who runs a marketing firm in Trumbull, 
Conn., and is chairman of the Promotion Marketing Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The offers are a bonus for regular customers of a brand who  
would be paying full price otherwise for both items. But the main 
targets are customers of competing brands. Once someone gets a 
taste of unfamiliar chips, the theory is the nibbler will come back 
to buy more at full price. 
</P>
<P>
	Theroux says such offers typically work best for established  
brands. ``If a consumer is not aware of a brand, he won't 
necessarily be sure if he will like one box, let alone two,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The offers are usually more appealing to brands that trail the  
category leader and are in sore need of some extra exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Expect to find two-for-one offers on products that are used  
fairly quickly like soft drinks or snacks where customers need to 
restock each week. If you give someone two bottles of cologne that 
last six months each, you have lost that customer for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may get a short-term bump in sales, but you have borrowed  
from the future,'' says Harold M. Spielman, chief executive of the 
market research firm McCollum-Spielman Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that simply slash prices in half risk damaging  
consumer's perceptions of the value of the brand and antagonize 
retailers who see the lower-priced products as more competition for 
their own store brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Price-cutting invites competitors to match the lower prices. It  
is also hard to raise prices once customers get used to the low 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	If two-for-one deals are used too often, customers may learn to  
stock up and buy only when a deal is on. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman also warns that consumers may see such offers as a sign  
of desperation. Consumers may think ``a new product is coming out 
and you are clearing out the old product. There is an image 
concern,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Bill Will Lower Calif. Milk Prices / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- D.B. Burns avoids buying milk whenever she  
can. Having lived and shopped in dozens of cities, she says the 
high milk prices in California are outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no excuse for it,'' she said while shopping in a  
supermarket where milk sells for $3.59 a gallon. ``It's such a 
staple and when something like that gets over the heads of people, 
especially folks who have to feed their children, the whole thing 
needs overhauling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California is the nation's biggest dairy producer, and the  
state's dairy industry enjoys relatively low production costs. But 
despite the plentiful supply, milk here costs more than in almost 
any other state, partly because of decades-old price and content 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, state Sen. Jackie Speier launched an effort to  
reduce milk prices, taking on the big grocery chains with a bill to 
end a state prohibition against selling milk for less than it costs 
retailers to keep it on their shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is fundamentally un-American to have a product as essential  
to child and adult nutrition as milk as the only price-fixed food 
staple in the grocery basket,'' said Speier, a San Francisco Bay 
area Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old state milk rules were enacted in part to prevent  
large dairy bottling and grocery chains from setting prices so low 
that smaller retailers couldn't compete. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumers Union, which helped draft Speier's bill, says  
retailers -- especially big grocery chains -- have instead used the 
rule as an excuse to inflate retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wholesale prices are also regulated in California. The current  
price to retailers and processors is $1.71 a gallon in Northern 
California and $1.73 a gallon in Southern California, according to 
the state Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Stores are required to add the costs of advertising and stocking  
the milk when they set retail prices. But consumer advocates say 
these costs don't account for average prices of $3.25 a gallon in 
San Francisco. In Los Angeles, milk prices are equally high, 
according to surveys by the Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried to get larger chains to compete by lowering their  
prices, but you never see milk sales being advertised,'' said Harry 
Snyder, a senior advocate with the Consumers Union, which publishes 
``Consumer Reports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We also tell larger stores that mom and pop stores are  
lowering their prices, so why can't they?'' Snyder said. ``They 
often blame the regulations, but now we've got a bill that takes 
away that excuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grocery industry officials had mixed opinions Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we have a neutral position on Speier's bill. There's  
no consensus,'' said Peter Larkin, president of the 1,500-member 
California Grocer's Association, which includes larger chains such 
as Albertsons, Safeway, Ralphs, Vons, and Lucky Stores. ``Some 
members believe it will have no impact and would support repealing 
price controls, and other members say they are more concerned about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In many states, grocers use milk as a loss leader, advertising  
low prices to get loyal customers into stores. In effect, they're 
willing to lose money on milk sales to ensure steady profits on 
other items. This is one reason why average prices for a gallon of 
milk are $2.80 in Chicago, $2.60 in Dallas and about $2.45 in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, that can't happen in California, one of 13 states to  
regulate milk prices. The others are Minnesota, North Dakota, 
Pennsylvania, Vermont, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Louisiana, Colorado, Nevada, and Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Earns Climb 21 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s fourth-quarter  
earnings rose a better-than-expected 21 percent from a year ago as 
the world's largest retailer continued to attract shoppers with its 
affordable prices and wide selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart said Tuesday that it earned $1.56 billion, or 70 cents  
a share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, compared with $1.29 
billion, of 57 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $40.79 billion in the latest fourth quarter from  
$35.39 million a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a year, a 
gauge retailers use to measure performance, were up 8.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates. Its  
stock was up $3 at $87.37 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at Wal-Mart's U.S. discount stores and supercenters rose  
14 percent in the fourth quarter, while sales climbed 26 percent in 
its international division. Its Sam's Clubs warehouse stores saw a 
12 percent gain in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the quarter, the company operated 1,869 Wal-Mart  
discount stores, 564 supercenters which include grocery and

<HEADLINE> Grounded Ship To Be Sunk at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- About a third of the molasses-like fuel  
oil aboard a grounded freighter has failed to burn away, officials 
said Tuesday as they prepared to tow the broken bow of the New 
Carissa to the deep Pacific to scuttle it. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship broke into two pieces after the Navy used napalm and  
directional explosives to burn off much of the nearly 400,000 
gallons of fuel aboard in a spectacular explosion on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	But an inspection team determined Tuesday the forward two-thirds  
of the Japanese-owned ship still contains about 135,000 gallons of 
fuel oil, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Ed Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinking the 440-foot forward section actually would help contain  
the remaining fuel oil, which is like a gooey black syrup, Parsons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea would be that this oil is already thick and viscous.  
If you get it down to these depths, about 5,000 feet, it will be 
very cold and under pressure, which will help immobilize it and 
contain it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans had not been made Tuesday to move the smaller 200-foot  
stern, or back portion of the fractured ship. 
</P>
<P>
	A salvage tug was expected to arrive early Wednesday to drag the  
ship's carcass out to sea.

<HEADLINE> Shares Slump at Telstra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Shares in Australia's  
telecommunications giant Telstra Corp. dipped Tuesday after the 
company appointed Ziggy Switkowski as its new chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	A nuclear physicist and an executive at Telstra for the past 18  
months, Switkowski replaces American Frank Blount on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year appointment comes after a lengthy national and  
international search and surprised some in the telephone industry, 
who had predicted Switkowski was out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	He was formerly chief executive at Optus Communications, now  
Cable and Wireless Optus, but left there in June 1997 after just 
one year on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later he joined Telstra as group managing director  
business and international. 
</P>
<P>
	Telstra shares slipped on news of the appointment, but investors  
were also digesting news that James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch had 
joined forces, through respective companies Publishing and 
Broadcasting Ltd. and News Ltd., to pump in more than 700 million 
Australian dollars ($448 million) into the smaller 
telecommunications company One.Tel. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal lifts One.Tel to be a significant new threat to  
existing carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Telstra were down 11 cents Australian (7 U.S. cents)  
at 8.29 Australian dollars ($5.30) at midday. 
</P>
<P>
	Telstra's battle to maintain its roughly 80 percent share of the  
telecommunications market in the face of aggressive new 
competitors, along with the further sale of Telstra shares to the 
public, are just some of the challenges Switkowski faces. The 
Australian government is currently a 66 percent shareholder in 
Telstra. 
</P>
<P>
	Switkowski made his name in corporate circles after a stellar 18  
year-career at the Australasian arm of Kodak, where from 1992-96 he 
was chairman and managing director. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry speculation on Blount's successor had more recently  
focused on Telstra's group managing director of finance Paul Rizzo, 
arguably more favored by the financial markets than Switkowski. 
</P>
<P>
	Telstra sources said Blount, a former executive with U.S.  
telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T, had always favored an Australian and 
an internal Telstra candidate to lead the company into the next 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Blount will return to the United States after seven years with  
Telstra, starting the modernization of the 100-year-old company.

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Defensive tackle James Jones, an unrestricted  
free agent who spent the past three seasons with the Baltimore 
Ravens, signed with the Detroit Lions on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 30, made 75 tackles in each of the past two seasons,  
highs in his eight-year NFL career. Last season he had 5.5 sacks 
for 41 yards, he forced a fumble and had a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Since entering the NFL out of Northern Iowa, Jones has played in  
128 games, making 108 starts, including starting all 16 
regular-season games in five seasons. He has 436 career tackles and 
27 career sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones played with the Denver Broncos in 1995 and with the  
Cleveland Browns from 1991-94. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal with the Lions were not announced.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Snowboarder? Socialite? Oscar de la Renta's  
newest look combines both. Even if his moneyed clientele never set 
foot past the bunny slopes, they'll be stepping out for soirees in 
fanciful, embroidered ball skirts -- with snow parkas. 
</P>
<P>
	As the fall fashion openings continued, de la Renta showed  
colorful eveningwear Tuesday that women could imagine in their 
wardrobes -- if home happens to include a Fifth Avenue drawing room. 
</P>
<P>
	Supermodel Naomi Campbell made the point with a fuchsia satin  
fur-trimmed parka, teamed with black embroidered evening pants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point of women dressing today is there are no  
(final) frontiers for what is for day or evening,'' de la Renta 
said after his show. ``Anoraks are versatile, great with a pair of 
jeans or an evening dress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At her Seventh Avenue showroom, Nicole Miller took a shine to  
techno-minded metalics. Narrow black evening separates sparkling 
with metal thread reflected Miller's vision of the future of 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fabric looks like a mirror. It's really modern, and we  
worked around the idea of newness,'' says Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the runways, Douglas Hannant, who never saw a garment  
that he couldn't wrap and drape, presented a fall collection that 
advanced the architectural buff's notions of ease of dressing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to eliminate all the closures, so they're clothes  
that are held together by straps with magnetic insets that wrap 
around the body,'' Hannant said. ``And I like the sounds of the 
magnet clicking to close. It's such an effortless way of putting on 
a garment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Notable was a black leather side wrap jacket that fastened with  
magnetic strap. An etiquette problem at airport metal detectors? 
</P>
<P>
	Hannant's jackets come with asymmetrical hems, such as his  
``bi-length skirts'' in brown wool that spiral below, or above, the 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the fashion circuit, on Monday evening, hip music  
makers Salt-N-Pepa, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Lou Reed, Debbie 
Harry and actor Damon Wayans turned out for Betsey Johnson's modern 
take on tattered street people of the Victorian era. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hands of the funky downtown designer, the  
vintage-inspired gear was hardly a study in restraint. Models 
strutted in lace-up corsets, bloomers, puffed-sleeved velvet gowns 
with trains, some nonchalantly torn and ragged. The look was 
Charles Dickens revisited -- with an avocado green runway and neon 
green headlights at a Mercedes Benz service station, where Johnson 
held her show. Models looked back-to-the-future with their black 
All-Star Converse sneakers and lime metallic eye shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not la-di-da Victorian richies,'' says Johnson. ``The  
clothes look the way the girls downtown really wear these 
clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, those who wear clothes, anyway. But one bare-breasted fan  
in the front row, drag performer Amanda Lepore, caused a photo 
frenzy by opting for near-nakedness. Besides her nude-color thong 
underpants and red stilettos, her ``outfit'' was nothing but tiny 
chains, a gift from Johnson. Indeed, Lepore's lack of clothes may 
have done more to promote Johnson's clothes than anything on her 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday evening, designer b Michael (lower case, no  
period please) traveled not quite so far back in time, pausing at 
the '40s, '50s and '60s to revamp ladylike fashions. 
</P>
<P>
	Pencil-slim skirts -- so-called for good reason -- worn below the  
knee with chinchilla-trimmed jackets recalled the days when Glenn 
Miller was ``In the Mood'' and FDR chatted by the fireside. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving up to the mod '60s, Michael sent out ``Jetson jackets,''  
orange mohair A-line coats, and black slingbacks that transported 
the audience back to the heyday of Jackie Kennedy and Audrey 
Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Polite and proper, top-handle bags, leather gloves, crystal  
brooches and a charming portrait hat completed the trip down memory 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when it's not in, those eras are still my inspiration,''  
says b Michael. ``The whole idea of dressing this way is modern.''

<HEADLINE> Judge May Probe Starr on Hubbell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Longtime presidential friend Webster Hubbell  
may get to delve into the inner workings of Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr's office to find out why the prosecutor waited so 
long before bringing a criminal case against him, a federal judge 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Robertson said he might conduct an  
evidentiary hearing to determine whether Starr's prosecutors 
prejudiced a fair trial for Hubbell by delaying charges for two 
years. Hubbell is accused in the November 1998 indictment of 
concealing his and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's roles in a 
fraudulent Arkansas land development. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's lawyers want the case dismissed, suggesting Starr's  
office held back the charges until a key witness, Hubbell's 
father-in-law, elderly businessman Seth Ward of Little Rock, Ark., 
was too ill to testify. Ward and the Clintons' Whitewater partner, 
Jim McDougal, co-owned a 1,000 parcel of property south of Little 
Rock called Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougal, who cooperated with Starr's office, died in prison  
last year and therefore cannot be cross-examined about the 
information he gave to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim McDougal died. Seth Ward is incompetent,'' and ``how do we  
build a record'' of the decision-making process on what led Starr 
to bring the charges, Robertson asked at a hearing of Hubbell's 
lawyers and Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell lawyer John Nields said a hearing is vital. However,  
prosecutor Jay Apperson contended Hubbell must first prove the 
delay was an effort to gain tactical advantage, and that high legal 
burden would make it difficult if not impossible for Hubbell's 
motion to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson rejected a separate motion by Hubbell that six of the  
15 charges against him be dismissed because they were covered by a 
1994 plea agreement in which Hubbell admitted defrauding some of 
his law firm's clients, including two federal regulatory agencies. 
He spent 1 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In the current indictment, Hubbell is accused of corruptly  
impeding the functions of those same two regulatory agencies, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third set of charges brought against Hubbell. He  
also is charged with tax evasion, a case that Robertson threw out 
but which an appeals court recently reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are overtones of double jeopardy here,'' Nields told  
Robertson. ``The law does not look sympathetically at the 
government for prosecuting'' someone ``over and over and over 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Castle Grande indictment alleges that Hubbell repeatedly  
failed to tell federal regulators his law firm had represented 
McDougal's failing savings and loan in the mid-1980s. As a result 
of that failure on disclosure, the government let Hubbell pursue 
work in which the law firm collected hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in fees from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Nields said Hubbell's firm represented the government  
``splendidly'' and that Hubbell's actions at most constituted 
``ethical violations.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar, Japanese Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's finance chief said Tuesday the government  
would move firmly to control long-term interest rates, triggering a 
rally in Tokyo stocks and sending the dollar soaring against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 177.92  
points, or 1.27 percent, to 14,232.64 points by the end of the 
afternoon session at 3 p.m. (1 a.m. EST). On Monday, the average 
closed up 81.03 points, or 0.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 748 to 369, while 167  
issues remained unchanged. Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo 
Stock Exchange was estimated at 399 million shares, up from 338.75 
million shares Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar bought 117.02 yen at 5 p.m. (3  
a.m. EST), up 2.94 yen from late Monday in Tokyo. U.S. markets were 
closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday. The dollar traded at 
between 115.60 yen and 117.50 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's advance came as Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa  
confirmed that the government plans to take aggressive steps to 
keep long-term interest rates in check in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a press conference, Miyazawa announced that the  
government will reduce the amount of 10-year government bond 
issuances to around 1.4 trillion yen ($12 billion) in March -- a cut 
of 400 billion yen ($3.42 billion) from recent levels. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the government will increase issues of  
shorter-dated debt by the same amount, increasing 2-year government 
bond issuances in March by 300 billion yen ($2.6 billion) and 
6-year bond issuances by 100 billion yen ($855 million). 
</P>
<P>
	``These steps should have a positive impact on long-term  
interest rates,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	High interest rates in Japan would strengthen the yen by  
attracting more investment in the currency. A pledge to lower rates 
would tend to make the yen weaker against foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency gained further momentum as it became clear  
that Japanese authorities -- including Vice Finance Minister for 
International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara -- weren't protesting the 
yen's fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Sakakibara has changed his policy,'' said Junichi  
Kodama, managing director and head of corporate foreign exchange 
sales at Chase Manhattan Bank in Tokyo. ``I think he's of the 
opinion that the priority is a recovery of Japan's economy and that 
exchange rate concerns can be put aside for the time being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was also boosted by news that the government has  
decided that the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau will 
temporarily resume its purchases of Japanese government bonds to 
bring interest rates down. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market was rocked recently when the bureau, which  
manages public pension funds and deposits from the country's 
massive postal savings system, announced it would discontinue 
purchases of government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates tend to reduce borrowing costs for  
companies, and could help spur economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.985 percent from Monday's finish of 2.140 percent, 
driving its price up to 98.54 yen from 97.35 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.16 yen, up from  
128.70 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, export-oriented auto issues such as Toyota  
Motor and Honda Motor led the way as investors were cheered up by 
the yen's retreat against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker yen tends to make Japanese exports cheaper aboard and  
thus more competitive, helping to boost earnings of export-led 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section added 6.66 points, or 0.61 percent, to 
1,101.68. The TOPIX closed up 5.49 points, or 0.50 percent, the day 
before.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. handily beat Wall  
Street expectations, earning $960 million, or 92 cents a share in 
its fiscal first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That compared to $929 million or 86 cents a share, in the  
year-ago period. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected 
the company to earn 83 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've achieved a good profit outcome despite softness in some  
of our businesses and weak revenue growth,'' said Hewlett-Packard 
president Lewis Platt on Tuesday. ``Our profit reflects the fact 
that we continue to tune our business models and cost structures. 
Manufacturing efficiencies have risen substantially, and we've kept 
tight controls on discretionary spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Platt said the company is still not meeting growth objectives.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to stay sharply focused on stimulating business while  
remaining sensitive to the need for careful expense management,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the three months ended Jan. 31 was $11.94 billion,  
compared with $11.82 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for the quarter were down 1 percent at $12.2 billion,  
compared with $12.4 billion in the same period last year. Orders in 
the United States fell 3 percent, to $5.2 billion. Orders from 
outside the United States remained steady at $7.1 billion.

<P>
	Protesters took hostages at the Greek missions in the  
Netherlands and Austria, but no injuries were reported. In cities 
across Europe, Kurds threatened to burn Greek embassies or 
consulates they occupied or set themselves afire. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan, leader of Kurdish guerrillas fighting for autonomy in  
Turkey, had been in the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, before 
Turkey announced his arrest. The circumstances of his arrest were 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	In a plush Hague neighborhood in the Netherlands, hundreds of  
angry Kurds forced their way through a police cordon and forced 
their way into the house of the Greek ambassador. They were holding 
three people hostage, including the envoy's wife and 8-year-old 
son, police spokeswoman Lineke Bennema said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Vienna, Kurds seized the Greek and Kenyan embassies today,  
and took the Greek ambassador and four others hostage at the Greek 
mission, police said. The ambassador was unharmed and in telephone 
contact with the Greek president, who is visiting Austria, the 
Austria Press Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 Kurdish demonstrators who occupied the Greek Embassy in  
Brussels, Belgium, today doused themselves with gasoline and 
threatened to set themselves on fire if police tried to drive them 
out, Belgian radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters, often armed with gasoline cans, threatened to burn  
the Greek consulate in Strasbourg, France, and the Kenyan consulate 
in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 40 protesters occupied the Greek Embassy in Moscow for  
several hours, leaving voluntarily after negotiations with the 
ambassador, the Russian news agency Interfax reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurds took control of diplomatic compounds in at least six  
German cities: Berlin, Bonn, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Hamburg and 
Duesseldorf. Kurds also occupied Greek diplomatic buildings in 
London; Marseilles, France; Stockholm, Sweden; and Zurich, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany has the largest Kurdish population in Western Europe,  
numbering 400,000 of its 2 million Turks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva today, a group of about 40 Kurdish protesters broke  
into the U.N. European headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	There were few large protests in Greece. Authorities had been  
given orders to immediately arrest any group of protesting Kurds, 
police sources said. At least 80 Kurds were reportedly detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Around Europe, security was increased at Greek institutions for  
fears of attacks or occupation attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos ordered Kurds to leave  
all Greek diplomatic areas or authorities would ``take appropriate 
action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greek authorities claim they lost sight of Ocalan on Monday  
after he left their embassy compound to travel to the Nairobi 
airport for a flight to the Netherlands, where his representatives 
had been conducting private negotiations for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Greek government ... granted him a place to stay in Kenya  
where he had traveled after his efforts to find permission to 
reside in various European countries,'' a government statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan has been on the run since he was forced to leave Syria  
last year under threat of military action by Turkey. After a brief 
stay in Russia, he spent two months in Italy, but left Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a protester set himself ablaze outside the Greek  
Parliament to demand the country grant Ocalan political asylum. And 
today in Denmark, a Kurdish woman was seriously burned when she set 
herself afire outside the Greek Embassy in Copenhagen.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Stocks End Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Enthusiasm for lower interest rates carried  
blue-chip stocks higher on Tuesday, but Nasdaq stocks took another 
beating amid concerns about computer-company earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended a volatile session 22.14  
points higher, at 9,297.03. The Dow shot up 112 points in the first 
hour as interest rates in the bond market declined. It retreated to 
a 15-point loss, then turned positive again in mid-afternoon. The 
index flitted between positive and negative for the remainder of 
the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader market was weaker. For the second session in a row,  
investors sold shares of Dell Computer over concerns that the 
personal computer maker's earnings, scheduled to be released after 
the close of trading Tuesday, would show a downturn in computer 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In its after-market report, Dell confirmed those worries even as  
profits soared. Dell shares fell 1 1/8 to 88 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 8.02 at  
2,313.87, after tumbling 83.66 points on Friday. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index fared better, closing up 11.74 at 1,241.87. 
</P>
<P>
	Some computer companies fared far better than Dell. Also after  
the close of trading, Hewlett-Packard reported net earnings of 92 
cents per share, soundly beating analysts' expectations of 83 
cents. Applied Materials reported earnings of 14 cents a share, 
beating estimates of 6 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard shares closed down 3/16 at 16 7/16. Applied  
Materials' shares closed at 67 7/8, up 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance in blue chips was sparked by a rally in U.S. bonds,  
after the Japanese minister of finance said the government will 
step up purchases of Japanese government bonds. The announcement 
pushed interest rates lower in Japan and boosted the Nikkei stock 
average by 1.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also supported the U.S. bond market, where the benchmark  
30-year bond was up $11.25 per $1,000 of valuation, pushing its 
yield down to 5.34 percent from late Friday's 5.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower rates on the 30-year bond sparked a strong rally in  
financial services stocks. Chase Manhattan shares gained 3 5/8, to 77 
11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was carried higher by Merck, which gained 3 7/16 to 153  
15/16. Merck and Johnson &AMP; Johnson announced that their joint 
Consumer Pharmaceuticals enterprise introduced an improved liquid 
formula of the popular Mylanta antacid. Johnson &AMP; Johnson's shares 
gained 2 to 86 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Wal-Mart rose 3 3/16 at 87 9/16, pulling other  
retail stocks with it, after its fourth-quarter earnings results 
beat analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	While investors, buoyed by the fattening of their stock  
portfolios, continue to make retail purchases at places like 
Wal-Mart at breakneck speed, there are signs that they are pulling 
back from their investments, said William Meehan, market strategist 
at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individuals seem to have curtailed their investment  
substantially over the last couple of weeks, and most portfolio 
managers have very little cash. What we have here is a situation 
where it's not really the economy that's driving the stock market, 
but the stock market that's driving the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other market action, the NYSE composite index rose 5.27 to  
586.73, and the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.28 
to 695.84. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.37 to 
396.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,550 to 1,539 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 473 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 792.65 million shares, down from 683.61  
million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, London's FT-SE 100 index gained 1.42  
percent, the DAX in Frankfurt rose 0.52 percent, but the CAC in 
Paris declined 0.32 percent.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles bolstered their wide  
receiving corps with the addition of free agents Charles Johnson 
and Torrance Small on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson signed a five-year deal worth $15 million, according to  
his agent, Joel Segal. Johnson, who played the last five seasons 
with the Pittsburgh Steelers, also will receive a $3 million 
signing bonus.

	``I'm on top of the world right now,'' said Johnson, who caught  
65 passes for 815 yards and seven touchdowns last year. ``This 
means a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small, who played with Indianapolis last season, signed a  
four-year deal worth $9 million, his agent Rich DeLuca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Small had 45 receptions for 681 yards and seven touchdowns last  
season. The seven-year veteran has also played for St. Louis and 
New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart's Quarterly Earnings Climb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s fourth-quarter  
earnings rose a better-than-expected 21 percent from a year ago as 
the world's largest retailer continued to attract shoppers with its 
affordable prices and wide selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart said Tuesday that it earned $1.56 billion, or 70 cents  
a share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, compared with $1.29 
billion, of 57 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $40.79 billion in the latest fourth quarter from  
$35.39 billion a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a year, a 
gauge retailers use to measure performance, were up 8.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates. Its  
stock closed up $3.18 3/4 at $87.56 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at Wal-Mart's U.S. discount stores and supercenters rose  
14 percent in the fourth quarter, while sales climbed 26 percent in 
its international division. Its Sam's Clubs warehouse stores saw a 
12 percent gain in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the quarter, the company operated 1,869 Wal-Mart  
discount stores, 564 supercenters which include grocery and 
discount stores, and 451 Sam's Clubs in the United States. 
Internationally, Wal-Mart has 13 stores in Argentina, 14 in Brazil, 
153 in Canada, 95 in Germany, 416 in Mexico, and 15 in Puerto Rico. 
It also has joint venture agreements in China and Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Wal-Mart earned $4.43 billion, or $1.98 a share,  
compared with $3.53 billion, or $1.56 a share, in the same period a 
year ago. Sales were $137.6 billion, compared with $117.96 billion 
a year ago.

<P>
	Today is Wednesday, Feb. 17, the 48th day of 1999. There are 317  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 17, 1801, the House of Representatives broke an  
electoral tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, electing 
Jefferson president. Burr became vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1817, a street in Baltimore became the first to be lighted  
with gas from America's first gas company. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1865, Columbia, S.C., burned as the Confederates evacuated  
and Union forces moved in. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1897, the forerunner of the National PTA, the National  
Congress of Mothers, was founded in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1933, Newsweek was first published.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1947, the Voice of America began broadcasting to the Soviet  
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that congressional districts  
within each state had to be roughly equal in population. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, President Nixon departed on his historic trip to China.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Lt. Col. William Higgins, an American officer serving  
with a United Nations truce monitoring group, was kidnapped in 
southern Lebanon. He was later slain by his captors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: Iran's President Ali Khamenei said Salman  
Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' could save himself from 
a death sentence pronounced by Ayatollah Khomeini if he were to 
apologize for his book, which was regarded as blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Bosnian Serbs began large-scale withdrawal of  
its heavy guns from the hills around Sarajevo under pressure from 
Russia. The U.S. government reported a record trade deficit with 
Japan the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: President Clinton, preparing Americans for  
possible air strikes against Iraq, said military force is never the 
first answer ``but sometimes it's the only answer.'' A jury in Fort 
Worth, Texas, convicted former Naval Academy midshipman Diane 
Zamora of killing a 16-year-old romantic rival. An Iranian crowd 
cheered as U.S. wrestlers carried the Stars and Stripes into an 
international meet in Tehran. The U.S. women's hockey team won the 
gold medal at Nagano, Japan, defeating Canada 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Birthdays: Actress Kathleen Freeman is 80. Margaret  
Truman Daniel is 75. Actor Hal Holbrook is 74. Singer Bobby Lewis 
is 66. Actor Alan Bates is 65. Country singer-songwriter Johnny 
Bush is 64. Football Hall-of-Famer Jim Brown is 63. Actress Mary

<P>
	While high pressure off the coast of the Carolinas was set to  
protect most of the East Coast from harsh weather today, damp air 
from the Pacific Ocean was pounding the West coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Partly cloudy skies and dry weather were forecast to extend from  
northern New England, south through the Carolinas, and into the 
rest of the Southeast. Most of the Plains also were expected to 
remain dry. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain showers were likely from the Great Lakes, south through the  
Ohio Valley, and into the western Gulf Coast states. A few 
thunderstorms were forecast over the lower Mississippi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	By afternoon, the rain was predicted to change into snow in the  
western Great Lakes. Areas from Minnesota to Michigan also could 
get sleet and snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain was forecast to batter much of the West as an area of  
low pressure and a trailing cold front brings wet snow from the 
eastern Rockies to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain was expected from the coastal areas of Washington, south  
into central California and into the Rockies. Snow was likely from 
the Cascades and northern Sierra-Nevadas, east into the Bitterroots 
of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Windy conditions also will develop along the Northwest coast.  
Wind gusts by afternoon were predicted to exceed 40 mph. Wyoming 
and Montana were expected to inherit much of the wet weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The hottest spot in the lower 48 states on Monday was McAllen,  
Texas, with a high reading of 79 degrees. The coldest place was 
Clayton Lake, Maine, with a low of 20 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's temperatures should range from the 20s in the northern  
Plains to 70s in the desert Southwest and the Texas coast, with 
readings elsewhere in the 30s for northern New England, the Great 
Lakes and northern Rockies, the 40s for the central Plains, central 
Rockies and Southwest, the 50s for New Jersey, the Northwest and 
the southern Plains, and the 60s for the Ohio Valley, California 
coast, the Southeast and the Mississippi Valley.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Gets Year Off to Good Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Jeff Gordon thinks winning a Daytona  
500 is almost as satisfying as capturing the Winston Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's to say he won't get both in 1999?  
</P>
<P>
	Gordon and his Rainbow Warriors got the year off to a perfect  
start by outdueling Dale Earnhardt down the stretch to win NASCAR's 
biggest race Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, Gordon turned his winning car over to be displayed  
at an exhibit next door to the track. Then, he started looking 
forward to the chase for a third-straight Winston Cup series title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We not only got the Daytona 500 win, but we got that first win  
of the season out of the way,'' Gordon said. ``It's so important to 
get that first win. After last season was over, you go, `Boy, do we 
have what it takes to get to victory lane again next year? Are we 
going to be a championship contender?' I'm still not sure about the 
championship part, but we definitely have one win out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what a victory it was.  
</P>
<P>
	A day later, Gordon was still putting the pieces together,  
trying to explain the thought process he used to muster a late 
chase through the pack that produced a scintillating final dash to 
the finish with Earnhardt on his bumper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is planned,'' Gordon said. ``I wish I could plan  
passes, but you never know when you're going to get a run on a 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the passing was over, Gordon had only one, daunting  
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	With Earnhardt bearing down, Gordon held him off with moves he  
had learned over his decade-plus of racing -- some by watching The 
Intimidator himself -- and ruined Earnhardt's hopes for a 
second-straight Daytona 500 title. 
</P>
<P>
	It could go down as the best finish in the 41-year history of  
the race. Even Gordon said he didn't fully understand the impact it 
had until well after the race was complete. 
</P>
<P>
	``You realize when you pick up the paper the next day how big an  
event this actually is,'' he said. ``It's not just an auto race, 
but an event that millions of people watch. To pull off a big win 
like that is exciting, especially because of the way it came down 
to Dale Earnhardt and myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon won his third straight race, dating to last year. One  
event into the season, it seems all the pieces are in place to 
match last year's 13-victory mark, which tied Richard Petty for the 
most wins in the modern era. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon also got a big jump on surpassing last year's record $9.3  
million in earnings. He took home a $2.1 million paycheck that 
included a $1 million sponsor bonus.

<P>
	After he said good-bye to Daytona, he boarded a Lear jet and  
traveled to New York, where he was scheduled for television 
appearances with David Letterman and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I realized how big an event the Daytona 500 was  
until I won it the first time in 1997,'' Gordon said. ``You go on a 
whirlwind tour. You go to New York, you go do the Letterman show 
and all the media things and they treat you like a king.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a magical day in Daytona, it was clear that Gordon had earned  
the title.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Middle Age Enjoyable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Far from being a time of failing health, personal  
turmoil and the ``midlife crisis,'' middle age for many is the most 
fulfilling time of life, according to new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year study sponsored by the John D. and Catherine T.  
MacArthur Foundation, made public in several news reports today, 
undermines many beliefs about middle age. 
</P>
<P>
	``The surprising thing is that midlife may be the best time, the  
best place to be,'' social psychologist Orville Gilbert Brim told 
the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have this public image of midlife being full of stress,  
but, in fact, (midlifers') sense of control is good and their sense 
of well-being is good,'' said Brim, director of the MacArthur 
Foundation's Network on Successful Midlife Development and 
president of Life Trends Inc., a Florida-based consulting business 
hired by MacArthur to conduct the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The MacArthur Foundation said the study is the largest ever done  
on midlife. It involved interviews with more than 3,000 people who 
answered more than 1,100 questions. 
</P>
<P>
	One myth the study demolished was that of the middle-aged man  
who abandons his family in favor of a red sports car and a woman 
half his age -- the proverbial midlife crisis. Nine out of 10 people 
surveyed in the study said they never experienced one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normal people recognize that the lifespan, regardless of age,  
brings change and that a healthy response to change is to make the 
necessary adjustments that are required,'' Brim said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study results also indicated that menopause was not a  
traumatizing life event for most women. 
</P>
<P>
	``For most middle-aged women, menopause is a benign experience,  
a far cry from the view of many contemporary writers,'' said Alice 
Rossi, professor emerita of sociology at the University of 
Massachusetts in Amherst. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 70 percent of the people in the study considered  
themselves in excellent health -- though one warning sign was that 
few said they worked hard at it, raising questions about health 
farther along in life. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority said they had no problems with arthritis,  
backaches, skin problems, indigestion, constipation, depression, 
gum disease, high blood pressure or migraines. 
</P>
<P>
	Respondents, however, felt they didn't have enough of two  
things: sex and money. 
</P>
<P>
	But while there may be less satisfaction with sex in midlife,  
there is growing satisfaction with marriage and relationships. 
Seventy-two percent of the respondents rated their relationships as 
very good to excellent and 90 percent said they thought it was 
unlikely that their relationship would break up. 
</P>
<P>
	Midlife ``has purpose, meaning and goals to live for,'' said  
Carol Ryff, a University of Wisconsin social psychologist, one of 
28 researchers who took part in the study. ``You have quality 
relationships with other people, and you are able to realize your 
talent and potential as a human being. I would call it having a 
good life.''

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Black Panther Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A state appeals court refused Tuesday to  
reinstate the murder conviction of former Black Panther Elmer 
``Geronimo'' Pratt, overturned by a judge because of revelations 
that a prosecution witness hid that he was a police informer. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt, now free on bail, served 27 years in prison for the 1968  
robbery and fatal shooting of schoolteacher Caroline Olsen on a 
Santa Monica tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed he was in Oakland for Black Panther meetings when she  
was killed, and that FBI agents and police hid and possibly 
destroyed wiretap evidence that would prove it. He blamed the 
arrest on a campaign by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI against the Black 
Panthers and other perceived enemies of the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Everett Dickey granted him a new trial in June 1997,  
saying the credibility of prosecution witness Julius Butler, who 
had quoted Pratt as confessing, could have been undermined if the 
jury had known of his relationship with law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler denied he was an informant. Evidence discovered later by  
Pratt's lawyers showed, among other things, that he was listed on 
the district attorney's files as an informant and that a prosecutor 
had agreed to let him avoid jail for four felonies. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Gil Garcetti's office appealed the ruling,  
arguing that the other evidence against Pratt, including two 
eyewitnesses, was so strong that he would have been convicted 
without Butler's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 2nd District Court of Appeal, in a 3-0 ruling, said it  
was ``unable to profess confidence in a guilty verdict based solely 
on evidence unconnected to Butler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juliana Drous, a lawyer for Pratt, said the ruling should end  
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The courts have done the right thing,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney said he's reviewing the case and would be  
unable to comment until Wednesday, spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin 
said.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Faces Sexual Assault Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman may end up spending more time  
in civil court than on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge on Tuesday refused to dismiss a lawsuit filed against  
the flamboyant Rodman by cocktail waitress Susan Patterson. She 
claims Rodman jammed a $100 bill down her blouse and grabbed her 
breast. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Susan Isacoff agreed with Ms. Patterson's  
attorney, Gloria Allred, that the allegations represented 
``outrageous conduct'' and allowed the suit to proceed. But the 
judge deleted any mention of previous sexual assault lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view the result of today's court proceedings as a  
significant victory,'' said Rich Howell, Rodman's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers are in negotiations with the former  
Chicago Bulls star, who is currently without a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may end up spending a significant amount of time in a Los  
Angeles court,'' Ms. Allred said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks More Hurricane Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration asked Congress  
Tuesday for an emergency package of $956 million to rebuild Central 
America from Hurricane Mitch, one of the worst disasters ever to 
strike the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, which killed more than 9,000 people and caused about  
$8.5 billion in damage, came ``out of nowhere'' last fall and wiped 
out so many hopes and dreams in the region, said first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be friends and partners in rebuilding those dreams  
and hopes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton and Tipper Gore, both of whom toured Central  
America after the hurricane as President Clinton's official 
emissaries, announced the package at the White House. They stressed 
that it was assembled in close consultation with Republicans on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This looks like we thought it would,'' said Elizabeth Morra,  
spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee. ``We'd like to 
pass it as quickly as possible. Mid-March is about the earliest we 
could get it to the House floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president is scheduled to tour Central America March 8-11.  
</P>
<P>
	Supplementing the $300 million already provided for immediate  
disaster relief in the region, the proposed package would primarily 
help Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala rebuild 
schools, homes, roads and sanitation systems destroyed by Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The package also includes $50 million to Haiti, the Dominican  
Republic and other Caribbean nations rebuilding from Hurricane 
Georges, plus $10 million to help victims of the recent Colombian 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to ensure a swift, unencumbered enactment of the spending  
bill, Clinton planned to submit separate legislation to enhance the 
Caribbean Basin Initiative and lower trade barriers in the region. 
``The CBI is a critical tool for the rebuilding of Central 
America,'' said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $300 million in U.S. assistance provided so far,  
administration officials said, $150 million was spent to maintain 
about 5,000 U.S. troops stationed in the region, $120 million was 
used for food and $30 million for relief to health clinics and for 
other activities.

<HEADLINE> Marv Albert Signs With Turner Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After nearly 18 months off, Marv Albert's career  
is back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert agreed Monday to a multiyear contract with Turner Sports  
to broadcast NBA games and other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired by NBC in 1997 after pleading guilty to biting a  
woman during a sexual encounter in a Virginia hotel room. His 
record was cleared after fulfilling the terms of his probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the darkest hours, I had no idea what would unfold in my  
life,'' Albert said. ``But I had to get past that. A year ago, I 
was just wondering if I'd get back, but I think everything has 
turned out well in the long run when you look at my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert will likely make his debut on TNT's broadcast of the Los  
Angeles Lakers game at Phoenix on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
	He can only hope that the reaction nationally will be as  
positive as it has been locally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has been so favorable in New York at the games and  
walking on the street,'' Albert said at a news conference in 
Madison Square Garden. ``I just hope it continues and people 
continue to react that way, but it's out of my control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert worked his first NBA game in nearly 20 months on Feb. 8,  
when he called the Knicks home opener on radio for the Madison 
Square Garden Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans lined up for autographs and voiced their support for  
Albert's return. 
</P>
<P>
	He will work six regular season games this season for Turner  
with analyst Reggie Theus, then will be placed in the regular 
announcing rotation during the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert might be paired with different partners during the  
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hiring is a step in the right direction for Marv to make a  
strong comeback,'' said Turner analyst and former NBA coach Hubie 
Brown. ``It also adds another quality announcer to our stable of 
people. The way people should look at it is that Turner is giving 
him a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next season, Albert will become a fulltime member of  
the Turner on-air staff, announcing a full slate of about 25 
regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that Marv is one of the top play-by-play announcers in  
the business,'' Turner Sports executive producer Mike Pearl said. 
``The concerns we had were that he was taking care of himself on a 
personal note. We have the confidence in our decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Albert's games on Turner this season will come on Friday  
nights on TNT in order to accommodate his obligations with Madison 
Square Garden, which will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy with this situation,'' Albert said. ``I don't  
know what's in store down the road. I'm just so thrilled to be 
doing NBA on national basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert returned to New York's MSG in September as a weeknight  
anchor its wrap-up show, ``SportsDesk.'' Besides NBA games, he also 
may work boxing for Turner along with the 2001 Goodwill Games and 
possibly the pro football league Turner and NBC are planning to 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's last national telecast was the NBA Finals in 1997 with  
NBC, where he worked for 20 years. Later that year, after the 
trial, he was fired by NBC and resigned from the MSG Network. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be great to see Marv return to television and work in  
the sport he loves,'' NBC spokesman Ed Markey said. ``We're happy 
to have him back as part of the NBA family.''

<HEADLINE> American Flights Nearly All Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Operations at American Airlines are expected to be  
almost normal today, a sharp contrast to the past 10 days during 
which more than 6,000 flights were canceled due to a pilot sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth-based airline has canceled only 17 flights  
scheduled for today, spokesman John Hotard said. 
</P>
<P>
	American's parent company, AMR Corp., and the Allied Pilots  
Association have begun negotiating again over the integration of 
the recently purchased Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks broke down earlier this month over a dispute over how the  
Reno pilots were being paid caused pilots to start calling in sick 
and refusing to work overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 800 of American's 9,400 pilots were still listed as  
sick Monday, compared to the nearly 2,500 who declared themselves 
unfit to fly Thursday and Friday, American officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, pilots have been taking themselves off  
the sick list at a rapid rate since Saturday after a federal judge 
ruled held the union and two top board members in contempt and 
promised sizable fines against them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 -- or roughly 11 percent -- of the 2,250 flights  
scheduled were canceled Monday because some pilots weren't 
immediately available for flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotard compared the impact on the airline's flight system to bad  
weather over the airline's Chicago, Miami or Dallas-Fort Worth 
hubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pilots complained that the number of pilots on the sick  
list could have been inflated because they had been trying to 
remove themselves, but normal procedures were suspended. Instead, 
they were told they had to meet with their chief medical officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotard said that was true for only 12 or 13 pilots who face  
possible disciplinary action for flying as passengers while they 
were on the sick list. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall threatened a ``significant''  
fine against the pilots' union Saturday, saying that the union did 
not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after he 
ordered the union to end the sickout last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge required the union place $10 million, or one-quarter  
of the union's net worth, with the court in preparation of making 
his final decision this Wednesday. He also ordered union president 
Rich LaVoy and vice president Brian Mayhew to remit a total of 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 6,000 flights have been canceled since the work action  
began, costing American between $67 million and $90 million, 
according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR Corp. The final 
total has not been projected. 
</P>
<P>
	American also will see revenue reductions in the future. The  
airline said it will reduce its schedule 2 percent in the spring, 
or about 45-50 flights a day, because it does not believe pilots 
will volunteer for extra overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute is over how Reno Air pilots have been paid since AMR  
took control of the low-cost carrier last December. AMR wants to 
pay the pilots higher rates as they are retrained, but the union 
believes their contract guarantees the pilots are paid more from 
the purchase date. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot is paid. AMR said the pilot union's 
demands to add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale quickly would 
cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said the sickout had not changed their original  
negotiating positions. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, neither the company or union has requested a federal  
mediator or binding arbitration in the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules on Rodman Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A cocktail waitress who accused Dennis Rodman  
of grabbing her breast cannot mention previous lawsuits against him 
in her own suit, a judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the woman, Susan Patterson, did win a ruling that allows her  
to keep a claim of emotional distress in her lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson, who works at the Fenix in the Argyle Hotel in West  
Hollywood, also accused Rodman of assault, battery, negligence and 
false imprisonment. She sued on Nov. 10, five weeks after she says 
she was assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawsuit cited assault claims by other women in Nevada and  
Utah, but the judge granted a request to delete mention of them in 
the Patterson case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope it sends a message that the focus is not going to be  
on what happened in these other lawsuits,'' said Rich Howell, 
Rodman's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Chicago Bulls star, who appears close to signing with  
the Los Angeles Lakers, is accused of jamming a $100 bill down 
Patterson's blouse and grabbing her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman pursued her into a corner and continued lunging at her  
even after she folded into a fetal position, the suit says. She 
finally got away by crawling into the kitchen area, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson seeks general and punitive damages, which would be  
determined at trial. No date was set.

<HEADLINE>  Browns Get Bills LB Chris Spielman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Chris Spielman had always learned life's  
lessons in the weight room and on the football field. Then his 
wife, Stefanie, was diagnosed with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending most of his adulthood knocking 250-pound  
fullbacks on their backsides, Spielman was confronted by an 
opponent he didn't know how to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	So he quit playing last season for the Buffalo Bills to be with  
his family, and the Spielmans took on the disease the only way they 
knew how: head on. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefanie Spielman is now cancer free, and her husband is  
returning to football as a member of the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned what real courage is from her,'' Spielman said  
Tuesday. ``What real toughness is, and what unconditional love is. 
You don't know what stress is until you're waiting for a biopsy 
report. That's stress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns acquired the 33-year-old Spielman on  
Tuesday for past considerations. Spielman hasn't played a down in 
the NFL since 1997 following neck surgery and his one-season 
sabbatical to care for his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics are wondering what the former Pro Bowl linebacker might  
have left. Go ahead and wonder, Spielman warns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people might look at it as a gamble,'' he said. ``But  
anyone who has ever bet against me in football has lost. It's 
irrelevant what anybody else thinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, who also signed free agent offensive tackle Orlando  
Brown and cornerback Corey Fuller on Tuesday, are banking on 
Spielman providing them with solid linebacking and leadership for 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the kind of player any coach would want,'' said Browns  
coach Chris Palmer. ``He's a winner with an intense desire to 
excel'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman's Ohio roots instantly make him the new Browns' star.  
He's played every snap as if it was his last throughout a career 
that began in Massillon, Ohio and continued at Ohio State. Stories 
of his workout regime as well as his pregame preparation rituals 
are already part of this state's football lore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be home,'' he said. ``I'm a Northeast Ohio guy.  
I'm about as Northeast Ohio as you can get. Steel mill or whatever 
you want to call it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, drafted in the second round by Detroit in 1988, played  
eight seasons and made four Pro Bowls for the Lions. He was signed 
as a free agent by the Bills in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I seem to have a problem getting off Lake Erie,'' he said.  
``From Detroit to Buffalo to Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman was limited to just nine games in 1997 when his season  
was cut short by his neck injury. And then as he prepared to 
return, Stefanie got cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	For Spielman the decision to become a stay-at-home-daddy was an  
easy one. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't do the things I did for my family last year I  
wouldn't be a man,'' he said. ``I did what was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Stefanie lost her hair during chemotherapy, Spielman shaved  
his head so she wouldn't feel alone. And to deal with the stress, 
Spielman would drive over to Ohio State from his home in Columbus 
to work out. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks during the time off he was able to improve his speed  
and quickness, and thinks he's in better shape than when he left 
football. And as for his neck, and the pounding it will take, 
Spielman isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never be the player I despise,'' he said. ``If I ever  
ducked a hit, I'd give my money back and walk off the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman said he hopes play out the three years remaining on the  
contract that transferred over from the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to put limits on myself,'' said Spielman, who has  
coaching aspirations. ``I think I can fulfill my contract here at a 
high level but after that I don't know. I want to give them 
everything I can for three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a 6-foot-7, 350-pound tackle nicknamed ``Zeus,'' will be  
the second former Browns player to return to Cleveland. Last week, 
the Browns used their final expansion draft pick to select 
cornerback Antonio Langham. Brown, who has reportedly signed a 
seven-year, $26 million deal, gives the Browns three young, quality 
offensive linemen. The 28-year-old will join guard Jim Pyne and 
center Dave Wohlabaugh, the former Patriot, who signed a 
seven-year, $26.25 million contract Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``My name is Zeus,'' said Brown, who first came to the Browns as  
an undrafted free agent in 1993. ``I'm ready to play ball, bang 
some heads and get some Ws (wins). I'm glad to be back. I missed 
the Dawg Pound.''

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. earned $960 million  
in its fiscal first quarter, exceeding Wall Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest computer company said Tuesday it  
earned 92 cents a share, compared to 86 cents, or $929 million, in 
last year's first-quarter mark. Analysts surveyed by First Call 
Corp. had expected the company to earn 83 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've achieved a good profit outcome despite softness in some  
of our businesses and weak revenue growth,'' said Hewlett-Packard 
president Lewis Platt. ``Our profit reflects the fact that we 
continue to tune our business models and cost structures. 
Manufacturing efficiencies have risen substantially, and we've kept 
tight controls on discretionary spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Platt said the company is still not meeting growth objectives.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to stay sharply focused on stimulating business while  
remaining sensitive to the need for careful expense management,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter was $11.94 billion, compared with $11.82  
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for the quarter were down 1 percent at $12.2 billion,  
compared with $12.4 billion in the same period last year. Orders in 
the United States fell 3 percent, to $5.2 billion. Orders from 
outside the United States remained steady at $7.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were released after stock markets had closed for  
the day. Before the announcement, Hewlett-Packard shares fell 
$5.93 3/4 to close at $70.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  Browns Get Bills LB Chris Spielman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Chris Spielman had always learned life's  
lessons in the weight room and on the football field. Then his 
wife, Stefanie, was diagnosed with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending most of his adulthood knocking 250-pound  
fullbacks on their backsides, Spielman was confronted by an 
opponent he didn't know how to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	So he quit playing last season for the Buffalo Bills to be with  
his family, and the Spielmans took on the disease the only way they 
knew how: head on. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefanie Spielman is now cancer free, and her husband is  
returning to football as a member of the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned what real courage is from her,'' Spielman said  
Tuesday. ``What real toughness is, and what unconditional love is. 
You don't know what stress is until you're waiting for a biopsy 
report. That's stress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns acquired the 33-year-old Spielman on  
Tuesday for past considerations. Spielman hasn't played a down in 
the NFL since 1997 following neck surgery and his one-season 
sabbatical to care for his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics are wondering what the former Pro Bowl linebacker might  
have left. Go ahead and wonder, Spielman warns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people might look at it as a gamble,'' he said. ``But  
anyone who has ever bet against me in football has lost. It's 
irrelevant what anybody else thinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, who also signed free agent offensive tackle Orlando  
Brown and cornerback Corey Fuller on Tuesday, are banking on 
Spielman providing them with solid linebacking and leadership for 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the kind of player any coach would want,'' said Browns  
coach Chris Palmer. ``He's a winner with an intense desire to 
excel'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman's Ohio roots instantly make him the new Browns' star.  
He's played every snap as if it was his last throughout a career 
that began in Massillon, Ohio and continued at Ohio State. Stories 
of his workout regime as well as his pregame preparation rituals 
are already part of this state's football lore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be home,'' he said. ``I'm a Northeast Ohio guy.  
I'm about as Northeast Ohio as you can get. Steel mill or whatever 
you want to call it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, drafted in the second round by Detroit in 1988, played  
eight seasons and made four Pro Bowls for the Lions. He was signed 
as a free agent by the Bills in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I seem to have a problem getting off Lake Erie,'' he said.  
``From Detroit to Buffalo to Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman was limited to just nine games in 1997 when his season  
was cut short by his neck injury. And then as he prepared to 
return, Stefanie got cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	For Spielman the decision to become a stay-at-home-daddy was an  
easy one. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't do the things I did for my family last year I  
wouldn't be a man,'' he said. ``I did what was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Stefanie lost her hair during chemotherapy, Spielman shaved  
his head so she wouldn't feel alone. And to deal with the stress, 
Spielman would drive over to Ohio State from his home in Columbus 
to work out. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks during the time off he was able to improve his speed  
and quickness, and thinks he's in better shape than when he left 
football. And as for his neck, and the pounding it will take, 
Spielman isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never be the player I despise,'' he said. ``If I ever  
ducked a hit, I'd give my money back and walk off the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman said he hopes play out the three years remaining on the  
contract that transferred over from the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to put limits on myself,'' said Spielman, who has  
coaching aspirations. ``I think I can fulfill my contract here at a 
high level but after that I don't know. I want to give them 
everything I can for three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a 6-foot-7, 350-pound tackle nicknamed ``Zeus,'' will be  
the second former Browns player to return to Cleveland. Last week, 
the Browns used their final expansion draft pick to select 
cornerback Antonio Langham. Brown, who has reportedly signed a 
seven-year, $26 million deal, gives the Browns three young, quality 
offensive linemen. The 28-year-old will join guard Jim Pyne and 
center Dave Wohlabaugh, the former Patriot, who signed a 
seven-year, $26.25 million contract Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``My name is Zeus,'' said Brown, who first came to the Browns as  
an undrafted free agent in 1993. ``I'm ready to play ball, bang 
some heads and get some Ws (wins). I'm glad to be back. I missed 
the Dawg Pound.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise on Japan's Move / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices jumped Tuesday as efforts by  
Japanese authorities to lower interest rates lifted demand for 
dollars and U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond soared 1 5/32  
points, or $11.56 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, tumbled to 5.34 percent from 5.42 
percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. financial markets were closed Monday for the Presidents Day  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest effort to stimulate a moribund economy, Japanese  
leaders announced measures Tuesday to reverse a sharp decline in 
Japanese government bond prices that had forced long-term interest 
rates higher, raising the cost of borrowing money. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government  
would cut back its sales of 10-year bonds in favor of bonds with 
shorter maturities. A public pension fund agency also said it would 
resume buying government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures to keep long-term interest rates from rising too  
high cheered investors. The Japanese Nikkei stock index rose 1.3 
percent, Japanese bond prices rallied, and the dollar jumped 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Treasury bonds also rose as fears eased that large Japanese  
institutional investors would be tempted to sell U.S. Treasurys in 
favor of high-yielding Japanese bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were up between 1/32  
point and 1/16 point, and intermediate maturities were up 3/32 
point to 11/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.96 
to 1,295.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.54 percent as the  
discount rose 0.02 percentage point from Friday to 4.44 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.62 percent, as the discount rose 0.04 
percentage point to 4.46 percent. One-year yields were 4.70 percent 
as the discount fell by 0.01 percentage point to 4.49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.13 percent from 4.75 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 15/16 from 124 27/32 late Friday 
The average yield to maturity rose to 5.16 percent from 5.15 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Team Signs Willie Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pitcher Willie Banks, let go by the Arizona  
Diamondbacks in December, agreed Tuesday to a one-year contract 
with the Orix Blue Wave of Japan's Pacific League, a deal worth 
about $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, a right-hander who turns 30 on Feb. 27, was 1-1 with a  
10.05 ERA in 14 1-3 innings of relief for the New York Yankees, who 
traded him to Arizona on June 4 for pitchers Scott Brow and Joe 
Lisio. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks went 1-2 with a 3.09 ERA and one save in 33 relief  
appearances with the Diamondbacks, who failed to offer him a 1999 
contract by the Dec. 20 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his professional career after Minnesota selected him  
with the third pick of the first round of the 1987 June amateur 
draft. He has a 31-38 career record in 147 career appearances in 
the major leagues with Minnesota, the Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles, 
Florida, the Yankees and Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Dell Quarterly Profit Jumps 49 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. posted a 49 percent jump in  
quarterly profit Tuesday but sales fell short of Wall Street 
predictions as Dell lost customers to rival sellers of lower-priced 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The revenue disappointment was unusual for Dell, the  
third-largest seller of computers that has set a scorching industry 
pace with its unconventional tactic of selling machines directly to 
customers and avoiding the middleman. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell has held fast with its strategy of refusing to compete on  
price with other major makers, such as Compaq Computer Corp. and 
International Business Machines Corp. Instead, Dell has focused on 
higher-end machines with bigger margins, managing to post 
consistently strong income even as rivals' narrowed. 
</P>
<P>
	That strategy resulted in a profit of $425 million, or 31 cents  
a share, meeting analysts' forecasts for the company's fourth 
quarter, ended Jan. 29. That was up from a profit of $285 million, 
or 20 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That increase was partly due to slower rate of cost increases in  
the quarter as revenue grew only 38 percent, to $5.17 billion from 
$3.74 billion. That was about $200 million less than analyst 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have been more aggressive in pricing in our  
product,'' Dell chief financial officer Thomas Meredith said in a 
phone interview from the company's Round Rock, Texas headquarters. 
He said the company may become a more vigorous cost cutter as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's results were released Tuesday after the close of  
financial markets, where Dell's stock fell $1.12 1/2 a share to $88.75 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell was able to hold the line on higher costs in part by  
boosting its Internet business, which requires fewer staff than 
conventional sales. Dell sold $14 million a day in computers over 
the Internet in the quarter, up from $10 million daily the quarter 
before, Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dell's full fiscal year, profit grew 55 percent to $1.46  
billion, or $1.05 a share, from $944 million, or 64 cents a share. 
Revenue rose to $18.24 billion from $12.33 billion.

	SHALIMAR, Fla. (AP) -- A man accused of hitting another motorist  
in the head with a golf club during a traffic dispute was sentenced 
to four years in prison. The victim died six weeks after the 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
	David Adams, 20, was sentenced Monday for striking Dale McElheny  
with a 5-iron in 1997. McElheny, 42, died after mixing alcohol with 
a drug he had been taking to control seizures during his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The two had argued in the parking lot of a convenience store  
after Adams made a U-turn in front of McElheny's car. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams pleaded no contest to second-degree murder last month. He  
could have gotten five years in prison.

not for the beating.

<HEADLINE> Increase Seen in Seat Belt Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The percentage of Americans wearing seat belts  
increased in 1998, the year police made widespread efforts to 
enforce seat belt laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of seat-belt users last year jumped from 62.2  
percent to 65.1 percent around the Memorial Day holiday, and from 
69.6 percent to 70.1 percent around the Thanksgiving holiday, the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report 
issued today. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two spikes coincided with weeklong crackdowns in which  
4,000 law enforcement agencies erected checkpoints and ticketed 
drivers who were not wearing seat belts. They also broke a 
three-year trend in which national seat belt usage hovered in the 
60 percent range. 
</P>
<P>
	Under laws in 14 states and the District of Columbia, police can  
pull over drivers for not wearing their seat belt. Under more 
widespread secondary laws, police can ticket drivers for not 
wearing a seat belt only if they have been pulled over for some 
other reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say primary laws are needed because seat belt use  
does not increase otherwise, and because research shows parents who 
do not wear seat belts themselves are more likely to leave their 
children unbuckled. Car accidents are the No. 1 killer of children 
14 and under. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we know what's killing our kids and we're not applying the  
medicine, shame on us as a nation for not acting,'' said Janet 
Dewey, executive director of the Air Bag &AMP; Seat Belt Safety 
Campaign. The group, sponsored by the auto industry and insurance 
companies, works in conjunction with the Transportation Department 
and the highway safety administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign announced Monday it was sending children to 11  
Statehouses across the country to lobby governors and legislative 
leaders for primary laws. It also planned lobbying campaigns in 
Florida, Ohio, Alabama, Illinois, Virginia and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Seat belt statistics have traditionally been unreliable. Some  
states measure usage by all drivers, while others check only car 
drivers and not those in trucks or sports-utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  
had an independent firm scientifically measure seat belt usage 
around the crackdowns. Two sets of surveys were conducted, one 
before and after Memorial Day and the other around the Thanksgiving 
holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	They showed a cumulative increase from 62.2 percent before  
Memorial Day to 70.1 percent after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	In surveys completed by the same firm in 1994 and 1996, the  
safety administration found seat belt usage to be 58.9 percent and 
61 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> MacWorld Won't Return to Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The popular MacWorld computer trade show won't be  
returning to Boston, costing the city millions of dollars in lost 
tourism revenue, organizers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A fixture in Boston for nearly 15 years, the trade show  
relocated to New York last summer after outgrowing Boston's hotel 
and convention space. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the New York convention, organizers said they would  
return to Boston in 1999, and scheduled the event for Aug. 3-6 at 
the World Trade Center, Seaport Hotel and the Hynes Veterans 
Memorial Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to return to Boston was made in part because New  
York's Jacob Javits Center didn't originally have space available 
for late summer 1999, when MacWorld wanted to schedule it. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past few weeks, however, Javits space opened up and the  
show will now be held there July 21-23, said Nicole Derany, 
MacWorld show director for Norwood-based IDG Expo Management Co., 
the event's organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love Boston and the city of Boston has been very helpful,''  
Derany said Tuesday. But organizers wanted to keep the show all 
under one roof -- something Boston was unable to provide, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer has been enjoying a recent resurgence in  
popularity with its colorful iMac computers and organizers are 
hoping for a large turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came as a huge disappointment, said Patrick  
Moscaritolo, president of the Greater Boston Convention and 
Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated 25,000 MacWorld visitors would have generated some  
$20 million in revenues for Boston area hotels, restaurants, retail 
stores, taxi drivers and laborers who would have set up the 
convention space, Moscaritolo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like taking a huge boulder and throwing it into a very  
small stream and seeing the ripple impact. That's what it means in 
terms of our visitor economy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake's Gifts to USOC Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gifts to U.S. Olympic Committee officials during  
Salt Lake's efforts to be the American bidder for the Winter Games 
are under investigation by an elite ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure, in a letter, was the first public sign of the  
direction of the inquiry, one of six into the bribery scandal 
surrounding the Utah capital's successful quest for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In Utah, meanwhile, a former U.S. skiing official said he had  
told investigators about Salt Lake-paid ski trips for three USOC 
members, and had identified one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, part of the investigation headed by former Senate  
Majority Leader George Mitchell, asked hundreds of members of the 
USOC board, site-selection task force and senior staff from 1988-89 
to detail any gifts they received from bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The request was made in a letter sent last Friday by John W.  
Cook, a partner in Hogan &AMP; Hartson, the USOC's outside counsel. A 
copy of the letter was obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Contained in the letter were copies of the minutes of a June 11,  
1988, USOC board meeting in Chicago, where a $25 limit on gifts 
from bidders to committee officials was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	It also included a questionnaire asking details of any gifts.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did you personally receive any gifts or financial advantages  
from any United States bid city or any representatives of a bid 
city that exceeded $25 in value?'' the questionnaire said. 
</P>
<P>
	It then asked eight questions about any gift received, including  
what it was, who gave it, where and when it was received, and 
whether it was reported to the USOC executive director as required 
by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Any information gathered by Cook's sweep will be turned over to  
Mitchell and the Justice Department, USOC spokesman Mike Moran said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell commission was appointed by the USOC in December  
after it was found that Salt Lake bidders provided almost a 
half-million dollars in scholarships for sons and daughters of IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	That news has turned into the biggest scandal in Olympic  
history, with nine IOC members expelled or resigning and at least 
13 others under investigation by an internal task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a Salt Lake ethics panel detailed more than $1.2  
million in cash, scholarships, travel, medical care and other 
inducements to 24 IOC members during the city's successful bid for 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC picked Salt Lake in 1989 to bid for the 1998 Winter  
Olympics. Those games went to Nagano, Japan, and Salt Lake 
automatically retained the U.S. designation, winning the 2002 Games 
in a landslide four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's panel is examining the USOC's role in that selection  
and preparing recommendations to avoid a recurrence of any 
wrongdoing it finds. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter from Cook was the first time the Mitchell commission,  
which is expected to brief USOC leaders on Feb. 28 and release its 
findings the next day, was known to be focusing on the USOC's 
decade-old selection of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is known also to be looking at the case of Alfredo La  
Mont, who resigned as USOC international relations director last 
month after disclosing an improper business relationship with the 
Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources said at the time that La Mont worked as a consultant for  
Salt Lake Olympic Tom Welch, gathering information about IOC 
members in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Peterson, a former executive director of the U.S. Ski  
Association who was among those receiving the Cook letter, said he 
had given investigators for Mitchell the name of one USOC board 
member who received a ski trip paid for by Salt Lake, along with 
information on two other members he did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson refused to publicly disclose the names of any of the  
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he had been reluctant to cooperate with the Mitchell  
panel at first, Peterson said he changed his mind because he was 
impressed with the investigators' work and progress that apparently 
had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided to provide names,'' he said in a telephone interview  
from his Utah home. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said he knew of numerous ski trips for USOC members  
paid for by Salt Lake, many of them to a resort in Park City run by 
former star Stein Ericksen. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were trips where travel from outside the area was  
included, not simply busing up to Park City after a Salt Lake 
meeting,'' Peterson said.

nerve damage in his lower leg while performing surgery on his left 
knee. 
</P>
<P>

	Doctors were able to repair damage done to four knee ligaments,  
but also found the nerve damage, the team said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Bertram Zarins, the team doctor, said he was ``pessimistic''  
about Edwards returning to football but did not rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards will undergo a long rehabilitation process. The process  
will continue for 4-6 weeks, but the recovery of the nerve function 
will be the biggest hurdle, Zarins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very difficult to get stability in that knee  
again,'' said Dr. John Richmond, director of sports medicine at New 
England Medical Center in Boston, prior to the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to worry about both stability and flexibility, and  
that's huge for a football player, particularly a running back,'' 
Richmond told the Boston Herald on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards went down hard during the pre-Pro Bowl festivities game  
on Feb. 5. in Honolulu, with his left knee turning one way in the 
sand, and his 218-pound body the other. 
</P>
<P>
	According to doctors, the joint was dislocated, there was artery  
and nerve damage and three of the four ligaments were torn. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, questions have arisen as to how the injury affects  
the five-year, $5.75 million contract Edwards signed with the 
Patriots after he was selected out of Georgia in the first round of 
last year's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe, citing an unidentified source, said the  
Patriots still owe Edwards at least $3 million for the remaining 
four years on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Globe said, the NFL collective bargaining agreement  
says that a player's contract is covered for injury only when an 
injury occurs during a league game, or a team-supervised workout. 
Edwards, therefore, was not covered when injured in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe also said Edwards and the other rookies in the flag  
football game signed releases, absolving the NFL from 
responsibility in case of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, the Patriots announced the signing of veteran defensive  
tackle Henry Thomas, a free agent, to a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not announced, but the Globe said it  
was worth more than $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 277-pound Thomas finished the season with 75  
tackles and 6 1/2 sacks.

<HEADLINE> `Message,' 'Payback' Top Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On a long holiday weekend that included  
Valentine's Day, the romantic ``Message in a Bottle'' edged 
``Payback'' as the top pick at North American theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The film starring Kevin Costner opened with $18.9 million in  
ticket sales over the four-day weekend, according to final industry 
figures released Tuesday. Mel Gibson's ``Payback'' was pushed to 
second place but remained strong in its second week, collecting 
$17.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Message,'' which also stars Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman,  
drew mostly older women and overcame reviews that called the film 
slow and sappy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but sometimes  
critics have a hard time with emotion,'' director Luis Mandoki 
said. ``It's not something we're always used to in these days of 
cynicism.'' 
</P>
<P>

million for third place while ``Blast from the Past'' had $9.2

<HEADLINE> Trial Opens in Dragging Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Physical evidence from the crime scene,  
racist tattoos and detailed written plans for a new hate group will 
link John William King to the gruesome dragging death of a black 
man last year, prosecutors told jurors today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidence will show Bill King had to do something dramatic in  
order to gain attention in their warped world,'' Jasper County 
District Attorney Guy James Gray said in his opening statement in 
King's trial in the death of James Byrd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray described King as a young man ``full of hate.'' Tattoos on  
his body, he said, ``will reflect and tell you the deep-seated 
anger and hatred that this man has.'' Gray said the tattoos include 
Nazi and Ku Klux Klan symbols, plus ``a little tattoo he's very 
proud of. It's a tattoo of a black man hanging from a tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lighter, King's DNA found on a cigarette and less than a drop  
of the victim's blood on King's shoes all tie the 24-year-old 
unemployed laborer to a wooded area and county road where Byrd was 
beaten last June 7, then chained to the back of a pickup truck and 
dragged for nearly three miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The nude body of Byrd, 49, an unemployed vacuum cleaner  
salesman, was shredded on the bumpy asphalt, his head and an arm 
severed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray today also said investigators found handwritten notes in  
King's apartment that included a constitution, bylaws, a code of 
ethics and a membership application for a group to be called the 
Texas Rebel Soldiers of the Confederate Knights of America. 
</P>
<P>
	King's lawyer, Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs, declined to make an  
opening statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence, it appears overwhelming,'' Cribbs had  
acknowledged Monday. ``But you've got to prove the accused has done 
the offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, the first of three white men to be tried in Byrd's  
slaying, faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. 
King, as has been the custom, wore bulletproof vest as he was 
escorted into the courthouse this morning by deputies. He would not 
respond to questions from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The first witness, Sheriff Billy Rowles, told how he originally  
believed Byrd's death was a hit-and-run accident. But when the 
dragging marks did not match with tire tracks, ``I knew it was 
going to be a murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he said when a lighter discovered along the dragging route  
had a Klan symbol, ``We started having some bad thoughts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a brand new sheriff,'' he said. ``I didn't even know the  
definition of a hate crime, but I knew somebody had been murdered 
because he had been black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted.  
Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, and Shawn Allen Berry, 23, are to be 
tried later. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member jury, plus two alternates, was selected after more  
than two weeks of individual interviews. The jury has one black and 
11 whites; the county population is predominantly white. 
</P>
<P>
	The 110-year-old courthouse has been outfitted for the trial  
with metal detectors, package scanners and numerous security 
cameras. State District Judge Joe Bob Golden has barred any rallies 
or signs regarding the case for two blocks. State police, sheriff's 
deputies and federal agents have been brought in to help local 
police enforce Golden's order during the trial.

<HEADLINE>  First Lady To Consider Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday she would  
give ``careful thought'' to running for a U.S. Senate seat from New 
York. Three confidants said she was talking with supporters about 
what it would take to run a serious campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady promised to make her decision later this year.  
President Clinton said on Monday she would be ``terrific in the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's statement drew a quick response from the camp of  
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a possible Republican rival. ``If 
Hillary Clinton announces a run for Senate, that would encourage 
the mayor to consider his candidacy for the Senate as well,'' a 
Giuliani spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly elected Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer sounded a note of  
caution for the first lady. ``I think she would be an extremely 
formidable candidate. I guess she'd have to be the favorite, but 
favorites don't always win,'' Schumer said at a news conference in 
Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she was deeply gratified by ``the large number  
of people who have encouraged me to consider running'' for the 
Senate seat being opened by the retirement of Democratic Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Just four days after the end of her husband's impeachment  
ordeal, Mrs. Clinton said she had not been able to give much 
thought to a potential candidacy but would be able to focus on it 
now. She said she would make her decision later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the meantime,'' she said in a three-sentence statement, ``I  
intend to continue to focus my attention on the issues central to 
the president's agenda and on which we have worked together for so 
many years.'' White House officials were delighted that the 
attention on Mrs. Clinton was taking attention away from the 
president's now-concluded impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry, her press secretary, said she could not elaborate  
on the timing of Mrs. Clinton's decision. ``I can't be any more 
specific than that because she doesn't know. She's going to talk to 
people, those who want her to do it and some who don't, and hear 
them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colleen Roche, press aide to Giuliani, said in response to Mrs.  
Clinton's statement, ``We are told that her candidacy would be the 
singular biggest unifying force in the Republican party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has made it clear he has ambitions beyond City Hall and  
has not ruled out a run for the Senate. He has a strong base, is a 
solid fund-raiser and would be a formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to be the star attraction at a New  
York fund-raiser for the Democratic Party's Women's Leadership 
Forum in the first week of March, providing one opportunity to 
announce her decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Monday he would enthusiastically support whatever  
decision she makes. 
</P>
<P>
	Three confidants of Mrs. Clinton, all speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said she has begun returning telephone calls to 
supporters and asking for information about what it would take to 
run a campaign -- from the amount of money she would have to raise 
to the availability of campaign talent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, these advisers echoed the sentiments of associates of  
Mrs. Clinton, who have been saying for weeks that they suspect she 
will eventually decide against making the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton talked over lunch Friday with former White House  
deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes, who is well versed in New York 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Mrs. Clinton was issuing the statement now, Berry  
said, ``She wanted to let you all know what she is thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton headlined a White House  
announcement on relief aid for Central America. As she left the 
room, a reporter shouted: ``Mrs. Clinton, everybody wants to know 
if you're going to run for the Senate!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton raised her arm, waved mechanically and smiled at  
the reporter, but she said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Her statement touched on her previous inability to focus on any  
decision about running. ``Until now, I have not been able to do so, 
but I will give careful thought to a potential candidacy in order 
to reach a decision later this year,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residency requirements vary among states. In New York a  
candidate need only have purchased or rented a residence by 
Election Day to meet residency requirements for running for office, 
according to Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the state Board of 
Elections. Robert Kennedy was a latecomer to New York when he won a 
Senate seat in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democratic ally of the Clintons, is  
going about the motions of a candidacy herself with forays to 
Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo -- all well outside her own district. 
But Lowey is a lady in waiting. Said her chief of staff, Howard 
Wolfson: ``If Mrs. Clinton wants to run, she will be the candidate. 
And, Nita will support her enthusiastically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats have expressed concern that others might have a  
tough time raising money as long as Mrs. Clinton was viewed as 
interested, but undecided. Polls show Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani 
in a theoretical matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released early this month from Quinnipiac College's  
Polling Institute, had Mrs. Clinton favored by 51 percent of 
registered voters to 42 percent for the mayor. Six percent of 
voters were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 53 percent to 42 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Aretha Franklin Criticizes Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Aretha Franklin says a newspaper report that  
documented lawsuits against her for not paying bills was malicious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never purchased any goods or services without the  
intention of paying my bills in a timely and responsible manner,'' 
she said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Free Press on Monday documented several lawsuits  
filed against Ms. Franklin since 1988. In some cases, the newspaper 
said, Ms. Franklin ignored court judgments, forcing creditors to 
seek liens on her assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Franklin, her lawyers and publicists declined to be  
interviewed by the Free Press for the story. But Ms. Franklin said 
Tuesday that she paid nearly all of her bills on time, and took 
responsibility for what she said was a small number of legitimate 
lawsuits. She said ``my travel and performance schedule and a lack 
of a secretary'' were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was ``clearly...a malicious and vicious attempt to  
discredit me by reprinting old, warmed-over news that local people 
knew about 15 years ago in a way that appeared to have a cumulative 
effect,'' Ms. Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Free Press executive editor Robert McGruder said the story was  
just the facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intended no malice, no disrespect and no lack of concern  
for Ms. Franklin. There was no vicious attempt to discredit here,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Polls Powerful in Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton's  
impeachment put the spotlight on polls and the pressure on 
pollsters as never before, and public opinion proved powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	When news of the investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr of the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky broke in 
January 1998, several political analysts said Clinton would never 
survive politically. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, some predicted the public would turn on the president  
once the accusations were proven true. By fall, many forecast the 
Republicans would steamroll Democrats in November's congressional 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The American public had other ideas.  
</P>
<P>
	They gave the president some of the highest job approval ratings  
of his presidency, in the 60s through much of the year as the 
economy flourished. And a solid majority opposed his removal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of the strongest reaffirmations of democracy I  
have seen,'' said Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, general chairman of the 
Democratic Party. ``People got it right, got it early and they 
stayed with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, many people were skeptical about the charges against  
Clinton, but about half said he should be impeached if he lied 
under oath about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Later, the number in 
favor of impeachment settled at about one in three. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters repeated their questions frequently, anticipating that  
people would turn against the president at some point. 
</P>
<P>
	It never happened.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans had a tougher year. They lost five House seats in  
mid-term elections. House Speaker Newt Gingrich resigned. Then Rep. 
Bob Livingston, the speaker-designate, quit after his own 
infidelity was disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The year was humbling for pundits and pollsters too, Republican  
pollster Bill McInturff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Who would have guessed a year ago, he said, that ``the president  
wouldn't be removed but it would wipe out the Republican 
leadership?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In general, the American electorate has shown a tolerance for  
personal behavior,'' McInturff added, ``that is far wider and 
broader than I would have imagined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Republicans pushed ahead with impeachment, they repeatedly  
said the polls were not a principal concern. But Republicans found 
some poll results worth noting, citing results that highlighted the 
majority of Americans who thought Clinton lied under oath and 
didn't trust him personally. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been too much focus on the polls and not enough on  
what's right and on principle,'' said Republican National Committee 
spokesman Mike Collins. ``If we were interested in doing the 
political thing, we would have dropped this months ago. We were 
following principle and doing our duty under the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The polls proved powerful because they gave a clear and  
recurring message, said Robert Shapiro, a Columbia University 
political scientist who studies public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Different organizations were asking the same kinds of  
questions and finding the same patterns and trends,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the president's ratings on handling of his job were low or  
the economy had gone bad, ``he'd be gone,'' Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the closing days of the impeachment process, some Republicans  
acknowledged their unsuccessful bid to oust Clinton had hurt them 
in the polls. But they predicted they would have time to recover 
and focus on tax cuts and other popular issues before the 2000 
elections.

<HEADLINE> Facts About Tomatoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tomatoes, the darling of the backyard gardener, the star of  
salads and spaghetti sauces, and now a possible weapon against 
cancer, were once considered poisonous fruit to be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	The tomato, a relative of the deadly nightshade family of  
plants, was held in high suspicion after it was brought to Europe 
from Mexico in the 1500s. It was grown in Spain and became a 
mainstay of Italian food, but was not widely accepted until the 
1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, more than 67 million tons of the smooth-skinned, succulent  
fruit are grown worldwide each year. About nine million tons are 
grown commercially in the United States -- and that doesn't count 
the millions of backyard gardeners who favor the tomato because it 
grows in a variety of soils and requires little skill. 
</P>
<P>
	There are more than 4,000 varieties of the tomato, ranging from  
the small, marble-size cherry tomato to the giant Ponderosa that 
can weigh more than 3 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Most commercial tomatoes are processed into foods, including  
sauces, pastes, purees, ketchups, soups and salsas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomatoes are rich in vitamins A and C and are a major source of  
lycopene, a compound that researchers think may help the body 
combat cancer.

<HEADLINE> Compaq: We're Not Microsoft Victim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to undermine government portrayal of  
the nation's computer makers as victims of an overzealous 
Microsoft, a senior Compaq executive is crediting the software 
giant with making computers easier to use, more reliable and less 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	John T. Rose, the next witness in the Microsoft antitrust trial,  
also disputes the government's characterization of several 
disagreements with Microsoft Corp., including one that threatened 
the future of Compaq Computer Corp., the world's largest maker of 
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq has not agreed with every position asserted by  
Microsoft, nor has Microsoft always agreed with our views,'' Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 17 pages of written testimony made public today, Rose  
acknowledged that Compaq was wrong in 1996 when it removed from 
some computers easy access to Microsoft's Internet software 
included within its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft objected and threatened to stop allowing Compaq to  
include Windows on its computers, which would have been 
catastrophic for Compaq's business. The government has used the 
episode at trial to illustrate what it considers to be Microsoft's 
heavy-handed tactics toward the nation's computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rose explained that Compaq removed the graphical icon for  
Microsoft's Internet browser software under a 1995 agreement with 
America Online Inc. stipulating that AOL's Internet icons would be 
the only ones easily accessible to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who was senior vice president and responsible then for all  
Compaq's desktop computers, told the judge he wasn't aware of the 
company's obligation to America Online until after Microsoft 
complained. Microsoft was correct to object, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The removal of the Microsoft icons was contrary to an  
understanding I had reached with Microsoft in August 1995,'' Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose also disputed government efforts to portray Microsoft as  
illegally restrictive toward ways that computer makers can modify 
Windows, such as offering a customized interface to allow consumers 
to run their software. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Compaq quit offering its own such program, called  
Tabworks, ``because it generated significant support costs and 
because we were satisfied that Windows 95 ... was more 
user-friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft doesn't prevent Compaq from selling machines with  
Internet software from rival Netscape Communications Corp., Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that Compaq since 1993 hasn't regularly sold  
computers using any operating system other than Windows, but he 
said that was a choice dictated by consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there were insufficient customer demand for a different  
operating system for personal computers, Compaq would consider 
licensing that operating system,'' Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price that Compaq pays for Windows is less than 5 percent of  
the cost of a $1,500 computer, Rose said, adding that his company 
pushes Microsoft ``to provide Windows to Compaq at the lowest 
possible price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To speed the trial, the judge has asked witnesses from both  
sides to submit their testimony in advance. The government is 
expected to begin questioning Rose on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Deere's Quarterly Earnings Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- Deere &AMP; Co. reported its first-quarter  
profit plunged 75 percent as a worldwide economic downturn sharply 
reduced sales of agricultural equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months that ended Jan. 1, the maker of large  
tractors and combines reported net income fell to $49.7 million, or 
21 cents a share, from $203 million, or 81 cents a share, a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street expectations of 18 cents a share,  
according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. Deere's stock 
rose 50 cents to $33.12 1/2 a share in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 14 percent to $2.46 billion from $2.85 billion as  
sales of both agricultural and construction equipment tumbled 23 
percent. Sales of commercial and consumer equipment rose 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moline, Ill.-based company said it expects 1999 volume to  
fall 13 percent to 15 percent as sales of agricultural equipment 
decline by 20 percent to 25 percent in North America and 10 percent 
to 15 percent elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Study: Doctors Missing Abuse Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Doctors failed to notice abuse-related head  
injuries in toddlers and babies nearly a third of the time in a new 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	They were especially likely to miss such injuries in white  
children from two-parent homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have our particular preconceived notions of what child  
abuse would look like. But, in fact, it's not a problem that's 
isolated to children of color or those from single-parent 
families,'' said Dr. Carole Jenny, a pediatrician who led the study 
while at Children's Hospital in Denver. She is now a professor of 
pediatrics at the Brown University. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American  
Medical Association, said doctors missed even life-threatening 
brain hemorrhaging and skull fractures. 
</P>
<P>
	Prompted by the case of a brain-damaged child who had visited  
eight doctors before being correctly diagnosed at the Denver 
hospital, Jenny and her colleagues reviewed medical charts compiled 
from 1990 to 1995 for 173 children under age 3 who had been treated 
by doctors throughout the Rocky Mountain region. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that 54 of the children, or 31 percent, had  
abuse-related injuries that weren't caught for an average of seven 
days. Five of the children died. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers determined four of those five might have been  
saved if the abuse had been noticed sooner because they were among 
15 children who were injured again after the missed diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Kirkpatrick, a spokesman for the Chicago-based National  
Committee to Prevent Child Abuse, said that fits with his agency's 
finding that 41 percent of abused children who died in 1995 through 
1997 had been seen by officials from child protective services. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors in the study missed nearly four in 10 abuse-related head  
injury cases in white children or those from two-parent families, 
while missing about two in 10 cases in non-white children or those 
living with a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all need to adjust our mindset,'' Kirkpatrick said.  
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. John Leventhal, a professor of  
pediatrics at Yale University, said it's unlikely doctors will make 
the correct diagnosis all the time, but ``physicians can do 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny recommended developing blood tests to detect enzymes  
released in the bloodstream when a child is injured through shaking 
or impact.

<HEADLINE> Dollar, Japanese Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's finance chief said Tuesday the government  
would move firmly to control long-term interest rates, triggering a 
rally in Tokyo stocks and sending the dollar soaring against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 177.92  
points, or 1.27 percent, to 14,232.64 points by the end of the 
afternoon session at 3 p.m. (1 a.m. EST). On Monday, the average 
closed up 81.03 points, or 0.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 748 to 369, while 167  
issues remained unchanged. Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo 
Stock Exchange was estimated at 399 million shares, up from 338.75 
million shares Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar bought 117.02 yen at 5 p.m. (3  
a.m. EST), up 2.94 yen from late Monday in Tokyo. U.S. markets were 
closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday. The dollar traded at 
between 115.60 yen and 117.50 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's advance came as Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa  
confirmed that the government plans to take aggressive steps to 
keep long-term interest rates in check in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a press conference, Miyazawa announced that the  
government will reduce the amount of 10-year government bond 
issuances to around 1.4 trillion yen ($12 billion) in March -- a cut 
of 400 billion yen ($3.42 billion) from recent levels. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the government will increase issues of  
shorter-dated debt by the same amount, increasing 2-year government 
bond issuances in March by 300 billion yen ($2.6 billion) and 
6-year bond issuances by 100 billion yen ($855 million). 
</P>
<P>
	``These steps should have a positive impact on long-term  
interest rates,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	High interest rates in Japan would strengthen the yen by  
attracting more investment in the currency. A pledge to lower rates 
would tend to make the yen weaker against foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency gained further momentum as it became clear  
that Japanese authorities -- including Vice Finance Minister for 
International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara -- weren't protesting the 
yen's fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Sakakibara has changed his policy,'' said Junichi  
Kodama, managing director and head of corporate foreign exchange 
sales at Chase Manhattan Bank in Tokyo. ``I think he's of the 
opinion that the priority is a recovery of Japan's economy and that 
exchange rate concerns can be put aside for the time being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was also boosted by news that the government has  
decided that the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau will 
temporarily resume its purchases of Japanese government bonds to 
bring interest rates down. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market was rocked recently when the bureau, which  
manages public pension funds and deposits from the country's 
massive postal savings system, announced it would discontinue 
purchases of government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates tend to reduce borrowing costs for  
companies, and could help spur economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.985 percent from Monday's finish of 2.140 percent, 
driving its price up to 98.54 yen from 97.35 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.16 yen, up from  
128.70 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, export-oriented auto issues such as Toyota  
Motor and Honda Motor led the way as investors were cheered up by 
the yen's retreat against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker yen tends to make Japanese exports cheaper aboard and  
thus more competitive, helping to boost earnings of export-led 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section added 6.66 points, or 0.61 percent, to 
1,101.68. The TOPIX closed up 5.49 points, or 0.50 percent, the day 
before.

	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- CBS plans to air a TV movie in March on  
the case of Alex Kelly, the former high school wrestler who went on 
the lam in Europe to escape charges of raping a teen-age girl in 
1986.

	``The Return of Alex Kelly'' will be broadcast March 23.  
</P>
<P>
	Margot Kidder, who played Lois Lane in the ``Superman'' movies,  
will portray Kelly's mother. Cassidy Rae, star of ``Hyperion Bay,'' 
plays the victim. Kelly is played by Matthew Settle, a regional 
stage actor. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Jagr Is a Star on His Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux hasn't laced up a pair of skates  
or stared down a goaltender on a breakaway in nearly two years. No 
matter, he thinks the best player in hockey still resides in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux doesn't attend Penguins' games in person -- he's  
embroiled in a dispute with the bankrupt franchise's owner. But he 
watches enough on TV to give Jaromir Jagr this endorsement: ``He's 
the best player in the world -- by far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Jagr has played during the Penguins' 10-game winning  
streak, at a level reached only occasionally by gifted players such 
as Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky, it would be hard to argue otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jagr had four points in a streak-stretching 7-3 victory  
Monday over Washington, Capitals coach Ron Wilson said he yanked 
goaltender Olaf Kolzig with Pittsburgh ahead 5-1, ``As an act of 
mercy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jagr is the best player in the league,'' Canadiens defenseman  
Stephane Quintal said in admiration last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr will say only that Lemieux was the best player he ever saw,  
``And there was only one Mario.'' He won't compare himself to Eric 
Lindros, Pavel Bure or Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jagr is enjoying the crackdown on holding, clutching and  
grabbing, tactics Lemieux long implored the NHL to regulate because 
they allowed players of marginal ability to drag down the quality 
of play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the game has changed since last year,'' Jagr said.  
``It's more open and the stronger, better, faster guys have an 
advantage over the other guys. Last year, there was a lot of 
holding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, there's no holding back Jagr as he tries to win a  
third NHL scoring title in five years. He has 26 points, with six 
games of three points or more, during a 10-game winning streak the 
Penguins hope to extend Wednesday night at the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The only surprising aspect of the Penguins' longest streak since  
they won a league-record 17 in a row in 1993 is it has revealed 
Jagr the leader, not just Jagr the scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr succeeded Lemieux and Ron Francis as the Penguins' captain  
mostly in deference to his ability as a player, rather than as a 
leader of men. But he has stepped forward recently as the Penguins' 
most vocal leader, one capable of rallying his team even when he 
doesn't score. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated the Penguins trailed Buffalo 3-2 on Feb. 2, Jagr  
stood up on the bench and said, ``We're not losing.'' The Penguins 
scored three times in the final 6:01 to win 5-3, with Jagr figuring 
in every goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with the winning streak in danger of ending Saturday in  
Nashville, Jagr implored his teammates to remember they had won 
their previous two games in overtime, yelling, ``Let's do it 
again.'' They did, winning 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, Jagr is not a one-man offense. Kip Miller, who had  
only three points with the Islanders last season, has 10 goals and 
18 points in 11 games since moving up to Jagr's line. Martin Straka 
made the All-Star game, and Alexei Kovalev has 18 goals since 
joining the NHL's league-best offense 2 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But it takes only a few shifts of any game to realize that  
Jagr's speed, playmaking ability, scoring touch and ability to stay 
on his skates even when pummeled by larger defensemen makes the 
Penguins go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Jaromir Jagr gets better every year,'' Penguins  
general manager Craig Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Kevin Constantine agreed, saying, ``You wonder how much  
better the kid can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What even his coach forgets sometimes is Jagr no longer is a  
kid. Jagr turned 27 Monday and is in his ninth season in the 
league, even if it seems like only last week he was an 
impressionable teenager playing alongside Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's possible Jagr might play someday for the now-retired  
Lemieux, who is trying to assemble investors who would rescue the 
Penguins from bankruptcy and keep them in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great,'' Jagr said, clearly enjoying the thought  
that Lemieux might be his boss. ``It would be all offense all the 
time -- just the way we like it.''

<HEADLINE>  Jagr Is a Star on His Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux hasn't laced up a pair of skates  
or stared down a goaltender on a breakaway in nearly two years. No 
matter, he thinks the best player in hockey still resides in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux doesn't attend Penguins' games in person -- he's  
embroiled in a dispute with the bankrupt franchise's owner. But he 
watches enough on TV to give Jaromir Jagr this endorsement: ``He's 
the best player in the world -- by far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Jagr has played during the Penguins' 10-game winning  
streak, at a level reached only occasionally by gifted players such 
as Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky, it would be hard to argue otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jagr had four points in a streak-stretching 7-3 victory  
Monday over Washington, Capitals coach Ron Wilson said he yanked 
goaltender Olaf Kolzig with Pittsburgh ahead 5-1, ``As an act of 
mercy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jagr is the best player in the league,'' Canadiens defenseman  
Stephane Quintal said in admiration last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr will say only that Lemieux was the best player he ever saw,  
``And there was only one Mario.'' He won't compare himself to Eric 
Lindros, Pavel Bure or Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jagr is enjoying the crackdown on holding, clutching and  
grabbing, tactics Lemieux long implored the NHL to regulate because 
they allowed players of marginal ability to drag down the quality 
of play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the game has changed since last year,'' Jagr said.  
``It's more open and the stronger, better, faster guys have an 
advantage over the other guys. Last year, there was a lot of 
holding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, there's no holding back Jagr as he tries to win a  
third NHL scoring title in five years. He has 26 points, with six 
games of three points or more, during a 10-game winning streak the 
Penguins hope to extend Wednesday night at the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The only surprising aspect of the Penguins' longest streak since  
they won a league-record 17 in a row in 1993 is it has revealed 
Jagr the leader, not just Jagr the scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr succeeded Lemieux and Ron Francis as the Penguins' captain  
mostly in deference to his ability as a player, rather than as a 
leader of men. But he has stepped forward recently as the Penguins' 
most vocal leader, one capable of rallying his team even when he 
doesn't score. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated the Penguins trailed Buffalo 3-2 on Feb. 2, Jagr  
stood up on the bench and said, ``We're not losing.'' The Penguins 
scored three times in the final 6:01 to win 5-3, with Jagr figuring 
in every goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with the winning streak in danger of ending Saturday in  
Nashville, Jagr implored his teammates to remember they had won 
their previous two games in overtime, yelling, ``Let's do it 
again.'' They did, winning 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, Jagr is not a one-man offense. Kip Miller, who had  
only three points with the Islanders last season, has 10 goals and 
18 points in 11 games since moving up to Jagr's line. Martin Straka 
made the All-Star game, and Alexei Kovalev has 18 goals since 
joining the NHL's league-best offense 2 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But it takes only a few shifts of any game to realize that  
Jagr's speed, playmaking ability, scoring touch and ability to stay 
on his skates even when pummeled by larger defensemen makes the 
Penguins go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Jaromir Jagr gets better every year,'' Penguins  
general manager Craig Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Kevin Constantine agreed, saying, ``You wonder how much  
better the kid can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What even his coach forgets sometimes is Jagr no longer is a  
kid. Jagr turned 27 Monday and is in his ninth season in the 
league, even if it seems like only last week he was an 
impressionable teenager playing alongside Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's possible Jagr might play someday for the now-retired  
Lemieux, who is trying to assemble investors who would rescue the 
Penguins from bankruptcy and keep them in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great,'' Jagr said, clearly enjoying the thought  
that Lemieux might be his boss. ``It would be all offense all the 
time -- just the way we like it.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Is Seeking Explanations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Letters are on the way to IOC members  
implicated in Salt Lake City's bribery scandal telling them they 
have until the end of the month to say why they shouldn't be 
expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, a member of a six-man IOC inquiry commission,  
said those implicated will be asked to reply by the last week of 
February. The commission will meet in late February or early March 
and make recommendations to the executive board, which can order 
further expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	Any expulsions would go before the full general assembly at the  
March 17-18 emergency session dealing with the corruption crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee's ethics panel issued a  
report last week that blamed two bid committee leaders for 
dispensing $1 million in cash, scholarships, medical treatment and 
other favors during the successful effort to win the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake report, which was reviewed by the IOC inquiry  
commission during the weekend, implicated 24 IOC members -- a fifth 
of the total roster. The report cited 10 names that were not 
included in the list of 14 implicated earlier during the IOC's 
internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	After the IOC panel sent letters demanding explanations from 13  
members (one, Cameroon's Rene Essomba, has died), nine members 
resigned or were ousted by the executive board. Three others remain 
under investigation; one received a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the IOC panel, headed by vice president Dick Pound,  
would follow the same procedure in dealing with new names and 
evidence contained in the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone mentioned in the ethics report, except those who have  
already resigned, will receive a letter asking for a reply,'' he 
said in a telephone interview Monday from Belgium. ``They have the 
right to respond in writing or to appear before the commission in 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those already investigated by the IOC will receive second  
letters if there is new evidence in the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Monday, the deadline passed for Olympic  
bid cities to report rule-breaking, and a Utah group opposed to 
state involvement in the Olympics launched its petition drive 
demanding taxpayers be protected from having to pay if the Games 
finish in the red. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that's something the Legislature has refused to talk  
about and believe it's the type of question that needs to be 
answered,'' Stephen Pace, head of Utahns for Responsible Public 
Spending, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt raised questions last month regarding whether  
the state could, under Utah's Constitution, protect the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee against financial losses should the games run 
a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he said he believes there is a moral obligation to  
abide by a promise made by his predecessor, Gov. Norm Bangerter, 
and renewed by him to provide financial protection to the games and 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	If an agreement the city signed with SLOC is unconstitutional,  
the Legislature would have to appropriate money to cover the debt 
through its normal appropriations process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pace's initiative would force an election on the indemnification  
issue. The ballot proposition would state: ``The State of Utah 
shall not indemnify, guarantee or reimburse the debt or obligations 
incurred by an organization, public or private, to host, solicit, 
organize, schedule, conduct, book or operate the Olympic Winter 
Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order to force the Legislature to consider the initiative,  
the group would have to collect 33,594 signatures in 20 of Utah's 
29 counties. To put it directly on the ballot, twice that number of 
signatures is required. 
</P>
<P>
	The worry over the possibility of the 2002 Games going into the  
red comes at a time when restless corporate Olympic sponsors are 
demanding the IOC carry through with decisive action to deal with 
the crisis or face a rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, the IOC marketing director who felt the wrath of  
sponsors at a meeting in New York last Friday, said the IOC was 
aware of the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors are saying, `Are you sure you really will deliver  
the cleaning of the house, and the reforms, in March? If this drags 
on beyond March, it impacts on our marketing programs. If we miss 
that March window, it's a big problem,''' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're telling the sponsors that cleaning the house is the  
first step. That's the line in the sand. Clearly there are things 
that are broken and need to be fixed. This is an opportunity to 
make changes. The IOC has the resolve to go all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors have been critical of the IOC leadership, while  
stopping short of calling for Samaranch's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have understood that, for the time being, while pushing  
through expulsions and reforms, it would not be helpful to have a 
presidential election,'' Payne said. ``It would destabilize the 
situation. I think that's understood by all of those who closely 
follow the Olympic movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung Electronics Co. denied Monday that it was considering  
abandoning its $45 million sponsorship of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are worried the commercial values of the Olympics have  
suffered because of these scandals,'' spokeswoman Cho Sung-in said. 
``But we remain committed to our sponsorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cho spoke in reaction to an Australian newspaper report that  
Samsung's sponsorship was in doubt because of vote-buying scandals 
and other allegations of misconduct involving members of the 
International Olympic Committee. Cho said The Sydney Morning Herald 
report Monday was ``far too exaggerating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta failed to make Monday's deadline for Olympic bidders to  
tell of rule-breaking behavior by IOC members or by bid cities. 
However, Atlanta bid officials said they did not find any 
wrongdoing during an internal review. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Monday it had no word yet on how many cities had  
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``ACOG has advised us they have no information relevant to the  
IOC request,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Atlanta response had been overshadowed by the USOC's  
need to get information to the other investigations into the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC president Bill Hybl would forward the Atlanta response to  
the IOC ``as soon as possible. We anticipate no problem,'' Moran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney 2000 Olympics bid leader John Fahey told the IOC that  
there is no fresh evidence of wrongdoing by IOC members during the 
city's successful quest for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every director has responded in writing and all directors,  
with one exception, have stated that they have no evidence of any 
improper conduct by any IOC member with regard to the Sydney bid,'' 
Fahey said in a statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	Former bid member Bruce Baird previously told the IOC Executive  
Committee of a matter concerning an IOC member, whom Fahey said has 
since resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC has been conducting its own ethics investigation, and  
criminal probes are under way by the U.S. Justice Department and 
the Utah Attorney General's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Utah Attorney General Reed Richards said Monday that  
the state investigation might take another couple of months to wrap 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	He said SLOC's ethics investigation was a good start. ``They've  
done quite a lot of work,'' he said. ``There may be some of those 
people that we would want to talk to again -- undoubtedly there will 
be. And there's some they did not talk to that we will want to talk 
to.''

<HEADLINE> Skip Away Wins Horse of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Skip Away, the ``horse pet'' of Carolyn and Sonny Hine, won the  
Eclipse Award on Tuesday night as Horse of the Year for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Skippy, as he was called by owner Carolyn and her  
husband-trainer Sonny, was a unanimous selection, getting the votes 
of the National Turf Writers Association, Daily Racing Form and 
racing secretaries of National Thoroughbred Racing Association 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would have been a real sadness in my heart (if he had  
lost),'' Carolyn Hine said. ``I guess I would have been numb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away finished second in Horse of the Year voting to  
2-year-old champion Favorite Trick in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The big gray horse, winner of his first seven starts, which  
stretched his victory streak to nine, beat Awesome Again, who won 
all six starts and beat Skip Away in the Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards were announced at the NTRA's Eclipse Awards dinner at  
Miami Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away, who was 5, also beat Awesome Again, who was 4, as  
best older horse or gelding. Frank Stronach, Awesome Again's owner, 
was voted the top owner of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away, 3-year-old champion in 1996 and best older horse and  
gelding in 1997, obviously won racing's top honor on the strength 
of his schedule. Of his seven straight wins, five of them were 
Grade I stakes, one of them was a Grade II and the other was a 
Grade III. He finished third in the Grade I Woodward, then sixth in 
Grade I BC Classic, finishing with $2.74 million for the year and 
$9,612,360 for his career, second only to Cigar ($9,999,815). 
</P>
<P>
	Awesome Again won two Grade I stakes -- the Whitney Handicap and  
the BC Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they couldn't give it to anyone else when his major  
competition won only two Grade ones,'' Sonny Hine said. ``He 
deserves all of his accolades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another big winner was Bob Baffert. He got an Eclipse Award as  
trainer of the year and two of his charges won divisional 
championships -- Real Quiet, winner of the Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness, 3-year-old, and unbeaten Silverbulletday, 2-year-old 
filly. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Pegram owns both Real Quiet and Silverbulletday, but the  
Eclipse Award for top owner went to Frank Stronach, owner of 
Awesome Again, whose big stable had a big year. Pegram said the 
victories of Real Quiet, Baffert and Gary Stevens were honor enough 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, Real Quiet's rider, was voted the top jockey. It was  
the first Eclipse Award for the Hall of Fame jockey, who has won 
the Kentucky Derby three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled to finally win it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Every winner was a unanimous first-place selection of each of  
the three voting organizations. The outstanding breeder award, 
given to Mr. and Mrs. John C. Mabee, was selected by a special 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Other equine winners were Answer Lively, 2-year-old colt or  
gelding; Banshee Breeze, 3-year-old filly; Escena, older filly or 
mare; Reraise, sprinter; Buck's Boy, male turf horse; Fiji, female 
turf horse; Flat Top, steeplechaser. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaun Bridgmohan was honored as top apprentice jockey.

<HEADLINE> 8 Charged in Attack on Disabled Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEANSBURG, N.J. (AP) -- Eight people were arrested in the beating  
of a learning-disabled man who was lured to a party, forced to wear 
women's clothing and taped to a lawn chair. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the eight allegedly picked up the 23-year-old man from  
his job at a restaurant and took him to the party on Jan. 30, said 
James K. Pigott, a deputy police chief who announced the arrests on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, who wasn't identified, had his head shaved and was  
beaten with shower curtain rods and a toilet brush, Pigott said. He 
was threatened with a knife and taken to a wooded area, where a 
pillowcase was put over his head and he was punched, Pigott said. 
</P>
<P>
	With one eye swollen shut, the man reached a security guard  
booth at a business and police were called. He was treated at a 
hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight were bent on revenge for two incidents involving the  
man at previous parties, including once telephoning his father and 
saying others wouldn't let him leave, Pigott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges ranged from kidnapping, aggravated assault and  
conspiracy to commit aggravated assault.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Modifies Cell Phone Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines has loosened its rules on  
the use of cellular phones aboard aircraft and in jetways. 
</P>
<P>
	Effective immediately, Northwest passengers may use their  
portable cell phones aboard planes and in the jetways connecting 
planes and terminals whenever at least one of the aircraft doors is 
open. Northwest's new policy is similar to that of its alliance 
partner Continental Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``For people on the go these days, down time is lost time,''  
said Tim Griffin, Northwest executive vice president for marketing 
and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	A Northwest pilot in command also may allow the use of cell  
phones after plane doors are closed while the aircraft is on the 
ground and clear of all runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers also may use at any time the in-flight phone systems  
installed on most aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The change does not apply to laptop computers, portable audio  
players, electronic games or other electronic devices which may not 
be used while on the ground or during flight until permission is 
given by cabin announcement.

<HEADLINE> French Sailor Rescued Unharmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Her life in peril and her boat destroyed  
by mountainous waves, a star French sailor was rescued unharmed in 
the South Pacific on Tuesday by a heroic rival in the solo 
around-the-world race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean navy said Isabelle Autissier was rescued at 9:37  
a.m. EST by yachtsman Giovanni Soldini of Italy. She was saved 
about 24 hours after sending a distress signal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The French sailor is now safe and in good condition aboard the  
Italian yacht Fila,'' Cmdr. Nilton Duran told The Associated Press 
by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier was the overall leader of the 27,000-mile Around Alone  
race when her 60-foot PRB overturned in fierce weather Monday. The 
Chilean navy said the 42-year-old Frenchwoman's boat was 
``completely lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The boat suddenly turned more than 90 degrees, and I could no  
longer be in the cockpit,'' Autissier said. ``Then it suddenly 
turned over, and I didn't have time to shut the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said earlier today that Autissier had taken to a life  
raft, but race director Peter Rachtman could not confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier sent a mayday and made a brief call to Paris after her  
boat was capsized by 40 mph winds and waves as high as 40 feet, 
Rachtman said from Auckland, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very quickly, the mast snapped into pieces,'' she said. ``When  
I saw that, I sent the signal because there was nothing else I 
could do. Then I began to get organized, getting security material 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no known commercial or private shipping in the isolated  
ocean south of Australia, organizers said the fleet represented 
Autissier's best chance for survival. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier was in second place in the third leg before her boat  
capsized, trailing Marc Thiercelin by 38 miles. The rescue came 
2,070 miles west of Punta Arenas, Chile's southernmost city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I calculated that Marc or Giovanni were closest to me, but  
nevertheless realized that it could take at least 24 hours for them 
to arrive,'' Autissier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini was 200 miles and at least 10 hours away when he turned  
south into heavy seas to reach Autissier. Duran said the weather 
had improved at the time of the rescue and winds had slowed to 29 
mph to 31 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am heading for PRB,'' Soldini told the Race Operations  
Center in Charleston, S.C., by radio before heading to Autissier. 
``I'm not letting up until I have found Isa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean navy kept contact with stations in Hawaii,  
California and New Zealand during the search and rescue efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran said Fila will stay in the race and is expected to reach  
Uruguay in seven to nine days. The race, which includes a dozen 
boats, began in Charleston in August and is to end there in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other competitors were heading toward Autissier, but  
organizers said the nearest boat was at least three days away. 
</P>
<P>
	At a briefing before the fleet left Auckland last week, skippers  
were told to look after each other.

<HEADLINE> No US Kosovo Troop Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No timetable or deadline will be set for  
American peacekeeping troops if they are sent to Kosovo, Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really learned a lesson in Bosnia that setting an  
artificial deadline doesn't work,'' Albright said on ABC-TV's 
``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What one needs to do is to put down benchmarks,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	American troops were sent to Bosnia as part of a NATO  
peacekeeping force after a settlement was reached in November 1995 
to end an ethnic war in the former Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the troops would be brought home in a  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, there are still about 6,700 U.S. troops in  
Bosnia-Herzegovina. At one point their were 22,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said a NATO peacekeeping force had to be part of any  
settlement for Kosovo. However, the Serbs, in negotiations with 
ethnic Albanians in Rambouillet, France, insist they would not 
permit NATO soldiers on their territory, including Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Serbs persist, Albright said, there will be no agreement  
to end the yearlong conflict in the province that has taken more 
than 2,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``No NATO force is a deal breaker from our perspective,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, she said, if there is an impasse, ``That means that it  
would be followed by NATO bombing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a settlement, some 4,000 U.S. troops would be part  
of a NATO force of about 28,000. They would help set the stage for 
elections to implement self-rule for Kosovo. And that would mean 
control by the Albanians who make up about 90 percent of the 
province's 2-million population. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers also would disarm Serb and Albanian forces and  
clear the way for setting up a local police force. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said the U.S. troops would stay in Kosovo however long  
it takes to deal with those ``benchmarks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So we're not putting that down as a period of time,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has briefed Congress on its plan to  
dispatch U.S. troops to Kosovo, but is not seeking authorization.

<P>
	Clinton has a constitutional right to send the Americans to the  
Serb province without Congress' approval, senior U.S. officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	This position has stirred controversy on Capitol Hill, where  
there is concern about the cost of the operation and the potential 
danger to the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., may provide for  
a nonbinding House vote on sending troops to Kosovo, spokesman John 
Feehery suggested today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hastert said I think we need to have a vote on this,'' Feehery  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said last week that, while the president  
would consult with Congress on any decision on ground troops, it 
did not feel it was required to get prior congressional approval. 
However some members of Congress have argued the opposite, citing 
the War Powers Act and the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Congress is likely to offer some form of support for U.S.  
troops if Clinton does decide to send them. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, in fact, the House interrupted its debate on  
articles of impeachment to pass a nonbinding resolution voicing 
support for the U.S. forces that Clinton had sent to the Persian 
Gulf as part of the continuing dispute with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., Saturday to tell them about the U.S. ground troops.

<HEADLINE> Threat of Avalanches Delays Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) -- Mickey Parker couldn't think of a  
better way to celebrate his 44th birthday than to go snowboarding 
with his 19-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	And where better than on 10,778-foot Mount Baker, just south of  
the Canadian border, where daredevils are allowed to venture into 
the fresh snow and rugged terrain outside the protected areas? 
</P>
<P>
	Past the warning signs, though, you're on your own.  
</P>
<P>
	That's where Justin M. Parker, 19, and his father were Sunday  
when a wall of snow broke loose and roared down Rumble Gulch. The 
father was 150 feet behind the son. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just buried him alive,'' Parker said. ``I realized it was  
my boy underneath there. I knew it was all over. I knew there was 
nothing I could do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His son's body was recovered moments later, but Justin could not  
be revived. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole hillside swallowed up my boy. I knew he was in God's  
hands. I accepted that he died right then and there,'' Parker said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy showed the younger Parker suffocated.  
</P>
<P>
	The search for a second man missing in the avalanche, Sean  
Riches, 25, of London, Ontario, has been suspended since late 
Sunday because of the danger of further slides. 
</P>
<P>
	Ski area spokeswoman Gwyn Howat said Monday the snow was moving  
``close to 200 miles per hour'' and covering an area about a mile 
long and 100 feet wide with several feet of snow in a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Howat said the search would resume when the slopes are stable,  
possibly not until spring. More than 57 feet of snow have fallen 
this season, and more snow is expected in the next few days, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs at the roped-off boundary warn that anyone venturing  
outside it faces a $500 minimum fine if rescue efforts are 
undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker said he and his son had talked about trying to snowboard  
ahead of an avalanche if they ever got caught in one. He said that 
was what the young man tried to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked safe enough. Everybody had gone through it,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker said he and his son had been snowboarding for a year, one  
of the ways in which they had been spending more time together. 
Three months ago the son began working for his father, building 
frames for houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to become more responsible,'' Parker said.

<HEADLINE> School Desegregation Suit Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A settlement was reached Tuesday just as a  
federal trial was to begin to decide the constitutionality of the 
city's school desegregation program, which bars any school from 
having more than 45 percent of any one racial or ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Orrick ordered details kept  
confidential until a hearing Wednesday on preliminary approval of 
the lawsuit's settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	But participants' comments indicated that limits on racial and  
ethnic groups at each school in the 63,000-student district, part 
of a 1983 court order, would be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement between the school district and the National  
Association for the Advancement of Colored People is ``a balanced 
resolution that achieves the objectives that plaintiffs in this 
case set,'' said Daniel Girard, lawyer for three Chinese-American 
students and their parents, who filed the suit in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely worth the fight,'' said Charlene Loen,  
whose 14-year-old son, Patrick Wong, was denied admission to elite 
Lowell High School in 1994 because the school then required higher 
test scores from Chinese Americans than other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	That policy has been changed, but the court order still has the  
effect of curbing Lowell's Chinese-American enrollment, the largest 
of any group. Wong, 18, now attends the University of California, 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1983 order, which resolved a 1978 discrimination suit by the  
NAACP, contained a 45 percent ceiling on any racial or ethnic group 
at a school. The limit is 40 percent at alternative or ``magnet'' 
schools. Those include Lowell, which has an entrance exam and 
counts U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and the late Gov. 
Pat Brown among its alumni. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft settlement that was brought to Orrick earlier in the day  
would prohibit assigning students based on race or ethnicity but 
would let the district consider their socioeconomic status, said 
Patrick Manshardt, a lawyer for the state Board of Education who 
saw the draft but was not part of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement comes at a time of increasing judicial hostility  
to race-based admissions. Last November, a federal appeals court 
struck down race as an admissions factor at the prestigious Boston 
Latin School, a ruling the school board decided not to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco settlement will not end desegregation efforts,  
insisted NAACP lawyer Peter Cohn. He said the agreement would 
``continue to protect the educational rights of all children.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congress Leaders To Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to move beyond impeachment, President  
Clinton is inviting congressional leaders to a White House meeting 
on the year's agenda when Congress returns to the Capitol next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., accepted the  
invitation on Tuesday, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., 
was also expected to attend, spokesmen for the two leaders said. 
Also invited were House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and 
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the leaders' first face-to-face encounter with the  
president since the Senate voted Friday to acquit him of perjury 
and obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is looking forward to talking with the  
bipartisan leadership about the agenda for this year,'' said White 
House spokesman Barry Toiv, who confirmed the invitations. ``He 
thinks we can accomplish a lot, and he wants to get off to a quick 
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican aides said the session could well include discussion  
of the upcoming year's leading domestic issues, such as Social 
Security, tax cuts and education. 
</P>
<P>
	A meeting between Clinton and congressional Republican leaders  
would serve both sides' interests in demonstrating to the public 
that they are moving beyond the impeachment fight, which has 
dominated news from Washington for months. 
</P>
<P>
	It might also serve as the starting point for whatever  
bipartisan effort will be made this year to overhaul Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Without changes, the massive pension system for the elderly and  
disabled will face a financing crunch when baby boomers begin 
retiring in a decade. But the program is probably the most 
politically sensitive one in the federal government, and neither 
party is eager to propose overhauls by itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Republicans said they assumed Democratic leaders would  
also be invited, a spokeswoman for Daschle said she was not aware 
of any invitation to him. Aides to Gephardt did not immediately 
return a telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are on a weeklong President's Day recess.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Juggles 6 Starting Pitchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks will bring all six of  
their experienced starting pitchers to spring training this week, 
with left-hander Brian Anderson likely headed to the bullpen if he 
isn't traded. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Diamondbacks spent nearly $100 million to sign free  
agents Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso, that 
left them with six starters for a five-man rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	With Andy Benes and the newly re-signed Omar Daal joining the  
newcomers in the rotation, Anderson is considered a top candidate 
to be traded, mainly because he is young, a left-hander and one of 
the game's best control pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Diamondbacks say they are in no hurry to make a deal,  
and Anderson could provide some much-needed help as a long 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Buck Showalter said one of his first orders of business  
when pitchers and catchers start workouts Thursday at Tucson will 
be to sit down with Anderson and make sure he understands what is 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize that Brian has pitched well as a starter and as a  
reliever,'' Showalter said, ``so it gives us the option to do 
both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, one of the most popular players in the Diamondbacks'  
clubhouse, was 12-13 last year with a 4.33 ERA. He led the National 
League in fewest walks per nine innings at 1.04. However, he also 
was tied for the most home runs allowed at 39. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said there has been  
considerable interest in making a trade for Anderson, but there is 
a good possibility any deal wouldn't be made until late in spring 
training or after opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks would not have a problem keeping Anderson as a  
reliever and spot starter, as well as for insurance should one of 
the other starters falter or get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know how valuable he is. We know how valuable he would be  
to us,'' Garagiola said. ``We also know he could pitch out of our 
bullpen. For us to entertain any discussions for him it's going to 
have to be for a player who really makes us significantly better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said he also plans a talk with Amaury Telemaco, who  
was part of the rotation much of last season but is destined for 
relief duty this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those invited as non-roster players to spring training  
include the three top young pitchers in Arizona's minor league 
system -- Brad Penney, John Patterson and Nick Bierbrodt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we go in the first day I'm going to tell them they're  
not going to make this ball club, so get that out of your heads,'' 
Showalter said. ``They're here to watch Andy Benes, Randy Johnson, 
Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso, to see the way professional 
pitchers in the major leagues carry themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penney, Patterson and Bierbrodt will start the season at  
Arizona's new Double-A farm club in El Paso, Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the players don't report to spring training until  
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks were close to a deal that would send outfielder  
Bernard Gilkey and another player to Pittsburgh for Al Martin and 
Tony Womack. The deal was contingent upon the Pirates signing 
former Twins infielder Pat Meares to play shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had conversations with the Pirates, and we're continuing  
to talk,'' Garagiola said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Benjamin, signed earlier by the Pirates to fill in at  
shortstop until prospect Abraham Nunez is ready, or rookie Warren 
Morris would replace Womack at second. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Pirates would give the Diamondbacks some much-needed  
speed on the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack, 30, a second baseman who likely would play right field  
for the Diamondbacks, has led the NL in stolen bases the last two 
seasons. Martin had 20 steals last season and 38 in 1996, but is 
coming off a career-low .239 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is penciled in as the Pirates' fourth outfielder, despite  
his team-leading $2.8 million salary. Martin, who has pushed for a 
trade since the Pirates dealt for outfielders Brant Brown and Brian 
Giles, would likely fill the same role in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the signing of Meares, there were two other sticking  
points holding up the trade. The two teams had yet to agree on what 
player would be sent to the Pirates with Gilkey. And the 
Diamondbacks had yet to agree on how large a portion of Gilkey's 
contract they were willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republic reported that the other player would either  
be a reserve outfielder -- David Dellucci, Yamil Benitez or Dante 
Powell -- or relief prospects Ben Ford, Nelson Figueroa or Russell 
Jacob.

<HEADLINE> IOC May End Profit-Sharing Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- With sponsors skittish over the Olympic bribery  
scandal, organizers of the Sydney Games were urged by an IOC 
executive Tuesday to plow a $66 million profit-sharing deal back 
into the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would solve the financing issue in a stroke of a pen,''  
International Olympic Committee marketing director Michael Payne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising money from corporate sponsors for the 2000 Sydney Games  
has become a major concern in the wake of the Olympic corruption 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	With Sydney about $130 million short of its target for  
sponsorship revenues, Payne said the controversial profit deal 
should be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way the games should be compromised because of a  
profit deal that we were opposed to,'' he told The Associated Press 
in a telephone interview from IOC headquarters in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. ``This money should be put back into the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said the IOC warned the Australians three years ago  
against projecting a surplus for the games. Sydney organizers have 
predicted a $17.7 million surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC was saying, `This is crazy to be talking about a  
profit now. You should wait until the day after the closing 
ceremony,''' Payne said. ``For various reasons, they wanted to lock 
down issues on profit two or three years ago. Maybe that should be 
reopened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the IOC's contract with Olympic cities, 90  
percent of any surplus goes to the host country and 10 percent to 
the IOC. Of the 90 percent set aside for the host country, 10 
percent goes to the national Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit-sharing arrangement for Sydney has gone through  
several changes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deal with the New South Wales government, the Australian  
Olympic Committee agreed to give up its veto power over key 
decisions in exchange for a guaranteed $66 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the NSW government effectively bought out the AOC's right  
to the money, and the funds go to the AOC whether there is a 
surplus or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``That money has now been taken off the balance books,'' Payne  
said. ``In hindsight, it might have been premature to talk about 
profit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's share of the profit deal was eventually capped at  
$8.95 million. The IOC has said it would earmark most of its share 
to a special fund for sports programs in Australia and the rest of 
Oceania. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has made clear  
the international committee is ready to help out if the organizing 
committee and government request it, including reconsidering the 
IOC's profit share. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem the first place to start is to look at the whole  
profit deal, which we thought was a bad idea in the first place,'' 
Payne said. ``We would never do a deal of this nature again. Never 
in a million years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the corruption scandals involving Olympic bid  
cities, Sydney was struggling to meet its $1.65 billion budget, 
falling short of its $542 million sponsorship target and leading to 
fears that budget cutbacks that could affect the games. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Olympics Minister Michael Knight suggested for the  
first time Tuesday that the Olympics could get by without the extra 
sponsorship revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can run a pretty fantastic Olympic Games on $2.4 billion  
(Australian, or $1.52 million),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said Sydney organizers erred by setting their latest  
sponsorship revenues too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``SOCOG has twice met their targets, and got the most successful  
marketing program we've ever seen for the games,'' he said. ``If 
it's a problem, it's because they were too successful early on. 
They allowed the targets to continue to be raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the current target is wrong. It never should have been  
raised to this height. It's like a high jumper. You can keep 
raising the height, but eventually he can no longer make it over 
the bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, who heads the IOC coordination commission for the  
Sydney Games, said he is optimistic that Sydney will raise enough 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, there is still some revenue to be found, but it's too  
soon to be worried,'' he said in a phone interview from Belgium. 
``I'm very relaxed about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are vigilant. But today no one can say there is a danger, a  
shortfall, a problem. We'll have a better idea in June after ticket 
sales have started and new efforts have begun to find new sources 
of revenue.''

<HEADLINE>  Protest in California Over Ho Poster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- Rows of police in helmets and flak  
jackets faced off against hundreds of demonstrators angry over the 
rehanging of a poster of communist leader Ho Chi Minh. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Saigon video shop owner Truong Van Tran had announced his  
intention to return to his Hi Tek video store on Monday and replace 
the wall-sized portrait. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating Tran's return, about 600 demonstrators gathered  
outside the store, many waving the yellow and red flags of what was 
once South Vietnam. Two men built symbolic ``cages'' and climbed 
inside to demonstrate what they said was done to prisoners during 
the Vietnam war. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran later told a television reporter that he didn't return to  
the store because he was told he would be arrested. But hundreds 
remained just in case, standing vigil outside the strip mall store. 
</P>
<P>
	Tran's poster of the late communist leader outraged many in  
Little Saigon, home to 200,000 Vietnamese-Americans. Some fled 
South Vietnam in 1975 after it fell to communist North Vietnam, and 
others left nearly a decade later when they were freed from prison 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-communists have picketed the shop almost daily since  
community leaders learned last month that Tran had placed the 
poster beside a flag of communist Vietnam in his shop window. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a judge affirmed Tran had a First Amendment right to  
display them. However, after Tran tried to rehang the poster after 
the court ruling, he was attacked by protesters and hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were arrested during Monday's protest for failing  
to disperse, police said. The demonstrations occurred at the start 
of the Vietnamese Tet Festival, the celebration of the Lunar New 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Protester Hai Long said he does not mind giving up a celebration  
to demonstrate against the communist display. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tet is important, but it cannot be a good time with this sort  
of thing in our community,'' said Long, who lost his right arm in 
battle and was imprisoned for 13 years in Vietnam from 1975 to 
1987. ``Fighting communism matters more than celebration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tran has said he is not a communist and does not support the  
communist leadership in Vietnam. He has never publicly explained 
why he set up the display.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Restores Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- As American Airlines restores operations to  
normal, the nation's second-largest airline is expected to take 
steps to win back the business of passengers alienated by 
cancellations during a pilots sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	But experts say that because of high demand for seats, travelers  
shouldn't expect big fare cuts after this labor dispute. What's 
more, American already is cutting back spring flight schedules in 
anticipation that its pilots will refuse voluntary overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer frequent-flier  
magazine, said he expects the airline to use frequent flier miles 
as an apology rather than money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're going to see a lot of big fare slashes.  
American is more conservative. They don't like to do things 
everyone else would match,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hotard, a spokesman for American's parent company, AMR  
Corp., said because of federal requirements he could not comment on 
whether there would be a fare sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline saw more than 6,000 of its  
flights canceled over the past 10 days due to a dispute with its 
pilots union that degenerated into a sickout. About 600,000 
travelers were inconvenienced by scrubbed takeoffs and delays on 
American flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Martin returned home to Miami Tuesday on a United  
Airlines flight. Delays and cancellations prompted her to scrap 
plans to return from Puerto Rico on an American flight Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really doubt I would ever fly American again,'' Martin said.  
``I know it will be an inconvenience to myself and it probably 
wouldn't make a difference to their business but I think I owe it 
to myself to stop flying American after what we've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, airlines regularly coaxed customers back with  
reduced prices. Northwest Airlines ran an extended fare sale last 
year while it weathered months of labor unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, American has usually used frequent flier miles to entice  
travelers. When pilots briefly walked off the job on Valentine's 
Day in 1997, the airline offered double bonus miles rather than 
cost reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the savviest in using those miles and programs to  
satisfy people's complaints,'' said Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
	To appease travel agents who have been overwhelmed by the  
changes in schedules, American on Monday decided to pay commissions 
for tickets that were later refunded because of the sickout. 
Commissions are not usually paid in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism experts expect the public and travel agents to continue  
to book with American. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think memories are short lived in these situations.  
Travelers will base their choice on price rather than short-term 
problems with service,'' said Sheryl Spivack, a tourism specialist 
at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Monroe of Boston, who was boarding an American flight at Los  
Angeles International Airport Tuesday, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``American Airlines is usually my first choice. It won't change.  
I've had good experience with them in the past, plus I'm in their 
frequent flier program,'' Monroe said. ``I don't hold it against 
the airline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While passengers saw flight schedules return to normal on  
Tuesday, the airline continued to negotiate with the Allied Pilots 
Association over the issue that started the whole scheduling snarl 
to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants the carrier to immediately put pilots from  
recently purchased Reno Air at the bottom of its seniority list, 
raising salaries for many pilots at both airlines. AMR says it will 
take as long as 18 months to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, the pilots followed a federal judge's order and placed  
$10 million, or one quarter of the union's assets, with the court. 
The money will go toward a fine that is expected to be levied 
against APA at a scheduled hearing on Wednesday. U.S. District 
Judge Joe Kendall ruled on Saturday that the union did not do 
enough to prevent the sickout once he ordered pilots to return to 
their cockpits. 
</P>
<P>
	Because both sides seem unwilling to budge during the talks,  
American Airlines has cut 45 to 50 flights a day from its schedule, 
a reduction of about 2 percent. The airline says it does not 
believe pilots will volunteer for extra overtime even though the 
union leadership is saying it is not encouraging pilots to refuse 
the extra flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots can be contractually scheduled to fly up to 78 hours a  
month. They can voluntarily fly five additional hours during the 
same time period.

<HEADLINE> Policy of Taping Customers Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A furniture chain's practice of using secret  
cameras to tape sales pitches will be revised after it was 
disclosed that a saleswoman was fired for refusing to take part in 
what she saw as a violation of customers' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	American TV, Appliance &AMP; Furniture, citing ``recent customer  
feedback,'' said in a statement Monday that from now on it will ask 
customers in advance if they mind being taped. The nine-store 
chain, based in Madison, used the tapes to train its workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Kusic, 36, who worked at the chain's store in Waukesha,  
said she lost her job Thursday after objecting to the secret taping 
of customers as she talked with them. 
</P>
<P>
	She said wearing the recording devices was not a condition of  
her employment when she was hired about a year ago. The taping was 
started since then. Signs posted in stores told customers that 
American electronically monitors sales transactions on a random 
basis, but did not specify how it is done. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Mixtacki, senior vice president of finances for American  
TV &AMP; Appliance of Madison Inc., said all of American's sales 
professionals in nine stores had been required to use recording 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices were disguised in lapel pins, tie tacks or  
zipper-covered planning books, he said. Salespeople were expected 
to produce four videotaped examples of how they answered a 
customer's needs.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Courts College Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole remembers the challenges of the  
classroom. So, as she laid out a platform centered on teacher 
quality, she stressed to college leaders gathered here that she 
wasn't going to bash educators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've refused to join those who often find it expedient to turn  
teachers into rhetorical punching bags,'' said Mrs. Dole, who 
described her own experience teaching 11th grade history in 
suburban Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, who is considering a bid for the presidency, told the  
American Council on Education conference Monday that she would 
champion higher learning, particularly as schools look to augment 
their budgets with federal research funds. The council is a 
nonprofit lobbying group for all accredited college and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where the future will take me,'' she told more  
than 1,000 educators, ``but I do know that if you are recruiting 
soldiers in the battle to strengthen federal investment in 
research, I'm ready to enlist right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also praised school choice and accountability, education  
policies that are popular with fellow Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, who has held cabinet posts in the Republican Bush and  
Reagan administrations, has left little doubt where she might be 
heading. Last week in New Hampshire, one of the early primary 
states, she said America needed a president ``worthy of her 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls find that the 62-year-old former Red Cross president is  
among the top GOP contenders and find that education will be a key 
issue in the 2000 race. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole told the educators that while university tenure and  
financing issues dominate discussion of higher education, the focus 
should be on turning out teachers better equipped to instruct this 
generation of students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be a zero tolerance policy toward bad teaching,''  
she said. ``If teaching is to become a prestigious profession, 
teachers must undergo rigorous training and hold prestigious 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the results of poorly focused learning,'' she  
said. ``Our colleges and universities have to pick up the slack.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq Threatens U.S. Allies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Baghdad warned U.S. allies today that they  
will pay a high price for playing host to American and British 
warplanes that patrol ``no-fly'' zones over Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The warnings carried by Iraq's state-controlled media came one  
day after Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Baghdad 
would attack a Turkish base for U.S. warplanes if the jets continue 
patrolling Iraqi skies. It was the first time in years Iraq has 
threatened to attack its northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has promised swift U.S.  
retaliation in the event of an Iraqi attack. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. jets based at Incirlik, in southern Turkey, have struck  
almost daily at Iraqi defense sites after being targeted while 
patrolling the no-fly zone over the Iraq's north. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ankara, Deputy Iraqi Prime Minister Tariq Aziz today defended  
his government's threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. and British planes are killing Iraqis, are destroying  
Iraqi property and this is not acceptable,'' Aziz said. ``A Turkish 
airbase should not be used by the Americans and British to hurt 
Iraqis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has also threatened to strike at bases in Saudi Arabia and  
Kuwait, from which U.S. and British jets patrol a southern no-fly 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time has run out for American and British aggressors and those  
supporting them,'' the al-Jumhouriya newspaper said in a front-page 
editorial. ``They shall pay a heavy price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Qadissiya, the newspaper of the Iraqi armed forces, said that  
it ``must be made clear and obvious to them that ... the price for 
their ongoing aggression will be very high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish officials did not immediately react to the remarks.  
</P>
<P>
	In Kuwait, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Iraqi threats  
reflect Baghdad's ``aggressive intention toward its neighbors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Ramadan said in an interview with Radio Monte Carlo  
that ``if the Turkish base continues attacking Iraq it will 
certainly be (targeted) like other bases'' in the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramadan made his remarks just hours after Aziz held talks with  
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit in Ankara. Aziz went to Turkey 
to try to persuade the Turkish government to halt the flights from 
Incirlik base. Ecevit, however, insisted that use of the base would 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. warplanes attacked Iraqi defense sites in northern Iraq on  
Monday, the Defense Department said in Washington. The planes 
returned safely to Incirlik, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq said Western planes also had carried out attacks in the  
southern no-fly zone, killing five civilians and injuring another 
22. The U.S. statement made no mention of strikes in the south, and 
the Iraqi claims could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The no-fly zones were set up after the 1991 Gulf War to prevent  
Iraqi aircraft from attacking Kurdish rebels in the north and 
Shiite Muslims in the south of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has never accepted the validity of the zones, which were  
created by the United States, Britain and France and are not 
authorized by the United Nations. France later withdrew its 
participation in the enforcement of the zones. 
</P>
<P>
	Aziz, who traveled to Turkey through the Iraqi Kurdish areas,  
questioned the validity of the zones. 
</P>
<P>
	``They claim they are protecting the Kurds from Iraqi  
government,'' he said. ``Then how can an Iraqi deputy prime 
minister travel so easily?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States says Iraq has violated the zones 90 times  
since it began challenging them in December. U.S. and British 
planes have retaliated by attacking more than 40 Iraqi air defense 
sites. Iraq says at least 32 people have been killed in these 
attacks.

<HEADLINE> IOC Extends Deadline for Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Less than a quarter of Olympic  
bidders responded to the IOC's request for information on 
rule-breaking behavior by its members, the committee said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Replies were received from 11 cities, while two other national  
Olympic committees were given more time to file their reports, the 
International Olympic Committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the replies were not disclosed and the groups granted  
extensions were not identified. A spokesman said the letters would 
be passed on to the special IOC panel investigating allegations of 
impropriety by members and would remain confidential until a report 
is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC sent out letters requesting information by Monday from  
54 cities that bid for the games from 1996 onward. The initiative 
was prompted by the bribery scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Japanese Olympic officials said they would tell the  
IOC that nine IOC members may have broken rules during Nagano's 
successful bid for the 1992 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, bid official John Fahey said Tuesday he told the IOC  
there was no fresh evidence of wrongdoing by IOC members during the 
city's successful quest for the 2000 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every director has responded in writing and all directors,  
with one exception, have stated that they have no evidence of any 
improper conduct by any IOC member with regard to the Sydney bid,'' 
Fahey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sydney bid team member Bruce Baird has previously told  
the IOC executive board of a matter concerning one IOC member, whom 
Fahey said had since resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney organizers have launched an independent inquiry into the  
bid process, with the investigation to be made public on March 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Another winning city -- Atlanta -- failed to make the IOC  
deadline, although bid officials said they did not find any 
wrongdoing during an internal review. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee said the results of the review by  
former officials of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games 
would be submitted by March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``ACOG has advised us they have no information relevant to the  
IOC request,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran said.

<HEADLINE> Riley Backs Teacher Licensing Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Education Secretary Richard Riley proposed  
Tuesday a national model for states to use in licensing teachers as 
a way to improve schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``A growing number of school districts are throwing a warm body  
into a classroom, closing the door and hoping for the best,'' Riley 
said in sixth annual address on the state of education, held this 
year at California State University in Long Beach. ``This is not 
the way to reach for high standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley devoted much of the speech to describing the model, which  
includes testing, but insisted it is not an attempt to mandate a 
federal policy on teacher quality, which congressional leaders and 
many teachers' groups oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	State licensing varies; at least 38 states require some sort of  
test or performance review. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers  
union, said she supports Riley's teacher-quality model. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are foward-looking proposals,'' she said. ``I don't  
think this is federalizing education at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley previously had told Congress that some way of making sure  
states adopt tougher, more-relevant teacher exams would be included 
in Clinton administration proposals this year for the law governing 
most education programs. But he said Tuesday there would be no 
federal stick or carrot to encourage states to improve teacher 
licensing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My suggestion shouldn't be the last word and I'm sure it will  
not be,'' Riley told the audience. ``Let's put our thinking caps 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But members of Congress expressed some caution about the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., who heads the House Education and  
Workforce Committee, said the idea has merit. But ``the type of 
teacher training programs and standards that may be good for 
schools in New England may not be good for schools in California,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other GOP leaders said they want to see concrete plans for all  
of Clinton's education ideas this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't received a single legislative proposal and there is  
no indication we are going to receive any, anytime soon,'' said Joe 
Karpinski, a spokesman for the Senate Health, Education, Labor and 
Pensions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Riley mapped out the licensing model to bring  
states together on the issue of teacher certification. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can no longer fiddle around the edges of how we recruit,  
prepare, retain and reward America's teachers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the model:  
</P>
<P>
	--New teachers would get a three-year maximum initial license  
after passing a written exam and an evaluation of classroom 
performance. Teachers who perform poorly could be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	--The majority of teachers could get a professional license,  
provided they meet state standards and win the approval of a panel 
of teachers and one supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	--The nation's top-paid teachers would be certified under a  
voluntary advanced license. Experienced teachers could choose to 
undergo a tough certification program much like the current 
master-teacher program under the National Board for Professional 
Teaching Standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley also suggested states and districts base a teacher's  
salary on the teacher's type of license, years of teaching 
experience and demonstrated knowledge and skills valued by the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	And he proposed a national job bank to match teachers with  
school districts to address the need for an estimated 2.2 million 
additional teachers in coming years because of the growing number 
of young students from the so-called baby boom echo. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley also highlighted administration goals like class-size  
reduction, school construction, after-school programs and increased 
classroom technology. He also stressed foreign language learning, 
adding that every American student should speak at least two 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's move beyond the American habit of stumbling along,  
phrase book in hand, when we visit a foreign country,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Sees U.S. Cultural War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A prominent conservative, giving voice to  
frustration within the Republican Party over President Clinton's 
acquittal, is telling conservative leaders that American society is 
``approaching barbarism'' and is out of step with their political 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I no longer believe that there is a moral majority,'' Paul  
Weyrich wrote in a letter dated Tuesday to several hundred 
conservatives. ``I do not believe that a majority of Americans 
actually share our values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation in Washington,  
argues that it may be time to ``drop out of this culture'' -- 
perhaps even abandoning efforts to influence the American political 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some sort of quarantine,'' he wrote in the letter  
obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no other leading conservatives have gone that far,  
Weyrich's letter underscores the level of resentment and anger over 
Clinton's acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there really were a moral majority out there, Bill Clinton  
would have been driven out of office month ago,'' Weyrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are angry that he got off,'' said Phyllis  
Schlafly, head of the Eagle Forum. ``They just don't understand it. 
They're shaking their heads: What is the problem?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Coalition director Randy Tate said there is  
``considerable frustration'' over the acquittal because ``it makes 
it tough to teach kids right from wrong, in the sense that the 
president doesn't know right from wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde, who led the  
prosecution team against Clinton, told senators toward the end of 
the trial, ``I wonder if, after this culture war is over that we 
are engaged in, an America will survive that will be worth fighting 
to defend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Weyrich goes further than most other conservative  
leaders, criticizing not only the president and GOP leaders in 
Congress -- but society in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Tate, for example, said conservatives ``are increasingly part of  
the mainstream,'' even on issues such as abortion, because they 
have increased efforts to influence the political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlafly, also departing with Weyrich, said a majority of  
Americans still embrace conservative values. And she says Clinton's 
victory had more to do with politics than morality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only partially a moral problem. I think there is so much  
the Republican Congress can do in so many ways to grab the 
leadership and yet they continue to play a defensive game,'' she 
said. ``Republicans have had Congress since January 1995 and what 
do we have to show for it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich, while a leading conservative intellectual, does not  
command a large grassroots organization or necessarily speak for a 
large number of conservatives. He led a campaign to rally social 
conservatives behind a Republican presidential candidate in 2000, 
but the effort failed after the prospect he favored, Sen. John 
Ashcroft of Missouri, decided not to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich is plowing relatively new ground by suggesting that the  
conservative movement cannot succeed in today's culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The culture we are living in becomes an ever-wider sewer. In  
truth, I think we are caught up in a cultural collapse of historic 
proportions, a collapse so great that it simply overwhelms 
politics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing that it may be time for ``separation'' from society,  
Weyrich points to conservatives who teach their children at home, 
form private courts or get rid of their televisions. ``I think that 
we have to look at a whole series of possibilities for bypassing 
the institutions that are controlled by the enemy,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He offered to hold a meeting to discuss the movement's next  
step. ``I don't have all the answers or even all the questions. But 
I know that what we have been doing for 30 years hasn't worked, 
that while we have been fighting and winning in politics, our 
culture has decayed into something approaching barbarism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Weyrich said he was not suggesting that  
conservatives stop fighting. ``I'm just suggesting that the chance 
of victory that we thought was excellent is now not in the cards,'' 
he said. ``We have to take the appropriate action.''

<HEADLINE> Julie Krone Wins 3,500th Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Julie Krone rode May B A Walk to her 3,500th  
career victory Tuesday at the Fair Grounds, making her the first 
female jockey to reach that milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	After posing for pictures with her fellow jockeys in the  
winner's circle, she ran onto the track and did a backwards 
handspring for joy. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory came eight years and three days after Krone's first  
career winner, a $3,500 claimer named Lord Farkle in the sixth race 
at Tampa Bay Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, from Colt's Neck, N.J., rode three winners Saturday and  
four Sunday to start the Mardi Gras race card with 3,498 career 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
	She won on Queen of the Hill in Tuesday's first race, May B A  
Walk in the third and Geiger Geisha in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Her career purse earnings are now close to $80 million, more  
than four times the total of No. 2 all-time female jockey Donna 
Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Krone came to the Fair Grounds this season looking for a relaxed  
atmosphere, a track where she could enjoy her work and boost her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	She was leading jockey at Gulfstream when she broke her left  
wrist and hand in a spill in January 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Depression and self-doubt set in and she saw a psychiatrist.  
Although she was still competitive, she wasn't winning like before.

<HEADLINE> Listeria Found at Milk Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- A milk processing plant that voluntarily  
recalled some of its products earlier this month was contaminated 
with Listeria bacteria, state officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing confirmed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes at the  
Kohler Mix Specialties dairy processing plant in White Bear Lake, 
said Michael Schommer, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Foods, the St. Louis Park-based parent company of  
Kohler, issued a nationwide recall Feb. 6 of 55 kinds of 
quart-sized and smaller cartons of dairy products packaged at the 
White Bear Lake plant and sold under several brand names. The 
recall amounted to 300,000 to 400,000 gallons of products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department examined 47 products and 87  
environmental samples from the plant. Nine of the product samples 
and six of the environmental samples tested positive for the 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only patterns that we were able to find during our  
investigation is the presence of Listeria near and under packaging 
machines but nowhere within the product zone or product contact 
surfaces,'' said Doug Engebretson of the Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't known how the bacteria got into the milk. That  
uncertainty isn't unusual, Engebretson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health Department officials said no illnesses have been reported  
related to the recalled products. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Kohler packages small-quantity products for other dairy  
companies that don't have specialty-packaging equipment in their 
own plants. The recalled products were packaged for Becker's, Dairy 
Fresh, Hardees, Kemps, Kohler Mix, Land O'Lakes, Muller Pinehurst, 
Oak Grove, Perkins, Roundy's and Wendy's. They have the plant code 
of PLT 27-416 printed on the top of the carton alongside the 
product's expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kohler Mix hot line, for further information about the  
recall, is 1-800-446-0994.

<HEADLINE> Physicist Kenry Kendall Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAKULLA SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- Physicist Henry W. Kendall, a Nobel  
Prize-winner for physics for his work on the building blocks of 
matter and a co-founder of the antiwar group Union of Concerned 
Scientists, died during an underwater photography dive. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, 72, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology, was diving with a National Geographic magazine mapping 
team at Wakulla Springs State Park when his body was found in 
shallow water, Wakulla County Sheriff's Capt. Gene McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had not yet determined whether Kendall died of a  
heart attack or encountered a problem in the water and drowned. 
There was air left in his tank, McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was planned for today.  
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, along with Jerome I. Friedman and Richard E. Taylor,  
worked for years starting in the late 1960s uncovering evidence 
that protons and neutrons, once thought to be basic building blocks 
of matter, were made up of smaller components called quarks. They 
all shared the Nobel prize in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a remarkable discovery at the time and contributed to  
the deeper understanding of things,'' he once said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall was a founding member of the Union of Concerned  
Scientists in 1969. He had served as that organization's chairman 
since 1973, leading efforts to warn against the dangers of nuclear 
weapons, safety hazards in nuclear power industry and space-based 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the group, he challenged President Reagan's ``star  
wars'' defense system proposal -- a system of satellites to defend 
American cities against nuclear attack. Kendall had also helped 
brief President Clinton in 1997 on global warming. His organization 
had studied the greenhouse effect, which many scientists say is 
raising temperatures around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all in a bit of a state of shock over here,'' Howard  
Ris, the organization's executive director, said this morning. 
``It's almost too trite to say, but he was a great inspiration for 
all of us and he had the rare gift to see where the world was 
headed and tried to make it a better place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ris said Kendall was a cautious, experienced diver and  
underwater photographer and a longtime friend of the late undersea 
explorer Jacques Cousteau. National Geographic spokeswoman Barbara 
Moffet in Washington said Kendall was not part of the group's 
project in Florida but was accompanying a friend who was in the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said Kendall was taking underwater photographs by  
himself in about eight to 10 feet of water Monday afternoon only a 
few feet from the shore. 
</P>
<P>
	A diver who encountered Kendall about 4:30 p.m. said everything  
seemed fine, McCarthy said. A half-hour later, another diver found 
him on the bottom of the springs. Kendall was flown to Tallahassee 
Memorial Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall received a Ph.D. in nuclear and atomic physics from  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1954. He taught at 
Stanford University from 1956 to 1961, when he took a teaching spot 
at MIT. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Kendall and his brother were large shareholders in  
the family business, Kendall Co., which made Curad bandages, Curity 
diapers and hospital equipment. Colgate Palmolive Co. bought the 
business in 1972 for $512 million.

<HEADLINE> Patriots' Edwards Return in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- New England Patriots running back Robert Edwards'  
return to football was in doubt Tuesday after doctors discovered 
nerve damage in his lower leg while performing surgery on his left 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards had the four-hour surgery at Massachusetts General  
Hospital after injuring himself in a beach flag football game. The 
rookie, who rushed for 1,115 will miss the entire 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors were able to repair damage done to four knee ligaments,  
but also found the nerve damage, the team said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Bertram Zarins, the team doctor, said he was ``pessimistic''  
about Edwards returning to football but did not rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards will undergo a long rehabilitation process. The process  
will continue for 4-6 weeks, but the recovery of the nerve function 
will be the biggest hurdle, Zarins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very difficult to get stability in that knee  
again,'' said Dr. John Richmond, director of sports medicine at New 
England Medical Center in Boston, prior to the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to worry about both stability and flexibility, and  
that's huge for a football player, particularly a running back,'' 
Richmond told the Boston Herald on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards went down hard during the pre-Pro Bowl festivities game  
on Feb. 5. in Honolulu, with his left knee turning one way in the 
sand, and his 218-pound body the other. 
</P>
<P>
	According to doctors, the joint was dislocated, there was artery  
and nerve damage and three of the four ligaments were torn. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, questions have arisen as to how the injury affects  
the five-year, $5.75 million contract Edwards signed with the 
Patriots after he was selected out of Georgia in the first round of 
last year's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe, citing an unidentified source, said the  
Patriots still owe Edwards at least $3 million for the remaining 
four years on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Globe said, the NFL collective bargaining agreement  
says that a player's contract is covered for injury only when an 
injury occurs during a league game, or a team-supervised workout. 
Edwards, therefore, was not covered when injured in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe also said Edwards and the other rookies in the flag  
football game signed releases, absolving the NFL from 
responsibility in case of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, the Patriots announced the signing of veteran defensive  
tackle Henry Thomas, a free agent, to a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not announced, but the Globe said it  
was worth more than $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 277-pound Thomas finished the season with 75  
tackles and 6 1/2 sacks.

<HEADLINE> American Flights Nearly All Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Operations at American Airlines were nearly back  
on track today, a sharp contrast to the past 10 days during which 
more than 6,000 flights were canceled due to a pilot sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth-based airline has canceled 56 flights, according  
to information posted on the carrier's web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Tim Smith called operations ``virtually normal today  
as the pilots' sick list continues to shrink.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, talks between American's parent company, AMR Corp.,  
and the Allied Pilots Association over the integration of the 
recently purchased Reno Air were scheduled to pick up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations continued into the evening and will resume  
today,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks broke down earlier this month over a dispute over how the  
Reno pilots were being paid caused pilots to start calling in sick 
and refusing to work overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 800 of American's 9,400 pilots were still listed as  
sick Monday, compared to the nearly 2,500 who declared themselves 
unfit to fly Thursday and Friday, American officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, pilots have been taking themselves off  
the sick list at a rapid rate since Saturday after a federal judge 
ruled held the union and two top board members in contempt and 
promised sizable fines against them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 -- or roughly 11 percent -- of the 2,250 flights  
scheduled were canceled Monday because some pilots weren't 
immediately available for flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman John Hotard compared the impact on the airline's  
flight system to bad weather over the airline's Chicago, Miami or 
Dallas-Fort Worth hubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pilots complained that the number of pilots on the sick  
list could have been inflated because they had been trying to 
remove themselves, but normal procedures were suspended. Instead, 
they were told they had to meet with their chief medical officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotard said that was true for only 12 or 13 pilots who face  
possible disciplinary action for flying as passengers while they 
were on the sick list. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall threatened a ``significant''  
fine against the pilots' union Saturday, saying that the union did 
not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after he 
ordered the union to end the sickout last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge required the union place $10 million, or one-quarter  
of the union's net worth, with the court in preparation of making 
his final decision this Wednesday. He also ordered union president 
Rich LaVoy and vice president Brian Mayhew to remit a total of 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 6,000 flights have been canceled since the work action  
began, costing American between $67 million and $90 million, 
according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR Corp. The final 
total has not been projected. 
</P>
<P>
	American also will see revenue reductions in the future. The  
airline said it will reduce its schedule 2 percent in the spring, 
or about 45-50 flights a day, because it does not believe pilots 
will volunteer for extra overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute is over how Reno Air pilots have been paid since AMR  
took control of the low-cost carrier last December. AMR wants to 
pay the pilots higher rates as they are retrained, but the union 
believes their contract guarantees the pilots are paid more from 
the purchase date. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot is paid. AMR said the pilot union's 
demands to add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale quickly would 
cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said the sickout had not changed their original  
negotiating positions. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, neither the company or union has requested a federal  
mediator or binding arbitration in the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Warm Weather Send Crude Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures tumbled Tuesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange as mild winter weather pushed heating oil prices to a 
record low. 
</P>
<P>
	Precious metals and coffee futures also fell sharply in a  
general rout on U.S. commodities markets that drove the Bridge 
Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 products to its lowest 
since July 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products fell as investors bet upcoming weekly  
inventory data would show supplies continue to build as mild 
weather dims demand and world producers continue to pump more oil 
than the world currently needs. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Northeast and Midwest, the two largest heating  
markets, have had several cold snaps, both regions have generally 
enjoyed a second consecutive mild winter, allowing consumers to 
turn down their thermostats and supplies to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. supplies of heating oil last week stood 17 percent higher  
than a year earlier and 23 percent higher than the five-year 
average, according to the American Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	That group on Wednesday is expected to release its latest  
inventory figures, and analysts said supplies likely will continue 
to grow even as refiners begin concentrating more on producing 
gasoline for the summer driving season. With just a few weeks left 
to go during the peak heating demand season, market participants 
hold out little hope for a turnaround in fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	Depressing energy prices further are fears the 11-member  
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at its next meeting 
in March will be unable to come up with concrete ideas for 
stabilizing prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for March delivery fell 51 cents to $11.37 a  
barrel; March heating oil fell .85 cent to 29.52 cents a gallon; 
March unleaded gasoline fell .73 cent to 32.92 cents a gallon; 
March natural gas fell 1.2 cents to $1.795 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures tumbled 1.3 percent, while silver fell 3.8 percent  
on the New York Mercantile Exchange as the U.S. dollar jumped to 
its highest in nearly three months against the Japanese yen, making 
dollar-based commodities more expensive to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	April gold fell $3.80 to $287.40 an ounce; March silver fell  
21.7 cents to $5.445 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices succumbed on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York to fears the U.S. Green Coffee Association would report a 
sharp increase in inventories as Central American coffee comes to 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants drove down prices 4.7 percent, to their  
lowest since October, amid expectations the association would 
report inventories rose by 250,000 to 300,000 bags weighing 132 
pounds each. The group after trading had ended said stocks in 
January jumped 343,000 bags to 1.751 million bags. 
</P>
<P>
	March arabica coffee fell 4.95 cents to $1.01 a pound.

<HEADLINE> Steel Industry Files Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leading U.S. steel companies and the United  
Steelworkers Union filed more import complaints Tuesday, accusing 
eight countries of dumping steel at below production costs and home 
market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The action against Czech Republic, France, India, Indonesia,  
Italy, Japan, Macedonia and South Korea came just days after the 
industry won a ruling that Japan and Brazil had illegally dumped 
hot-rolled steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The new anti-dumping complaints involve a different type of  
steel, cut-to-length plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of that steel product have increased by 521 percent from  
those eight countries since 1995, the industry said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint news release, Bethlehem Steel Corp., Gulf States  
Steel Inc., IPSCO Steel, Inc., Tuscaloosa Steel Co., USX Corp. and 
the union said those eight countries were responsible for pushing 
down prices that forced American factories to significantly cut 
back production. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions of these foreign producers have caused serious  
injury to our domestic industry,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission has 45 days and the  
Commerce Department 160 days to make a preliminary determination of 
injury that could lead to new tariffs on steel exports from those 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Still pending is a Clinton administration decision on a deal  
with Russia that could allow that nation to avoid tariffs on its 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a deal would anger the American steel industry, which does  
not want to see Russia given a guaranteed price or slice of the 
U.S. market, but the administration is reluctant to impose a 
trading penalty that could aggravate Russia's troubled economy.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Lower at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen early Wednesday as  
the market responded to Japan's recent steps to lower long-term 
interest rates. Japanese stock prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.12 yen at midday, up 1.08 yen from Tuesday  
in Tokyo but below its New York level of 118.74 yen. The New York 
rate was the highest level for the U.S. currency since Dec. 9, when 
it hit 118.75 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average lost 19.95 points, or 0.14 percent, to  
close the morning session at 14,212.69 points. On Wednesday, the 
average closed up 177.92 points, or 1.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar continued a rally begun on  
Tuesday following an announcement by the Japanese Finance Ministry 
that it would lower the yields of government bonds. Rising yields 
were behind last month's gaining of the yen's value. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Bank of Japan lowered its target for overnight  
call money -- the rate banks charge each other for unsecured 
short-term loans -- to 0.15 percent from the previous 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates in Japan would weaken the yen by making  
yen-denominated investment less attractive to investors, but 
helpful to companies by lowering borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.930  
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.985 percent, driving its price 
up to 98.97 yen from 98.54 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 132.60 yen, up from  
131.16 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei average fell slightly as  
investors sold shares to take profits on Tuesday's sharp rise, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has changed really. There aren't that many reasons to  
buy stocks,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock 
division at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``While company earnings may stabilize with the government's  
efforts, there is still no sign of an economic recovery,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 0.33 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1101.35 points. 
The TOPIX closed up 6.66 points, or 0.61 percent, the day before.

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Suspect Tape Played </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- A detective testified Tuesday that just  
hours after a school shooting rampage last spring, suspect Kip 
Kinkel pleaded with police officers to ``Just kill me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel, then 15, was accused of killing two students and  
wounding 22 others. His parents were later found shot to death in 
their home. He had been expelled from Springfield's Thurston High 
School a day before the May 21 shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	New details from the aftermath of the shooting emerged during  
pretrial hearings Tuesday. Along with testimony, prosecutors played 
a videotaped walk-through of the rampage made in the cafeteria 
where the shooting had occurred hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	On the tape, detectives ask Kinkel why he did it. ``I had no  
other choice,'' he replies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel then tells police how he walked into the cafeteria  
wearing a trenchcoat and armed with three guns and two knives. ``I 
started shooting,'' he said on the tape in a barely audible 
monotone. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-minute tape was played for the judge and attorneys as  
evidence in a defense motion to leave it out of Kinkel's scheduled 
April trial.

<P>
	Kinkel, 16, was not at the hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	Lane Circuit Judge Jack Mattison did not immediately rule on the  
defense request to suppress the tape or on another motion to delay 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel's attorneys say they need more time to prepare. They have  
yet to say whether they will claim Kinkel suffered from some mental 
defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, detectives described how Kinkel had extra  
bullets taped to his chest so he could kill himself and begged 
officers to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Alan Warthen said police had to subdue Kinkel with  
pepper spray after he lunged at them with a knife he had taped to 
his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw that he had a folding pocket knife in the open position.  
He pushed himself back from the wall and lunged towards me,'' 
Warthen said. ``He started screaming at me, `Just kill me! Just 
shoot me!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Warthen said police then found Kinkel had taped one 22-caliber  
bullet and one 9mm round to his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said in case he ran out of ammunition he would have one of  
each for the different weapons he had to reload and kill himself,'' 
Warthen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warthen said Kinkel also described how he shot his father in the  
head and then waited for his mother to get home. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was explaining how he killed his mother -- he just went  
off,'' Warthen said. ``He started talking about a voice in his 
head. He started banging his head against the wall a couple of 
times. I put my hand on his shoulder and said, `Kip, calm down.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel is charged as an adult with four counts of aggravated  
murder and numerous other felony counts. If convicted, he faces 
life in prison without parole.

	Kurdish Rebel Leader Held in Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was  
arrested after waging a 14-year guerrilla war for autonomy from 
Turkey, setting off massive protests today as enraged Kurds seized 
embassies and held hostages across Europe. Breaking down doors and 
smashing windows, Kurdish protesters occupied Greek embassies and 
consulates in at least 21 European cities, as well as a consulate 
in Vancouver, Canada. Turkish officials said Ocalan's capture was a 
victory over his rebel movement and hoped for an end to the long 
conflict that has claimed 37,000 lives.

	Clinton May Be Cited in Jones Case

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The judge who oversaw Paula Jones'  
sexual harassment suit against President Clinton said today she'll 
consider citing the president for contempt because of his testimony 
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But U.S. District 
Judge Susan Webber Wright said she would step aside from the case 
if she were asked to do so by attorneys because of her contact with 
a House impeachment case manager. Wright raised the possibility of 
contempt in a footnote to her decision on Sept. 1 to release a 
transcript of Clinton's testimony in a deposition in the Jones 
case.

James Byrd Jr. Byrd, 49, who was black, was chained to the back of 
a pickup truck June 7 and dragged for three miles as his body was 
ripped to pieces. King is the first of three white men charged in 
the crime to stand trial. The jury consists of 11 whites and one 
black. Jasper County, from which the jurors were drawn, is 18

	Riley Backs Teacher Licensing Plan

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Education Secretary Richard Riley proposed a  
national model for states to use in licensing teachers as a way to 
improve schools. Riley devoted much of his annual address on the 
state of education to describing the model, but insisted it is not 
an attempt to mandate a federal policy on teacher quality. Under 
the model, new teachers would get a three-year maximum initial 
license after passing a written exam and an evaluation of classroom 
performance. Teachers who perform poorly could be fired.

	New Orleans Celebrates Mardi Gras

<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Merry makers danced in the streets and  
cheered the gaudy parades as angels, cowboys and clowns marched 
from dawn to dusk in the city's Mardi Gras celebration. The bash is 
the final fling before Lent, which many Christians observe from Ash 
Wednesday to Easter by fasting or by giving up something, like meat 
or sweets. About two million people were expected to participate in 
celebrations. Arrests were up slightly, but they were all 
misdemeanors -- nudity, urinating in public, trespassing.

	Tomatoes May Lower Cancer Risk

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new study confirms a long-suspected view  
that eating lots of fresh and processed tomatoes can lower the risk 
of some kinds of cancer. The summary study in the Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute found there is now enough data to show 
convincingly ``that high consumers of tomatoes and tomato products 
are at substantially decreased risk of numerous cancers, although 
probably not all cancers.'' The data are most compelling for 
cancers of the prostate gland, lung and stomach, said Dr. Edward 
Giovannucci, author of the report.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFL will most likely add a 32nd team in  
Houston or Los Angeles in March, returning to a city that lost a 
franchise this decade. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said today the 
31 owners seem in agreement on the plan and will vote on it next 
month in Phoenix. The team, which would be the NFL's fourth 
expansion club this decade, could begin play in 2002.

<HEADLINE> New Vaccine May Fight Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have discovered a possible new way  
to vaccinate against malaria, which kills up to 3 million people a 
year and sickens an additional 300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Creating a vaccine is crucial because the parasite has begun  
developing resistance to drugs used to treat malaria, and even 
mosquitos that spread the disease are withstanding pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	But finding a malaria vaccine has proved exceptionally  
difficult, and testing in 1997 concluded the candidate long thought 
the best hope was actually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason most vaccine attempts have failed is that they  
focused on just one part of the malaria parasite's complex life 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention and from India have created a multipronged vaccine 
designed to make the immune system fight the parasite at many 
stages: When the mosquito bite sends it into the body, when it 
invades the liver and when infection moves into the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbits immunized with the new vaccine produced antibodies that  
prevented malaria parasites from invading liver cells and from 
replicating in the blood, the researchers reported Monday in 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because the vaccine stimulates a rabbit's immune system  
doesn't mean it would work in people, cautioned parasitologist 
Anthony Holder of London's National Institute for Medical Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC hopes further testing in primates will prove promising  
enough to try the vaccine in people.

<HEADLINE> Marv Albert Signs With Turner Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After nearly 18 months off, Marv Albert's career  
is back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert agreed Monday to a multiyear contract with Turner Sports  
to broadcast NBA games and other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired by NBC in 1997 after pleading guilty to biting a  
woman during a sexual encounter in a Virginia hotel room. His 
record was cleared after fulfilling the terms of his probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the darkest hours, I had no idea what would unfold in my  
life,'' Albert said. ``But I had to get past that. A year ago, I 
was just wondering if I'd get back, but I think everything has 
turned out well in the long run when you look at my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert will likely make his debut on TNT's broadcast of the Los  
Angeles Lakers game at Phoenix on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
	He can only hope that the reaction nationally will be as  
positive as it has been locally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has been so favorable in New York at the games and  
walking on the street,'' Albert said at a news conference in 
Madison Square Garden. ``I just hope it continues and people 
continue to react that way, but it's out of my control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert worked his first NBA game in nearly 20 months on Feb. 8,  
when he called the Knicks home opener on radio for the Madison 
Square Garden Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans lined up for autographs and voiced their support for  
Albert's return. 
</P>
<P>
	He will work six regular season games this season for Turner  
with analyst Reggie Theus, then will be placed in the regular 
announcing rotation during the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert might be paired with different partners during the  
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hiring is a step in the right direction for Marv to make a  
strong comeback,'' said Turner analyst and former NBA coach Hubie 
Brown. ``It also adds another quality announcer to our stable of 
people. The way people should look at it is that Turner is giving 
him a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next season, Albert will become a fulltime member of  
the Turner on-air staff, announcing a full slate of about 25 
regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that Marv is one of the top play-by-play announcers in  
the business,'' Turner Sports executive producer Mike Pearl said. 
``The concerns we had were that he was taking care of himself on a 
personal note. We have the confidence in our decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Albert's games on Turner this season will come on Friday  
nights on TNT in order to accommodate his obligations with Madison 
Square Garden, which will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy with this situation,'' Albert said. ``I don't  
know what's in store down the road. I'm just so thrilled to be 
doing NBA on national basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert returned to New York's MSG in September as a weeknight  
anchor its wrap-up show, ``SportsDesk.'' Besides NBA games, he also 
may work boxing for Turner along with the 2001 Goodwill Games and 
possibly the pro football league Turner and NBC are planning to 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's last national telecast was the NBA Finals in 1997 with  
NBC, where he worked for 20 years. Later that year, after the 
trial, he was fired by NBC and resigned from the MSG Network. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be great to see Marv return to television and work in  
the sport he loves,'' NBC spokesman Ed Markey said. ``We're happy 
to have him back as part of the NBA family.''

<HEADLINE> Browns Might Sign Brown, Fuller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns have agreed to terms with  
Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Orlando Brown and Minnesota 
Vikings cornerback Corey Fuller, according to reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown agreed Monday to sign a six-year, $26 million contract  
today, the Akron Beacon Journal and ESPN reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller agreed to sign a five-year, $20.6 million contract,  
according to several newspaper reports today. Both players visited 
the Browns on Monday, along with Minnesota defensive end Derrick 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns also are close to signing Buffalo Bills linebacker  
Chris Spielman, according to reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller, 27, said he wanted to stay in Minnesota but the Browns  
topped the Viking's best offer of $19 million over five years, 
including a $4 million signing bonus, the Star Tribune of 
Minneapolis reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't even close,'' he told the newspaper. ``I gave the  
Vikings a chance to step up, but it wasn't even close. I had to 
stop messing around and make a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller will receive $3 million of the signing bonus now, and the  
other $2 million next February. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of five free-agent defensive starters for the  
Vikings. He had been a starter since his rookie year in 1995 and 
played especially well late last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bittersweet, but it's part of growing up and part of  
taking the next step in my life,'' said Fuller, who had made no 
secret of his desire to stay in Minnesota. ``Tell the fans I'm 
sorry, but this is how it goes in this business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Cleveland signs Brown, three-fifths of Cleveland's offensive  
line would be set with young, experienced players. Brown, who 
started his career in Cleveland as a free agent, would play right 
tackle, free agent signee Dave Wohlabaugh center and Jim Pyne left 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman had a workout and underwent a physical for the Browns  
on Friday at the team's headquarters in Berea. Buffalo granted the 
Browns permission to bring in Spielman, who hasn't played a down in 
the NFL since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Report: Wars Have Roots in Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Look for the roots of war literally in the  
roots of nations' agriculture, suggests a report financed by an 
organization seeking to build public understanding of the 
importance of farming. 
</P>
<P>
	The study released today draws a link between poor agriculture  
and the spread of regional and internal wars. It estimates that 4 
million people have died in post-Cold War conflicts, 90 percent of 
them civilians, and points to India as a country where conflicts 
have been avoided to a degree with agricultural successes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This report demonstrates that providing developing world  
farmers with the fruits of research, when combined with other 
measures, not only helps to end hunger, but can also contribute to 
ending the increasingly vicious warfare that the world has seen 
during the 1990s,'' said Dr. Indra de Soysa, co-author of the study 
conducted for Future Harvest, which commissions research for the 16 
worldwide centers of the U.N.-connected Consultative Group on 
International Agricultural Research. 
</P>
<P>
	De Soysa said research uncovered a strong link between  
conditions affecting agriculture and poverty and a new pattern of 
conflicts. The report said the new wars are largely internal and 
tend to reflect crises of subsistence rather than of ideological 
conflict or superpower rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	``These new conflicts can be traced to the loss of livelihood,  
the hopelessness of surviving at the margins, and the alternative 
life of crime and banditry,'' de Soysa said. The report concludes 
that when people are unable to meet their food requirements, their 
survival strategies often lead them to join rebellions or become 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The report describes how India, despite widespread poverty, has  
avoided serious conflicts ``by providing poor farmers with 
high-tech seeds and extension services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960, India and sub-Saharan Africa were each producing  
about 50 million tons of food a year, but by 1988, India was 
producing 150 million tons while Africa had remained at about the 
same level, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In contrast to the endemic violence in Africa and in parts of  
Latin America that stem largely from subsistence crises, India can 
serve as an example of how effective state action and a functioning 
participatory political system can mitigate serious armed 
confrontation,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	India has had scores of conflicts through the years but its lack  
of widespread unrest suggests ways to avoid conflict in other 
regions, by properly mixing agricultural research aimed at 
developing modern technology for subsistence farmers and policies 
which will increase food production and raise incomes of the poor, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	With international peacekeeping and emergency humanitarian  
relief now totaling more than $10 billion a year, a reduction of 
conflicts would also benefit more prosperous nations, it said.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Introduce New QB Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- If these are indeed Charley Casserly's last  
days with the Washington Redskins, the introduction of quarterback 
Brad Johnson on Tuesday displayed a general manager determined to 
leave with his pride intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating the tough question before it was even asked,  
Casserly launched into an unusually forceful defense of his 
decision to trade three draft choices to the Minnesota Vikings for 
Johnson -- especially when he could have re-signed Trent Green and 
drafted some much-needed starters with those very picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have all these discussions about what you give up, what  
you don't give up,'' said Casserly, who first approached Minnesota 
about Johnson when Randall Cunningham signed a contract extension 
in December. ``This isn't complicated. Ladies and gentlemen, this 
is about winning. You want to win, or you don't want to win. This 
city demands a winner. We've been a little bit short. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't punt at the quarterback position in this city. There  
are too many great ones that played here. It's real simple, if you 
took a vote in the National Football League today, who is the best 
quarterback available? It's 31-0 for Brad Johnson. ... So do you 
want to win, or do you want to punt? We want to win. That's why we 
make this trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins gave up their No. 11 overall pick and a third-round  
selection from this year's draft, plus a second-rounder next year, 
for a quarterback who has started 23 NFL games. The Skins still 
have the No. 5 overall pick this year, but there remain big holes 
to fill at offensive tackle, cornerback, defensive end, receiver 
and kicker. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson instantly became the only quarterback on the roster. The  
Redskins cut Jeff Hostetler on Tuesday, a few days after releasing 
Gus Frerotte. Coach Norv Turner said unsigned free agent Casey 
Weldon, Johnson's former teammate at Florida State, is now No. 2 on 
the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins also released strong safety Jesse Campbell, whose  
career may be over because of a knee injury. His possible 
successor, free agent Devin Bush from Atlanta, visited the team 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The passion in Casserly's remarks may have been lost on Johnson,  
who had just passed a physical and walked through the front door at 
Redskin Park for the first time. Johnson, who grew up a Redskins 
fan in Black Mountain, N.C., said he knew no one on the roster and 
knew nothing about the team's state of flux, which could produce a 
new owner, coach and general manager within the next couple of 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what happened in the past. I had nothing to do  
with that past,'' said Johnson, who has two years left on a 
four-year, $15.5 million contract and is joining a team that hasn't 
made the playoffs since 1992. ``I expect to win right away, and 
that's the only way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins are waiting for NFL owners to approve the team's  
record $800 million sale to Howard and Edward Milstein and Daniel 
Snyder, who are expected to make major changes once they take over. 
Meanwhile, Casserly, Turner and president John Kent Cooke are 
running the team by order of commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who 
intervened last week after negotiations with Green went nowhere 
because of a power struggle involving a group of trustees who 
temporarily own the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said the uncertain ownership situation was one of the  
reasons he signed Monday with St. Louis, although the Redskins 
almost certainly would have kept him if they had topped the Rams' 
four-year, $16.5 million offer. 
</P>
<P>
	After Green signed, Casserly intensified his 2-month-old  
contacts with the Vikings concerning Johnson, putting together a 
package of draft picks that beat out the Baltimore Ravens and other 
interested teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brad has earned the right to be here,'' Turner said. ``Brad  
brings maturity, he brings enthusiasm to this position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was among the NFL's top quarterbacks in 1997 until a  
neck injury cost him the final five games. He was back as the 
starter when last season began, but he broke his leg in the second 
week against St. Louis and gave way to Cunningham. Johnson returned 
for one game last year, when Cunningham hurt his knee early against 
New Orleans on Nov. 8. Johnson broke the thumb on his passing hand 
the same day.

<HEADLINE> Hyperbole Was Big Part of Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reading Republican forecasts, the acquittal of  
George Washington's 41st successor may have put every cherry tree 
at risk of chopping by youths who will lie rather than confess. 
</P>
<P>
	For if President Clinton can get by with dishonesty, the House  
impeachment prosecutors said, the message will be that children can 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	They argued as well that the American legacy of duty and honor  
would be so damaged as to leave doubt that people would be willing 
to defend it. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Democratic prophecies, Clinton's impeachment  
demeaned the process, weakened the presidency itself, opened a path 
to political prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	In impeachment, hyperbole was part of the rhetoric of Republican  
prosecution and Democratic defense. The warnings of doom were not 
credible, then or now. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were part of the argument.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder if, after this culture war is over, an America will  
survive that will be worth fighting to defend?'' Rep. Henry Hyde 
said in closing the case against Clinton, knowing the Senate would 
not convict the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of dire predictions grew steadily over the 13 months  
from the beginning of the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal to the Senate 
votes acquitting Clinton on House articles of impeachment for 
perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that it is done, and Clinton has been spared conviction, the  
grimmest of those forecasts are being toned down. ``Only time will 
tell,'' said Hyde, the chief House prosecutor, who had claimed 
prior to the Senate's two not guilty verdicts that acquittal would 
permanently undermine fair and equal justice. 
</P>
<P>
	And Democrats say that despite the damage to this president,  
there probably will be no lasting harm to the office of the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really upheld the presidency,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman,  
D-Conn., ``and therefore, I think the damage to it will be 
temporary and minimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What time has told about forecasts in the entire impeachment  
case is that almost every prediction has been wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Except the one about the verdicts. Nobody thought there were or  
would be 67 Senate votes to convict Clinton and force him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning that American youth would see unpunished lying by  
the president as a license to do it themselves was threaded through 
GOP arguments to the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do we say to the kids about truth and justice, about  
honesty and integrity, about the political and governmental 
heritage they should admire and emulate?'' Sen. James Inhofe, 
R-Okla., asked after voting to convict. 
</P>
<P>
	Logically, that none of those standards have changed, and that  
Clinton's conduct was neither to be admired nor emulated. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, of course, was the president who could not tell a  
lie, and so, legendarily, admitted as a boy that he had chopped 
down the cherry tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is a president who can tell one, more than one, although  
not, his lawyers maintained, under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	The oath, to tell the truth, would be a casualty of acquittal,  
the prosecutors argued. ``We have reduced lying under oath to a 
breach of etiquette, but only if you are the president,'' Hyde 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact of allowing a president to stand above the law will  
be felt for generations to come,'' argued Rep. James Sensenbrenner, 
R-Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the Senate voted against ousting Clinton, Hyde said he  
could only hope and pray that the oath against lying would remain a 
strong pillar of American justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only time will tell what effect all of this has had on the  
efficacy, the enforceability of the oath,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, one of the few impeachment forecasts that stood up  
was Hyde's, more than a year ago -- and it held despite his best 
efforts to disprove it. Hyde said at the start, long before 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr gave the House a case for 
impeaching Clinton, that impeachment would have to elicit 
bipartisan support. ``So nothing much will happen until the 
Democrats decide something should happen,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't. Republicans drove impeachment through the House,  
and in the Senate trial, which ended with all 45 Democrats voting 
not guilty. What bipartisanship there was came in the votes of 10 
GOP senators to acquit on the perjury count, five on obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, of course, there is the ancestor of all flawed forecasts,  
the Supreme Court decision that Clinton could be sued in the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment case while serving as president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to us highly unlikely to occupy any substantial  
amount of petitioner's time,'' the court said in the 1997 decision, 
opening the path that ultimately led to impeachment. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Reputed Mobster Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A reputed mob boss pleaded guilty to  
racketeering and tax charges Tuesday in a federal court where he 
was to face trial on charges of murder, illegal gambling, 
obstruction of justice, fraud and extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	In his plea agreement, Lenine ``Lenny'' Strollo agreed to  
testify against three of his associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Strollo admitted plotting the killing in 1996 of a rival  
organized crime leader in Youngstown, a northeast Ohio city which 
for decades has had a reputation as a haven for organized crime and 
was once nicknamed ``Crime Town U.S.A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If his testimony satisfies prosecutors, Strollo, 68, could serve  
as few as 12 years in prison. But U.S. District Judge Kathleen 
O'Malley reserved the right to sentence him to up to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Strollo also agreed Tuesday to a plea deal on separate charges  
filed in state court that cover much of the same ground as the 
federal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave us an offer we couldn't refuse,'' said Herbert  
Greenman, Strollo's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenman said the government agreed not to seek any forfeiture  
of Strollo's possessions, although that was not included in the 
12-page plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing, Strollo gave mostly one-word answers, except  
when he was asked if he was confused by the plea agreement. ``No, 
it's pretty clear,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No sentencing date was set. Plea negotiations were expected to  
continue Wednesday for the other three defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Since December 1997, federal prosecutors have charged 43 others  
besides Strollo with racketeering-related charges. Many pleaded 
guilty and were expected to testify against Strollo and the 
remaining defendants, Bernard Altshuler, 68, of Youngstown; Lavance 
Turnage, 26, of Youngstown; and Jeffrey Riddle, 38, of Youngstown.

<HEADLINE> Japan Moves To Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fearing that higher borrowing costs could choke off  
business activity, Japan moved again Tuesday to lower interest 
rates in the latest effort to repair damage to the world's 
second-largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced that the government  
would cut back its sales of 10-year bonds by about 22 percent, 
making up some of the difference with sales of bonds with shorter 
maturities. The government also said that an agency that manages 
public pension funds would resume buying government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``These steps should have a positive impact on long-term  
interest rates,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin announcements were aimed at reversing a sharp decline  
in Japanese government bond prices that had forced benchmark 
interest rates higher, threatening to further cramp economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves came on the same day as the Economic Planning Agency  
reported the economy remains distressed and followed a cut Friday 
in a key short-term interest rate by the Bank of Japan, the 
country's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets cheered the government's efforts to rein in  
interest rates. The main Japanese stock index rose 1.3 percent and 
the price of the 10-year government bond soared, pushing its yield 
down to 1.99 percent from 2.14 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The push for lower interest rates in Japan also benefited the  
dollar, whose relatively higher intererest rates make it more 
attractive to international investors. After a strong rally in 
Tokyo, the dollar jumped to 118.74 yen in New York, 4.53 yen above 
its level on Friday. U.S. markets were closed Monday for the 
Presidents Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Treasury bonds also benefited as fears eased that high  
Japanese bond yields would tempt investors to dump American bonds 
in favor of Japanese ones. The yield on the 30-year bond, a 
barometer for long-term borrowing costs, fell to 5.34 percent from 
5.42 percent late Friday as demand increased for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has been urging Japan to shore up its economy  
as a way to help pull weaker Asian nations out of their own 
economic slump. Without Japanese banks lending in Asia or Japanese 
consumers buying Asian goods, many fear that the region may take 
even longer to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest sign that Japan's economic troubles run deep, the  
government's main economic forecasting unit, the Economic Planning 
Agency, issued a report Tuesday saying the outlook for Japan 
remains bleak despite scattered signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	In its February report on the economy, the agency pointed to the  
lack of improvement in consumer spending, which continues to shrink 
as workers become increasingly frugal due to falling wages and 
record-high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Weak domestic demand has put the Japanese economy, already mired  
in its worst recession since the end of World War II, in an 
``extremely severe'' state, the planning agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did note some bright spots -- such as a pickup in  
housing construction and a slowdown in the rate of bankruptcies -- 
but said these were doing little more than slowing the pace of 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted the risk from rising long-term interest  
rates, which could increase borrowing costs for Japanese companies 
and hurt exports by driving up the yen against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though the rise in interest rates hasn't had a negative effect  
on the economy yet, a continued rise would pose downside risks for 
the economy,'' said Takashi Omori, director of the national 
economic division at the agency's research bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami expressed optimism the lower  
rates would stimulate new demand by cutting borrowing costs for 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the current situation, I get a good impression  
that this will give vigor to the domestic economy,'' Hayami said.

<HEADLINE>  De la Renta Previews Fall Togs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Snowboarder? Socialite? Oscar de la Renta's  
newest look combines both. Even if his moneyed clientele never set 
foot past the bunny slopes, they'll be stepping out for soirees in 
fanciful, embroidered ball skirts -- with snow parkas. 
</P>
<P>
	As the fall fashion openings continued, de la Renta showed  
colorful eveningwear Tuesday that women could imagine in their 
wardrobes -- if home happens to include a Fifth Avenue drawing room. 
</P>
<P>
	Supermodel Naomi Campbell made the point with a fuchsia satin  
fur-trimmed parka, teamed with black embroidered evening pants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point of women dressing today is there are no  
(final) frontiers for what is for day or evening,'' de la Renta 
said after his show. ``Anoraks are versatile, great with a pair of 
jeans or an evening dress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At her Seventh Avenue showroom, Nicole Miller took a shine to  
techno-minded metalics. Narrow black evening separates sparkling 
with metal thread reflected Miller's vision of the future of 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fabric looks like a mirror. It's really modern, and we  
worked around the idea of newness,'' says Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the runways, Douglas Hannant, who never saw a garment  
that he couldn't wrap and drape, presented a fall collection that 
advanced the architectural buff's notions of ease of dressing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to eliminate all the closures, so they're clothes  
that are held together by straps with magnetic insets that wrap 
around the body,'' Hannant said. ``And I like the sounds of the 
magnet clicking to close. It's such an effortless way of putting on 
a garment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Notable was a black leather side wrap jacket that fastened with  
magnetic strap. An etiquette problem at airport metal detectors? 
</P>
<P>
	Hannant's jackets come with asymmetrical hems, such as his  
``bi-length skirts'' in brown wool that spiral below, or above, the 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the fashion circuit, on Monday evening, hip music  
makers Salt-N-Pepa, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Lou Reed, Debbie 
Harry and actor Damon Wayans turned out for Betsey Johnson's modern 
take on tattered street people of the Victorian era. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hands of the funky downtown designer, the  
vintage-inspired gear was hardly a study in restraint. Models 
strutted in lace-up corsets, bloomers, puffed-sleeved velvet gowns 
with trains, some nonchalantly torn and ragged. The look was 
Charles Dickens revisited -- with an avocado green runway and neon 
green headlights at a Mercedes Benz service station, where Johnson 
held her show. Models looked back-to-the-future with their black 
All-Star Converse sneakers and lime metallic eye shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not la-di-da Victorian richies,'' says Johnson. ``The  
clothes look the way the girls downtown really wear these 
clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, those who wear clothes, anyway. But one bare-breasted fan  
in the front row, drag performer Amanda Lepore, caused a photo 
frenzy by opting for near-nakedness. Besides her nude-color thong 
underpants and red stilettos, her ``outfit'' was nothing but tiny 
chains, a gift from Johnson. Indeed, Lepore's lack of clothes may 
have done more to promote Johnson's clothes than anything on her 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday evening, designer b Michael (lower case, no  
period please) traveled not quite so far back in time, pausing at 
the '40s, '50s and '60s to revamp ladylike fashions. 
</P>
<P>
	Pencil-slim skirts -- so-called for good reason -- worn below the  
knee with chinchilla-trimmed jackets recalled the days when Glenn 
Miller was ``In the Mood'' and FDR chatted by the fireside. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving up to the mod '60s, Michael sent out ``Jetson jackets,''  
orange mohair A-line coats, and black slingbacks that transported 
the audience back to the heyday of Jackie Kennedy and Audrey 
Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Polite and proper, top-handle bags, leather gloves, crystal  
brooches and a charming portrait hat completed the trip down memory 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when it's not in, those eras are still my inspiration,''  
says b Michael. ``The whole idea of dressing this way is modern.''

<HEADLINE> Jagr Is a Star on His Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux hasn't laced up a pair of skates  
or stared down a goaltender on a breakaway in nearly two years. No 
matter, he thinks the best player in hockey still resides in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux doesn't attend Penguins' games in person -- he's  
embroiled in a dispute with the bankrupt franchise's owner. But he 
watches enough on TV to give Jaromir Jagr this endorsement: ``He's 
the best player in the world -- by far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Jagr has played during the Penguins' 10-game winning  
streak, at a level reached only occasionally by gifted players such 
as Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky, it would be hard to argue otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jagr had four points in a streak-stretching 7-3 victory  
Monday over Washington, Capitals coach Ron Wilson said he yanked 
goaltender Olaf Kolzig with Pittsburgh ahead 5-1, ``As an act of 
mercy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jagr is the best player in the league,'' Canadiens defenseman  
Stephane Quintal said in admiration last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr will say only that Lemieux was the best player he ever saw,  
``And there was only one Mario.'' He won't compare himself to Eric 
Lindros, Pavel Bure or Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jagr is enjoying the crackdown on holding, clutching and  
grabbing, tactics Lemieux long implored the NHL to regulate because 
they allowed players of marginal ability to drag down the quality 
of play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the game has changed since last year,'' Jagr said.  
``It's more open and the stronger, better, faster guys have an 
advantage over the other guys. Last year, there was a lot of 
holding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, there's no holding back Jagr as he tries to win a  
third NHL scoring title in five years. He has 26 points, with six 
games of three points or more, during a 10-game winning streak the 
Penguins hope to extend Wednesday night at the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The only surprising aspect of the Penguins' longest streak since  
they won a league-record 17 in a row in 1993 is it has revealed 
Jagr the leader, not just Jagr the scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr succeeded Lemieux and Ron Francis as the Penguins' captain  
mostly in deference to his ability as a player, rather than as a 
leader of men. But he has stepped forward recently as the Penguins' 
most vocal leader, one capable of rallying his team even when he 
doesn't score. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated the Penguins trailed Buffalo 3-2 on Feb. 2, Jagr  
stood up on the bench and said, ``We're not losing.'' The Penguins 
scored three times in the final 6:01 to win 5-3, with Jagr figuring 
in every goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with the winning streak in danger of ending Saturday in  
Nashville, Jagr implored his teammates to remember they had won 
their previous two games in overtime, yelling, ``Let's do it 
again.'' They did, winning 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, Jagr is not a one-man offense. Kip Miller, who had  
only three points with the Islanders last season, has 10 goals and 
18 points in 11 games since moving up to Jagr's line. Martin Straka 
made the All-Star game, and Alexei Kovalev has 18 goals since 
joining the NHL's league-best offense 2 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But it takes only a few shifts of any game to realize that  
Jagr's speed, playmaking ability, scoring touch and ability to stay 
on his skates even when pummeled by larger defensemen makes the 
Penguins go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Jaromir Jagr gets better every year,'' Penguins  
general manager Craig Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Kevin Constantine agreed, saying, ``You wonder how much  
better the kid can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What even his coach forgets sometimes is Jagr no longer is a  
kid. Jagr turned 27 Monday and is in his ninth season in the 
league, even if it seems like only last week he was an 
impressionable teenager playing alongside Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's possible Jagr might play someday for the now-retired  
Lemieux, who is trying to assemble investors who would rescue the 
Penguins from bankruptcy and keep them in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great,'' Jagr said, clearly enjoying the thought  
that Lemieux might be his boss. ``It would be all offense all the 
time -- just the way we like it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks More Mitch Victim Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is asking Congress  
for an emergency aid package of $956 million for Central America's 
rehabilitation and reconstruction from last fall's devastating 
Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, which White House officials cast as a package  
assembled with Republican consultation and certain to be approved, 
would supplement $300 million already provided for immediate 
disaster relief in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tipper Gore, both of whom toured  
Central America after the hurricane as President Clinton's official 
emissaries, were announcing the new aid package later today at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is scheduled to travel to Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala  
and El Salvador next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $300 million in U.S. assistance provided so far,  
administration officials said, $150 million was spent to maintain 
about 5,000 U.S. troops stationed in the region, $120 million was 
used for food and $30 million for relief to health clinics and for 
other activities.

<HEADLINE> Tabloid Publisher Sold for $300M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two of the nation's best-known tabloids -- the  
National Enquirer and Star -- are part of a struggling publishing 
empire being acquired for $300 million by a New York investment 
firm headed by former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman. 
</P>
<P>
	American Media Inc., the Lantana, Fla.-based publisher that has  
suffered from slipping newsstand sales, is being purchased by 
Evercore Partners, which also is assuming $470 million in debt 
under the deal announced late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a terrific opportunity to build on the strength of  
these brands,'' said Austin Beutner, a principal with Evercore. The 
National Enquirer and Star ``are probably two of the most 
under-marketed and under-promoted papers in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Pecker, chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines,  
which publishes George, Elle and Mirabella magazines, has been 
hired as chairman and chief executive of American Media, which 
keeps its name in the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Pecker is planning a $50 million marketing campaign, to boost  
newspaper sales. The popular tabloids also may be expanded to 
include teen and Spanish language versions and television 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new owners of American Media face the daunting task of  
trying to build a company known for peddling gossip at a time when 
the Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal has left many Americans turned 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	``If well over two-thirds of the American public wanted just to  
end the entire Clinton-Lewinsky saga ... what that's saying is 
maybe the public's appetite for gossip and sexual peccadilloes of 
celebrities may have ebbed,'' said Jack Cox, president of the 
Foundation for American Communications, a Los Angeles-based 
journalism think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	American Media, which also prints Country Weekly and Weekly  
World News, said last week it would stop publishing Soap Opera News 
and Soap Opera Magazine, and would sell certain assets and 
trademarks to Primedia Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	American Media has been hurt by distribution problems and  
lackluster sales -- exacerbated by a drop in circulation after the 
death of Princess Diana, whose every move was dogged by tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Enquirer's circulation has dipped to 2.24 million  
at the end of last year from 2.72 million in June 1997. At the same 
time, The Star's circulation fell to 1.82 million from 2.22 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the company reported that profits for the first nine  
months of its fiscal year dropped 92 percent to $569,000 from $6.8 
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	American Media's stock rose 37 1/2 cents to $6.56 1/4 Tuesday on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Evercore's offer of $7 a share, announced after the market  
closed, represents a 6.6 percent premium. Boston Ventures Ltd., 
which owns 70 percent of American Media, has agreed to the sale.	   While Pecker clearly has his work cut out, he has a solid 
reputation in the publishing world. During his seven years as chief 
executive of Hachette, the company's sales doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very few brands that combine the high profile and  
high circulation levels of the Enquirer and Star,'' Pecker said in 
a statement. ``We feel these publications can be positioned for 
future growth on both the advertising and circulation fronts.''

<HEADLINE> Consumers Said Losing on Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are losing tens of billions of  
dollars in interest each year by keeping their money in traditional 
bank savings accounts instead of certificates of deposit and credit 
union accounts, the Consumer Federation and a credit union group 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching to certificates of deposit and from banks to credit  
unions ``is really a no-brainer. People ought to be doing it,'' 
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of 
America, told a news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brobeck said Americans have about $1.5 trillion in traditional  
savings accounts and money-market deposit accounts, which pay on 
average less than 2 percent annually. Rates on certificates of 
deposit -- also federally insured -- usually exceed 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, credit unions on average pay more than 1 percentage  
point above what banks offer on the same kind of accounts, 
according to Brobeck and Dan Mica, president and chief executive 
officer of the Credit Union National Association. Their figures 
were based on data compiled by Bank Rate Monitor, an industry trade 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching to a CD or from a bank to a credit union is ``an  
opportunity for consumers to save an awful lot of money'' quickly 
and easily, Mica said. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties for early withdrawal from CDs rarely reduce the yield  
to consumers below that of traditional savings accounts, said 
Brobeck of the consumer advocacy organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit unions, which have some 77 million members nationwide,  
often are able to offer lower rates on loans and higher interest on 
savings than banks because they are cooperatively owned and don't 
have to pay dividends to shareholders. In addition, credit unions 
are exempt from federal taxes -- a subsidy which amounts to about $1 
billion a year, according to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit unions' tax exemption has been bitterly contested by  
banks, which fought legislation Congress enacted last year allowing 
credit unions to include more than one occupational group in their 
membership -- as long as each group doesn't exceed 3,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month the American Bankers Association, the industry's  
biggest trade group, filed suit seeking to bar the National Credit 
Union Administration, a federal agency, from putting rules into 
effect to implement the new law. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the statements Tuesday by the Consumer Federation  
and the credit union group, an American Bankers Association 
official said banks offer consumers a wider range of financial 
products, such as brokerage and trust services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Savings accounts are not the whole picture,'' said Nancy Ness  
Judy, consumer affairs manager for the bankers' group. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, she said, banks generally offer lower rates than  
credit unions on home mortgage loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate home mortgages currently average  
6.80 percent at banks and 6.86 percent at credit unions, according 
to Bank Rate Monitor. At savings and loans, the average rate is 
6.74 percent. Many credit unions lack sufficient capital to make 
mortgage loans directly and must go through brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Ms. Judy said, some 4,000 credit unions of the  
11,300 nationwide do not offer checking accounts.

<HEADLINE> `Message,' 'Payback' Top Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Audiences looking for mush and mayhem placed  
Kevin Costner's romantic ``Message in a Bottle'' just ahead of the 
violent ``Payback'' over the President's Day weekend, box office 
figures showed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Message in a Bottle'' opened with $18.9 million in ticket  
sales over the four-day weekend. Mel ``Gibson's ``Payback'' 
remained strong in its second week, collecting $17.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Message,'' which also stars Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman,  
drew an audience dominated by older women and overcame savage 
reviews that found the film slow and sappy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but sometimes  
critics have a hard time with emotion,'' director Luis Mandoki 
said. ``It's not something we're always used to in these days of 
cynicism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other new releases, ``My Favorite Martian'' grossed  
$11.2 million for third place while ``Blast from the Past'' had 
$9.2 million to place fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's All That'' was at No. 4 with a $10 million gross in its  
third week. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a boost from last week's best-picture Oscar nominations  
were ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which grossed $9.1 million for sixth 
place; the re-issue of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which had $4 
million for seventh; and ``Life is Beautiful,'' which had $2.8 
million for 11th place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rushmore'' had $3.7 million for eighth place, followed by  
``Patch Adams'' with $3.6 million and ``Varsity Blues'' with $3.1 
million.

<HEADLINE> No Wind in 'Captains Courageous' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There is no wind in the sails of ``Captains  
Courageous,'' a curiously becalmed seafaring musical launched 
Tuesday by the Manhattan Theater Club on its main stage. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a competent show, tasteful even, especially in Lynne  
Meadow's clear, clean staging and a production design whose 
simplicity enhances its coming-of-age tale. Yet whenever the 
musical has a reason to sing, it never soars. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's a puzzle because composer Frederick Freyer and  
lyricist Patrick Cook have made some intelligent choices on what 
moments to musicalize. What comes out, though, is a series of 
indistinguishable songs, many of them mild sea chanteys that 
quickly disappear beneath the waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Captains Courageous,'' adapted by Cook from a Rudyard Kipling  
novel, is the saga of a spoiled rich kid who falls into the North 
Atlantic from his father's ship and is rescued by Manuel, a 
Portuguese fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	The fisherman works aboard an ancient fishing vessel out of  
Gloucester, Mass. The lad, who has the moneyed moniker of Harvey 
Ellesworth Cheyne, at first resists pitching in with the crew. Yet 
gradually, he tempers his outrage and forms a bond with Manuel and 
the rest of the fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a minor subplot involving the ship's veteran captain  
and his modern-minded son, who sees the age of sailing vessels 
coming to an end with the arrival of engine-driven ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly exciting stuff, and the low-keyed story seems to  
affect Treat Williams' portrayal of Manuel. Saddled with a hokey 
Portuguese accent, Williams gives a likable yet subdued 
performance. Brandon Espinoza's bratty rich boy has spunk, and he 
makes a nice transition to seaworthy scout. 
</P>
<P>
	In Act 2, after their relationship is cemented, the twosome  
finally get a sprightly ragtime strut called ``Regular Fellas'' 
that momentarily shakes the score out of its slumber. 
</P>
<P>
	The voices in the all-male supporting cast are strong,  
particularly Michael X. Martin, the musical's nominal villain. 
Martin plays a sailor who predicts trouble aboard ship when the boy 
is fished out of the ocean. None occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Designer Derek McLane has made the most out of the wide yet  
low-ceilinged stage at Manhattan Theater Club. A spartan wooden 
turntable serves as both ship and shore and as the dinghy where 
Manuel and the boy forge their friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is no choreography as such, Jerry Mitchell is  
responsible for the minimal musical staging, which consists mostly 
of men and ropes being pulled across the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Captains Courageous'' is best known from its 1937 film version  
starring Spencer Tracy as the seaman and Freddie Bartholomew as 
little Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
	To its credit, ``Captains Courageous'' on stage has an affecting  
ending, the reconciliation of a too-busy father with his now 
chastened and wiser son. The musical's final minutes are strong, 
far stronger than anything the show sang about in its previous two 
hours at sea.

<HEADLINE> Reds OK Facial Hair After 32 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Hold the shaver. A 32-year-old tradition  
has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott junked the rule about no  
facial hair, delighting some players who had delayed shaving their 
beards and mustaches until the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Tuesday, the Reds became the first team in the majors to  
start spring training when pitchers and catchers reported to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was traded here from St. Louis, the only thing I didn't  
like was the fact that I had to shave,'' said right fielder Dmitri 
Young, who arrived early Monday with a mustache and beard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that goes the same for a lot of guys. I've even talked  
to some who said that's the only reason they wouldn't want to play 
for the Reds. Of course, I didn't think it was right for me to say 
anything. I don't exactly have the same pull as Greg Vaughn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn's 50 home runs last year with San Diego obviously gave  
him some clout with the Reds, who traded for him on Feb. 2. Schott 
agreed this week to Vaughn's request that she waive the rule about 
facial hair, a policy dating to 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	So Vaughn's goatee is safe, clearing the way for other players.  
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the Reds' early arrivals at the City of  
Sarasota Sports Complex showed up with some facial hair. All were 
holding off before reaching for the razor, hoping for a policy 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called Greg Vaughn to let him know before he reported to  
spring training, so he could keep his goatee as long as it was 
neatly trimmed,'' Schott said. ``With the support of our fans, we 
have changed our facial hair policy. The team will continue to 
respect the traditions of Cincinnati Reds baseball and adhere to 
our other uniform personnel rules, presenting a clean-cut image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds said they were swamped by calls from fans who supported  
Vaughn's plea for his goatee. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Johnson, a catcher signed by the Reds during the  
off-season, arrived in camp with a goatee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 31 years old, and I've had this for five years,'' said  
Johnson, who shaves his head. ``I had to cut it off for the media 
photo when I signed here, and I looked like I was about 12 years 
old. I'm happy that they made the change. No one wants to 
disrespect tradition, but that was a rule brought in during a 
certain era, and it's kind of outdated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enforcement of the rule began during the days of Vietnam War  
protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Jack McKeon sported a mustache when he managed the  
Oakland Athletics in 1977 and '78 and again as Padres manager and 
general manager in the late '80s. He said Schott's decision will 
mean he won't have to issue the occasional reminder to shave or get 
a haircut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably had to do that about three or four times last year,  
but it was never a problem,'' McKeon said. ``You change with the 
times, so it's no big deal to me. I'm just interested in how you 
play.''

<HEADLINE> Riley May Urge U.S. Teacher Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his yearly speech on the state of American  
schools, Education Secretary Richard Riley will propose a national 
teacher licensing system to raise the bar on teacher quality, a 
newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, to be outlined in the speech to be delivered at  
California State University, Long Beach, would also tie a teachers' 
pay to the certification, which could be carried from state to 
state, USA Today reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony before congressional education panels last week,  
Riley offered no specifics about what stick or carrot the federal 
government might use to get states to follow a national teacher 
certification plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley did say that the department's proposals this year for the  
law governing most education programs would include some way of 
making sure states adopt tougher, more-relevant teacher exams. He 
cited a recent department survey of teachers showing that many feel 
unprepared to teach specific subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	``States receiving (federal) funds should adopt challenging  
competency tests for new teachers, phase out the use of uncertified 
teachers, and reduce the number of teachers who are teaching `out 
of field,''' Riley told a House committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would be state-operated and would go as follows:  
</P>
<P>
	--New teachers would get a three-year maximum initial license  
after passing a written exam and an evaluation of classroom 
performance. Teachers who perform poorly could be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	--Other new teachers could get a professional license, provided  
they meet state standards and win the approval of a panel of 
teachers and one supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	--Finally, the nation's top-paid teachers would be certified  
under a voluntary advanced license. Experienced teachers could 
choose to undergo a tough certification program under the National 
Board for Professional Teaching Standards. 
</P>
<P>
	States and districts would have to base a teacher's salary on  
the teacher's type of license, years of teaching experience and 
demonstrated knowledge and skills valued by the district. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also includes a national job bank to match teachers  
with school districts. Education officials expect that many new 
teachers will be needed in coming years because of the growing 
number of young students expected from the ``baby boom echo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Education Association President Bob Chase told the  
newspaper that he supports Riley's ideas of stricter licensing 
requirements and tying salaries to tougher state standards. Chase 
said he believes Riley is not calling for federalization of the 
teacher licensing process, an idea the NEA opposes.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake's Gifts to USOC Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gifts to U.S. Olympic Committee officials during  
Salt Lake's efforts to be the American bidder for the Winter Games 
are under investigation by an elite ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure, in a letter, was the first public sign of the  
direction of the inquiry, one of six into the bribery scandal 
surrounding the Utah capital's successful quest for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In Utah, meanwhile, a former U.S. skiing official said he had  
told investigators about Salt Lake-paid ski trips for three USOC 
members, and had identified one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, part of the investigation headed by former Senate  
Majority Leader George Mitchell, asked hundreds of members of the 
USOC board, site-selection task force and senior staff from 1988-89 
to detail any gifts they received from bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The request was made in a letter sent last Friday by John W.  
Cook, a partner in Hogan &AMP; Hartson, the USOC's outside counsel. A 
copy of the letter was obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Contained in the letter were copies of the minutes of a June 11,  
1988, USOC board meeting in Chicago, where a $25 limit on gifts 
from bidders to committee officials was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	It also included a questionnaire asking details of any gifts.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did you personally receive any gifts or financial advantages  
from any United States bid city or any representatives of a bid 
city that exceeded $25 in value?'' the questionnaire said. 
</P>
<P>
	It then asked eight questions about any gift received, including  
what it was, who gave it, where and when it was received, and 
whether it was reported to the USOC executive director as required 
by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Any information gathered by Cook's sweep will be turned over to  
Mitchell and the Justice Department, USOC spokesman Mike Moran said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell commission was appointed by the USOC in December  
after it was found that Salt Lake bidders provided almost a 
half-million dollars in scholarships for sons and daughters of IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	That news has turned into the biggest scandal in Olympic  
history, with nine IOC members expelled or resigning and at least 
13 others under investigation by an internal task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a Salt Lake ethics panel detailed more than $1.2  
million in cash, scholarships, travel, medical care and other 
inducements to 24 IOC members during the city's successful bid for 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC picked Salt Lake in 1989 to bid for the 1998 Winter  
Olympics. Those games went to Nagano, Japan, and Salt Lake 
automatically retained the U.S. designation, winning the 2002 Games 
in a landslide four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's panel is examining the USOC's role in that selection  
and preparing recommendations to avoid a recurrence of any 
wrongdoing it finds. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter from Cook was the first time the Mitchell commission,  
which is expected to brief USOC leaders on Feb. 28 and release its 
findings the next day, was known to be focusing on the USOC's 
decade-old selection of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is known also to be looking at the case of Alfredo La  
Mont, who resigned as USOC international relations director last 
month after disclosing an improper business relationship with the 
Salt Lake bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources said at the time that La Mont worked as a consultant for  
Salt Lake Olympic Tom Welch, gathering information about IOC 
members in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Peterson, a former executive director of the U.S. Ski  
Association who was among those receiving the Cook letter, said he 
had given investigators for Mitchell the name of one USOC board 
member who received a ski trip paid for by Salt Lake, along with 
information on two other members he did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson refused to publicly disclose the names of any of the  
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he had been reluctant to cooperate with the Mitchell  
panel at first, Peterson said he changed his mind because he was 
impressed with the investigators' work and progress that apparently 
had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided to provide names,'' he said in a telephone interview  
from his Utah home. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said he knew of numerous ski trips for USOC members  
paid for by Salt Lake, many of them to a resort in Park City run by 
former star Stein Ericksen. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were trips where travel from outside the area was  
included, not simply busing up to Park City after a Salt Lake 
meeting,'' Peterson said.

<HEADLINE> FCC OK of AT&AMP;T-TCI Merger Said Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp.'s proposed takeover of cable giant  
Tele-Communications Inc., which could dramatically change the 
markets for local phone and Internet service, is nearing final 
approval by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is expected this week to  
clear the deal, which was valued at nearly $32 billion when it was 
announced in June, said government and industry officials speaking 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	For consumers, the merger holds the promise of providing a new  
choice for local phone service -- a prospect appealing to regulators 
wanting to crack open local phone monopolies to competition. The 
merger could eventually give residential and business customers 
one-stop shopping for local, long-distance and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, however, is not expected to force AT&AMP;T and TCI to  
provide other companies with access to TCI's high-speed cable TV 
lines. Consumer groups, America Online and others had been pressing 
for the agency to require AT&AMP;T to give other companies access to 
those lines to offer competing services. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the nation's largest telecommunications company and  
biggest provider of mobile phone services. TCI is the nation's 
second-largest cable TV company, with lines reaching one-third of 
all U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those TCI lines have been upgraded to permit cable TV  
customers to connect their computers to the Internet and access 
online data at speeds as much as 100 times faster than conventional 
telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, AT&AMP;T intends to make TCI's lines capable of  
providing customers with local phone service, too. AT&AMP;T has a 
separate agreement with cable company Time Warner to provide local 
phone service over its high-speed cable TV lines. More cable 
agreements are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable agreements thus would give AT&AMP;T a way to get into  
homes without having to rely on phone lines controlled by the 
regional Bell companies, which dominate the local phone market. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the merger, AT&AMP;T also will control TCI's stake in AtHome  
Corp., a leading provider of high-speed Internet access. Consumer 
groups have said AT&AMP;T could charge consumers extra if they got 
their Internet service over the merged companies' lines but wanted 
another Internet service provider, such as AOL. But federal 
regulators are not expected to set any conditions on that part of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department had approved the merger in December on  
the condition that TCI sell its interest in a rival mobile phone 
company, Sprint PCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the FCC declined to open a proceeding that would  
force all cable companies to share their high-speed lines with 
rivals. But the agency said it would monitor the situation to make 
sure cable companies don't freeze out their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and AOL have pressed for the same mandatory  
access requirements they sought in the merger to apply to all cable 
companies. AT&AMP;T and TCI support voluntary agreements for businesses 
offering competing services to gain access to their high-speed 
cable lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of AT&AMP;T and TCI, in separate meetings Wednesday,  
are to vote on the planned merger. It still must be approved by 
many local cable franchising authorities. Some local authorities 
want to provide rivals access to TCI's high-speed lines, but it's 
unclear if they would have the authority to force any changes.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures found support from expectations Egypt will  
purchase 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat, but were pressured by 
weak asking prices and continued expectations for ample supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures traded listlessly, finding little support from  
export news and pressure from expectations Argentina will harvest a 
bumper crop in competition with U.S. farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were supported by gains in the soybean oil complex, but  
were pressured by continued favorable growing conditions in South 
America that are likely also to lead to bumper crops and intense 
competition for export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 1/4 cent to $2.57 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn fell 1/4 cent to $2.14 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 1/2 cent to 
$1.03 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans rose 1/2 cent to $4.92 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>

	April live cattle fell .12 cent to 67.45 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .25 cent to 74.35 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell 1.07 cents to 45.70 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell .95

<HEADLINE> Rodman Remains a Man Without a Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- While Dennis Rodman and the Los Angeles  
Lakers seem to want each other, they aren't together yet. 
</P>
<P>
	When -- or if -- it does take place appears to be up to the  
eccentric seven-time rebounding champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard he's coming,'' Shaquille O'Neal, the NBA's leading  
scorer, said Monday after another practice came and went without an 
appearance from Rodman. O'Neal said he hasn't spoken with the Worm 
since last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I haven't heard much about it,'' reserve forward  
Corie Blount said. ``I haven't heard the players talk about it, the 
coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the Lakers told The Associated Press late  
Sunday that Rodman was expected to sign with the team by today and 
be in uniform for tonight's game against Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black said there was ``absolutely nothing  
new to report,'' but acknowledged that executives Jerry West and 
Mitch Kupchak have been talking with Rodman's agents. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple hours earlier, Black answered his home telephone by  
saying, ``Dennis Rodman Hotline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several players said speculation over Rodman's expected arrival  
hasn't been a distraction, but the Lakers enter tonight's game with 
a disappointing 3-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll just leave that up to everybody else to talk  
about,'' Lakers coach Del Harris said when asked about Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my contract, it says to play basketball,'' reserve forward  
Travis Knight said. ``I just show up at practice and at games and 
play as hard as I can. I don't really give it much mind. I've got 
enough to worry about doing my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Harper, at 37 the oldest player on the team and the same  
age as Rodman, said over the weekend that ``any distraction was 
going to be a cancer for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he can help us as a player here,'' Harper said Monday.  
``If and when it happens, it happens. That's the only approach you 
can have. We haven't, I haven't, talked about it with anybody 
except the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers first expressed an interest in Rodman two weeks ago.  
They can only offer the veterans' minimum of $1 million, prorated 
for this lockout-shortened season, and that money is diminishing 
with every game Rodman misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting tonight, they'll play six games in eight days.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has played on five of the last 10 NBA champions,  
including the last three with the Chicago Bulls, who opted not to 
pursue him last month after Michael Jordan announced his 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for Rodman's new agents from International  
Creative Management could not be reached Monday.

<HEADLINE> Miami No. 15, No. 25 in AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the first time in the 50-year history of the AP college  
basketball poll, there are two Miamis in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami of Florida, a member of the Big East, was 15th Monday, the  
Hurricanes' highest ranking since joining the Top 25 last month for 
the first time in 39 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami of Ohio, a member of the Mid-American Conference, was back  
in the poll at No. 25 after a two-week run in November, the 
RedHawks' first appearance in 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good,'' RedHawks guard Damon Frierson said of what it  
means to put a temporary end to being the ``other'' Miami. ``We're 
finally seeing some recognition. We thought we were good a few 
years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami of Ohio (19-4) was ranked in the second and third polls of  
the regular season, but dropped out following losses to Xavier and 
Wisconsin-Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Frierson said the team struggled after its first ranking because  
of a knee injury sustained by point guard Rob Mestas, who has 
returned to the RedHawks, winners of seven straight and 12 of 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rob does a great job for us providing leadership,'' Frierson  
said. ``We're playing as a team now. We're winning basketball games 
and we don't care who scores the points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the return to the rankings of Miami of Ohio and No. 22  
Missouri were among the many changes in the Top 25 this week, the 
top three spots held steady with Duke, Connecticut and Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (25-1) stayed a resounding No. 1, receiving 64  
first-place votes and 1,744 points from the national media panel 
after breaking the 100-point mark twice and winning by an average 
of 38.5 points in their two games last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (22-1), which also won twice last week, got the  
other six No. 1 votes and 1,677 points, 72 more than Auburn (24-1), 
which also went 2-0 last week, winning by an average of 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State moved up one spot to fourth, and Maryland and  
Kentucky each jumped two places to fifth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, which beat then-No. 9 UCLA and lost to Southern  
California, dropped from sixth to seventh, while Arizona moved up 
two places No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, which lost to Marquette and Saint Louis last week  
and is on a three-game losing streak, fell from fourth to No. 9, 
its lowest ranking since jumping to sixth in late November after 
beating then-No. 1 Duke in the Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's moved up one place to round out the Top Ten.  
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State moved from No. 13 to 11th, the Buckeyes' highest  
ranking since being No. 3 in the final poll of the 1991-92 season. 
They were followed by Utah, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Miami, UCLA, 
Purdue, College of Charleston, Indiana and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five teams in the poll were Syracuse, Missouri,  
Florida, New Mexico and Miami of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri (18-6) was 24th two weeks ago, its first poll  
appearance since December 1995, but dropped out following a loss to 
Nebraska. They returned after victories over Iowa State and 
Colorado, but lost 69-57 to Oklahoma on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten ranked teams lost a total of 14 games last week, and two of  
the two-time losers -- Minnesota and Kansas -- dropped out of the 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota (14-8) fell out from 22nd after losing last week to  
Iowa and Michigan State. The Golden Gophers joined the Top 25 in 
the fourth poll of the season and had gotten as high as No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (16-8), which had been No. 24, lost to Nebraska and Texas  
Tech last week to drop out after returning from a one-week absence. 
The Jayhawks had been ranked in every poll for the previous eight 
years before dropping out the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA, which took the week's biggest fall in dropping from No. 9  
to 16th, was the fourth ranked team to lose two games last week, 
losing to Stanford and California.

<HEADLINE> Tonya Harding Announces Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Tonya Harding announced her latest  
comeback to skating Tuesday, saying there has been a recent easing 
of her lifetime ban from the sport for her role in the 1994 Nancy 
Kerrigan knee whacking. 
</P>
<P>
	That was news to the U.S. Figure Skating Association, which  
emphasized that absolutely nothing has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not changed our stance on a lifetime ban for Tonya  
Harding,'' USFSA spokesman Bob Dunlop said. ``That's about as 
simple as I can make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harding revealed her plans Tuesday on KPTV's breezy ``Good Day  
Oregon'' morning show. Between hugs with her dog, Dakota, and talk 
of a new man in her life, Harding said the USFSA had a meeting last 
week in which officials said she could skate professionally with 
their skaters in competitions and shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say I can skate with their skaters and in shows,''  
Harding said, adding that she has turned her life around and wants 
to return to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Skating always been my whole life,'' she said. ``I just love  
it. I miss my old friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunlop said Harding continues to be banned from all USFSA  
sanctioned events, including the popular televised Champions on 
Ice, featuring such stars as Michelle Kwan. Non-sanctioned events 
are the only venues in which Harding can skate professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what she's aiming at, said Michael Rosenberg, Harding's  
former manager who is now acting as her adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg said he spoke informally with USFSA officials last  
week to clarify that the ban included no reprisals against other 
skaters who appeared in professional events with Harding. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last five years, skaters have been worried that if  
they skated on the same ice with Tonya, they would never be invited 
to a pro-am event,'' Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that in the past five years, Harding has tried other  
comebacks but no promoters or tour producers ever approached her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been like a pariah in the skating world,'' Rosenberg  
said. ``She's tried to sing, she's tried to wrestle, she's done 
interviews for money... That's how she's scraped out a living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She should be able to resume her life and do what she was born  
to do,'' Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding, 28, was convicted of hindering prosecution in the  
attack on Kerrigan at the USFSA national championships in Detroit. 
She was fined $110,000 and ordered to perform community service. 
Her ex-husband and two other men were convicted and served time for 
planning and carrying out the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``She paid the fine, did the community service, and was banned  
from her sport for five years,'' Rosenberg said. ``That's more than 
paying for what she did.''

<HEADLINE> Consumers Said Losing on Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are losing tens of billions of  
dollars in interest each year by keeping their money in traditional 
bank savings accounts instead of certificates of deposit and credit 
union accounts, the Consumer Federation of America and a credit 
union industry group said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching to certificates of deposit and from banks to credit  
unions ``is really a no-brainer. People ought to be doing it,'' 
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation, 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Brobeck said Americans have about $1.5 trillion in traditional  
savings accounts and money-market deposit accounts, which pay on 
average less than 2 percent annually. Rates on certificates of 
deposit -- also federally insured -- usually exceed 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, credit unions on average pay more than 1 percentage  
point more than banks on the same kind of interest-earning 
accounts, according to Brobeck and Dan Mica, president and chief 
executive officer of the Credit Union National Association. Their 
figures were based on data compiled by Bank Rate Monitor, an 
industry trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching to a CD or from a bank to a credit union is ``an  
opportunity for consumers to save an awful lot of money'' quickly 
and easily, Mica said. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties for early withdrawal from CDs rarely reduce the yield  
to consumers below that of traditional savings accounts, Brobeck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit unions, which have some 77 million members nationwide,  
often are able to offer lower rates on loans and higher interest on 
savings than banks because they are cooperatively owned and don't 
have to pay dividends to shareholders. In addition, credit unions 
are exempt from federal taxes -- a subsidy which amounts to about $1 
billion a year, according to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit unions' tax exemption has been bitterly contested by  
banks, which fought legislation Congress enacted last year to allow 
credit unions to include more than one occupational group in their 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
	A banking industry spokeswoman said consumers should choose the  
best combination of financial services for their needs. Consumers 
should look at ``what's going to give them the best deal all 
around,'' said Janet Eissenstat, a spokeswoman for the American 
Bankers Association.

<HEADLINE> IOC May End Profit-Sharing Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- With sponsors skittish over the Olympic bribery  
scandal, organizers of the Sydney Games were urged by an IOC 
executive Tuesday to plow a $66 million profit-sharing deal back 
into the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would solve the financing issue in a stroke of a pen,''  
International Olympic Committee marketing director Michael Payne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising money from corporate sponsors for the 2000 Sydney Games  
has become a major concern in the wake of the Olympic corruption 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	With Sydney about $130 million short of its target for  
sponsorship revenues, Payne said the controversial profit deal 
should be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way the games should be compromised because of a  
profit deal that we were opposed to,'' he told The Associated Press 
in a telephone interview from IOC headquarters in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. ``This money should be put back into the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said the IOC warned the Australians three years ago  
against projecting a surplus for the games. Sydney organizers have 
predicted a $17.7 million surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC was saying, `This is crazy to be talking about a  
profit now. You should wait until the day after the closing 
ceremony,''' Payne said. ``For various reasons, they wanted to lock 
down issues on profit two or three years ago. Maybe that should be 
reopened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the IOC's contract with Olympic cities, 90  
percent of any surplus goes to the host country and 10 percent to 
the IOC. Of the 90 percent set aside for the host country, 10 
percent goes to the national Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit-sharing arrangement for Sydney has gone through  
several changes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deal with the New South Wales government, the Australian  
Olympic Committee agreed to give up its veto power over key 
decisions in exchange for a guaranteed $66 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the NSW government effectively bought out the AOC's right  
to the money, and the funds go to the AOC whether there is a 
surplus or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``That money has now been taken off the balance books,'' Payne  
said. ``In hindsight, it might have been premature to talk about 
profit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's share of the profit deal was eventually capped at  
$8.95 million. The IOC has said it would earmark most of its share 
to a special fund for sports programs in Australia and the rest of 
Oceania. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has made clear  
the international committee is ready to help out if the organizing 
committee and government request it, including reconsidering the 
IOC's profit share. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem the first place to start is to look at the whole  
profit deal, which we thought was a bad idea in the first place,'' 
Payne said. ``We would never do a deal of this nature again. Never 
in a million years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the corruption scandals involving Olympic bid  
cities, Sydney was struggling to meet its $1.65 billion budget, 
falling short of its $542 million sponsorship target and leading to 
fears that budget cutbacks that could affect the games. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Olympics Minister Michael Knight suggested for the  
first time Tuesday that the Olympics could get by without the extra 
sponsorship revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can run a pretty fantastic Olympic Games on $2.4 billion  
(Australian, or $1.52 million),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said Sydney organizers erred by setting their latest  
sponsorship revenues too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``SOCOG has twice met their targets, and got the most successful  
marketing program we've ever seen for the games,'' he said. ``If 
it's a problem, it's because they were too successful early on. 
They allowed the targets to continue to be raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the current target is wrong. It never should have been  
raised to this height. It's like a high jumper. You can keep 
raising the height, but eventually he can no longer make it over 
the bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, who heads the IOC coordination commission for the  
Sydney Games, said he is optimistic that Sydney will raise enough 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, there is still some revenue to be found, but it's too  
soon to be worried,'' he said in a phone interview from Belgium. 
``I'm very relaxed about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are vigilant. But today no one can say there is a danger, a  
shortfall, a problem. We'll have a better idea in June after ticket 
sales have started and new efforts have begun to find new sources 
of revenue.''

<HEADLINE> Hamilton Ready for Blue Jays Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Joey Hamilton couldn't wait to join his new  
Toronto teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good to get down here, not only being with a new team  
but to meet new guys,'' the right-hander said Tuesday after his 
first spring training workout. ``I drove down yesterday from 
Fayetteville, N.C. in five or six hours, and it used to take me a 
five- or six-hour plane flight to get to the West Coast. It was 
refreshing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, acquired from San Diego during the offseason for Woody  
Williams, hopes Roger Clemens will remain with the Blue Jays. 
Without Clemens, it's difficult to imagine Toronto contending for a 
playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be great if the Jays keep Roger here, because  
if you lose that guy, you lose 18-20 wins,'' Hamilton said. ``But 
just looking around here early, they have some big old boys here 
and from what I understand, they have a lot of talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Blue Jays manager Tim Johnson underwent minor nasal surgery  
on Monday in Clearwater and is expected back on the field Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nixon Adviser Ehrlichman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Watergate figure John D. Ehrlichman confessed to  
being too loyal to President Nixon -- overriding his own judgments 
in order to do the president's bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went and lied and I'm paying the price for that lack of  
willpower,'' Ehrlichman said in a taped statement filed in federal 
court in 1977 before he was granted parole for his Watergate 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had any advice for my kids, it would be never ... ever  
defer your moral judgments to anybody. ... That's something that's 
very personal. And it's what a man has to hang on to,'' said 
Ehrlichman, who had been Nixon's chief adviser on domestic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman, who suffered from diabetes, died from natural causes  
at his home in Atlanta on Sunday, his son Tom said Monday. He was 
73. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never the person everybody saw in the Watergate  
hearings. But I have realized that I was never going to catch up 
with my image. It was set in concrete. It bothered me enormously 
for a while, what people thought of me,'' he told The Washington 
Post in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made myself stop caring because I knew I couldn't do a thing  
about it, and I knew it was going to tear me up if I tried,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman and Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, were  
virtually indistinguishable by the public. Both were close to Nixon 
and they became known as the ``Berlin Wall'' because they shielded 
the reclusive Nixon from unwelcome encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman coined a phrase that became part of the nation's  
political lexicon when he advised Nixon to allow L. Patrick Gray 
3rd, then acting director of the FBI, to become the fall guy for 
Watergate and to leave him ``twisting slowly, slowly in the wind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cover-up was the attempt to conceal from the public the  
White House involvement almost from the start in the break-in at 
Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate office complex in 
Washington on June 17, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ehrlichman admitted he knew about the break-in shortly  
after it happened, he maintained that he did what he was told and 
said he regretted not asking Nixon about his involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	After the break-in, Nixon ``asked me to stay out of it and  
concentrate on domestic policy. So that's what I did until the 
following April,'' Ehrlichman told The Associated Press in January 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	That was when Nixon asked Ehrlichman to find out what was going  
on with the Watergate investigation, Ehrlichman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere that I went was a Richard Nixon footprint,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1973, as the cover-up began to unravel and pressure  
mounted, Nixon held a tearful meeting at his presidential retreat 
at Camp David, Md., with Haldeman and Ehrlichman. By that time, 
Nixon's counsel, John W. Dean 3rd, had implicated them in the 
Watergate cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Nixon fired Dean, and accepted the resignations of  
Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Attorney General Richard Kleindienst. 
Nixon hoped that the sacrifices of his closest aides would stanch 
the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	When Nixon was forced by the Supreme Court to surrender the tape  
that showed his own involvement in the cover-up, his impeachment 
became inevitable and, on Aug. 9, 1974, he became the first and 
only president to resign. His successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman went to prison in October 1976 and served 18 months  
of a four-to-eight-year term for obstruction of justice, conspiracy 
and perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	His conviction grew out of his false testimony to a Senate  
committee investigating Watergate and for his role in the 1971 
break-in at the office of Dr. Lewis Fielding, a psychiatrist who 
had treated Daniel Ellsberg, the former Pentagon aide who leaked 
the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Klein, director of communications in Nixon administration  
and now editor in chief of The Copley Newspapers, said: ``John 
Ehrlichman's arrogance in Watergate has become his legacy, but in 
fairness, he should be given credit for the fact that as President 
Nixon's top domestic adviser, he left a major record of school 
desegregation nationally and of progress toward welfare reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitaker, a member of Nixon's Domestic Council and a former  
undersecretary of the interior, said Ehrlichman was ``an honest 
broker of all the policy differences and brought them all before 
the president in very clarified style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman was born March 20, 1925, in Tacoma, Wash. He  
graduated from University of California, Los Angeles and got a law 
degree at Stanford University in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, he was a lead navigator in the 8th Air  
Force where he earned the Air Medal clusters and the Distinguished 
Flying Cross. Before joining the White House, Ehrlichman was a 
partner in the Seattle law firm of Hullin, Ehrlichman, Roberts &AMP; 
Hodge from 1952 to 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	After the scandal, he eventually moved to Atlanta, where he  
served as senior vice president of Law Environmental, an 
international engineering and environmental regulatory compliance 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his third wife, Karen Hilliard, four sons and  
two daughters and his mother, Lillian. Funeral services will be 
private.

<HEADLINE>  Chinese Begin Year of the Rabbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The Chinese-speaking world welcomed the Year of  
the Rabbit today with fireworks, dragon dances and hopes for an end 
to Asia's economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	China's television news and newspapers, all controlled by the  
government, reported almost exclusively on merry-making for the 
nation's biggest holiday -- highlighting the upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rural Chinese welcomed the New Year with deafening blasts of  
fireworks, traditionally meant to scare off evil. 
</P>
<P>
	In Shanghai, China's biggest metropolis, workers swept up piles  
of debris in the streets today after a thunderous night of 
fireworks set off in defiance of a ban. 
</P>
<P>
	During the night, Shanghai shook with fireworks ignited in  
nearly every street and rockets launched from the tops of 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in more staid Beijing, where fireworks also are banned,  
random bangs lasted through the night and into the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of Chinese took advantage of a seven-day  
government-ordered break and traveled to their hometowns to gather 
with their families and watch lion dances and other entertainment 
at fairs and parades. Others broke from tradition and went 
sightseeing instead, an alternative edging up in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	But worries about unemployment caused spending to be curbed this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of millions of workers have been laid off from defunct  
state-run factories, farmers chafe under heavy taxes and slow 
income growth. State media reported that even in the relatively 
affluent capital, spending on the lunar New Year, or Spring 
Festival, was down. 
</P>
<P>
	To attract the frugal shopper, department stores ran holiday  
sales, and a nationwide welfare lottery appealed to the traditional 
lunar New Year wish that doubles as a greeting: ``Get rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Chinese zodiac, the Year of the Rabbit is believed to  
bring peace, prosperity and good luck. Throughout Asia, many were 
hoping that the New Year might bring a change of fortune after 
months of economic adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	For cheer and good luck, office buildings and hotels in Hong  
Kong, mired in its worst recession in decades, were festooned with 
the customary symbols of the season -- tangerine trees and 
narcissus. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the holidays, I am sure that in our typical Hong Kong  
way, we will all be back at work striving for a better tomorrow,'' 
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said in his annual New Year's 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	In his annual speech to the nation, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji  
said he expected Hong Kong's troubles to ease and the rest of the 
nation to remain stable as the People's Republic approaches the 
50th anniversary of its founding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under complicated circumstances both at home and overseas, our  
great motherland remains prosperous,'' Zhu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu made the customary appeal for unity with Taiwan, which has  
been ruled independently of Beijing since the communists took power 
in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwanese celebrated the New Year today by setting off  
firecrackers and beating drums. Millions of people prayed at 
Buddhist or Taoist Temples to welcome the New Year amid wafts of 
incense smoke and food offerings. A temple to five smiling gods of 
wealth was crowded with business people praying for better 
fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, animal lovers were worried about the high number  
of rabbits being bought as pets, only to be abandoned later. 
Economic hard times there also meant more restaurants, shops and 
food stalls were to remain open today and Wednesday because the 
owners and their staff need the income.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Remains a Man Without a Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- While Dennis Rodman and the Los Angeles  
Lakers seem to want each other, they aren't together yet. 
</P>
<P>
	When -- or if -- it does take place appears to be up to the  
eccentric seven-time rebounding champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard he's coming,'' Shaquille O'Neal, the NBA's leading  
scorer, said Monday after another practice came and went without an 
appearance from Rodman. O'Neal said he hasn't spoken with the Worm 
since last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I haven't heard much about it,'' reserve forward  
Corie Blount said. ``I haven't heard the players talk about it, the 
coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the Lakers told The Associated Press late  
Sunday that Rodman was expected to sign with the team by today and 
be in uniform for tonight's game against Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black said there was ``absolutely nothing  
new to report,'' but acknowledged that executives Jerry West and 
Mitch Kupchak have been talking with Rodman's agents. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple hours earlier, Black answered his home telephone by  
saying, ``Dennis Rodman Hotline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several players said speculation over Rodman's expected arrival  
hasn't been a distraction, but the Lakers enter tonight's game with 
a disappointing 3-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll just leave that up to everybody else to talk  
about,'' Lakers coach Del Harris said when asked about Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my contract, it says to play basketball,'' reserve forward  
Travis Knight said. ``I just show up at practice and at games and 
play as hard as I can. I don't really give it much mind. I've got 
enough to worry about doing my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Harper, at 37 the oldest player on the team and the same  
age as Rodman, said over the weekend that ``any distraction was 
going to be a cancer for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he can help us as a player here,'' Harper said Monday.  
``If and when it happens, it happens. That's the only approach you 
can have. We haven't, I haven't, talked about it with anybody 
except the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers first expressed an interest in Rodman two weeks ago.  
They can only offer the veterans' minimum of $1 million, prorated 
for this lockout-shortened season, and that money is diminishing 
with every game Rodman misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting tonight, they'll play six games in eight days.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has played on five of the last 10 NBA champions,  
including the last three with the Chicago Bulls, who opted not to 
pursue him last month after Michael Jordan announced his 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for Rodman's new agents from International  
Creative Management could not be reached Monday.

<HEADLINE> EU OKs Bertelsmann Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission on Tuesday  
approved Bertelsmann AG's $591 million purchase of Springer Verlag, 
a leading publisher of scientific and medical books and journals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelsmann is the world's largest book publisher, but the  
commission ruled that the deal would not give the company an unfair 
market share in science publishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately held Springer publishes science books and journals in  
Europe, Asia and North America. More than a quarter of its annual 
sales of roughly $360 million come from North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer is Germany's largest science publisher and ranks No. 3

<HEADLINE> Browns Get Bills LB Chris Spielman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The new Browns are a little like that old  
saying about not liking the weather: Wait five minutes and it will 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	But the expansion Browns seem to be moving even faster than the  
clouds blowing in off Lake Erie. They're shifting and reforming by 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the team had its busiest shopping day yet on the free  
agent market, agreeing to terms with Baltimore offensive tackle 
Orlando Brown and Minnesota defensive back Corey Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Browns closed a deal with Buffalo for linebacker  
Chris Spielman, who hasn't played in 1 1/2 years after sitting out the 
1998 season to be with his wife while she was treated for breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, the Browns are talking with 42-year-old  
quarterback Warren Moon while they prepare for this week's NFL 
college scouting combine in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Browns fans didn't have enough to swallow, Kentucky  
quarterback Tim Couch, Cleveland's possible No. 1 overall pick in 
April's college draft, will be in town later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Expansion sure is fun. It's exciting and exhausting.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a great deal happening,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer  
said. ``So much going on that I can't explain it to you. You just 
have to stay tuned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot has happened in the past week. Before last Tuesday's  
expansion draft, Cleveland's roster consisted of about 20 no-name 
street free agents, many of whom don't figure to be with the team 
beyond summer training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Browns spent only $18 million of their $55 million  
salary cap on 37 players in the expansion draft and entered the 
free-agent signing period with piles of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	They've spent some money, and now with nearly 70 players -- they  
can bring 90 to camp -- the Browns have some quality to go along 
with quantity. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, 33, doesn't exactly fit the player profile Palmer and  
Browns director of football operations Dwight Clark were seeking. 
He's at the end of his career, and he's had injury problems. But 
when a player of Spielman's caliber says he wants to play for your 
team, you bend the rules a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, who is under contract with the Bills through 2000, was  
reportedly acquired for a low-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	His '97 season was cut short when he had to undergo neck fusion  
surgery. Then last year, he chose to be with his wife, Stefanie, 
while she recuperated. When she lost her hair during chemotherapy, 
Spielman shaved his head, too. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some questions about the his playing future, but he  
had a strong workout and passed his physical with the Browns last 
week. Palmer came away impressed by both Spielman's condition and 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's great just to be around and talk with,'' said Palmer, who  
may see the inside linebacker as a mentor for the Browns' 
youngsters.

<HEADLINE> Video Shown at Microsoft Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Turning from video critic to producer, the  
government played its own courtroom demonstration Tuesday in an 
attempt to show that Microsoft Corp. made it complicated for 
customers of the world's largest Internet provider to use a rival's 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	Even U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson appeared  
perplexed about part of the process to download and separately 
install the rival software using America Online, confessing to ``a 
conceptual problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's video, shown to the judge last week, skipped over  
parts of the process ``to save time.'' The company said it took a 
total of 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government said Tuesday the procedure could take more  
than an hour, depending on the speed of the Internet connection, 
and isn't obvious for most computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not nearly as easy as their video portrayed it to be,''  
Justice Department lawyer David Boies said outside court. It was 
third Microsoft video challenged by government lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies also introduced an e-mail from Microsoft executives to  
Chairman Bill Gates in March 1990 describing a meeting with Intuit 
Inc., maker of the world's most popular personal finance software. 
</P>
<P>
	In the e-mail, an executive told Gates he proposed to Intuit:  
``We'd rather not compete with you. Instead of growing the market, 
we'd just both spend a lot of money fighting each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive concluded to Gates: ``If they were listening  
carefully, this could have been interpreted as a chance to avoid 
competition with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies asked Microsoft's witness, executive Brad Chase, about the  
e-mail, but Chase said he knew nothing about it. The judge ordered 
Boies to ``move on,'' and the matter was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Microsoft bristled at the use of an e-mail nearly  
a decade old. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government contends Microsoft  
Corp. imposed illegal restrictions on America Online Inc. as part 
of a 1996 deal for AOL to distribute Microsoft's Internet software 
to its millions of subscribers. Chase helped negotiate the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions prevent AOL from actively promoting rival  
Internet browser software from Netscape Communications Corp. and 
prohibit AOL from distributing Netscape's browser to more than 15 
percent of its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, which is buying Netscape for $4.3 billion, has more than 16  
million subscribers, far more than any other service. Its agreement 
to distribute Microsoft's browser lasts until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft denies government claims that it wields its enormous  
influence to coerce other companies into accepting restrictive 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase acknowledged that AOL's agreement includes ``limitations  
on their ability to promote Netscape'' but asserted that more than 
one in five AOL subscribers actually used Netscape's browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's next witness, a senior executive for Compaq Computer  
Corp., is trying to undermine the government's portrayal of 
computer makers as victims of an overzealous Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	In written testimony released Tuesday, John T. Rose disputed the  
government's characterization of several disagreements with 
Microsoft, including one that threatened the future of Compaq, the 
world's largest maker of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose acknowledged that Compaq was wrong in 1996 when it removed  
easy access to Microsoft's Internet software included within its 
Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft objected and threatened to stop allowing Compaq to  
include Windows on its computers. The government has used the 
episode to illustrate what it calls Microsoft's heavy-handed 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rose explained that Compaq removed the icon for Microsoft's  
browser software under a 1995 agreement with America Online 
stipulating that AOL's Internet icons would be the only ones easily 
accessible. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who was responsible then for all Compaq's desktop  
computers, told the judge he wasn't aware of the company's 
obligation to America Online until after Microsoft complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``The removal of the Microsoft icons was contrary to an  
understanding I had reached with Microsoft in August 1995,'' Rose 
said.

<HEADLINE> NFL To Add Los Angeles or Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFL will most likely add a 32nd team in  
Houston or Los Angeles in March, returning to a city that lost a 
franchise this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Tuesday the 31 owners seem in  
agreement on the plan and will vote on it next month in Phoenix. 
The team, which would be the NFL's fourth expansion club this 
decade, could begin play in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville and Carolina joined the league in 1995 and the new  
Cleveland Browns begin play this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are getting to the point where they understand  
that, as we go into the 21st century, we've certainly got to have a 
32-team league,'' Tagliabue said after a four-hour meeting with the 
expansion committee at an Atlanta airport hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the L.A. and Houston markets have fan interest, large  
populations and television appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The main difference is there is only one group, headed by Robert  
McNair, vying for the franchise in Houston, and it has a plan for a 
new retractable-roof stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Two rival groups in Los Angeles are bidding for the expansion  
franchise, each with its own stadium plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz has lined up an all-star roster of  
investors, including actors Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner, to build 
a combined stadium and shopping mall in Carson, 21 miles south of 
downtown. Developer Ed Roski Jr. and billionaire Eli Broad are 
proposing to renovate the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has been without a franchise since the Raiders  
returned to Oakland and the Rams moved to St. Louis before the 1995 
season. The Houston Oilers left for Tennessee in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said the league may assist in the funding of the Los  
Angeles stadium, but the money would go toward one of the plans 
already proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say if the league is committed to picking one of  
the two ownership groups, indicating there is some trepidation 
among the owners about the warring bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got two different ownership groups and two different  
stadium plans,'' he said. ``That's something we've got to work 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion decision likely will spawn a whole new set of  
issues, with realignment at the head of the list. Tagliabue said 
the expansion committee discussed various scenarios Tuesday, using 
both Los Angeles and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Realignment is a hot-button issue in a league where Arizona and  
Dallas are part of the NFC East, Atlanta and Carolina are members 
of the NFC West, and the three teams in Florida are spread over 
three separate divisions in both conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	On another matter, the league's finance committee decided it  
needs more information about an $800 million bid by Howard Milstein 
to purchase the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wants to ensure that Milstein is not violating the  
rule against borrowing more than $100 million using the team as 
collateral to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving as promptly as we can. It's important to  
Washington and important to the league,'' Tagliabue said. ``But 
it's not as important that we complete this deal today or tomorrow 
as it is to make the right decision for the next quarter-century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Joe Browne said Tagliabue also hopes to have a  
decision by the March meeting on whether Edward DeBartolo Jr., 
owner of the San Francisco 49ers, can resume active control of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo ceded day-to-day control to his sister, Denise  
DeBartolo York, when he was targeted in a Louisiana gambling fraud 
probe. He pleaded guilty in October to failing to report a felony 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said the NFL is still committed to having the 2003 Super  
Bowl in San Francisco -- if a new stadium is built to replace 3Com 
Park. That issue will be discussed next month, as well, with the 
owners having the option of taking away the title game.

<HEADLINE> Cops Say Husband Beat Wife to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNDHURST, N.J. (AP) -- A retired butcher bludgeoned his wife of  
52 years to death and hid her body in a basement freezer, then 
slashed his wrists and neck three days later as his sons came 
looking for their mother, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvatore Rosa, 75, remained hospitalized in fair condition  
Tuesday. He is being held on $2 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with murder Monday after police found 70-year-old  
Esther Rosa's body under a pile of frozen food in the couple's 
basement freezer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosa allegedly smashed his wife's head with a crowbar after an  
argument Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Rosa, a son, had reported his mother missing Saturday.  
That same day, another son, James, flew in from Texas after hearing 
of his parents' argument. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Rosa's sons found their father in the bathtub  
bleeding from wounds to his wrist and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosa had left a handwritten confession to killing his wife and  
stuffing her body in the freezer, police said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Weapons Sold Without Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of old Army rifles have been sold to  
civilians in the past few years without required criminal 
background and U.S. citizenship checks, according to congressional 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lawmakers who asked for the audit of the longtime Civilian  
Marksmanship Program, which has been run by a private group since 
1996, pledged Tuesday to introduce legislation requiring greater 
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows whose hands wound up on those triggers?'' Rep.  
Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said in a statement released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said he was appalled by the  
findings of the General Accounting Office. ``The GAO investigation 
showed that privatization meant the end of Army controls on gun 
buyers, so even felons could purchase M-1 rifles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 law handed over administration of old Army rifle and  
pistol sales to a private group created by the legislation, the 
Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms 
Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, designed to promote and monitor marksmanship  
training through affiliated gun clubs, had been in existence since 
1903, with the Army selling old firearms instead of destroying 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law required the corporation to make sure buyers were  
U.S. citizens and didn't have felony records. The old Army rifles 
were to be sold only to club members or clubs as well. But the GAO 
audit found the corporation had not routinely conducted such 
background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	After a review of 6,400 M-1 rifle sales between July 1997 and  
August 1998, the GAO estimated the corporation sold 1,200 to 2,200 
of the World War II-era semiautomatics without checks, or 19 
percent to 34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the audit, the corporation said it has improved  
scrutiny of buyers by sending applicants' names through the Justice 
Department's national instant background check system. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation, based at Fort Clinton, Ohio, also promised to  
audit sales each year to ensure criminal background checks are 
conducted and that guns go to only its club members and U.S. 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report is focused on yesterday's deficiencies,'' said  
Charles Maddox, chairman of the corporation's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO didn't say there was evidence that the Army firearms  
were used to commit any crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Sen. Lautenberg and Rep. Maloney said the law needs  
to be changed to require such audits. The lawmakers also are 
considering requiring a government agency -- perhaps the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms -- to provide oversight. Returning the 
program to the Army is not under consideration, a spokesman for 
Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Stewart, assistant GAO director who worked on the January  
report, said the 1996 law excluded the program from ATF scrutiny 
since the corporation was supposed to conduct its own checks on 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were examples where the corporation followed the law,  
but, as the audit shows, we found quite a few times when it 
didn't,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO recommended the corporation audit its firearms sales and  
that Congress amend the law to require such action. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Army has transferred more than 56,000 firearms to  
the corporation, including M-1 Garands, M-1 Carbines, M-14s, 
.22-caliber rifles and pistols, according to the GAO. As of Sept. 
30, the Army had in storage another 230,000 M-1s, 35,000 
.22-caliber rifles and more than 4,000 other firearms that the 
corporation will receive. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation, in turn, sold 22,584 weapons from the Army  
stock in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 -- 16,339 of them M-1 rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army charges the corporation about $100 per weapon to handle  
costs such as storage and transportation, a GAO spokesman said. The 
corporation then sells the arms for $450 to $750 each.

<HEADLINE> Mardi Gras Starts in New Orleans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Merry makers danced in the streets, bartered  
for beads and cheered the gaudy parades as angels, cowboys and 
clowns marched the streets from dawn to dusk in the city's Mardi 
Gras celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	The bash is the final fling before Lent, which many Christians  
observe from Ash Wednesday to Easter by fasting or by giving up 
something, like meat or sweets. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen parades -- not counting the small marching  
societies like clarinetist Pete Fountain's Half-Fast Marching Club 
-- rolled from early morning until dark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got everybody here from Grandma on down,'' said Mike  
Broud, one of 32 family members dressed as white rabbits along the 
parade route for Zulu and Rex, two of the largest parades. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here every year. It's a combination family reunion and  
party. There's nothing else like it in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With sunshine and temperature in the 70s, crowds quickly grew.  
Police believed the combination of good weather and a four-day 
weekend, thanks to Presidents Day on Monday, would boost the throng 
to a record size. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're huge crowds, much bigger than last year,'' said police  
spokesman Marlon Defillo. ``We had 1.5 million people then. We'll 
have over 2 million this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arrests were up slightly in the French Quarter, Defillo said,  
but they were all misdemeanors -- nudity, urinating in public, 
trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
	``No problems at all, really,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Satin-clad angels rubbed elbows with clowns and cowboys along  
St. Charles Avenue, the mansion-lined parade route where floats 
rolled for over eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Children and adults staked out spots before dawn, then clamored  
for trinkets tossed by costumed riders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spend about $2,000 on beads and I throw every single one of  
them before the end of the day,'' said Stacie Honore, 32, a rider 
on the Zulu parade. ``You can't believe how much fun it is to throw 
your money away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People on balconies in the French Quarter tossed beads to the  
celebrants below. Although it is illegal, many flashed flesh in 
exchange for the long strings of plastic beads. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just good clean fun, why would they arrest you for  
that?'' asked Judy Hudson, 26, of Los Angeles.

	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- Germain Green Glidden, a national squash  
racquets champion and founder of the National Art Museum of Sport, 
died Feb. 8. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Glidden won nine national titles in squash between 1935 and  
1956. He was intercollegiate champion in 1935 and 1936, and held 
the national singles title from 1936-1938. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving as a naval officer during World War II, Glidden  
became a portrait artist. His works have been displayed in the 
national halls of fame of baseball, basketball and tennis. 
</P>
<P>

	GARY, Ind. (AP) -- Gerald ``Bounce'' Gregory, the bass singer who  
hit the distinctive low notes on The Spaniels' 1950s classic 
``Goodnight Sweetheart, Goodnight,'' died Friday. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	While the doo-wop group didn't hit it big nationally, their  
signature song, penned by lead singer James ``Pookie'' Hudson, was 
covered by several bands during the 1950s, notably The McGwire 
Sisters and Pat Boone. 
</P>
<P>
	Sha-Na-Na sang ``Goodnight Sweetheart, Goodnight'' to close its  
television show each week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniels were made up of students from Gary's Roosevelt High  
School. The group later signed with Chicago record label Vee Jay 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniels were awarded the Pioneer Award from the Rhythm &AMP;  
Blues Foundation of the Smithsonian Institution in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's career was at its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, but  
the Spaniels, with some replacement members, continued to perform 
around the country. Gregory's last performance with the group was 
in December 1998.

</P>
<P>
	WAKULLA SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- Henry W. Kendall, a physicist who  
won the Nobel Prize for his building blocks of matter and a 
founding member of the antiwar group Union of Concerned Scientists, 
died Monday during an underwater photography dive. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  
was taking pictures in about 10 feet of water at Wakulla Springs 
State Park, when his body was found in shallow water. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy determined that Kendall did not drown. Officials said  
Tuesday they were conducting more tests to determine a cause of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, along with Jerome I. Friedman and Richard E. Taylor,  
worked for years starting in the late 1960s uncovering evidence 
that protons and neutrons, once thought to be basic building blocks 
of matter, were made up of smaller components called quarks. They 
all shared the Nobel prize in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A founding member of the Union of Concerned Scientists in 1969,  
Kendall had served as that organization's chairman since 1973. He 
led efforts to warn against the dangers of nuclear weapons, safety 
hazards in nuclear power industry and space-based weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the union, Kendall challenged President Reagan's ``star  
wars'' defense system proposal -- a system of satellites to defend 
American cities against nuclear attack. He had also helped brief 
President Clinton in 1997 on global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall and his brother were also large shareholders in the  
family business, Kendall Co., which made Curad bandages, Curity 
diapers and hospital equipment. Colgate Palmolive Co. bought the 
business in 1972 for $512 million.

	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- William Kessen, a noted child  
psychologist who was the Eugene Higgins Professor Emeritus of 
Psychology at Yale University, died Saturday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Kessen's research centered on the behavior of children in the  
first years of life. 
</P>
<P>
	He was especially known for his research on how infants organize  
and make sense of the world before they are able to speak. He also 
studied the emergence of professional psychology in the late 19th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to numerous articles, Kessen's publications included  
several books. Among them were: ``The Language of Psychology'' 
(with George Mandler), ``The Child,'' ``Childhood in China,'' and 
``The Rise and Fall of Development.'' 
</P>
<P>

	A day later, Gordon turned his winning car over to be displayed  
at an exhibit next door to the track. Then, he started looking 
forward to the chase for a third-straight Winston Cup series title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We not only got the Daytona 500 win, but we got that first win  
of the season out of the way,'' Gordon said. ``It's so important to 
get that first win. After last season was over, you go, `Boy, do we 
have what it takes to get to victory lane again next year? Are we 
going to be a championship contender?' I'm still not sure about the 
championship part, but we definitely have one win out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what a victory it was.  
</P>
<P>
	A day later, Gordon was still putting the pieces together,  
trying to explain the thought process he used to muster a late 
chase through the pack that produced a scintillating final dash to 
the finish with Earnhardt on his bumper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is planned,'' Gordon said. ``I wish I could plan  
passes, but you never know when you're going to get a run on a 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the passing was over, Gordon had only one, daunting  
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	With Earnhardt bearing down, Gordon held him off with moves he  
had learned over his decade-plus of racing -- some by watching The 
Intimidator himself -- and ruined Earnhardt's hopes for a 
second-straight Daytona 500 title. 
</P>
<P>
	It could go down as the best finish in the 41-year history of  
the race. Even Gordon said he didn't fully understand the impact it 
had until well after the race was complete. 
</P>
<P>
	``You realize when you pick up the paper the next day how big an  
event this actually is,'' he said. ``It's not just an auto race, 
but an event that millions of people watch. To pull off a big win 
like that is exciting, especially because of the way it came down 
to Dale Earnhardt and myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon won his third straight race, dating to last year. One  
event into the season, it seems all the pieces are in place to 
match last year's 13-victory mark, which tied Richard Petty for the 
most wins in the modern era. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon also got a big jump on surpassing last year's record $9.3  
million in earnings. He took home a $2.1 million paycheck that 
included a $1 million sponsor bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	After he said good-bye to Daytona, he boarded a Lear jet and  
traveled to New York, where he was scheduled for television 
appearances with David Letterman and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I realized how big an event the Daytona 500 was  
until I won it the first time in 1997,'' Gordon said. ``You go on a 
whirlwind tour. You go to New York, you go do the Letterman show 
and all the media things and they treat you like a king.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a magical day in Daytona, it was clear that Gordon had earned  
the title.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Allegations Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The National Labor Relations Board has  
announced its intention to dismiss charges filed against 
Anheuser-Busch Inc. by the Teamsters union. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had challenged the company's implementation last  
September of its final contract offer covering some 8,000 
Anheuser-Busch U.S. brewery employees represented by the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that the Board has recognized we have acted  
properly throughout this process and that it is clear that the 
parties reached impasse,'' said William L. Rammes, the vice 
president of corporate human resources. ``This demonstrates that 
the union's charges to the contrary were without merit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Scott, head of one of the Teamsters local in St. Louis,  
said the union would appeal, as it has appealed the dismissal of 
earlier charges of bargaining in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still believe we're not at an impasse,'' said Scott.  
</P>
<P>
	The company maintains that the two sides had reached an impasse,  
giving it legal justification to start enforcing a five-year 
contract last September. The brewer pointed out that union members 
have twice voted down a proposed contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis D'Amico, who coordinated the agency's investigation, said  
the union's latest charges ``just didn't have any merit. The 
implementation was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Board officials told the company that it will also dismiss  
another Teamsters charge that had challenged the company's 
elimination of union dues checkoff, its protection of internal 
company documents on the implementation process and the format of 
final offer clarifications, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rammes said the implementation of the contract was almost  
complete and was going well. 
</P>
<P>
	When a second hourly raise kicks in March 1, Teamsters will make  
almost $22 an hour. With benefits, their total hourly compensation 
will top $45, he said.

<HEADLINE> Benitez, Mets Agree at $1,987,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- The New York Mets avoided going to a  
salary arbitration hearing for the seventh straight year, agreeing 
Tuesday with reliever Armando Benitez on a one-year contract worth 
$1,987,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Benitez, who had been scheduled for a hearing Tuesday afternoon,  
agreed to a deal halfway between the $2.4 million he had sought and 
the $1,575,000 the Mets had offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Benitez, obtained from Baltimore during the offseason, was 5-6  
with a 3.82 ERA and 22 saves for the Orioles last season and made 
$1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	New York previously agreed to an $18.4 million, four-year  
contract with second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo and one-year deals 
with shortstop Rey Ordonez ($1.65 million) and pitchers Hideo Nomo 
($2,925,000), Turk Wendell ($1,200,000.99) and Jason Isringhausen 
($350,000). 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets haven't gone to a hearing since 1992, when they lost to  
David Cone, and beat Kevin Elster and Jeff Innis.

<HEADLINE> Peabody Acquires Coal Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Peabody Group has acquired an additional  
38.3 percent share of Black Beauty Coal Co. for about $150 million, 
giving it a majority stake in the state's largest coal producer. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis-based Peabody is buying a 33.3 percent share owned by  
P&AMP;M Coal Mining Co., a unit of Chevron Corp., and a 5 percent 
interest held by Black Beauty managers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Monday and expected to close within 30 days,  
will give Peabody an 81.7 percent stake in Black Beauty. The 
management group, called Black Beauty Resources Inc., will retain 
the remaining 18.3 percent share. 
</P>
<P>
	Black Beauty shipped more than 17 million tons of coal last year  
and had about $350 million in revenues. It operates eight mines in 
Indiana and three in southern Illinois. It sells low-, medium and 
high-sulfur coal to power companies and industrial users. 
</P>
<P>
	Peabody, the world's largest coal company, said its coal fueled  
9 percent of all the U.S. electricity generation last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Its Peabody Holding Co. recently agreed to pay $1.3 million to  
members of the United Mine Workers for a labor contract violation 
stemming from the transfer of some of its coal reserves to Black 
Beauty, a nonunion company. Peabody at the time held only a 
minority stake in Black Beauty. The UMW revealed the settlement 
last week.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Sign Dunston, Perez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals, seeking infield depth,  
agreed Tuesday to a $500,000, one-year contract with shortstop 
Shawon Dunston. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston, a 14-year veteran, has spent most of his career with  
the Chicago Cubs and also played for San Francisco, Pittsburgh and 
Cleveland. He hit .176 in 51 at-bats with the Giants last season, 
getting three homers and eight RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston, 35, has a .269 career average and is a two-time  
All-Star. He'll back up shortstop Edgar Renteria and second baseman 
Carlos Baerga, and can also play the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston could equal his $1 million 1998 salary by earning all  
$500,000 in available performance bonuses. He would get $50,000 
each for 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 plate 
appearances, and $20,000 each for 80, 90, 100, 110 and 120 games. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis also signed former Cincinnati first baseman Eduardo  
Perez to a minor league contract and invited him to spring training 
along with Erik Pappas, a former Cardinals backup catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we try to put together a quality bench for 1999, we think  
Shawon and Eduardo could play very important roles,'' general 
manager Walt Jocketty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez would get $50,000 in the minors and $325,000 if he's in  
the majors, plus the chance to earn $75,000 in performance bonuses: 
$25,000 each for 300, 350 and 400 plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, son of former Cincinnati Reds star Tony Perez, has a .235  
career average in six years with California and Cincinnati. His 
best season was 1997, when he hit. 253 with 16 homers and 52 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pappas, who will compete for a spot as a backup to catcher Eli  
Marrero, has not played in the major leagues since 1994. He has a 
.242 career average in 104 big league games.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Fernandez May Start Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Alex Fernandez's first pitch in 18 months could  
come on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming he's healthy, the Florida Marlins right-hander will  
start the season opener April 5 against the New York Mets, manager 
John Boles said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, coming back from a torn rotator cuff that sidelined  
him after the 1997 NL championship series, will test his right arm 
in spring training starting next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of anybody better to open the season with,''  
Boles said. ``I haven't even talked to anybody about it, but for me 
it's a no-brainer. He deserves it. In my mind, going in he's a No. 
1. I don't care if he sat out a year; he's a tremendous pitcher and 
a tremendous competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez was pleased to hear about Boles' comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great. I feel proud,'' Fernandez said. ``I've worked  
very hard to get to this point. You certainly want support from 
your manager, and you want your manager to believe in you, because 
it helps you prepare mentally and helps you believe in yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez's likely opponent on opening day against the New York  
Mets is former Florida teammate Al Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the best shape of my life,'' said Fernandez, who threw  
90 pitches Monday. ``The only thing I might do differently at the 
start of spring training is instead of throwing three days in a 
row, I might only throw two days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not for the torn rotator cuff, Fernandez would likely have  
been traded during the Marlins' salary purge last year. He has 
three seasons remaining on his $7 million-a-year contract, and 
there will be trade interest this spring if the 29-year-old pitcher 
shows he's healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1993-97, Fernandez averaged 220 innings and nearly 14 wins  
per season.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The original Stockton-Malone combination is still better than  
the upstart impersonators from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	John Stockton and Karl Malone held off a spirited charge from  
Jason Williams and Chris Webber as the Utah Jazz beat the Kings 
120-112 in overtime Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento appeared ready to upset the Jazz thanks primarily to  
standout efforts from rookie point guard Williams and new 
acquisition Webber that sparked memories of Stockton and Malone in 
their early days. 
</P>
<P>
	In just his fifth pro game, Williams had 19 points and seven  
assists, while Webber had 26 points and 11 rebounds before fouling 
out early in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``He plays with a lot of confidence, but their whole team  
does,'' Stockton said of Williams. ``They're going to beat some 
people this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not Monday night. Malone hit five free throws in the final  
minute of regulation to force overtime, and the Jazz made a 9-2 run 
to start the extra period and run their record to a franchise-best 
6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take the win and not dwell on the rest,'' said Stockton,  
who scored eight of his 10 points in the fourth quarter and had 15 
assists. ``Karl is our guy. He made huge free throws all night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the moral victories, however, belonged to the Kings (2-3  
with just one home game so far), who appear transformed from the 
moribund franchise that has made the playoffs just once in the last 
12 years. And with Williams and Webber, they may have a young go-to 
combination similar to the one that has served the Jazz so well for 
so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel some good about it, but we need to win some of these  
games,'' Kings coach Rick Adelman said. ``We have a lot of road 
games (14 of their first 21), and it's a tough stretch for any 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere Monday, it was New York 78, Detroit 69; Miami 95, New  
Jersey 72; Phoenix 115, Denver 106; Portland 99, Dallas 84; and 
Golden State 101, Minnesota 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryon Russell and Shandon Anderson combined for 12 points in  
overtime as Utah remained one of two undefeated teams heading into 
tonight's showdown with Seattle (5-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, despite shooting just 8-for-20 from the field, led the  
Jazz with 26 points and nine rebounds. Russell had 25 points -- 
seven in overtime -- and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Knicks 78, Pistons 69    	
</P>
<P>
	At New York, Grant Hill scored 31 points, but the Knicks held  
the rest of Detroit's players in check. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston scored 19 points, Patrick Ewing had 14, Larry  
Johnson 12 and Charlie Ward 10 for the Knicks, who double-teamed 
Hill near midcourt whenever they could. The strategy worked as New 
York held the Pistons to 36 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Miami 95, New Jersey 72    	
</P>
<P>
	At Miami, Alonzo Mourning had 34 points, 17 rebounds and seven  
blocks as the Heat handed New Jersey its third straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	P.J. Brown chipped in 12 points and nine rebounds for Miami,  
which has won 12 of its last 14 games against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Van Horn paced the Nets with 19 points.  
</P>
<P>
                        *Suns 115, Nuggets 106    	
</P>
<P>
	Jason Kidd had 28 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds and George  
McCloud added 24 points as Phoenix won at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd was 9-for-17 shooting and posted his 20th triple-double as  
the Suns beat the Nuggets for the eighth consecutive time and 
second time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant Stith scored 23 points and Nick Van Exel added 21 for the  
Nuggets. Antonio McDyess, who played for the Suns last season, had 
20 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Trail Blazers 99, Mavericks 84

	At Portland, Arvydas Sabonis had 16 points, 10 rebounds and nine  
assists for the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasheed Wallace added 15 points, while Damon Stoudamire and  
Isaiah Rider each had 14 points for Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Finley led Dallas with 21 points, and Steve Nash added  
19.

<P>
                    *Warriors 101, Timberwolves 99

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Be Cited in Jones Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In a sign that President Clinton's  
legal troubles aren't over, a federal judge said Tuesday she is 
prepared to consider whether he should be found in contempt of 
court for his testimony about Monica Lewinsky in the Paula Jones 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright said she had waited to  
address the issue because of the impeachment trial and the fact 
that Mrs. Jones' case had been pending before an appeals court. It 
was settled in December for $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accordingly, I believe that now it is time for the court to  
address the contempt issue,'' she said in an order issued Tuesday 
after a status conference with lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also said she would step aside from the case if she were  
asked to do so by attorneys because of her contact with a House 
impeachment case manager. She gave lawyers until Friday to file a 
request that she remove herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House referred all requests for comment to Clinton's  
private lawyer in the case, Robert Bennett. Bennett did not 
immediately return a call to his office seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright raised the possibility of contempt in a footnote to her  
decision on Sept. 1 to release a transcript of Clinton's testimony 
in a deposition in the Jones sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Wright said she ``has concerns about the nature of  
the president's January 17, 1998, deposition'' but ``makes no 
findings at this time regarding whether the president may be in 
contempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition, Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual  
relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' He acknowledged Aug. 17 before a 
federal grand jury -- and again in a nationally televised address -- 
that he had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group in  
Washington, filed a formal petition with Wright months ago seeking 
a court hearing on whether Clinton was in contempt of court because 
of what the private organization called his ``apparently false 
testimony.'' The foundation said ``the court has the right, if not 
the duty, to defend itself against obstructive acts committed in 
its presence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In saying she would step down, Wright disclosed Tuesday she had  
contact with Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and her law clerk 
provided an affidavit for possible use in the impeachment case. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Hutchinson wanted her testimony about Clinton's  
demeanor during his deposition testimony, including where his 
attention was directed. She said she was not willing to be a 
witness in the impeachment proceeding and suggested that other 
people could provide the same evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Her law clerk, Barry Ward, later provided an affidavit about  
Clinton's deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said she didn't think those were reasons for her to  
step aside. 
</P>
<P>
	If that happens, the contempt matter would be decided by another  
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones filed her lawsuit in 1994. Wright dismissed the  
lawsuit April 1, but Mrs. Jones appealed the decision. The appeal 
was pending when she and Clinton reached the settlement Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawsuit brought to light the president's affair with  
Ms. Lewinsky and set in motion a criminal investigation that 
resulted in the House vote to impeach Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones alleged that Clinton, when he was governor of  
Arkansas, made a crude advance in a room at a Little Rock hotel in 
1991. She was a state worker at the time. Clinton denies her 
accusation.

<HEADLINE> Tom Shales To Fill In for Siskel </HEADLINE>

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Look for film critic Tom Shales when those thumbs  
go up or down on TV next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Shales will be the first revolving co-host to fill in for Gene  
Siskel on the syndicated ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' show while Siskel (He's

brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Shales, like Ebert, is a Pulitzer Prize-winning critic. He is  
The Washington Post's television critic but has reviewed movies for 
the Post and National Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel, the film critic for the Chicago Tribune, had surgery in  
May to remove a growth on his brain. Ebert, the film critic for the 
Chicago Sun-Times, has been host by himself since Siskel took a 
leave of absence Feb. 3.

<HEADLINE> Choreographer Alvin Ailey Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Hymn,'' a 33-minute dance Judith Jamison  
created in tribute to Alvin Ailey, is the centerpiece of the next 
WNET ``Great Performances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hourlong show, ``A Hymn for Alvin Ailey,'' airs Wednesday at  
10 p.m. (ET) on PBS and includes interviews with former dancers, 
photographer Jack Mitchell and Ailey, the dancer-choreographer who 
founded the popular Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Aily died 10 years ago aged 58 but ``he still can emotionally  
move us,'' says Jamison, in her 10th year as artistic director of 
the company. ``He thought dance should take you someplace 
emotionally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison says that with ``Hymn'' she was attempting to have a  
conversation with Ailey, to tell him that the company is continuing 
in the way he envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
	When she was thinking about choreographing ``Hymn'' for the  
company's 35th anniversary, in 1993, Jamison went to the theater to 
see Anna Deavere Smith's one-woman show in which she created 
characters for people she had interviewed in Crown Heights, 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her technique sparked me,'' Jamison says. ``I said to her,  
`Why don't you interview my dancers about Alvin and let's see what 
we can work from there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith interviewed the dancers and in the PBS show, she appears  
near dancers while they dance, speaking the dancer's words in what 
she perceives to be the dancer's voice or accent. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every dancer is eloquent, Jamison says, but they all were  
real, which Ailey would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some things they talk about are so mundane and some are so  
important. It's what we really all are. We can't be profound 24 
hours a day. I think it was very important for dancers to express 
how they felt about being with Alvin or being young and not being 
with him,'' Jamison says. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Ailey believed in individuality, meaning he didn't  
choose dancers of only one body type, height or color. ``He always 
said, `Let me help you along to become this person you're going to 
be.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And he brought many choreographers' work into the company, along  
with his own dances. The company continues to bring in new dances. 
The 40th anniversary season in New York in December saw four 
premieres, one by Jamison, one by French choreographer Redha and 
two by company members Lisa Johnson and Troy O'Neil Powell. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison joined the Ailey company in 1965 and soon became a star.  
Of the dances Ailey created for her, the most famous is the solo 
``Cry,'' about the trials and strengths of black women. The dance 
was a birthday present to Ailey's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alvin used to say, `I want the audience to see how difficult  
this is.' He didn't always want you to look like you had the ease 
of the movement,'' Jamison says. ``He thrived on how hard we worked 
to show the emotion of the pieces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Hymn,'' Jamison used some of Ailey's choreographic  
movements as a tribute. In the beginning and end, she says, she 
used abstract versions of ``Wade in the Water'' and ``I Been 
'Buked,'' two sections from ``Revelations,'' Ailey's masterwork. 
``Of course, I wanted to invoke those shapes in my way and I did 
that on purpose,'' Jamison says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hymn'' was filmed in May 1997 in a theater in Purchase, N.Y.,  
as well as the ``spiritual walking'' section at the Cathedral of 
St. John the Divine in New York City, where Ailey's funeral was. 
The show also has brief footage of the funeral, which was attended 
by 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison would like the TV show to be available to college movie  
theaters, film festivals and video stores. ``I want it to be as 
accessible as Alvin wanted the dance company to be -- and it still 
is,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-member company is on a U.S. tour through May 15. The  
Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble tours all the time. It gives 
graduates of Ailey's school two years of experience before they 
audition for the senior company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alvin's spirit is alive and well. As long as we're doing his  
work,'' Jamison says, ``his spirit will always be there.''

	HAIR TESTING: How reliable is testing strands of hair to detect  
drug use? CBS's ``This Morning'' tries to find out in a three-part 
investigative report that began Monday. One expert tells reporter 
Roberta Baskin that people with dark hair are more likely to test 
positive because of the amount of melanin in their hair. Another 
expert says that in situations where a person's job or liberty are 
at stake, hair testing is questionable. On Wednesday, Baskin 
reveals the results of tests conducted on hair samples containing 
illegal drugs that she sent to three different laboratories.

<HEADLINE> Japan Steelmaker Denies Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's top steemaker today said fresh allegations  
by U.S. steelmakers that Japan is dumping exports in the American 
market ``hard to understand'' and smack of protectionism. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, major U.S. steelmakers and the United Steelworkers  
Union filed import complaints accusing Japan and seven other 
countries of selling steel in the U.S. market at below production 
costs and home market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint news release, Bethlehem Steel Corp., Gulf States  
Steel Inc., IPSCO Steel, Inc., Tuscaloosa Steel Co., USX Corp. and 
the union said eight countries were responsible for pushing down 
prices that forced American factories to significantly cut back 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions of these foreign producers have caused serious  
injury to our domestic industry,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon Steel Corp., Japan's and the world's largest integrated  
steelmaker, denied the dumping allegation, saying it was ``hard to 
understand what is behind the filing of the complaints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry's approach, by calling for protectionist  
measures to solve its own management problems, is ``too 
simplistic,'' Nippon Steel said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon Steel often acts in behalf of Japan's steel industry when  
a trade row emerges over Japanese steel exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese exports of steel to the United States have become a  
major trade issue between the two countries, with American 
steelmakers accusing several foreign companies of harming their 
industry with cheap imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government announced last week that it had evidence  
that Japan and Brazil had illegally dumped hot-rolled steel. The 
fresh complaints on Tuesday concerned a different type of steel, 
cut-to-length plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's exports of steel-plate products to the United States  
skyrocketed more than 5,800 percent to 278,180 tons in the first 11 
months of last year, according to the Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Federation officials said, however, that Japan's sharp exports  
during the period came largely at the request of the U.S. 
steelmakers themselves and steel users to meet a domestic supply 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese steel industry wants the U.S. government to conduct  
a ``fair investigation based on the law,'' Nippon Steel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry also  
announced it will closely watch the investigation, national 
broadcast NHK reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission has 45 days and the  
Commerce Department 160 days to make a preliminary determination of 
injury that could lead to new tariffs on steel exports from those 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic, France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan,  
Macedonia and South Korea were the other countries mentioned in the 
complaint.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 66 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were higher at midday but the rally  
had stalled, after a morning run-up fueled by a drop in interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
66.17 at 9,341.06. The Dow got as high as 9387.40, up 112.51, in 
the first hour of trading, after losing 88.57 points last Friday. 
The financial markets were closed Monday for the President's Day 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 16.90 at 1,247.03, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index rose 27.57 at 2,349.46 after having tumbled 83.66 
points on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's run-up was sparked by a rally in U.S. bonds, after the  
Bank of Japan cut a key bank lending rate on Friday, and the 
Japanese government followed up Tuesday by saying it will step up 
purchases of government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement pushed interest rates lower in Japan and  
boosted the Nikkei stock average by 1.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also supported the U.S. bond market, where the benchmark  
30-year bond was up 27/32 point, pushing its yield down to 5.36 
percent from late Friday's 5.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a big boost in the morning from the bond market,'' said  
Bill Meehan, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. ``Japaniese 
bonds rallied pretty sharply, and that helped put a pretty strong 
bid under the U.S. bond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in interest rates boosted financial services and  
utility stocks. Citigroup was up 1 11/16 at 53 9/16. The Dow Jones 
utility average was up 2.61 points, or .91 percent, at 289.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also returning to technology shares, which had  
been beaten down on Friday following a big sell-off in Dell. 
Analysts warned the computer maker faces tougher competition as 
other PC makers cut costs and shift their business models to 
include more direct sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell shares were up 2 7/8 at 92 3/4. The company is expected to  
release earnings after the close of trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 4 to 3 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 302.46 million shares, just 
under Friday's pace of 316.62 million.

<HEADLINE> American Red Cross Sued for $34.2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- A man imprisoned in Mexico for eight  
months has sued the American Red Cross for $34.2 million, saying 
the agency was responsible for his imprisonment and did nothing to 
get him out. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbert Andrews, 50, an El Paso businessman who once sold  
medical equipment, was released from a Mazatlan prison in December 
after fraud charges against him were dropped due to lack of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit doesn't name former Red Cross President Elizabeth  
Dole as a defendant, but Andrews accuses her and other Red Cross 
officials of ``unconscionable and egregious'' conduct in failing to 
get him out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit evolved from a $130,000 deal between Andrews and the  
Mazatlan chapter of the Mexican Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews contends Red Cross officials in Mexico and the United  
States conspired to avoid import tariffs. To do so, the American 
Red Cross indicated in a letter that it was donating the $130,000 
worth of medical equipment, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews was accused of embezzling the money. Mazatlan Red Cross  
officials said they filed a criminal fraud complaint because much 
of the equipment was broken and useless when it arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said he took that money and did not give them anything in  
return,'' said Andrews' lawyer, Christopher Antcliff said. ``Their 
(the American Red Cross) actions caused him to spend 242 days in a 
Third World prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Named as defendants are the American Red Cross, the El Paso  
chapter of the American Red Cross and its former local director, 
Carmen Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ms. Ruiz nor Mrs. Dole's spokeswoman Joyce Campbell  
returned telephone calls from The Associated Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Blaul, spokesman for the American Red Cross, said Andrews'  
dispute should be with the Mexican Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Andrews' case is without merit,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gramm Makes Bank Overhaul Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new chairman of the Senate Banking  
Committee has jumped into the debate on overhauling financial 
services laws with a proposal more in line with the views of the 
Federal Reserve than those of the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, took the helm of the  
Banking Committee after former chairman Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, 
R-N.Y., lost his re-election bid in November. Gramm unveiled his 
draft legislation Tuesday for lifting the Depression-era barriers 
between banks, securities firms and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	All financial overhaul proposals before Congress would create  
huge financial ``supermarkets,'' offering consumers checking 
accounts, mutual funds, insurance policies and much more. Ralph 
Nader and other consumer advocates have expressed concern that the 
changes could bring a dangerous concentration of economic power in 
fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's proposal calls for most new financial activities to be  
conducted by affiliated companies within bank holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm has said he wants to make enactment of financial overhaul  
legislation his highest priority, even though he blocked such a 
measure last October because of his opposition to federal 
community-lending laws that banks must follow. 
</P>
<P>
	In three days of hearings last week before the House Banking  
Committee, battle lines over financial overhaul legislation were 
drawn clearly and early as Congress began this year's debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed chairman Alan Greenspan extended his public disagreement  
with the administration over the best approach to take. He endorsed 
a bill proposed by Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, 
R-Iowa, that would give the Federal Reserve more power over new 
financial activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks put him at odds again with the  
administration's top economic policymaker, Treasury Secretary 
Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin supported a new, competing version of the financial  
overhaul legislation, which would lift the barriers between 
financial industries but split regulatory authority between the 
Treasury Department and the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's new draft is closer to Greenspan's view.  
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury and the central bank have long been at odds over  
the issue, while agreeing that legislation is needed to keep the 
U.S. financial industry competitive in a fast-changing world. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to let banks diversify through  
subsidiaries of the bank itself, not just through affiliates within 
the same parent holding company. That arrangement would increase 
the power of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, regulator of nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the battle, bills letting banks into other  
kinds of financial activities through a holding company structure 
would expand the independent Fed's role in regulating financial 
services industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent nod to administration concerns that such an  
arrangement would discriminate against smaller banks, Gramm's 
proposal also would allow nationally chartered banks with $1 
billion or less in assets -- the bulk of national banks -- to get 
into the new activities through subsidiaries under certain 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 2,546 banks operating under national charters as of last  
spring, 2,359 had assets of $1 billion or less, according to the 
comptroller's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's proposal also would require the federal banking agencies  
to jointly issue consumer protection rules governing retail sales 
of insurance by banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the Clinton administration and the banking,  
securities and insurance industries said they were still studying 
Gramm's proposal and had no immediate comment.

<HEADLINE> Miami, County Clash Over Ruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The mayor wants to preserve centuries-old Tequesta  
Indian ruins discovered on the site of a planned downtown 
high-rise, but the financially-strapped city can't afford to fight 
the property's developer and is turning to the county for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the responsibility to do what is right for past  
civilizations. But I have a greater responsibility to the present 
civilization,'' Mayor Joe Carollo said Tuesday at a city commission 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	City leaders would like the 500- to 700-year-old stone circle  
left as is instead of being moved or sharing the site with the 
planned waterfront apartments, but they fear a legal battle could 
bankrupt the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city of Miami cannot afford to take a hit of $40-, $50- or  
$60 million dollars or more to pay for a (lawsuit). We would not 
survive as an entity,'' Carollo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the city commission wants Miami-Dade County to agree to  
take on the responsibility and the liability that goes with 
preserving the circle. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruins, called the Miami Circle, were discovered last year  
during a routine excavation of the property at the Miami River's 
mouth. Developer Michael Baumann has permits for the 
$126-million-project and plans to begin construction by the end of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to understand that the developer on this matter is  
ready to proceed,'' said Vicky Garcia-Toledo, spokeswoman for 
Baumann. 
</P>
<P>
	Baumann already delayed construction and paid for investigators  
to continue researching the site, Garcia-Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of Miami's commissioners appeared willing to risk a lawsuit  
by having the city take over the land. Instead, the commission 
voted 4-0 to urge Baumann to find a way to build while preserving 
the discovery on the property. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensing the city's predicament, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas  
offered to take the lead on the project. Commissioners agreed with 
one caveat -- cover all the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Penelas said he feared the county commission would reject the  
plan since Miami leaders didn't provide a clear indication they 
wanted the Miami Circle and surrounding property preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless I hear a clear message that it's important to save this  
site I won't present anything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of protesters packed the commission chambers, but were  
not allowed to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami Circle supporters have held vigils by the ruins and  
carried banners urging drivers to honk for support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never found something as profoundly unique as this,''  
said Archeologist Robert Carr, director of Miami-Dade County's 
Historic Preservation Division. ``This site is 2,000 years old. The 
Circle is 500 to 700 years of age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Archaeologists say it could be a ceremonial temple built by the  
Tequesta, a tribe of about 10,000 Indians who lived in south 
Florida before war and disease wiped them out in the 1500s.

<HEADLINE> Japan: Bad Loans Will Be Cleaned Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's major banks will finish writing off their  
share of the bad debt hobbling the financial system by the end of 
March, the country's financial reform chief said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government on Friday gave preliminary approval to funneling  
7.5 trillion yen ($65 billion) to 15 major Japanese banks in a 
massive effort to clean up the debt mess. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash infusion is a fraction of the debt facing the overall  
financial system. Insurers, brokerages and other financial firms, 
are struggling with as much as 100 trillion yen ($862 billion) in 
problem loans left over from the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakuo Yanagisawa, who heads the Financial Revitalization  
Commission, said while new problem loans could arise, he expects 
the majority of problem loans will be removed. Japan's fiscal year 
ends on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Yanagisawa said the public fund injections would give the banks  
enough capital to erase losses on stock holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of money each bank receives will depend on the bank's  
restructuring plans, he said.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Modifies Cell Phone Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines has loosened its rules on  
the use of cellular phones aboard aircraft and in jetways. 
</P>
<P>
	Effective immediately, Northwest passengers may use their  
portable cell phones aboard planes and in the jetways connecting 
planes and terminals whenever at least one of the aircraft doors is 
open. Northwest's new policy is similar to that of its alliance 
partner Continental Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``For people on the go these days, down time is lost time,''  
said Tim Griffin, Northwest executive vice president for marketing 
and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	A Northwest pilot in command also may allow the use of cell  
phones after plane doors are closed while the aircraft is on the 
ground and clear of all runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers also may use at any time the in-flight phone systems  
installed on most aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The change does not apply to laptop computers, portable audio  
players, electronic games or other electronic devices which may not 
be used while on the ground or during flight until permission is 
given by cabin announcement.

<HEADLINE> Mardi Gras Starts in New Orleans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Members of the Half-Fast Marching Club  
lurched Mardi Gras into action today as they paraded shortly after 
dawn for the holiday throngs, many bleary-eyed from partying 
through the night. 
</P>
<P>
	The smells of sausage and steak sizzling on grills and red beans  
simmering in huge pots woke those who had camped overnight for 
prime people-watching spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1960, jazz clarinetist Pete Fountain's marching club  
claims 125 members, including actor John Goodman, who was riding in 
a big wagon behind the costumed ``half-fast'' marchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Watson, 47, of Slidell, and about 70 of his relatives  
staked out a spot on St. Charles Avenue just after midnight. His 
family has been congregating in the same spot for at least 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about how many beads we can get and how much food we can  
eat,'' Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Camped out nearby was Chris Hudson, 21, of New York City,  
dressed as Wonder Woman and eating a breakfast of doughnuts and 
beer. Asked whether his mother knew what he was doing, the Tulane 
student said, ``She doesn't want to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is why people come to Tulane. Never mind the education  
they give you, it's what you learn in the streets that's 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was estimated that more than 2 million people, many wearing  
outrageous and often naughty costumes, would jam New Orleans and 
its suburbs for what has been billed as the world's largest free 
street party. 
</P>
<P>
	The partying began over the weekend and escalated as Lent, which  
arrives Wednesday, drew nearer. Parades filled the streets, music 
filled the air, beer and booze sloshed in plastic ``go-cups'' -- 
glass containers are banned on city streets -- and plenty of flesh 
was on display. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't decide between Disney World and this. Who cares  
about some mouse?'' Joe Milling, 43, of Detroit, said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Five parades roll today in New Orleans and nine more in its  
suburbs, where the entertainment is traditionally more 
family-oriented. Next come floats carrying members of the Zulu 
Social Aid and Pleasure Club -- black men in a blackface spoof of 
the ``krewes,'' the once lily-white clubs that sponsor Mardi Gras 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Carnival first, symbolizing racial harmony, ``Rex, King of  
Carnival,'' head of the most prestigious of the old-line krewes, 
and ``King Zulu'' met and shook hands Monday night as part of a 
giant open-air music and fireworks show. ``Rex'' is a white 
businessman, Louis Freeman, and ``King Zulu'' this year is a black 
doctor, Dr. Myron Moorehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it remains predominantly white, the Rex krewe began  
admitting blacks after the City Council adopted an ordinance seven 
years ago requiring parading organizations to open their membership 
to all races. Three of the old-line krewes stopped holding parades 
rather than comply with the ordinance.

<HEADLINE> Japan May Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fearing that higher borrowing costs could choke off  
business activity, Japan moved again Tuesday to lower interest 
rates in the latest effort to repair damage to the world's 
second-largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced that the government  
would cut back its sales of 10-year bonds by about 22 percent, 
making up some of the difference with sales of bonds with shorter 
maturities. The government also said that an agency that manages 
public pension funds would resume buying government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``These steps should have a positive impact on long-term  
interest rates,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin announcements were aimed at reversing a sharp decline  
in Japanese government bond prices that had forced benchmark 
interest rates higher, threatening to further cramp economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves came on the same day as the Economic Planning Agency  
reported the economy remains distressed and followed a cut Friday 
in a key short-term interest rate by the Bank of Japan, the 
country's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets cheered the government's efforts to rein in  
interest rates. The main Japanese stock index rose 1.3 percent and 
the price of the 10-year government bond soared, pushing its yield 
down to 1.99 percent from 2.14 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. markets also rallied. Yields on 30-year U.S. government  
bonds, a barometer for long-term borrowing costs for consumers and 
business, tumbled to 5.39 percent Tuesday afternoon from 5.42 
percent on Friday, and stocks and the dollar followed bonds higher. 
U.S. markets were closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has been urging Japan to shore up its economy  
as a way to help pull weaker Asian nations out of their own 
economic slump. Without Japanese banks lending in Asia or Japanese 
consumers buying Asian goods, many fear that the region may take 
even longer to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest sign that Japan's economic troubles run deep, the  
government's main economic forecasting unit, the Economic Planning 
Agency, issued a report Tuesday saying the outlook for Japan 
remains bleak despite scattered signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	In its February report on the economy, the agency pointed to the  
lack of improvement in consumer spending, which continues to shrink 
as workers become increasingly frugal due to falling wages and 
record-high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Weak domestic demand has put the Japanese economy, already mired  
in its worst recession since the end of World War II, in an 
``extremely severe'' state, the planning agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did note some bright spots -- such as a pickup in  
housing construction and a slowdown in the rate of bankruptcies -- 
but said these were doing little more than slowing the pace of 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted the risk from rising long-term interest  
rates, which could increase borrowing costs for Japanese companies 
and hurt exports by driving up the yen against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though the rise in interest rates hasn't had a negative effect  
on the economy yet, a continued rise would pose downside risks for 
the economy,'' said Takashi Omori, director of the national 
economic division at the agency's research bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami expressed optimism the lower  
rates would stimulate new demand by cutting borrowing costs for 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the current situation, I get a good impression  
that this will give vigor to the domestic economy,'' Hayami said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Unions Sue Tobacco Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Health-care insurers for Ohio's labor unions  
are suing the tobacco industry for almost $2 billion to cover the 
costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit claims tobacco companies targeted  
blue-collar workers and their children through advertising and 
promotional gimmicks that encouraged them to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found documents that indicate that the tobacco industry was  
aware that people with lower incomes and less education, and who go 
to work right after high school, are more susceptible to the 
advertising -- the Marlboro man image, Joe Camel, etc. -- and this is 
the most vulnerable group to purchase their tobacco products,'' 
said Mike Withey, an attorney from Seattle representing the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was brought by an Ohio group representing more than 100  
labor union trust funds, which hold the money union members and 
their employers set aside for health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry also discovered the health hazards of  
cigarette smoking through its research and kept that information 
from the public, according to the lawsuit, which goes to trial 
Monday in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry attorneys maintain there are no legal grounds  
for the lawsuit. Tobacco companies, like any other business, have a 
legal right to advertise, said Robert Weber, an attorney who 
represents R.J. Reynolds Co., which makes such cigarettes as Camel, 
Vantage, Winston and Salem and is one of the companies named in the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're trying to say is that somehow Ohio working men  
and women don't somehow understand advertising and are more 
susceptible than other people in society -- and that's just 
hogwash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is one of more than 30 similar ones across the  
nation. Judges have thrown out such lawsuits in Florida and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit comes on the heels of a recent $206 billion  
settlement of tobacco suits in 46 states, including more than $9 
billion for Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs dismissed The Liggett Group, which makes  
Chesterfield, Lark, L&AMP;M and Eve cigarettes and is based in Durham, 
N.C., from the lawsuit in exchange for its cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants in the lawsuit are Philip Morris Inc., Lorillard  
Tobacco Co., RJR Nabisco Inc. and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., all 
based in New York; Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. of Louisville, 
Ky.; British American Tobacco of Middlesex, England; and United 
States Tobacco Sales and Marketing Co. of Greenwich, Conn.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Black Panther Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An appeals court has refused to reinstate the  
murder conviction of former Black Panther Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt, 
overturned because a prosecution witness didn't reveal that he was 
a police informer. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt, now free on bail, served 27 years in prison for the 1968  
robbery and fatal shooting of schoolteacher Caroline Olsen on a 
Santa Monica tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed he was in Oakland for Black Panther meetings when she  
was killed, and that FBI agents and police hid and possibly 
destroyed wiretap evidence that would prove it. He blamed the 
arrest on a campaign by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI against the Black 
Panthers and other perceived enemies of the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Everett Dickey granted him a new trial in June 1997,  
saying the credibility of prosecution witness Julius Butler, who 
had quoted Pratt as confessing, could have been undermined if the 
jury had known of his relationship with law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler denied he was an informant. Evidence discovered later by  
Pratt's lawyers showed that he was listed on the district 
attorney's files as an informant and that a prosecutor had agreed 
to let him avoid jail for four felonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors appealed the ruling, arguing that the other evidence  
against Pratt, including two eyewitnesses, was so strong that he 
would have been convicted without Butler's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 2nd District Court of Appeal, in a 3-0 ruling Tuesday,  
said it was ``unable to profess confidence in a guilty verdict 
based solely on evidence unconnected to Butler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juliana Drous, a lawyer for Pratt, said the ruling should end  
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The courts have done the right thing,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Mike Utley Takes a Few Giant Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Mike Utley's legs buckled under him a couple of  
times, and he had to be steadied by two friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the wobbly steps that Utley took Monday represented an  
emotional triumph after seven years of unfailing optimism and 
exhausting physical therapy in the face of overwhelming odds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 17, 1991, Utley, a third-year offensive lineman for the  
Detroit Lions, was paralyzed with two crushed vertebrae, a 
horrifying injury suffered in a game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has vowed to someday walk off the Silverdome turf  
in Pontiac, Mich., from the exact spot where he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he took his first public steps toward that goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``By standing up, you feel who you are,'' he said. ``I was 315  
pounds and 6-foot-6. I was proud to be as big as I was. I was proud 
to be as tall as I am. I want it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towering over everyone as he did so long ago, wearing a Lions  
T-shirt, Utley slowly struggled down a wooden walkway, painfully 
swinging one leg ahead, then the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice his legs gave way, and the two buddies on each side,  
retired NFL center Bill Lewis and Lions linebacker Rob 
Frederickson, had to catch him. Girlfriend Dani Andersen helped by 
steadying the lower leg braces that kept his ankles from rolling 
inward. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it 10 feet or so.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was awesome to see him up there,'' Lewis said. ``Yesterday  
when we rehearsed, I was practically in tears. It's nothing short 
of miraculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he finished his news conference, just before he wheeled out  
of the room, he gave a ``thumbs up'' sign to a boy sitting on a 
man's shoulders in the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The gesture has become his trademark, just as Utley has come to  
symbolize grit, determination and optimism in the face of grim 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley, 33, is paralyzed from the chest and elbows down. His  
upper arms still are the bulging biceps of a football lineman. But 
he has only partial control of his hands and lower arms. About two 
years ago, he began to feel some sensations in his legs. He can 
feel his toes, describing it as the way you'd feel on an extremely 
cold day. 
</P>
<P>
	He began working with biofeedback, trying to identify the  
connection between his brain and those few alive nerves in his 
legs. He kept up daily, grueling physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rehabilitation is a lifestyle,'' he said. ``It's not something  
you just do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for his public display, and the pressure that  
came with it, on Monday was his desire to raise more money for his 
Mike Utley Foundation, dedicated research aimed at finding a cure 
for spinal cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley was quick to point out that no two spinal cord injuries  
are the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing you can control is your mind,'' he said. ``I'm  
not saying everyone will get as far as I've gotten. But they can do 
something today they didn't do yesterday. Maybe they can go 
outside. Maybe they can wheel themselves around the block, and 
maybe tomorrow they can do two blocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley credits his positive attitude for everything he has  
accomplished, whether it was snow skiing, scuba diving, driving his 
specially equipped van or taking those few steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken a few more steps before, but I've never gone this  
far,'' he said. ``I want to walk off that Silverdome, and one day I 
will. It might not be tomorrow, but someday I will. I guarantee 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, who once told him he'd never walk again, now look on  
Utley as a great asset. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives their new patients hope,'' Utley said. ``If you take  
hope away, if you take dreams away, you lose them forever. But it 
goes back to the person. If you're a champion before you got hurt, 
you're a champion now. But you have to work at it. You have to have 
goals. I will never be number two, not today, not tomorrow, not 
ever. Why? Because I believe in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He talked of going to hospitals to visit children stricken by  
paralyzing injuries, seeing their family's in pain and solidifying 
his determination to find a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see moms and dads cry anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before he rose for that moment on his feet, he explained why he  
decided to take these steps publicly. He wanted to show doctors, 
insurance companies and the health industry in general that 
rehabilitation is a lifelong process, something a seriously injured 
person needs to do until he dies. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a more personal reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do it for my family and the people who have given me  
support from the first day when I came off that field and gave that 
thumbs up,'' he said, ``everyone in the Detroit organization, the 
friends I've made since I've been hurt. I will show them that I 
have never quit. I will never quit until I am completely free of 
this spinal cord injury.''

	``It was awesome to see him up there,'' Lewis said. ``Yesterday  
when we rehearsed, I was practically in tears. It's nothing short 
of miraculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he finished his news conference, just before he wheeled out  
of the room, he gave a ``thumbs up'' sign to a boy sitting on a 
man's shoulders in the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
	The gesture has become his trademark, just as Utley has come to  
symbolize grit, determination and optimism in the face of grim 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley, 33, is paralyzed from the chest and elbows down. His  
upper arms still are the bulging biceps of a football lineman. But 
he has only partial control of his hands and lower arms. About two 
years ago, he began to feel some sensations in his legs. He can 
feel his toes, describing it as the way you'd feel on an extremely 
cold day. 
</P>
<P>
	He began working with biofeedback, trying to identify the  
connection between his brain and those few alive nerves in his 
legs. He kept up daily, grueling physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rehabilitation is a lifestyle,'' he said. ``It's not something  
you just do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for his public display, and the pressure that  
came with it, on Monday was his desire to raise more money for his 
Mike Utley Foundation, dedicated research aimed at finding a cure 
for spinal cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley was quick to point out that no two spinal cord injuries  
are the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing you can control is your mind,'' he said. ``I'm  
not saying everyone will get as far as I've gotten. But they can do 
something today they didn't do yesterday. Maybe they can go 
outside. Maybe they can wheel themselves around the block, and 
maybe tomorrow they can do two blocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley credits his positive attitude for everything he has  
accomplished, whether it was snow skiing, scuba diving, driving his 
specially equipped van or taking those few steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken a few more steps before, but I've never gone this  
far,'' he said. ``I want to walk off that Silverdome, and one day I 
will. It might not be tomorrow, but someday I will. I guarantee 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, who once told him he'd never walk again, now look on  
Utley as a great asset. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives their new patients hope,'' Utley said. ``If you take  
hope away, if you take dreams away, you lose them forever. But it 
goes back to the person. If you're a champion before you got hurt, 
you're a champion now. But you have to work at it. You have to have 
goals. I will never be number two, not today, not tomorrow, not 
ever. Why? Because I believe in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He talked of going to hospitals to visit children stricken by  
paralyzing injuries, seeing their family's in pain and solidifying 
his determination to find a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see moms and dads cry anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before he rose for that moment on his feet, he explained why he  
decided to take these steps publicly. He wanted to show doctors, 
insurance companies and the health industry in general that 
rehabilitation is a lifelong process, something a seriously injured 
person needs to do until he dies. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a more personal reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do it for my family and the people who have given me  
support from the first day when I came off that field and gave that 
thumbs up,'' he said, ``everyone in the Detroit organization, the 
friends I've made since I've been hurt. I will show them that I 
have never quit. I will never quit until I am completely free of 
this spinal cord injury.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Gets $3.2M Award Vs. Wal-Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSKEGEE, Ala. (AP) -- A jury has ordered Wal-Mart to pay $3.2  
million to a woman who said she was wrongly accused of stealing a 
telephone and handcuffed in front of her children on Christmas Eve 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury in rural Macon County returned the verdict Friday in  
favor of LaShawna Goodman, who was arrested at the Wal-Mart in 
Opelika. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Goodman was awarded $3 million in punitive damages, which  
are meant to punish and deter wrongdoing, and $200,000 in 
compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Maher, a spokesman for Wal-Mart in Bentonville, Ark., said  
Tuesday: ``The facts of the case and the amount the jury awarded 
are on two separate planets. We will exhaust every legal remedy to 
right something which we believe is totally wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses testified that Miss Goodman entered the Wal-Mart with  
her two young children to exchange a phone she had bought a week 
earlier. She presented a receipt. Unable to find another phone she 
wanted, Miss Goodman said, she retrieved the initial purchase, 
bought some motor oil and left. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, she was detained and accused of stealing the phone,  
even after she offered the receipt as proof of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Goodman was later acquitted of shoplifting and sued  
Wal-Mart for malicious prosecution. Her lawyers contended Wal-Mart 
security personnel have a quota for making arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Maher said there is no such quota. He said there were questions  
over the authenticity of the receipt Miss Goodman presented.

<HEADLINE> Helms: Resist Russia Weapons Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States should not bow to Russia's  
insistence that agreement on conventional weapons in Europe be 
reached before NATO's enlargement this spring, Sen. Jesse Helms, 
R-N.C., said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told  
President Clinton in a letter that Moscow's demands ``are 
ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Urging Clinton to ``avoid a last-minute push,'' Helms suggested  
that the negotiations on levels of tanks and other conventional 
military equipment in Europe be suspended until after the NATO 50th 
anniversary summit in Washington in April. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Washington gathering, Poland, the Czech Republic and  
Hungary will be welcomed as full members of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The entry of the three former Warsaw Pact nations will increase  
membership to 19 and expand the Atlantic alliance eastward toward 
Russia, to the frontier of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's enlargement has strained U.S.-Russian relations.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides wanting an early agreement on conventional forces in  
Europe, Moscow has voiced sharp opposition to any additional NATO 
expansion after Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	Yevgeny Gusarov, the deputy foreign minister of Russia, told a  
military conference in Munich, Germany, last week that Moscow had 
drawn a ``red line'' on further eastward expansion of NATO into 
lands of the former Soviet Union, such as the Baltic states of 
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising Helms' concerns are changes being negotiated in the  
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also said that the United States should not agree to new  
language until Russia withdraws troops from ``illegally occupied 
territory in Moldavia and Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Undue haste in concluding a new CFE treaty will be a missed  
opportunity to use arms control to rectify the dramatic military 
imbalances used by Russia to bully and undermine its neighbors,'' 
Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that meeting Moscow's demands on timing could erode  
Senate support for the new conventional-weapons treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also reiterated his long-standing demand that Clinton send  
to the Senate for consideration modifications to the 1972 
Anti-Ballistics Missile Treaty -- changes Helms and other Senate 
conservatives insist are needed because the treaty was made with 
the old Soviet Union, not just with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends the treaty remains in force with  
Russia, and that Senate action is not needed.

<HEADLINE> Levi Sales Down 13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.'s sales fell 13 percent  
last year as teen-agers continued to shun its classic five-pocket 
jeans for trendier styles by rival designers. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based company said Tuesday that its sales were  
$6 billion for the fiscal year ended last November, compared with 
$6.9 billion in 1997. The company saw record sales in 1996 of $7.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which is privately held, doesn't release earnings  
reports, quarterly revenues or competitive data on specific 
business units or brands. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough two years for Levi's, which has struggled to  
compete with well-known labels from the Gap and Tommy Hilfiger, 
newcomers like MUDD, LEI and JNCO and lower-priced jeans from Sears 
and Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1997, Levi's said it would lay off 7,400 workers, more  
than a third of its North American work force, and close 11 of its 
27 U.S. plants, to compensate for lower demand in the overall jeans 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Levi's said it would temporarily halt all production  
of five-pocket jeans beginning Dec. 1, 1998. The company also 
launched an aggressive new advertising campaign with one main goal: 
persuading 15- to 24-year-olds that Levi's jeans are still cool. 
</P>
<P>
	In its sales report released Tuesday, the company said that  
``solid results'' for both Dockers, the leader in the khakis 
market, and Slates, the best-selling dress pants in department 
stores, could not overshadow ``soft sales'' of jeans. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the world's largest brand-name apparel manufacturer,  
making branded jeans, casual sportswear and dress pants under the 
Levi's, Dockers and Slates brands. It employs about 30,000 people 
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> N. Dakota Plans Mass Immunization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLISTON, N.D. (AP) -- State officials plan to vaccinate nearly  
5,000 people around this town in the northwestern part of the state 
after a 2-year-old boy died of a meningitis-related bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stephen McDonough, the medical officer for the state health  
department, said Tuesday that people in Williston ages 18 months to 
21 years should be immunized. About 13,000 people live in 
Williston. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy who died last week was confirmed to have a bacteria  
known as Type C meningococcus, McDonough said. It is among the 
bacteria types that causes meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
	A second case involving a Williston preschooler was confirmed  
late Monday. That child and a third child suspected of having the 
bacteria are responding well to treatment, McDonough said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time in the 15 years I've worked for the  
Health Department that we've had such a cluster,'' McDonough said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering  
the brain and spinal cord.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Eyes Winston Cup Threepeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Gordon has just one thing on his mind after  
winning 43 checkered flags -- No. 44. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old NASCAR star, fresh off his thrilling Daytona 500  
victory over Dale Earnhardt, is already gearing up for the next big 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on the top of the world at Daytona. It was such a great  
race and everybody is talking about it,'' Gordon said Tuesday 
during a stopover in Manhattan. ``It's cool to be a part of that. 
But on Monday morning, all that was behind us because now there's 
Rockingham and finding out how good a year we'll have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's off to a great start.  
</P>
<P>
	Gordon won the last two Winston Cup championships and three of  
the last four. A third straight title would put him in select 
company. Cale Yarborough won three in a row from 1976-78 and is the 
only driver to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, Gordon thinks about that bit of history.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win another,'' he said. ``If it's this year, great.  
If not, we'll work on next year. A threepeat would sure be cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gordon knows it's a grueling season, with the next stop in  
Rockingham, N.C., for the Goodwrench 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every race is competitive,'' said Gordon, whose 13 victories  
last year tied Richard Petty's single-season record. ``There's 
plenty left to accomplish. To keep at this level is not easy to do. 
That's what drives me. What I've got in Winston Cup is not easy to 
come by in other sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is NASCAR's version of the Denver Broncos with two straight  
Super Bowls, or Detroit Red Wings with two straight Stanley Cups. 
And he's looking at the Chicago Bulls with three straight NBA 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon sees nothing but boom times ahead for his sport.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see myself as an ambassador of the sport but one of  
many ambassadors,'' he said. ``I feel very good about what I am a 
part of. We put on great races with a great fan base and great 
sponsors. I want to see it continue to get bigger and bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Gordon at the wheel, there's little doubt it will.

<HEADLINE> What Will Talk Radio Talk About? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- The callers have phoned from cars, kitchens  
and doughnut shops, and their words condemn. Sleazy, slimy, 
immoral. Indefensible. Reprehensible. Liar, they spit into the 
airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	They've ranted about Bill. They've jabbered about Monica.  
They've talked and talked and talked about sex in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen months of sizzling presidential scandal have fueled  
talk radio with angry words and big ratings, and show hosts predict 
they'll be talking about it for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like manna from heaven for talk radio,'' said Jack  
Cashill, the conservative voice of KMBZ in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been Monica all day and every day for the most part,''  
said Mary O'Halloran, his liberal counterpart on ``Talk Back with 
Mary and Jack,'' where ratings are up. ``I think the interest will 
just increase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk show callers and hosts have joked about the Gap dress and  
snickered over the cigar. Some called President Clinton the target 
of a witch hunt, others called him a danger to women everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In the heart of the country, most of those callers are  
conservatives. They tend to consider talk radio their territory, 
said Ms. O'Halloran, whose show is followed by the king of the 
radio right, Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative gray-haired men who form the breakfast club at  
Anne's Daylight Donuts in Tulsa see no reason why talk radio 
shouldn't be their territory. 
</P>
<P>
	No pollsters ever called them. They never saw their disgust with  
Clinton's ``sin and spin'' aired on the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
	When the dozen-or-so regulars conduct Clinton polls over cups of  
black coffee and smoldering cigarettes, they have their own voice 
willing to air the results. It hits northeastern Oklahoma every 
morning at 50,000 watts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Erling in the morning!'' KRMG host John Erling belts into  
the pre-dawn darkness before promising more talk when ``William 
Jefferson Clinton does something stupid again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the kind of talk that appeals to Jim Addington. Without  
talk radio, ``Clinton would never have been impeached,'' the 
71-year-old notes to the nods of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	The callers have urged their leaders to do what's best for the  
country. Step down. Stay put. Convict. Censure. Just leave it all 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	But the listeners themselves can't leave it alone.  
</P>
<P>
	Ronn Owens at KGO radio in San Francisco tries other topics, but  
none have the same ``umpfh,'' even in a city brimming with Clinton 
supporters, he said. Callers like the Clinton scandal because it's 
juicy, shallow and requires nothing more than an opinion on 
character issues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true that despite everyone's professed boredom, when I  
don't get into it, people are chomping at the bit to talk about 
it.'' Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimates he has devoted about one-third of his shows to the  
story since it broke in 1998, raking in higher ratings in return. 
Owens predicts interest will fade soon, and he isn't sure what will 
captivate listeners next. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what we're going to be talking about, but I bet  
it won't be Kosovo,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kansas City, Ms. O'Halloran hears from callers who feel  
disconnected from Washington politics and are frustrated with 
Congress. She thinks the talk will stay strong as voters seek 
revenge at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	In Clinton's home state, talk show host Pat Lynch at KARN in  
Little Rock, Ark., said he plans to move on with discussions about 
Arkansas highways, kids and guns and more scrutiny of the state's 
governor. But he sees no end to the Clinton story. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will never happen,'' he said. ``We're going to be talking  
about Clinton as long as we live. He is the political Elvis.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Celebration Uses Fake Fireworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chinatown celebrated the lunar New Year on  
Tuesday with the flash and pop of fireworks for the first time in 
three years, but the display was a dud for many. 
</P>
<P>
	The fireworks were fake, with bright red confetti shooting out  
of exploding pods instead of brilliant pyrotechnics. Three years 
ago, City Hall banned fireworks and firecrackers at most events in 
the interest of safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first place, they don't particularly look like  
fireworks, and in the second place, there's not enough of them to 
sound like a real Chinese New Year,'' said 11-year-old Debbie 
Cheung. ``It sounds cheap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks are set off to mark the lunar New Year -- celebrated by  
Chinese, Koreans, Cambodians Tibetans and Vietnamese -- in a ritual 
to scare off evil spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the fake fireworks compromise was  
``designed to deal with the unfortunate effect of fireworks, in 
which people lose their eyesight, lose their hands and sometimes 
lose their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After suffering through the past three lunar New Years with no  
fireworks at all, Carl Lee, co-chairman of the Organization of 
Chinese Americans, which helps stage the annual event, remained 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully,'' he said, ``this is a step toward going back to  
the traditional way of doing things.''

<HEADLINE> Texas, Arkansas Execute Murderers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VARNER, Ark. (AP) -- A triple-murderer who claimed that he might  
be immune to the poisons used to kill death row inmates was 
executed by injection Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, a parolee convicted of killing three people in a  
murder-for-hire plot was executed in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arkansas, Johnie Michael Cox, 42, admitted killing his  
step-grandmother and two distant relatives on Nov. 1 -- All Saints 
Day -- 1989. He told police that Marie Sullens would go to heaven if 
she died that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox's spiritual adviser said Cox believed the execution ``may  
just be a show'' and that it was possible to survive poisons that 
shut down the heart and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had any final words, Cox replied, ``Yes. I'm  
anxious. Please release me and let me go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox was convicted of killing Mrs. Sullens, 68; Margaret Brown,  
34; and Billy Brown, 32. They were tied at the hands and feet with 
wire and tape and had been shot, stabbed and strangled before their 
home was set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Andrew Cantu was executed for the 1990 stabbing deaths  
of Gene Summers and his wife Helen, both 64, and Summers' mentally 
retarded brother, Billy Mack Summers, 60. All were attacked at home 
as they slept. 
</P>
<P>
	Cantu, 31, declined to make a final statement.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Buys 'Net Info Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. is filling another gap in  
its AltaVista Web gateway with a deal to buy Zip2 Corp., which will 
help AltaVista visitors find nearby restaurants, local events and 
other regional information. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms were not disclosed Tuesday. Rod Schrock,  
president and chief executive of AltaVista, said the cash deal was 
worth more than the $220 million Compaq paid last year for Internet 
retailer Shopping.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is Compaq's latest effort to try to flesh out  
AltaVista's services and products ahead of a public stock offering 
of the Web unit, expected sometime this year. Compaq is retaining a 
majority stake. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista already offers a widely used search engine and a  
variety of other options, including news, stock quotes and shopping 
services, and took in about $40 million in revenue last year. But 
it ranked No. 12 among Web sites last month, lagging Yahoo, Excite, 
Lycos and other top destinations, according to the Media Metrix 
research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq executives hope that Zip2, a privately held company based  
in Mountain View, Calif., will help AltaVista attract more visitors 
and keep them on the site longer. Using Zip2's technology, for 
example, a visitor to AltaVista's site could find a nearby 
restaurant by typing in the desired food and location. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology also will let Web users automatically receive  
``personalized'' information whenever they click onto the AltaVista 
Web site, tailored to their location and tastes. Looking ahead, 
AltaVista aims to let visitors users do even more, such as 
scheduling a haircut appointment at a local shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a great way to bond with a consumer,'' said Nick  
DiGiacomo of Scient Corp., an electronic-commerce consulting firm 
based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's announcement is ``very much an indication we intend to  
round out AltaVista into a leading destination on the Internet,'' 
Schrock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several major rivals already offer local Internet information,  
such as Microsoft Corp.'s Sidewalk.com service.

newest look combines both. Even if his moneyed clientele never set 
foot past the bunny slopes, they'll be stepping out for soirees in 
fanciful, embroidered ball skirts -- with snow parkas. 
</P>
<P>
	As the fall fashion openings continued, de la Renta showed  
colorful eveningwear that women could imagine in their wardrobes -- 
if home happens to include a Fifth Avenue drawing room. 
</P>
<P>
	Supermodel Naomi Campbell made the point with a fuchsia satin  
fur-trimmed parka, teamed with black embroidered evening pants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point of women dressing today is there are no  
(final) frontiers for what is for day or evening,'' de la Renta 
said after his show. ``Anoraks are versatile, great with a pair of 
jeans or an evening dress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the runways, Douglas Hannant, who never saw a garment  
that he couldn't wrap and drape, presented a fall collection 
Tuesday that advanced the architectural buff's notions of ease of 
dressing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to eliminate all the closures, so they're clothes  
that are held together by straps with magnetic insets that wrap 
around the body,'' Hannant said. ``And I like the sounds of the 
magnet clicking to close. It's such an effortless way of putting on 
a garment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Notable was a black leather side wrap jacket that fastened with  
magnetic strap. An etiquette problem at airport metal detectors? 
</P>
<P>
	Hannant's jackets come with asymmetrical hems, such as his  
``bi-length skirts'' in brown wool that spiral below, or above, the 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the fashion circuit, on Monday evening, hip music  
makers Salt-N-Pepa, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Lou Reed, Debbie 
Harry and actor Damon Wayans turned out for Betsey Johnson's modern 
take on tattered street people of the Victorian era. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hands of the funky downtown designer, the  
vintage-inspired gear was hardly a study in restraint. Models 
strutted in lace-up corsets, bloomers, puffed-sleeved velvet gowns 
with trains, some nonchalantly torn and ragged. The look was 
Charles Dickens revisited -- with an avocado green runway and neon 
green headlights at a Mercedes Benz service station, where Johnson 
held her show. Models looked back-to-the-future with their black 
All-Star Converse sneakers and lime metallic eye shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not la-di-da Victorian richies,'' says Johnson. ``The  
clothes look the way the girls downtown really wear these 
clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, those who wear clothes, anyway. But one bare-breasted fan  
in the front row, drag performer Amanda Lepore, caused a photo 
frenzy by opting for near-nakedness. Besides her nude-color thong 
underpants and red stilettos, her ``outfit'' was nothing but tiny 
chains, a gift from Johnson. Indeed, Lepore's lack of clothes may 
have done more to promote Johnson's clothes than anything on her 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday evening, designer b Michael (lower case, no  
period please) traveled not quite so far back in time, pausing at 
the '40s, '50s and '60s to revamp ladylike fashions. 
</P>
<P>
	Pencil-slim skirts -- so-called for good reason -- worn below the  
knee with chinchilla-trimmed jackets recalled the days when Glenn 
Miller was ``In the Mood'' and FDR chatted by the fireside. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving up to the mod '60s, Michael sent out ``Jetson jackets,''  
orange mohair A-line coats, and black slingbacks that transported 
the audience back to the heyday of Jackie Kennedy and Audrey 
Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Polite and proper, top-handle bags, leather gloves, crystal  
brooches and a charming portrait hat completed the trip down memory 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when it's not in, those eras are still my inspiration,''  
says b Michael. ``The whole idea of dressing this way is modern.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Firefighters Die in Texas Blaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Phillip Dean, a firefighter and Sunday  
school teacher, was looking forward to the birth of his first child 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Collins, who taught children about fire safety, was a  
father of two, with his wife due to deliver a third this summer. 
Gary Sanders learned everything he could about firefighting, and at 
age 19 already had two years of experience under his belt. 
</P>
<P>
	All three died Monday in a three-alarm blaze at a Lake Worth  
church that investigators believe was caused by arson. In the smoky 
haze of the smoldering remains, moist-eyed firefighters struggled 
to balance their sense of duty with an agonizing feeling of loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that is going to obviously take a toll on many  
departments, not just ours,'' said Lt. Kent Worley of the Fort 
Worth Fire Department. ``The brotherhood and sisterhood is such 
that we all lost a family member, irregardless of which department 
they are from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the men -- Collins, 35, and Dean, 29 -- were Fort Worth  
firefighters who were volunteering for the nearby River Oaks 
department on their day off. Collins was a 14-year veteran, and 
Dean a 6-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, the youngest of the three, worked for the Sansom Park  
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	They died when the roof of the nondenominational Precious Faith  
Church, located about 35 miles west of Dallas, collapsed on top of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other firefighters were hospitalized with minor injuries.  
Three of them were trying to extinguish flames on the roof when it 
caved underneath them. 
</P>
<P>
	Family and friends of the victims gathered in a parking lot  
across the street from the church to hug, cry and console each 
other. Church members also grieved the loss of their church, which 
they built themselves 38 years ago in a neighborhood of small, 
modest homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor J.C. Terry said he worried at first about the church. But  
his thoughts quickly turned to the men who gave their lives trying 
to save it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can rebuild a building,'' Terry said, choking back tears.  
``We can't bring back a life.''

<HEADLINE> Ilgauskas Sidelined With Sore Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cavaliers center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, who twice  
broke his right foot, missed Tuesday's night game against the 
Orlando Magic with a sore left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas recently signed a six-year, $70 million deal and will  
undergo further testing on his foot at the Cleveland Clinic on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just keep our fingers crossed,'' Cleveland coach Mike  
Fratello said. ``If we knew what the injury was, we could discuss 
it further. Obviously, we are concerned, given the problems he had 
with the other foot. We just have to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-3 Ilgauskas, who averaged 13.9 points and 8.8  
rebounds per game last season, missed his entire rookie season in 
1996 with a broken bone in his right foot. It was the same injury 
which caused him to sit out 1995-96 while playing in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitaly Potapenko started for Ilgauskas and scored eight points  
in the first period as the Cavs took a 29-14 lead.

<HEADLINE> Japan Steelmaker Denies Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fresh allegations by U.S. steelmakers that Japan is  
dumping exports in the American market are ``hard to understand'' 
and smack of protectionism, Japan's top steelmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Major U.S. steelmakers and the United Steelworkers Union filed  
import complaints Tuesday accusing Japan and seven other countries 
of selling steel in the U.S. market at below production costs and 
home market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon Steel Corp., Japan's and the world's largest integrated  
steelmaker, denied the dumping allegation, saying it was ``hard to 
understand what is behind the filing of the complaints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry's approach, by calling for protectionist  
measures to solve its own management problems, is ``too 
simplistic,'' Nippon Steel said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon Steel often acts in behalf of Japan's steel industry when  
a trade row emerges over Japanese steel exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese exports of steel to the United States have become a  
major trade issue between the two countries, with American 
steelmakers accusing several foreign companies of harming their 
industry with cheap imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government announced last week that it had evidence  
that Japan and Brazil had illegally dumped hot-rolled steel. The 
fresh complaints on Tuesday concerned a different type of steel, 
cut-to-length plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's exports of steel-plate products to the United States  
skyrocketed more than 5,800 percent to 278,180 tons in the first 11 
months of last year, according to the Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Federation officials said, however, that Japan's sharp exports  
during the period came largely at the request of the U.S. 
steelmakers themselves and steel users to meet a domestic supply 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese steel industry wants the U.S. government to conduct  
a ``fair investigation based on the law,'' Nippon Steel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry also  
announced it will closely watch the investigation, national 
broadcast NHK reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission has 45 days and the  
Commerce Department 160 days to make a preliminary determination of 
injury that could lead to new tariffs on steel exports from those 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The other nations mentioned in the case include Czech Republic,  
France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Macedonia and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Unions Sue Tobacco Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Health-care insurers for Ohio's labor unions  
are suing the tobacco industry for almost $2 billion to cover the 
costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit claims tobacco companies targeted  
blue-collar workers and their children through advertising and 
promotional gimmicks that encouraged them to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found documents that indicate that the tobacco industry was  
aware that people with lower incomes and less education, and who go 
to work right after high school, are more susceptible to the 
advertising -- the Marlboro man image, Joe Camel, etc. -- and this is 
the most vulnerable group to purchase their tobacco products,'' 
said Mike Withey, an attorney from Seattle representing the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was brought by an Ohio group representing more than 100  
labor union trust funds, which hold the money union members and 
their employers set aside for health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry also discovered the health hazards of  
cigarette smoking through its research and kept that information 
from the public, according to the lawsuit, which goes to trial 
Monday in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry attorneys maintain there are no legal grounds  
for the lawsuit. Tobacco companies, like any other business, have a 
legal right to advertise, said Robert Weber, an attorney who 
represents R.J. Reynolds Co., which makes such cigarettes as Camel, 
Vantage, Winston and Salem and is one of the companies named in the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're trying to say is that somehow Ohio working men  
and women don't somehow understand advertising and are more 
susceptible than other people in society -- and that's just 
hogwash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is one of more than 30 similar ones across the  
nation. Judges have thrown out such lawsuits in Florida and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit comes on the heels of a recent $206 billion  
settlement of tobacco suits in 46 states, including more than $9 
billion for Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs dismissed The Liggett Group, which makes  
Chesterfield, Lark, L&AMP;M and Eve cigarettes and is based in Durham, 
N.C., from the lawsuit in exchange for its cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants in the lawsuit are Philip Morris Inc., Lorillard  
Tobacco Co., RJR Nabisco Inc. and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., all 
based in New York; Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. of Louisville, 
Ky.; British American Tobacco of Middlesex, England; and United 
States Tobacco Sales and Marketing Co. of Greenwich, Conn.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Tanker Wreckage May Be Towed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- The broken bow of a grounded freighter  
appears headed for a deep and watery grave as authorities try to 
prevent it from leaking more fuel along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest plan calls for a tug to pull the 440-foot front  
section of the New Carissa off the beach as early as Wednesday and 
haul it about 200 miles offshore, where it will be sunk. The 
journey was expected to take at least five days. 
</P>
<P>
	The target area is waters that are about 9,000 feet deep.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know this is the most environmentally sound way to do this  
job,'' said Bill Milwee, a representative of the Japanese company 
that owns the 639-foot cargo ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Carissa ran aground Feb. 4 north of the entrance to Coos  
Bay and broke into two pieces last week after a Navy explosives 
team set it afire to burn off most of the nearly 400,000 gallons of 
fuel aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials haven't decided yet how to dispose of the other  
section of the broken ship, the 200-foot stern with the ship's 
engine, control bridge and living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, workers continued efforts to save oil-soaked birds.  
Teams have found 42 dead birds, 20 with obvious signs of oil. One 
of the dead birds was a marbled murrelet, a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Benjamin Morgado, the captain of the freighter, was  
subpoenaed to appear at an official U.S. Coast Guard inquiry this 
week to determine the cause of the grounding. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is ``correct these things so this doesn't happen  
again,'' said Capt. Mike Hall, the Coast Guard officer in charge of 
the multi-agency response team in Coos Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	An official report outlining why the ship ran aground will  
eventually help determine who is liable for the cleanup costs.

<HEADLINE> Gramm Makes Bank Overhaul Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new chairman of the Senate Banking  
Committee has unveiled draft legislation for lifting the 
Depression-era barriers between banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies that is more in line with the Federal Reserve 
than the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Sen. Phil Gramm -- a Texas Republican who took  
the helm of the Banking Committee after former chairman Sen. 
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., lost his re-election bid in November -- 
calls for most new financial activities to be conducted by 
affiliated companies within bank holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft proposal ``is the result of consultation'' with  
members of the banking panel, key government officials and 
lobbyists for the financial services industries, Gramm said in a 
brief statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	All financial overhaul proposals before Congress would create  
huge financial ``supermarkets,'' offering consumers checking 
accounts, mutual funds, insurance policies and much more. Ralph 
Nader and other consumer advocates have expressed concern that the 
changes could bring a dangerous concentration of economic power in 
fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm has said he wants to make enactment of financial overhaul  
legislation his highest priority, even though he blocked such a 
measure last October because of his opposition to federal 
community-lending laws that banks must follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the Clinton administration and the banking,  
securities and insurance industries said they were still studying 
Gramm's proposal and had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In three days of hearings last week before the House Banking  
Committee, battle lines over financial overhaul legislation were 
drawn clearly and early as Congress began this year's debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed chairman Alan Greenspan extended his public disagreement  
with the administration over the best approach to take. He endorsed 
a bill proposed by Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, 
R-Iowa, that would give the Federal Reserve more power over new 
financial activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, meanwhile, supported a new,  
competing version of the financial overhaul legislation, which 
would lift the barriers between financial industries but split 
regulatory authority between the Treasury Department and the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's new draft is closer to Greenspan's view.  
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury and the central bank have long been at odds over  
the issue, while agreeing that legislation is needed to keep the 
U.S. financial industry competitive in a fast-changing world. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to let banks diversify through  
subsidiaries of the bank itself, not just through affiliates within 
the same parent holding company. That arrangement would increase 
the power of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, regulator of nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the battle, bills letting banks into other  
kinds of financial activities through a holding company structure 
would expand the independent Fed's role in regulating financial 
services industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent nod to administration concerns that such an  
arrangement would discriminate against smaller banks, Gramm's 
proposal also would allow nationally chartered banks with $1 
billion or less in assets -- the bulk of national banks -- to get 
into the new activities through subsidiaries under certain 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 2,546 banks operating under national charters as of last  
spring, 2,359 had assets of $1 billion or less, according to the 
comptroller's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's proposal also would require the federal banking agencies  
to jointly issue consumer protection rules governing retail sales 
of insurance by banks.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria OKs Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Nigeria's former finance minister was  
chosen today to represent two of Nigeria's three political parties, 
setting him against a retired general in upcoming presidential 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the All Peoples Party and the Alliance for  
Democracy agreed on a joint candidacy naming Olu Falae as their 
presidential nominee, following weeks of political and legal 
wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
	The former government official will face retired Gen. Olusegun  
Obasanjo -- the candidate of Nigeria's leading party, the Peoples 
Democratic Party -- in the Feb. 27 presidential vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the backing of two parties, the 60-year-old Falae still  
has a difficult campaign to overcome the political power and 
financial backing of Obasanjo and his party. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement matches two parties that have held opposing  
positions in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alliance for Democracy is largely composed of Yorubas from  
Nigeria's southwest and is lead by a number of prominent opponents 
of the country's late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha. The All Peoples 
Party, meanwhile, includes many politicians who built their careers 
through loyalty to Abacha. 
</P>
<P>
	But the presidential parties and candidates have shown little in  
the way of ideology so far, with candidates mostly offering vague 
promises of a better Nigeria as they maneuver for greater ethnic 
and regional support. 
</P>
<P>
	Falae, a Yoruba who had earlier been named the candidate of the  
Alliance for Democracy, is seen as a temperate politician who could 
gain support outside of the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo is also a Yoruba, but in a country split along  
regional, ethnic and religious lines, he is also an anomaly. While 
he is a Baptist, he draws most of his support from the 
predominantly Muslim north, where the military is popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo is well-known for being the only Nigerian ruler to ever  
give up power voluntarily. He was jailed from 1995 until June last 
year by Abacha for alleged involvement in a coup plot. 
</P>
<P>
	But his military past is exactly why he is widely distrusted in  
his home region in the south, where opposition to successive 
military governments has been strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Battered by corruption and poverty after years of military rule,  
Nigeria -- the world's sixth largest oil producer -- has been moving 
toward civilian democracy since Abacha's death in June. 
</P>
<P>
	His successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, has vowed repeatedly  
to hand power over to civilians in May. Nigeria has been ruled by 
the military for all but 10 years since independence from Britain 
in 1960.

<HEADLINE> Campbell Earnings Fall 24.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Campbell Soup Co.'s earnings for the latest  
quarter fell 24.6 percent from a year ago, matching Wall Street 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The food company announced last month that cost-cutting changes  
in its supply chain system -- streamlining purchasing decisions, 
using storage more efficiently and cutting shipping costs -- would 
result in lower second quarter and full year earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings for the second quarter were $219 million, or 49  
cents a share, for the second fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, down 
from $300 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched the 49 cents a share average expected by  
analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. In trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange, Campbell closed up 43 3/4 cents a share at $40.68 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings from continuing operations decreased to $219 million  
from $291 in the comparable quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $1.83 billion, down 9 percent from  
the 1998 figure of $2.01 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the company's soups and sauces division were down 8  
percent to $1.28 billion, due to lower soup shipments resulting 
from the cost-saving measures. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, Campbell earned $483 million, or $1.07  
a share, down from $567 million, or $1.23 a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the first half fell to $3.64 billion from $3.83  
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell is the world's largest maker and marketer of soup. It  
also makes the Pepperidge Farm line of cookies and crackers, Prego 
sauces and Godiva-brand chocolates.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Interest Rates Rise / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Tuesday's auction to the highest level in seven 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.51 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.440 percent, up from 4.420 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.470 percent, up from 4.420 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates were the highest since Dec. 28, when three-month bills  
sold for 4.520 percent and the six-month rate was 4.525 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.551 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,887.80 and 4.637 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,774.00. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.67 
percent last week from 4.61 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Olympic Official Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Christian Rodriguez, the secretary  
general of Chile's Olympic committee, has submitted his resignation 
but claims he played no part it the Salt Lake City Olympic bribery 
scandal, published reports said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez denied accusations he served as a go-between in  
gaining favors for Sergio Santander, the expelled Chilean IOC 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always carried out my duties with integrity,''  
Rodriguez said in a report published Tuesday. Reports said 
Rodriguez submitted his resignation by fax to the Chilean Olympic 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the ethics panel of the Salt Lake City 2002  
organizing committee, Rodriguez accompanied Santander on a site 
visit to Salt Lake in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report said Rodriguez, at Santander's request, asked  
Tom Welch -- head of Salt Lake City bid committee -- for 
contributions to Santander's political campaign. Rodriguez was 
managing the campaign. The ethics report said Welch contributed 
$20,050. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander is one of nine members of the International Olympic  
Committee who has been ousted or resigned from the IOC in the wake 
of the scandal.

<HEADLINE> Expert:Marine Jet Radar Didn't Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The radar altimeter from a Marine jet  
that struck an Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 people, 
malfunctioned in tests after the accident, an expert testified 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The altimeter, which uses a radar signal bounced between the  
plane and the ground to indicate its altitude, stuck at a reading 
of 650 feet when it should have read 500 feet in a test, said 
Robert Fitzgerald, an instrument expert from the Naval Aviation 
Depot in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	When the setting was changed to zero, the altimeter still showed  
650 feet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The needle's circuitry was not working,'' Fitzgerald said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Capt. Richard Ashby, the pilot of the EA-6B Prowler,  
contend his radar altimeter was malfunctioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged with 20 counts  
of involuntary manslaughter and could be sentenced to life in 
prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ashby flew too low and too fast and broke  
flight rules. The gondola cable was between 360 and 370 feet from 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination by defense attorney Maj. William Webber,  
Fitzgerald said Ashby filed a complaint that the jet's altimeter 
was sticking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gripe that Capt. Ashby made described circumstances very  
similar to what we saw in the test,'' Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Fitzgerald said.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, John Seereiter, a Defense Department  
employee, offered testimony about tests on an instrument called a 
transponder, which signals to the air control tower the plane's 
identification, speed and altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by a prosecutor, Seereiter said the  
transponder was more than likely working properly during the flight 
but did not respond well to tests.

<HEADLINE> Three Jewish Charities To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philanthropist Charles R. Bronfman was named on  
Tuesday to head an organization to be formed from the merger of 
three Jewish charities later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will combine the United Jewish Appeal, the Council of  
Jewish Federations and United Israel Appeal. The new organization 
is as yet unnamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronfman, co-chairman of Seagram Co., said the merger will  
change the face of Jewish philanthropy, which in the past focused 
on recovery from the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenges we face are quite different from 50 years ago.  
Then, anti-Semitism and an urgent need to rescue our people from 
physical danger defined our mission. Now, we enjoy unprecedented 
freedom,'' Bronfman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronfman said the new organization will focus on such tasks as  
feeding Jews in poverty-stricken areas and helping settle new 
immigrants in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronfman has been named one of the 100 richest men in America by  
Forbes magazine. He is known for making large donations to Jewish 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he and fellow philanthropist Michael Steinhardt  
launched Birthright Israel, a $300 million program to provide 
education and travel to Israel for every Jewish youth between 15 
and 26.

<HEADLINE> Young Snowboarders New Ski Hazard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRECKENRIDGE, Colo. (AP) -- At 64, Don Rooks has just about had  
it with the young, reckless skiers and snowboarders he shares the 
slopes with. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people just don't give a damn,'' the Colorado Springs  
resident complained. ``It's no fun when you have to watch your 
backside. They need to kick these people off the mountain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't tell that to Steve Stasiuk, a 27-year-old snowboarder from  
Aspen who believes the mountain is there to be conquered. 
</P>
<P>
	``You only live once. It's an adrenalin-based sport,'' he said.  
``It would totally annoy me if they want to hold us back. And it 
will hinder the progress of the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figures on ski deaths have been declining, and do not support  
the perception that skiing is becoming more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	But catastrophic injuries have been far above average for the  
past two seasons, with 45 in 1996-97 and 42 in 1997-98. The average 
for the previous 12 seasons was only 28. 
</P>
<P>
	There also has been a spate of deaths at resorts in New England  
and Colorado, some of them the result of collisions attributed to 
reckless skiing. On Monday, a snowboarder was killed when he was 
hit by a 15-year-old skier who went airborne during a steep descent 
in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ski areas find themselves caught in the middle, with America's  
retired population more active than ever and young skiers and 
snowboarders anxious to show their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that clearly road rage exists on the slopes,'' said  
John Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country USA, a trade group. 
Frew said ski resorts all over the country are seeing a decline in 
courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail Resorts, operator of Vail and Breckenridge, the nation's  
two busiest ski resorts, has been inundated with safety complaints 
by longtime skiers. After six deaths this year at its four resorts, 
Vail introduced a special safety and courtesy patrol over the 
holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Some blame the problems on better ski equipment that has  
increased speeds and shortened the learning curve, dumping new 
skiers on the slopes faster than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
	High-speed ski lifts also put more people on the hill at once  
and allow people to make more runs, perhaps pushing their 
endurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``At 30 I feel like a grandfather, watching these kids do things  
I wouldn't even consider,'' said Klaus Obermeyer Jr., credited with 
introducing snowboarding to the Aspen area. 
</P>
<P>
	Obermeyer said if the kids mimic some of the death-defying  
stunts on commercials, ``they will be dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Fortner, head of mountain security at Camelback in  
Pennsylvania's Poconos, said Vail is on the right track. His 
mountain has had a mostly volunteer force of speed controllers, led 
by a former state trooper, since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it has cut our collision rate,'' said Fortner, whose  
mountain draws up to 8,500 skiers on peak days.

<HEADLINE> Delta Acquires Southeast Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines announced Tuesday it will acquire  
Atlantic Southeast Airlines, a regional carrier already linked to 
Delta routes, and run it as a subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said the $700 million acquisition will increase efficiency  
and help growth plans for Delta and the regional carrier, which 
flies Delta customers under a code-sharing agreement in the 
southeastern United States and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful of the recent pilots conflict that grew out of American  
Airlines' acquisition of a smaller carrier, Delta emphasized that 
ASA will retain a separate workforce and salary and benefits 
structure. There will be no integration of workforces or seniority 
lists, it said, and ASA's agreements with the Air Line Pilots 
Association and the Association of Flight Attendants will remain in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Deane, a captain and a spokesman for Delta's pilots union  
said there ``don't appear to be any contractual problems'' with the 
regional carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Disagreement over American's integration of Reno Air and the pay  
of its pilots led to the American pilots' sickout that resulted in 
thousands of canceled flights over the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said Tuesday's deal with ASA is for growth, not  
cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we build on ASA's strengths, we not only will improve  
Delta's overall route network, but we also will be in position to 
increase traffic flows to our other connection partners,'' said Leo 
F. Mullin, Delta's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Southeast is Atlanta's largest regional air carrier  
with service to 37 markets. It also offers service to 21 airports 
from its second hub at Dallas/Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	ASA, founded in 1979, has operated as a Delta Connection carrier  
since 1984. It has a fleet of 88 aircraft with 2,673 employees 
based in 40 cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, a Delta subsidiary will make a  
tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of 
ASA Holdings for $34 per share in cash. ASA Holdings has 28.5 
million shares of common stock outstanding. Delta already owns 
7,995,000 of those shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to regulatory review.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Rodman Still Unsigned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Maybe Dennis Rodman is waiting for a  
nationally televised game to make his return, to maximize his 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, the eccentric seven-time NBA rebounding  
champion remained a man without a team Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no update on Dennis Rodman, we have nothing to  
report,'' Los Angeles Lakers spokesman John Black said wearily 
following a shootaround several hours before the Lakers faced the 
Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	While they waited for the 37-year-old forward, the Lakers  
learned that Robert Horry, hospitalized Sunday due to an irregular 
heartbeat, will remain on the sidelines for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry was told to sit out the game against the Hornets and  
Wednesday night's contest against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be re-evaluated Thursday,'' he said. ``They say I  
have nothing to worry about. The muscles are fine, the blood flow 
is fine, I've just got an extra beat in my heart, probably caused 
by a virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, (doctors) just want me to take it easy.''  
</P>
<P>
	The forward could return as early as Friday night, when the  
Lakers play the first of two consecutive nationally televised games 
-- at home against San Antonio (Turner Network). On Sunday 
afternoon, they play at Seattle (NBC). 
</P>
<P>
	One of those also could be Worm time.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman reportedly decided last week he wanted to play for the  
Lakers, and a source close to the team told The Associated Press 
late Sunday he was expected to be signed by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	No such development.  
</P>
<P>
	Then again, Rodman has always proven to be anything but  
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
	While responding to questions about a civil case involving  
Rodman on Tuesday, attorney Richard Howell was asked if he was 
Rodman's civil lawyer or his sole lawyer, and whether his client 
would join the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm his lawyer lawyer, I know everything,'' Howell replied.  
``And I'm not saying a thing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left for representatives of International Creative  
Management, Rodman's new agents, weren't immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever he decides to come, if he decides to come, is fine,''  
Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal said. ``If he decides not to come, 
it's fine. He's always been that type of a guy, to keep people 
guessing, the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a different type of marketing -- negativity, positivity  
marketing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was in Las Vegas on Monday, registered under his own name  
at a prominent hotel, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if that annoyed him, that Rodman was in Las Vegas  
rather than with the Lakers, O'Neal replied, ``The only thing that 
annoys me now is we're 3-3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kobe Bryant said the matter wasn't a distraction to him.  
</P>
<P>
	``We come to practice and answer questions about it,'' he said.  
``Whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, laughing, Bryant said, ``He's hiding behind that bleacher  
over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Horry: ``Usually something like this would bother players,  
but this hasn't bothered us. This way, people are talking about 
Rodman, not about our record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horry, 28, was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center  
shortly before Sunday's 101-99 loss to the Indiana Pacers due to 
chest pains he said he first felt Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like somebody hit me in the chest,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat, but discharged  
Monday after tests came back within the range of normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry wore a monitor until Tuesday morning, but after those  
results were checked, he was told more monitoring was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling a lot better,'' he said. ``I don't have as much  
pain in my chest as I had Saturday or Sunday. I want to play. I 
kind of hated lying in the hospital bed watching us playing 
Indiana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horry said he has never had chest pains before, and there was no  
family history of heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could feel the extra beats, I can feel them now,'' he said.  
``It's still not regular. If I'm moving around, I have a couple 
extra beats. If I'm resting, I don't feel them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about it. I didn't feel any pain in my left  
shoulder, I didn't feel any dizziness, I didn't feel tired.''

<HEADLINE> Irwin, Pak Having Tough Seasons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They share virtually nothing in common except where they were  
last year and what they have done lately. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale Irwin put together one of the most astounding seasons in  
golf last year on the Senior Tour, dominance measured by more than 
just seven victories and $2.8 million in earnings. In 22 events, he 
finished out of the top five just two times. 
</P>
<P>
	Se Ri Pak is coming off the most sensational rookie season since  
Nancy Lopez 20 years earlier -- two major championships, two LPGA 
scoring records (including a 61) and two other victories during her 
rapid rise to fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Now for the encore.  
</P>
<P>
	Irwin has played two tournaments and still hasn't won, still  
hasn't finished in the top five, still hasn't threatened anyone on 
Sunday. His final-round 73 in the American Express Invitational 
marked the first time in his senior career he failed to make a 
birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	At least he has shot in the 60s, something Pak still hasn't  
managed this year in 13 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In many respects, Irwin and Pak face the same problem. Both are  
trying to put last year behind them without having had enough time 
to recharge the batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning is the real tonic. It's the real balm for the blues,''  
said Irwin, who is having more success waxing poetic than waxing 
the field like he used to on the Senior Tour. ``Once you get it in 
your system, it's hard to flush that out. You just want more of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just that right now, I need to catch my breath and  
restart,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin played until Christmas, but the time away from golf caused  
him to pay more attention to problems that surfaced with building a 
house in Phoenix. And the break from golf lasted only four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That break was either too short or too long,'' he said. ``I  
didn't have the opportunity to create the momentum, let it go and 
then recreate it. And it was too long a period in which to try to 
keep it. I think I've found myself sort of crashing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a high-speed crash, at that. Irwin won nine times in  
1997, tying the Senior Tour record set in 1985 by Peter Thomson. 
Last year was even more of a whirlwind, a weekly showdown with Gil 
Morgan. Both had six victories until Irwin captured the 
season-ended Tour Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	So where does he go from there? More victories? More money?  
</P>
<P>
	``That has been the challenge thus far this year, to get my  
interest level back up where it should be, get my energy level up 
where it needs to be to be competitive,'' Irwin said. ``There's 
just a lot of things swirling around in this chamber right now. Get 
those straightened out and I'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pak's season officially ended in November, but that's when  
things really heated up. She had a bizarre breakup with swing coach 
David Leadbetter and was put on the open market by Samsung, who 
farmed out management of the 21-year-old star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, big season. 1999 is new season,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The good news for Pak is that the new season is starting out the  
same way. She didn't even record a top 10 last year until winning 
the LPGA Championship, and she did all of her damage in 11 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she has no coach and doesn't plan to find one right away.  
And her putting has been suspect the first month of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``No reason,'' she said. ``Sometimes it doesn't work. That is  
golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What might help both shake their doldrums is competition. Kelly  
Robbins and Karrie Webb have shown they are serious about getting 
back to the top, and Annika Sorenstam is always a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Fleischer caught Irwin's attention by becoming the first  
senior player to win his first two tournaments. The real challenge 
is in September, when Tom Watson turns 50. Tom Kite and Lanny 
Wadkins are eligible three months later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hale Irwin better get all the money he can,'' said Chi Chi  
Rodriguez. ``Because when Tom Watson and Tom Kite get here, it's 
going to be a different story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of talk only gets Irwin's juices flowing.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are those who probably think that this is all going to  
come to a crashing end once Tom Watson gets on the Senior Tour and 
we all ought to roll over,'' Irwin said. ``I think hardly the case. 
I look forward to them coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question is what kind of game he'll have when they get  
there.

<HEADLINE> Kurd Rebel Leader Brought to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan's  
international quest for asylum ended today after Turkey's prime 
minister announced that Ocalan had been brought here to face 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had promised that the state would catch him, we have kept  
our promise,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said. ``He will pay the 
price of his accounts to the independent Turkish courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's capture is a victory for Turkey, which wants to  
prosecute him for waging a 14-year guerilla war for autonomy that 
claimed tens of thousands of lives. He faces the death penalty if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of soldiers who died in the war poured into cemeteries  
after learning of Ocalan's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have waited for this day all along,'' the Anatolia agency  
quoted Emine Eris as saying. ``We won't cry today, it is our day of 
celebration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit did not say when Turkey would put Ocalan (pronounced  
OH'-jah-lan) on trial. Ocalan was once tried in absentia, but a 
verdict was never issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan, 49, who dropped from sight after leaving Rome in  
January, was brought to Turkey today after surfacing in Kenya, 
Ecevit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit said his capture was the result of a 12-day covert  
operation, but gave no details. He did not say where Ocalan was 
being held. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's arrest sparked Kurdish demonstrations across Europe,  
with protesters storming Greek diplomatic compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said Ocalan went to  
Kenya on Feb. 2 and was given refuge in the Greek Embassy in 
Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Pangalos said Ocalan left against the advice of his hosts,  
heading for the Nairobi airport on Monday to fly to the 
Netherlands. Greek authorities said they lost track of him after he 
left their compound. 
</P>
<P>
	But another account was offered by Ocalan's attorneys and a  
Kenyan guard at the Greek ambassador's residence. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said men in  
Kenyan government vehicles entered the compound and forcibly 
removed three men Monday evening. An attorney for Ocalan said the 
men who seized Ocalan were Kenyan police. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing eyewitnesses, attorney Britta Boehler said Ocalan, ``did  
not leave voluntarily. He was physically dragged out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boehler, who is in the Netherlands, said four or five of  
Ocalan's associates were being held in the Greek Embassy in Nairobi 
by Greek officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard said the men who were seized had been in the Greek  
compound for about two weeks, but was unsure whether any of them 
was Ocalan. He said the men were forced into a vehicle, which sped 
off in a convoy that included the Greek ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Kenya asked Greece to recall its ambassador, accusing him  
of sneaking Ocalan into the country under a false name. Kenyan 
Foreign Minister Godana Bonaya denied any Kenyan role in the rebel 
leader's seizure Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Giulano Pisapia, another Ocalan attorney in Rome, said he  
visited Ocalan in Nairobi on Sunday. ``Ocalan told me that his life 
was in grave danger,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pisapia said he feared for his client's safety in Turkish hands.  
</P>
<P>
	Pangalos hinted at possible American complicity in Ocalan's  
capture. The United States regards Ocalan as a terrorist and had 
pressed Italy to extradite him to Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the  
United States had ``no direct involvement in Ocalan's handover to 
Turkey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``We're obviously very pleased with the  
apprehension of this terrorist leader. We condemn the violence that 
has gone on in Europe and call on those responsible to release any 
of the people that are being held.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has maintained an uncompromising stance toward Kurds  
since 1984 when Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, launched a 
guerrilla war for autonomy on behalf of Turkey's 12 million Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has refused to negotiate with the Kurdish  
guerrilla, which it calls a terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone must understand that no one can challenge our state  
and no one can get anywhere in Turkey with separatist terrorism,'' 
Ecevit said, his voice trembling with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's group has recruited around 10,000 guerrillas over the  
years, mostly from the remote poverty-stricken southeastern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	``While you were fighting in the mountains, Ocalan was living in  
luxury,'' Ecevit said. ``Say ``Enough!' to Ocalan and come and 
reunite with your mothers, fathers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan fled Turkey in 1979. His latest odyssey began last fall  
after Syria, under threat of attack from Turkey, expelled him from 
his longtime base. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief stay in Russia, Ocalan went to Italy in November  
and asked for political asylum. Italy refused to extradite him to 
Turkey because he faced the death penalty, but was unwilling to 
grant him asylum and asked him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	In January he left Italy; his whereabouts have been a mystery  
since. He was denied refuge in a number of European countries 
before going to Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 2, he tried to fly to the Netherlands but was turned  
away and headed for Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> Delta Acquires Southeast Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines announced Tuesday it will acquire  
Atlantic Southeast Airlines, a regional carrier already linked to 
Delta routes, and run it as a subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said the $700 million acquisition will increase efficiency  
and help growth plans for Delta and the regional carrier, which 
flies Delta customers under a code-sharing agreement in the 
southeastern United States and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful of the recent pilots conflict that grew out of American  
Airlines' acquisition of a smaller carrier, Delta emphasized that 
ASA will retain a separate workforce and salary and benefits 
structure. There will be no integration of workforces or seniority 
lists, it said, and ASA's agreements with the Air Line Pilots 
Association and the Association of Flight Attendants will remain in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Deane, a captain and a spokesman for Delta's pilots union  
said there ``don't appear to be any contractual problems'' with the 
regional carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Disagreement over American's integration of Reno Air and the pay  
of its pilots led to the American pilots' sickout that resulted in 
thousands of canceled flights over the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said Tuesday's deal with ASA is for growth, not  
cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we build on ASA's strengths, we not only will improve  
Delta's overall route network, but we also will be in position to 
increase traffic flows to our other connection partners,'' said Leo 
F. Mullin, Delta's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Southeast is Atlanta's largest regional air carrier  
with service to 37 markets. It also offers service to 21 airports 
from its second hub at Dallas/Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	ASA, founded in 1979, has operated as a Delta Connection carrier  
since 1984. It has a fleet of 88 aircraft with 2,673 employees 
based in 40 cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, a Delta subsidiary will make a  
tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of 
ASA Holdings for $34 per share in cash. ASA Holdings has 28.5 
million shares of common stock outstanding. Delta already owns 
7,995,000 of those shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to regulatory review.

<HEADLINE> 3 Losses Leave Bearcats at a Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Three straight road losses have left  
Cincinnati at a loss to explain what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	When they won their first 15 games, the Bearcats became an  
unexpected choice to contend for the national title. Things were so 
good that volatile coach Bob Huggins was actually acting mellow. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last 10 days, everything has changed. The Bearcats have  
lost their cool, their intensity and their lofty ranking, falling 
to No. 9 in the poll released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	By losing three consecutive games for only the fourth time  
during Huggins' 10 seasons at Cincinnati, the Bearcats (21-4) have 
fallen out of first place in their Conference USA and lost their 
hold on a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason, we've lost our focus,'' point guard Michael  
Horton said before practice Monday. ``I don't know what it is. This 
needs to stop somewhere. We need to get a little confidence back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were full of confidence during the 15-0 start that included  
wins over Duke -- they remain the only team to beat the Blue Devils 
-- as well as Minnesota, Louisville and Rhode Island when they were 
ranked. 
</P>
<P>
	The ominous signs -- close wins against overmatched Dayton and  
Southern Mississippi -- were ignored. A 62-60 loss at UNC Charlotte 
was shrugged off to an official's mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	So was a 61-60 overtime loss at DePaul, even though Cincinnati  
blew a lead and was fortunate to get the game to overtime. The 
officials couldn't be blamed for a 62-58 loss at Marquette four 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	The crushing loss came Sunday in St. Louis, where technical  
fouls on Huggins and Melvin Levett helped the Billikens pull away 
to a 69-57 victory -- the Bearcats' most lopsided loss in 52 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Huggins' technical foul for jumping and screaming about a  
non-call allowed Saint Louis to close to 48-47 with 6:53 left. 
Levett's technical for upending Troy Robertson on a rebound attempt 
helped the Billikens push their lead to nine points with fewer than 
two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	Huggins defended his own outburst on Monday, saying it didn't  
hurt the team. He also made another round of complaints about the 
officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much am I supposed to sit there and take?'' Huggins said.  
``Really, I thought I was pretty good (until then). At a certain 
point in time, you've got to fight for your team. 
</P>
<P>
	``All this stuff about mellowing out and (being) nicer and all  
that stuff -- I don't know. But I don't think that hurt the team. 
Throwing the ball away hurt the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bearcats' ballhandling has been the main problem during the  
slump. They had 23 turnovers in the loss to DePaul and 19 against 
Saint Louis, including seven by Horton. 
</P>
<P>
	The players have held two meetings and Huggins has changed his  
starting lineup and left one player behind for not trying hard 
enough in practice. Nothing has worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Horton concedes that the early season success might have gone to  
the players' heads, causing them to get sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt happy winning before. We got comfortable with it,''  
Horton said. ``We thought we could come in every day and go through 
the motions, not take it seriously like we were (before). It caught 
up with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huggins thinks there's something to it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was patting them on the back and telling them how  
good they were and we kind of got away from what we're good at 
doing,'' Huggins said. ``I told you guys, but you didn't believe 
me: Our margin for error is very, very small.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Reviews Web Site Offerings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former KGB Operative Alexander Vassiliev  
remembers well how Soviet spies in Washington relied on openly 
available sources to pull together intelligence reports for Moscow. 
It was a technique the Pentagon fears may be returning as more and 
more defense information becomes easily available online. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were not many real sources of top-secret information,  
but, on the other hand, the Soviet leadership demanded 
information,'' said Vassiliev, co-author of ``The Haunted Wood,'' a 
book about U.S.-Soviet espionage during the Stalin era. Soviet 
spies would pore through academic journals, speeches and reports 
looking for material they could package for headquarters in the 
guise of intelligence. In some cases, the information, though 
public, was highly valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the Internet and the vast stores of government-generated  
information available online has made such work quicker and easier 
-- and that has the Pentagon worried. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that terrorists and hostile nations are surfing its  
Web sites for sensitive nuggets tucked in among reams of mundane 
data, the military is putting its vast Web network through a 
security scrubbing, one that some groups say has gone too far. That 
criticism recently prompted some military and national security 
officials to provide more details than they previously had about 
the potential security problems they discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Military commanders began focusing on the problem last year when  
Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, got 
a classified briefing from Pentagon cyber-warriors who showed him 
how an able adversary might quickly locate his son's home address 
in Florida. They also demonstrated how a skilled Web surfer could 
combine publicly available biographies and contractor information 
on military Web sites with a few well-placed phone calls to pin 
down the dates of highly classified nuclear exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said military Web sites  
offered adversaries ``a potent instrument to obtain, correlate and 
evaluate an unprecedented volume of aggregated information'' that 
could, when combined with other information, ``endanger Department 
of Defense personnel and their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was information that was potentially tactically useful  
to an adversary, the kind of thing where if someone really wanted 
to do harm to your personnel, it could facilitate them in 
undertaking an attack,'' said one senior defense official working 
on Internet security issues. Another national security official, 
who also spoke on condition of anonymity, called the briefings 
``eye-openers'' that startled commanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The briefings stemmed from work in 1997 and 1998 by Pentagon  
``red teams,'' a term associated with a hypothetical enemy force in 
war games. Team members tried to learn how much mischief they could 
do by scanning military Web sites without any sophisticated 
hacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaning the military Web sites of potentially dangerous  
information has proved a monumental task -- even for an organization 
whose research arm is credited with inventing the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Leonard, a top Pentagon information security official, said  
the military initially was unsure how many Web sites it had, and 
even today can provide only an estimate. Entire military Internet 
addresses have been put off limits, with a terse computer screen 
message that the information has been removed for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Some think the scrub of military Web sites has gone too far.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wartime information policy,'' said John Pike of the  
Federation of American Scientists, a Washington-based research 
group that follows military and intelligence matters. ``All kinds 
of program information is being withdrawn. Almost anything that 
discloses what an agency actually does, beyond a brief mission 
statement, is going away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To date, the Pentagon cannot point to a specific incident where  
information posted on a military Web site resulted in harm to U.S. 
national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``The menacing scenarios have remained just that -- only  
scenarios,'' according to George Smith, editor of The Crypt 
Newsletter, an online publication on computer security. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pentagon says it has solid electronic evidence that  
foreign countries, including adversaries, regularly visit its Web 
sites.
