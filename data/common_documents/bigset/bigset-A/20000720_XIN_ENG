<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has dismissed the recent unrests in the West African country as
activities related to plots aimed at destabilizing the country,
media here reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agitation over the Islamic Sharia law in the north, the
ethnic fighting in the southern Niger Delta region and the riots
in Lagos are all propelled by extreme groups geared to
disintegrate the country, the president was quoted as saying in
Abuja on Tuesday before his tour to Japan, South Korea and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Describing the many problems facing Nigeria as daunting,
Obasanjo said he is undaunted in his resolve to provide purposeful
leadership to the citizenry and maintain the unity and
indivisibility of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was created "for a purpose which no man could destroy",
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He listed the activities of his one-year administration, saying
his government has restored hope to all Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The citizenry should keep this hope alive, he said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Islamic Professor to be Tried for Libeling Top Cleric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian Islamic theology
professor was ordered on Thursday to stand trial for libeling a
sheikh who presides over the highest authority of Sunni Islam in
the world, the prosecutor's office said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's public prosecutor Maher Abdel Wahed ordered Al-Azhar
University Professor Yehia Ismail Giloush to be tried on charges of
insulting and defaming Sheikh Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi of the
university in an article published on March 17, the country's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There was no plan to arrest Giloush, who will continue teaching
and show up for the trial in a criminal court when a date is set,
the prosecutor's office said.
</P>
<P>
Biloush's article entitled "Egyptian Divorce, an American
Enterprise" was published by the Islamist newspaper Al-Shaab, which
authorities suspended in May for inciting unrest.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of scorning and ridiculing Sheikh Tantawi for
endorsing the new law making it easier for women to divorce,
legislation which the professor said failed to comply with Islamic
law.
</P>
<P>
Tantawi filed a complaint with the public prosecutor after the
article was published, prompting an immediate investigation. The
grand sheikh, Egypt's top cleric, usually mirrors the government
point of view.
</P>
<P>
Under the law ratified in January, a woman can ask for a divorce
on grounds of incompatibility in exchange for renouncing all
financial rights she had gained through the marriage.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaab had frequently clashed with the government and several
of its journalists have been convicted of libeling government
officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Thursday received a letter from Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The letter, delivered by Wahid's envoy, visiting Indonesian
Minister of Trade and Industry Luhut Pandjaitan, touched upon ways
on strengthening bilateral relations in political, economic and
cultural fields, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to cooperate with Indonesia in all fields now as
well as in the future," Saddam was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wahid sent the envoy and an Indonesian delegation to Iraq to
attend the celebration of Iraq's 32nd anniversary of the July
revolution in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been intensifying efforts to strengthen relations
with Iraq to gain a slice of Iraq's highly profitable market by
signing contracts with Iraq under the United Nations oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian deal is an exemption from the crippling U.
N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, which allows Iraq from November 1996 to sell limited amount
of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods for its 22 million people.

<HEADLINE> 3 Muslims Arrested in Egypt for Stirring up Violence Against Christian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Three Muslims were arrested near
Cairo on Thursday for stirring up a mob that set fire to a
Christian's home because they believed he was turning it into a
church, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
Samir Naguib, a Christian tailor who lives in a village south of
the Giza area of greater Cairo, tried to convince the three he was
simply making renovations, but they refused to believe him, the
officials were quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Using loudspeakers, they rallied a mob from Awasaya village and
a neighboring village, who set fire to his house, with flames
spreading to two adjacent homes, the officials said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was reported hurt in the incident, which raised fears
among analysts that religious intolerance was growing in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The three Muslims were identified as Salem Rashad Ismail, Hassan
Goma al-Hamad and Khaled Hassan Rabiya.
</P>
<P>
Police tightened security in the area to prevent further
incidents of violence.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has a population of 64 million, of whom over 9 percent are
Christians. It witnessed the worst sectarian violence in at least
20 years when 22 people died, almost all of them Coptic Christians,
in clashes that broke out last January in the town of Kosheh of
Suhag Governorate, 400 kilometers south of Cairo.

KIEV, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's foreign trade turnover in
January-May of this year reached 13.131 billion U.S. dollars, up
22.1 percent on the same period of 1999, an official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Andrii Honcharuk, Ukrainian Deputy Minister of
Economy, over the first five months of this year, export of goods

with the same period of 1999, import increased by 27.5 percent and
reached 6.342 billion dollars. The foreign trade favorable balance
was 447 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that Ukraine's foreign trade volume in 2000
would grow by 17-19 percent from 1999.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ukraine's foreign trade turnover dropped by 13.8
percent from 1998 and made 28.056 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Interest in Online Banking Up in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Interest in online banking has
been steadily increasing in the United States, resulting in a
dramatic rise in user participation over the next two years, said
a new study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the study conducted by U.S. research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC), the number of U.S.
households banking online will reach 22.8 million in 2004.
</P>
<P>
As this large banking consumer base moving online, IDC said, it
will bring with it significant implications for banks, ranging
from technology support and customer service, to online banking
functionality. Banks of all sizes that have resisted creating
online services will find themselves competitively disadvantaged
over the next 24 months, according to the research firm.
</P>
<P>
An earlier research by market analysis firm Dataquest estimated
that the number of U.S. households using PC banking applications
will more than triple in the next few years, from 7 million at the
end of 1998 to more than 24.2 million by 2004. Dataquest said that
banks and other financial institutions face two primary challenges
to promote growth in these online activities -- to widen the
overall appeal of online banking and overcome consumer unease
about control of the online bill paying process.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Members Lack Political Will to Prevent Conflicts, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Thursday criticized member countries for lacking political
will to prevent conflicts all over the world, which have claimed
the lives of five million people in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"There is no shortage of ideas for avoiding the sort of human
suffering, killings and wanton destruction that so disfigured the
20th century," Annan said in an opening speech at an open Security
Council debate on the body's role in the prevention of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Most modern wars are civil conflicts in poor countries, where
most of the victims are civilians, women and children.
</P>
<P>
The prevention of those conflicts goes beyond the normal
remedies of early warning, disarming warring factions or deploying
U.N. peacekeepers, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Countries must help address the underlying causes of conflict,
such as underdevelopment, the absence of democratic government and
social inequality, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But there remains a worrying lack of political will among
governments, which hold most of the levers of prevention in their
hands, either to show political leadership when it is needed, or
to commit the necessary resources," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Only seven countries have contributed 7.4 million U.S. dollars
in three years to a special fund destined for preventing conflict
in countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Foreign Trade Sets New Records in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's foreign trade set new
records in May, with exports topping the highest level of 33.8
billion Canadian dollars (about 22.89 billion U.S. dollars) in
exports in March, according to Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
In its latest monthly report made available here Thursday, the
official statistical agency said exports hit a record 34.3 billion
Canadian dollars (about 23.2 billion U.S. dollars) in May, with
trade surplus rising to 3.7 billion dollars(about 2.5 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The country recorded exports of 32.79 billion dollars (about 22.
21 billion U.S. dollars) in April, with a trade surplus of 2.96
billion dollars (about 2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Statscan described the 4.6 percent monthly rise in exports as a
high-tech boom based on the growing foreign demand for Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
"Exports of high-technology equipment were up.
Telecommunications and television equipment exports have been
particularly strong this year rising 13 percent in May," said
Statscan.
</P>
<P>
Trade with the United States continued to account for a
dominating part of Canada's total volume, with 86 percent of
exports going to and 72 percent of imports from the southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Statscan put the monthly trade surplus with the United States
in May at a record 7.47 billion dollars (about 5.06 billion U.S.
dollars),surpassing the previous high of 7 billion dollars (4.74
billion U.S.dollars) set in January.

<HEADLINE> Two Former Salt Lake Olympic Bid Leaders Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Two Olympic bid leaders for
Salt Lake City were indicted at a federal grand jury on Thursday
on charges of conspiracy of racketeering for their roles in paying
more than one million U.S. dollars to bring the 2002 Winter
Olympics to the city.
</P>
<P>
The 15-count indiction from the Utah capital city said that
Thomas Welch and David Johnson secretly paid an official of the U.
S. Olympic Committee to win the 2002 winter games for the Utah
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Welch, 55, former president of the Salt Lake City Olympic Bid
Committee, and Johnson, 41, ex-vice president, "offered and paid $
1 million to influence the votes of more than a dozen
International Olympic Committee members," the Justice Department
said in a news release summarizing the indictment.
</P>
<P>
The two men were charged with one count of conspiracy, five
counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud and four counts of
interstate travel in aid of racketeering.
</P>
<P>
All the charges carry a maximum sentence of five years in
prison and a 250,000 dollars fine.
</P>
<P>
The indictment followed the collapse of negotiations aimed at a
plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's lawyer, Max Wheeler, had said Welch and Johnson
consider themselves scapegoats for the vote-buying scandal, which
has been under a Justice Department investigation for one and a
half years.
</P>
<P>
A Salt Lake ethics panel found that the bid lavished more than
1.2 million dollars in cash, gifts, travel and other inducements
on members of the International Olympic Committee and their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Mitt Romney was appointed president of the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee to clean up the organization after the scandal broke in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the scandal, 10 IOC members resigned or were
removed from the 105-year-old organization.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe not to Play Spain in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- John McEnroe removed his name
at the last moment from the four-man roster as the United States
will play Spain in the Davis Cup semifinals in Santander, Spain on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Due to injury pullout of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, McEnroe
once expressed the willingness to play doubles but refrained from
playing as he found himself out of form, and will confine his role
to his captain's job in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move at the draw, the 45-year-old McEnroe filled
in the names of Todd Martin, Jan-Michael Gambill, Vince Spadea and
Chris Woodruff, hoping the quartet can pull off a huge upset on
clay in the semifinals against Spain.
</P>
<P>
Martin will play the first match Friday against Albert Costa,
and Gambill will follow against Alex Corretja.
</P>
<P>
The tentative matchup for Saturday's doubles is Spadea and
Woodruff against Corretja and Juan Balcells. On Sunday, Martin
will play Corretja, and Costa will meet Gambill in the best-of-
five competition.
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, arguably the greatest doubles player in history but
eight years removed from his last Davis Cup doubles match, said
that "there was a temptation, there's a part of me that wanted to
do it, but I feel awkward picking myself. These guys are fitter
than I am. I'm not dominating, to be honest."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Upgrades Major Public Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian government is to spend tens
of millions of U.S. dollars to refurbish major public hospitals
while stepping up the construction of new ones to upgrade medical
services, officials with the health ministry said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Innovation for Bashir hospital in downtown Amman, the largest
and most full-fledged public hospital in the kingdom, is expected
to start by the year end under the first part of a three-year
expansion plan, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
With 12 million dollars from a 50-million-dollar loan from the
World Bank, the first-stage innovation for the hospital includes
the building of a main block with a 300-bed maternity and children
wing and an outpatient department harboring 50 clinics.
</P>
<P>
Currently Bashir hospital has 874 beds and caters to some 5,000
patients every day.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the pressure on Bashir hospital, the government is
stepping up the construction of two other major public hospitals in
the west and east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Located on some 18,000 square meters in western Amman, a new
150-bed facility called Sahab hospital is expected to receive
patients in two months. The government has invested 6.5 million
Jordanian dinars (9.1 million dollars) on the project, excluding
equipment and furniture.
</P>
<P>
Another new hospital named Prince Hamzah will be built in
eastern Amman with a loan of 50 million dinars (70 million dollars)
from the Kuwaiti-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is also expanding public hospitals in
the most populous governorates of Zarqa, Maan, Karak, Mafraq and
will build three new public hospitals in the northern governorate
of Irbid, the most important industrial district of the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Cypriots Mark 26th Anniversary of Turkish Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Greek Cypriots on Thursday paid
tribute to those who lost their lives in the 1974 invasion by
Turkey, while Turkish Cypriots celebrated the 26th anniversary of
the event that led to the de facto split of the island.
</P>
<P>
Air raid sirens wailed early Thursday morning, the very time
that 26 years ago Turkish troops landed on the shores of the
northern coastal town of Kyrenia. And flags were flying at half
mast.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriot women refugees from the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
northern area of the island staged a hunger strike on Wednesday and
Thursday demanding justice for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The mayors of all Greek Cypriot towns Thursday signed a petition
demanding the reunification of the island, respect of human rights
for all the people of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, according to local media, a military parade
was organized Thursday in the Turkish Cypriot area of Nicosia to
celebrate the 1974 Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
Five Turkish F16 warplanes and five F4s flew over northern
Cyprus Thursday. Six of them flew over the Turkish army military
parade while the other four were patrolling the area.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish Air Force display flight, comprising nine F5
warplanes, and a transport plane remained landed at the airport
Lefkoniko in northeast Cyprus. The F5s are expected to fly over the
Kyrenia town for an air show.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Defense Minister Socrates Hasikos confirmed that Turkish
activities, relating to the anniversary of the July 20 invasion,
have been stepped up this year in comparison with previous years.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government is expected to lodge a protest against
these "mass violations" to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the east Mediterranean island in the wake a
failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has since maintained some 35,000 troops in the north of
the island with the claimed aim of protecting the Turkish Cypriots.
In 1983 Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway republic
which is recognized only by Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Rescue workers on Thursday pulled one
of their colleagues out alive after he has been trapped for hours
under the rubble of a collapsed clothing factory in the
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Yussef Mohammad of the Civil Defense disaster squad was
inspecting the fire-damaged six-story building in Al-Nozha district
of Alexandria Wednesday night when it fell on them, the state-run
MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad, 55, was rescued around dawn, about eight hours after
the building collapsed, the news agency said. He was now recovering
in a nearby hospital with broken bones and bruises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rescue workers extracted 10 more bodies from under
the debris of the building on Thursday, which brought the number of
dead in the incident to 17, including three policemen.
</P>
<P>
Police and witnesses said a group of children had also been in
the building when it collapsed, but there was no word on their
fate.
</P>
<P>
The clothing factory caught fire around 22:00 local time (1900
GMT) Wednesday. The civil defense workers had gone inside to
inspect the building and find ways to cool it down late at night,
when it caved in.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- An official commemoration was held
Thursday in the hometown of late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to
mark the end of the 40-day mourning for the passing of the man who
had ruled the country for three decades.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration at Qurdaha, in Latakia city about 320
kilometers northwest of the capital city of Damascus was attended
by the late president's son, new President Bashar al-Assad and a
number of senior Syrian officials.
</P>
<P>
Foreign dignitaries present at the event included Lebanon's
President Emile Lahoud, Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister
Salim Hoss, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid,
representatives of United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Zayed Bin
Sultan Al-Nahyan and Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian National

peace as a way to liberate the occupied territories, namely the
Golan Heights seized by Israel in 1967, despite the complicated
regional and international conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said Syria cannot abandon even one inch of its land or
compromise over its rights, pointing out that Syria is committed to
be developed in all political, economic, cultural, scientific and
military fields.

<HEADLINE> Armenia to Establish Diplomatic Relations With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Armenian Councilor Yori Baba Kanian
and Charge D'Affairs Murad Muktyarian arrived in the Iraqi capital
Baghdad on Thursday to establish the Armenian embassy here, the
official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Such a move came amid Armenia's efforts to strengthen political
and economic relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Armenia will "do its best" to call on the United Nations to lift
the sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
the Armenian charge d'affairs said.
</P>
<P>
Armenia is keen on opening new fields of cooperation between the
two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Armenia tries to develop relations with Iraq to gain a share of
Iraq's lucrative market to improve its grim domestic economic
situation, which has been troubling the country ever since its
independence in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's reconstruction, a market of over 200 billion U.S.
dollars, has been attracting officials and business delegations
from countries worldwide to Iraq to make business deals within the
framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The program, began in November 1996, allows Iraq to export
limited amount of oil every six months to finance imports of food,
medicine and other humanitarian goods to offset the crippling
impact of the decade-old sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Syria to be Linked by Railroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Syria signed an agreement
here on Thursday to link their railroad network via Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was inked by head of Iran's railroad department
Rahman Dadman and his visiting Syrian counterpart Mohammad Ayad
Qazal, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the Syria-Iraq section of the
railway will be 150 kilometers long while the Iran-Iraq section has
a length of 30 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The design and construction of the Syria-Iraq railway have been
contracted to an Iranian company, Qazal said at the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the other section will link Iran's southern city
of Khorramshahr and the Iraqi city of Basrah. Syria, however, has
yet to start negotiations with Iraq on the matter, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dadman hailed that the line would be an important transportation
link between the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
He added that once completed, the Iran-Iraq-Syria railroad would
be the most important surface transportation route in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two officials, however, did not say when the project is
expected to be started and completed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, IRNA reported that Syria and Iran had
decided to build a railroad via Turkey. It is not clear why they
have finally changed minds and chosen Iraq instead.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court to Hear Appeals of Espionage Convicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian judiciary official said
on Thursday that an appeals court would shortly hear appeals by 12
persons convicted of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
The 12 Iranians, 10 Jews and two Muslims, had on July 1 been
sentenced to two to 13 years in prison for espionage by a
revolutionary court in Shiraz, capital of the southern Fars
Province. Five others, including three Jews and two Muslim, were
acquitted in the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Ali Amiri, head of judiciary of Fars Province, said
appeals by the convicted will be heard soon, but he did not give
exact date, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
He told the agency that the attorneys of the convicts had
submitted their appeals against the ruling issued by the Shiraz
court.
</P>
<P>
The court of appeals in Fars Province will either uphold the
ruling of the lower court or overturn it, but it cannot issue a
stronger ruling than that issued by the lower court, he added.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers of the Iranian Jews tried for spying for Israel
have raised protest to the court ruling, IRNA reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the lawyers Esmaeel Naseri Mojarad said that he has
submitted a 95-page petition to Branch Three of the Islamic
Revolutionary Court of Shiraz in protest at the ruling of the court
dealing with the case.
</P>
<P>
Since the arrest of the Jews early last year, Iran has been
under severe pressure from western countries to release them.
</P>
<P>
After the court verdict on July 1, western countries stepped up
their criticism and pressing Iran to overturn the sentences. Iran,
however, insists that the trial and verdict were rational and fair
and no foreign country should meddle in country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iran has a Jewish community of about 25,000 people, the largest
in the Middle East outside Israel.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed, 4 Injured in House Collapse in Southern Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and four
others injured on Thursday when a wall of a house collapsed in
southern Egypt, the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place in the town of Samallout, Menya
Governorate, 220 kilometers south of Cairo, when workers were
reinforcing the wall of the fragile mud-brick house, a security
official told the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The wall suddenly fell down, leaving two of the construction
workers dead and four members of the family injured, the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He did not mention how
many workers and family members were on the scene.
</P>
<P>
Building collapse is common in Egypt as buildings are often
built with shoddy materials and small houses are added to larger
buildings without permission. The house was the latest structure to
fall down in Egypt that saw 23 people die in the collapse of three
buildings in Cairo and Alexandria in May and June. Dozens more were
crushed to death in at least seven building accidents last year.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Group Denies Paying Commission to Angolan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The French oil group Total-Fina-
Elf denied on Thursday that it has paid commissions to Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in order to win contracts of
exploration and development of the country's rich offshore oil
resources.
</P>
<P>
Total-Fina and Elf merged one year ago to become the world's
fourth largest oil group with its main interests in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview last Saturday, a former high official of
Elf who was the president of Elf's branch in Gabon said that he
used the good personal relations among African leaders to enter
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Andre Tarallo, who is called ``Mr. Africa'' of Elf for his 30
years of experiences in Africa, said that ``the system of
relations in Africa is such that you benefit in a country from the
good relations which you have in another.''
</P>
<P>
Tarallo, 72, is now under judicial investigation for his role
in several corruption scandals of Elf and is suspected to have
abused public fund.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has angrily reacted to the declaration
by Tarallo and accused Tarallo of ``trying to hide his possible
criminal acts which were blamed on him personally or his
colleagues in Elf.''

<HEADLINE> UNAIDS Calls on G8 for Massive Increase in Resources to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has called on the G8 group of wealthy countries
attending the Kyushu-Okinawa Summit Meeting 2000 to show resolve
and leadership on AIDS by radically stepping up their spending to
fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
"In sub-Saharan Africa alone, we need a minimum of 3 billion U.
S. dollars a year if we are to turn back the tide of the epidemic,
but we are spending only a tenth of that," said UNAIDS Executive
Director Dr Peter Piot said in a statement here Thursday. "For the
past two weeks,the world's eyes have been focused on AIDS. Rich
countries can rewrite the history of the epidemic by taking a
decisive stand against AIDS and committing more resources to
fighting it."
</P>
<P>
The call comes in the aftermath of the XIII International AIDS
Conference that closed on Friday in Durban and the resolution
adopted this week by the UN Security Council reiterating its
concern about the spread of HIV/AIDS and drawing attention to the
risk posed by an unchecked epidemic to stability and security.
</P>
<P>
"There are already encouraging indications," Piot added. "Some
G8 countries have taken their decision to step up their
commitments to fighting AIDS. But this is not enough. Last year, 5.
4 million people were newly infected with HIV. The latest figures
show that 34.3 million people worldwide are now living with HIV.
Barring a miracle,most of them will die within a decade or so. We
cannot and we will not turn our backs on these millions."
</P>
<P>
In several of the worst-affected African countries, resources
freed by debt relief are already being rechannelled into AIDS.
While this is a promising start, UNAIDS supports more widespread
efforts to use the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC),
announced at last year's G8 meeting in Cologne, Germany, to boost
funding for national AIDS efforts. At Durban, the UNAIDS chief
called on governments in the south to invest more resources in
AIDS, and on governments in the north to greatly increase their
contributions to fight AIDS in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of HIV-infected people live in developing
countries, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time,
African governments together owe more than 230 billion U.S.
dollars in debt, with repayments costing Africa a staggering 15
billion dollars each year, the equivalent of 5 percent of the
region's income and about 15 percent of its export earnings.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS has single-handedly caused a profound reversal of
development gains made over the past three decades in a number of
countries, especially in Africa. Studies presented in Durban last
week show that countries with the highest number of HIV-infected
persons stand to lose up to a fifth of their economic output
because of AIDS over the next ten years. Therefore, UNAIDS says,
spending the"savings" from debt relief on effective programs to
prevent the spread of HIV makes sound economic sense.
</P>
<P>
In addition to debt relief, UNAIDS has called for making sure
the basic tools of prevention and care are available in the
neediest countries. In many instances, basic health systems exist
but there are few or no commodities to distribute, including
condoms, testing kits,and drugs for both prevention and care.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the G8 leaders earlier this month, UNAIDS urged
wealthy countries to agree that no African country should be
unable to mount prevention campaigns or provide basic care for its
population because of lack of basic commodities. It called on G8
countries to make available an additional 1.5 billion U.S. dollars
a year to provide and distribute HIV/AIDS commodities. UNAIDS
further urged the G8 to support accelerated action in Africa under
the framework of the International Partnership Against AIDS in
Africa negotiated by governments, the UN, donors, civil society
and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The call for broader and increased action on HIV/AIDS is part
of a wider UN effort to intensify G8 action against communicable
diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.

<HEADLINE> Jamaica Becomes First Active Player in UNCTAD's Online Trading Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Jamaica has become the first
country to participate in the newly redesigned Global Trade Point
Network(GTPNet) of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development(UNCTAD) following its signature in Kingston on July 12
of the terms and conditions for membership in the Trade Point
Program.
</P>
<P>
The GTPNet is a database-driven Internet system with password-
protected areas designed to provide international traders with up-
to-the-minute listings of potential buyers and sellers of products
and services and other trade-related information not usually
available online, according to a UNCTAD press release here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Interactivity and decentralization are the buzzwords of the new
network architecture, which uses state-of-the-art tools for
uploading,downloading, automatically updating and searching for
information. On the GTPNet, information is shared through central
databases, making data retrieval easier and faster.
</P>
<P>
A full text search capability, and customized search tools
including user-defined fields for eight-day period before being
listed on the publicly accessible part of the site. All the
information on each trade point has been formatted into
standardized categories and codes, and the trade points in turn
periodically verify the data on their member enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Three types of information can be found on the GTPNet website:
</P>
<P>
-- General information maintained by UNCTAD, including a list
of trade points worldwide, their home pages and status, relevant
guidelines and frequently asked questions;
</P>
<P>
-- Specific information on individual trade points, providing
details on their services and fees, direct business contacts,
local companies, and national trade regulations, posted by the
trade points via online secured forms or automated replication
processes; and
</P>
<P>
-- Open areas for the exchange of information, such as
electronic trading opportunities or technology developments, and
for user feedback, a discussion database, newsletters and special
announcements. A knowledge management framework including online
training courses will be set up shortly to make this type of
pooling of knowledge, information and experience among trade
points even easier.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are more than 200 trade points in 130 countries,
and as the number continues to grow, along with the sheer volume
of available business information and quantum leaps in information
technology, the GTPNet is expected to expand even further.
</P>
<P>
The long-term objective of the program is for the trade points
to become self-sustainable and to take ownership of the GTPNet.
The forthcoming VI Worldwide Trade Point Meeting, to be held in
Geneva on November 6-10 this year, will provide an opportunity to
strengthen and institutionalize the growing community of trade
points.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Cyprus a Shame for Europe, Says Greek Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday expressed its
dissatisfaction over the present situation in Cyprus, saying that
it constituted "an open wound and a shame" for Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing on the 26th anniversary of
Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said that the situation in the eastern Mediterranean island
was an injustice for both the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"Today, 26 years after the Turkish invasion, we all feel as
Cypriot citizens and our thought is turned to the lost fighters,
the missing and the refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish provocation continued with aircraft flights and
parades in the Turkish occupied northern part of Cyprus as well as
with violations of the national airspace in the Aegean Sea by
Turkish aircraft, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the issue, Reppas said that Greece was "in a
state of preparedness" and would face any such actions in the
appropriate way.
</P>
<P>
Greek political leaders Wednesday repeated their firm support
for Cyprus and hoped for a positive and viable solution to the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
In Cyprus, the Greek Cypriots Thursday paid tribute to those
who lost their lives in the 1974 Turkish invasion while the
Turkish Cypriots celebrated the 26th anniversary of the event that
led to the de facto split of the island.

<HEADLINE> Over 2,000 Cows Killed in Northeastern Greece Due to Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 2,100 cows and 150 sheep and
goats suffering from foot-and-mouth disease have been killed in
Greece's northeastern Evros Delta since the recent outbreak of the
disease in the region.
</P>
<P>
The figures are expected to increase in the next few days
because two new outbreaks of the disease appeared in the areas of
Peplos and Ferres in the Evros prefecture Thursday, according to
the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
Currently, veterinarians are continuing epidemic checks at all
the compounds for big and small animals in the Evros region to
enable timely diagnosis and action in the event of more such
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
The ANA quoted Evros Veterinary Service Director Costas
Dadousis as saying that the next measures in the effort to combat
the disease is the stringent limitation of animals in compounds to
prevent herd movements and to allow for better control.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight herds of cows in the Evros region were found
early July with clinical symptoms of the disease and veterinarians
believed that such disease was transmitted from neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 animals were killed in the northern Thrace
region when a similar outbreak had occurred during 1994-1998.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Taliban Talks Fail over Women Recruitment Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior United Nations official,
who discussed with Afghanistan's Taliban on the fresh ban on the
recruitment of women employees, failed to secure any assurances
from the ruling militia to remove the ban, Afghan and U.N. sources
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Erick de Mul, Islamabad-based U.N. coordinator for Afghanistan,
who flew to the Afghan capital of Kabul on Sunday, returned here
empty-handed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban ordered the United Nations and other relief agencies
two weeks ago to sack all the female staff on their strength.
</P>
<P>
The order might create problems for relief agencies because
many agencies utilize the services of hundreds of local women to
implement their welfare projects.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's new order led to the arrest of Mary Macmakin, head
of the Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Support for Afghanistan,
along with her seven Afghan women employees earlier this month.
She was later deported to Pakistan after Taliban accused her of
espionage.
</P>
<P>
"Taliban need more time to review the ban," Erick de Mul said
on his return from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
When Taliban captured Kabul in September 1996, they ordered all
women to stay at home. However, the radical Islamic militia
gradually relaxed its policy and granted special permission on
some women to work, most in the health sector.

<HEADLINE> UK Government To Spend Huge Cash On Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott
announced Thursday a 180-billion-pound 10-year plan to ease road
congestion and boost public transport in Britain.
</P>
<P>
He told the House of Commons that the increase of 75 percent in
real terms would be divided roughly into thirds between rail, road
and local transport projects.
</P>
<P>
The plan, entitled Transport 2010, would deliver radical
improvement for passengers, motorists, business and for all the
citizens, Prescott said.
</P>
<P>
On the roads, the Government plans to widen 360 miles of the
motorway and trunk road network to ease bottlenecks and to build
100 new bypasses.
</P>
<P>
On the railways, a large-scale investment in the upgrade and
expansion of the network will allow for 50 percent more passengers
to travel and will make their journeys quicker and safer.
</P>
<P>
The Government is also introducing a new 7 billion pounds rail
modernization fund which will "lever in" private capital to the
rail system.
</P>
<P>
Prescott said he expected local transport providers to use the
new resources wisely, and ensure that better public transport was
delivered "on budget and on time".

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says U.S. Economy Shows Signs of Slowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said Thursday the economy is showing signs of
slowing but cautioned that it was too early to announce victory in
fighting inflation.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the Fed's midyear economic report to Congress,
Greenspan said the U.S. economy seems to be cooling from its red-
hot pace, a change many economists and members of the Fed believe
is needed to prevent an outbreak of inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Aggregate demand may be moving closer into line with the rate
of advance in the economy's potential," Greenspan told the Senate
Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan noted that rising interest rates, a flattening in
stock prices, and rising levels of household debt all had
contributed to a softening in the pace of consumer spending, the
main engine behind the U.S. economy's growth.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned that "We cannot yet be sure that the
slower expansion of domestic final demand, at a pace more in line
with potential supply, will persist." He said it's too early to
draw definitive conclusions that the economy is on a sustained
path of moderate growth.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan tied his worries to the tight labor market and fears
that workers will demand big boosts in wages and benefits, costs
that could be passed along to consumers as higher prices, meaning
more inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Should labor markets continue to tighten, short of repeal of
the law of supply and demand, labor costs eventually would have to
accelerate to levels threatening price stability and our
continuing economic expansion," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
Labor costs have been held in check by healthy gains in worker
productivity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Even so, Greenspan said, inflation, including the "core" rate,
which excludes energy and food, has worsened.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has raised interest rates six times over the last 13
months to slow economic growth and its main engine, consumer
spending, in an effort to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
"Maximum sustainable growth ... requires price stability. The
Federal Reserve, I trust, will always remain vigilant in pursuit
of that goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
As part of his testimony, Greenspan presented the Fed's revised
economic forecast for 2000. The Fed predicted the gross domestic
product (GDP) will grow by around 4 to 4.5 percent this year,
compared with 4.2 percent in 1999. For 2001, growth was projected
to slow to around 3.25 percent to 3.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
And, the central bank forecast inflation will worsen slightly
this year, with a GDP-related inflation gauge rising around 2.50
percent to 2.75 percent, compared to an increase of 2 percent last
year.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Strong Political Impetus to Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Thursday calls for stronger political impetus behind research
policies of European countries.
</P>
<P>
The commission, in a new evaluation report on research
programs in the EU, warns of a danger that Europe will fall behind
other economic areas and lose its place as a knowledge center if
the leaders do not place research at the right political level.
</P>
<P>
Andrea Dahmen, spokeswoman for the European Commission's
research section, told reporters that the EU's research policy
needs more political support than before.
</P>
<P>
The report, addressed to European Research Commissioner
Philippe Beusquin, said EU research programs are now not strong
enough to meet new challenges, while demographic changes and
decreasing research budgets call for a major policy review.
</P>
<P>
The report also assessed program performance and administration
and urged greater flexibility to meet new challenges such as new
diseases and food scares.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, issues an
evaluation report on its Research Framework Programs every five
years.
</P>
<P>
At the European Council meeting held in Lisbon last March, the
EU set a goal of producing the most competitive and dynamic
knowledge-based economy in the world, thus putting research and
technological development policy at the heart of the development
strategies for the 15 country European bloc.

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves 176-Million-U.S.-Dollar Assistance to Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank approved
Thursday a financial assistance package totaling 176 million U.S.
dollars for the Philippines to clean highly polluted Pasig River
in the capital of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said in a press release that the package will support
the Philippines' five year phase (2000-2004) of its 750-million-
dollar Pasig River Development Plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to bring marine life back to the river and make
it suitable for activities such as boating by 2014, said the ADB.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the bank's assistance package
consists of a 175 million dollar loan and a one million dollar
technical assistance grant.
</P>
<P>
The ADB's assistance components include measures to relocate
squatters, establish and develop 10-meter-wide environmental
preservation areas along the river banks, and reduce the volume of
untreated wastes discharged into the river system.
</P>
<P>
The Pasig River is a waterway of historical, social, cultural
and commercial significance, but has been seriously polluted by
indiscriminate discharge of untreated municipal and industrial
wastewater and solid waste.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Fall in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. housing starts in June
fell 3 percent from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.
55 million units, the lowest level in more than two years, the
Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last month's starts were down 1 percent from the June 1999 rate
of 1.56 million units, providing further evidence that the Federal
Reserve's string of interest rate increases is beginning to slow
the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The decline left housing starts at their lowest level since May
1998, when they totaled an annual rate of 1.54 million units.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has raised the interest rates six times during
the past 13 months in an effort to slow the economy and keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
The housing market, sensitive to interest rates, has been an
engine of the vibrant economy, and, even with higher rates,
activity has remained healthy.
</P>
<P>
Starts of new single-family homes also fell 3 percent in June,
to 1.21 percent, also the lowest level since May 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, new building permits, a barometer of future
activity, for single-family homes fell to a rate of 1.11 million,
down 3 percent from May and the lowest level since December 1997.
</P>
<P>
New building permits for all types of housing were unchanged in
June at 1.51 million, suggesting future construction activity may
slow.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the government said the number of
Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week fell 9,

OTTAWA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's new economy sector is
expected to grow to a record level this year with the total
spending amounting to 13.3 billion Canadian dollars (9 billion U.S.
dollars), a whopping 25 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
New economy industries, such as telecommunications, computer
manufacturing, scientific and computer-related service industries,

<P>
By contrast, the increase for the rest of the economy is
estimated at 3.3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The new economy industries help drive total spending of
Canadian companies and governments on new plant and equipment to
140.2 billion Canadian dollars (95 billion U.S. dollars) this
year, up 5.1 percent from the 133.4 billion Canadian dollars (90
billion U.S. dollars) spent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Prices Go Up in EU Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Natural gas prices in the
European Union (EU) countries went up notably between January 1999
and January 2000, a Eurostat report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After a strong decrease in natural gas prices (excluding taxes)
for industries between January 1998 and January 1999 in most of
the EU member states, the rise last year is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, Denmark and Finland recorded the highest
rise in prices for gas for industrial consumers. The two countries
experienced very strong increases between 1999 and 2000 after
significant drops between 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
Major price increases were also registered between 1998 and
2000 in Ireland and France. On the other hand, gas prices for
industries in average terms decreased particularly in Austria, the
Netherlands and France.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat said the changes in oil prices and the
liberalization process under way or just starting in some EU
members during the period analyzed have been considered when
analyzing these fluctuations.

<HEADLINE> Britain Participates in Chinese State-Owned Firm Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-British governmental
project concerned with state-owned enterprises reform and
development was launched today in this capital of northeast China'
s Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
British Ambassador to China H.E. Sir Anthony Charles Galsworthy
said, "This is the first time for Britain, and also for any
Western industrialized country, to cooperate with China in state-
owned enterprises reform."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador expressed the hope that this experiment in
Liaoning, a province with many large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises, will set up a model for the other provinces.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that he was positive about the prospects for
the project, saying, "Though different in social systems, the two
countries can learn from each other on how to run state-owned
enterprises within the framework of the market economic system."
</P>
<P>
Yang Xihuai, head of the Liaoning Provincial Economic and Trade
Committee, said six enterprises have been chosen to spearhead the
reform in Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
Gao Guozhu, deputy governor of Liaoning, said the management
system introduced from Britain is expected to help Chinese state-
owned enterprises out of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The British government is to invest 19 million pounds (about 26
million U.S. dollars) in restructuring 24 Chinese state-owned
enterprises within the next three years, and setting up
information and consultancy services for medium and small-sized
private companies.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Shantou Fire Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The cause of a fire that claimed
five lives in a hotel in this south China coastal city on July 15
has been identified.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that the fire was caused by the over-
heating of an electron vacuum flask in the hotel room where the
fire started.
</P>
<P>
The malfunctioning of the vacuum flask burned the plastic parts
of it, and the flames spread and caused a major conflagration, the
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
The investigators have excluded the possibility that the fire
was started deliberately.

<HEADLINE> 5 Amal Members Charged of Killing Hezbollah Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese army Wednesday filed
charges against five members of the Amal movement over involvement
in killing of two men of the Hezbollah group last week, local media
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the defendants might face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
In the incident last Saturday, members of Amal killed two
Hezbollah members in the southern Lebanese village of Markaba in a
gun battle which erupted after members of the two groups ripped up
posters of their rival's leaders.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the bloodiest between the two groups since
Israel withdrew from south Lebanon late in May after 22 years of
occupation, during which the two Shiite Muslim groups spearheaded a
guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation troops in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iran- and Syria-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
effectively controlled south Lebanon since the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Amal, which has a secular political platform, is led by the
influential Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Frees Slain Soldier's Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine extremist group Abu
Sayyaf released Thursday afternoon in the southern Sulu province
the 16-year old son of a soldier slain whom they kidnapped on May
17, the official Philippine News Agency said in a report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the kidnapped teenager, Richard Sintos,
has been turned over from Jolo, Sulu to chief government
negotiator Robert Aventajado in the southern Zamboanga City.
</P>
<P>
Avenajado said no ransom was paid to the Abu Sayyaf because the
release of Sintos was part of a "swap deal" where the extremist
group released five schoolchildren in exchange for seven family
members of Basilan-based Abu Sayyaf Commander Khadaffy Janjalani.
</P>
<P>
Sintos is the son of Scout Ranger Sergeant Freddie Sintos who
was slain during an attack by the Abu Sayyaf on a military
detachment in Basilan province over two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Sintos was held by the Abu Sayyaf faction led by Khadaffy
Janjalani, younger brother of the group's slain founder Abdurajak
Janjalani. Two school teachers are still reportedly being held by
the Janjalani faction.
</P>
<P>
The Janjalani faction is different from the faction based
mainly in Sulu province, which is still holding 18 mostly foreign
hostages taken from Malaysian on April 23; Jesus Miracle Crusade
leader Wilde Almeda and 12 of his followers; and four foreign
journalists.
</P>
<P>
The country's leading news channel ABS-CBN reported earlier in
a report that the Abu Sayyaf also freed Thursday seven Malaysian
hostages who were among the original 21 hostages taken from
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
However, government chief negotiator Robert Aventajado said
that negotiations are still on-going for the release of the seven
Malaysian hostages.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 hostages abducted from Malaysians, two Malaysians and
one German woman have been released.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu

Commander of the Armed Forces Mongkon Ampornpisit, Deputy Prime
Minister Korn Dabbaransi, also leader of the ruling coalition

Chinese legislative and judicial authorities have taken firm and

</P>
<P>
"China is willing to play an active role under an international
framework of drug suppression," he stated.

BANGKOK, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao met here Thursday with Thai crown prince Maha
Vajiralongkorn and senior Thai parliamentary, governmental and
military leaders separately.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Hu said the two countries and two peoples
have already established friendly relations marked by mutual trust,
mutual understanding and mutual support, which are particularly
valuable in country-to-country relationship.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides can strengthen
cooperation and further promote friendship in the new century and
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Prince Vajiralongkorn said Sino-Thai relations are deeply
rooted and are as inseparable as relatives and brothers.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the Chinese vice-president's visit will
definitely further promote the friendship between the two peoples
in the new century.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Chinese vice-president, Prem

He said the "one China, two systems" principle put forth by the
late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is "pragmatic, promising" and
the Thai government and parliament will stick to the "one China"
policy in both administration and registration and will never
change the stance under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Thai Supreme Commander of the Supreme Command Mongkon

any anti-drug regional and international framework.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Belgrade to Reject Results of U.N.-Conducted Census in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia said Thursday that it
will not recognize the results of a census conducted by the U.N.
Special Mission in its breakaway southwestern province of Kosovo
because the census is "a gross violation of the U.N. resolution
1244."
</P>
<P>
Stanimir Vukichevich, head of a cooperation committee formed by
Yugoslav officials and members of the U.N. mission, said in a
statement that the census, which started in February, was widely
boycotted by non-ethnic Albanian residents in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Although the U.N. mission kept putting pressure on non-ethnic
Albanian residents in the mostly Albanian province," he said, "
they still refused to take part in the census in a bid to prevent
the double standard imposed by the U.N. mission from being
legalized."
</P>
<P>
Since the U.N. body began to administer Kosovo last June,
Vukichevich said, 360,000 non-Albanian residents have been forced
to flee the region while 250,000 ethnic Albanians illegally
entered Kosovo from the two neighboring countries of Albania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
At present, non-Albanians can neither move about safely in
Kosovo nor freely use their own language. Under such circumstances,
he said, it is apparently inopportune to conduct a census in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-organized census was also boycotted by the Yugoslav
government, which claims that the move is an encroachment of
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and it should be taken by the country
itself.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, representatives from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), co-organizer of the
census, told reporters in a Kosovo city that the census had failed.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Condemns U.S. Bill on Russian Radar in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian lawmaker on
Thursday condemned the U.S. House of Representatives for imposing
the precondition of shutting down a Russian radar station in Cuba
for the restructuring of Russia's debt to the Paris Club.
</P>
<P>
Dmitry Rogozin, chairman of the Committee for International
Affairs of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament,
said he is surprised at the U.S. House's "more than strange"
stance, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House passed the bill on Wednesday, urging the Clinton
administration to block the restructuring of Russia's foreign debt
to the Paris Club if Moscow fails to shut down its radar in Lurdes,
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Russia owes the U.S. 485 million U.S.
dollars in debt inherited from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Rogozin pointed out that U.S. Congress has no moral right to
handle the issue this way, as a law recently passed in the U.S.
has given the go-ahead for the construction of a U.S. radar
installation in the direct vicinity of the Russian border on the
Aleutian Islands, in Britain and in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a U.S. radar is now operating in Norway in
violation of the 1972 ABM Treaty, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Congress thinks that the U.S. has the right to violate all
agreements while we must instantly dismantle our radar in Cuba,
which was not involved in ABM tests and has nothing to do with
these agreements, unlike the American radar in Norway," the
lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, while
condemning the Congress bill, said the development should not be "
over-dramatized."
</P>
<P>
The radar station has been functioning for many years "and it
is no secret to America," Kasyanov said. The station is employed
to monitor the observance of international arms control agreements,
Kasyanov said, noting that the U.S. has analogous stations.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. Congress resolution is dictated by the
country's internal political situation, but the U.S.
administration has a "balanced attitude" towards the problem and
therefore the situation should not be "over-dramatized."

<HEADLINE> Moscow Condemns French Seizure of Russian Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin on Thursday condemned the French
seizure of the Russian embassy's property in Paris and the Russian
sailing vessel Sedov in Brest as contradicting international law.
</P>
<P>
Kudrin made the statement at a government meeting "in
connection with the continuing practice of illegally seizing"
Russian assets and the property of a number of Russian
organizations on the basis of lawsuits filed by the Swiss Noga
company, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Swiss businessman Nessim Gaon, who heads the Noga company, has
sued the Russian government for a 63 million U.S. dollar debt he
says is owed him by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Kudrin said the seizure of the Russian embassy's property in
Paris, which was carried out on the basis of the Noga company,
obviously contradicts international law, in particular, the 1961
Vienna Convention, which the Russian side has communicated to the
French authorities on an official level.
</P>
<P>
The perceived debt stemmed from a series of food-for-oil deals
that Noga struck with the Russian government in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Gaon's lawyers say they are seeking to recover a total of 800
million dollars in interest and damages, but for now are demanding
the immediate payment of the 63- million-dollar debt.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Pavel Latushko on Thursday urged the United States to
objectively consider the facts concerning the disappearance of a
TV cameraman and refrain from inaccurate interpretations on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Latushko was responding to a U.S. State Department spokesman's
comments on the July 7 disappearance of Dmitry Zavadsky, a
Belarussian national working for Russia's ORT television, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. spokesman said the development considerably increases
Washington's concern over the persecution of journalists, the
restriction of the freedom of speech and the atmosphere of fear in
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Latushko said an investigation has been launched to establish
the real reasons behind the ORT cameraman's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
In another related development Thursday, the Belarussian
embassy in Moscow criticizing Russian media for what it described
as biased approach to the coverage of Zavadsky's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
"Certain media outlets have been fuelling a dirty campaign
lately in connection with ORT cameraman Zavadsky's disappearance,"
the embassy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Belarussian law enforcement agencies are taking every measure
to investigate this incident" and the course of the investigation
"is under the Belarussian president's personal control," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, it is worth emphasizing that Zavadsky is a
Belarussian citizen and the state is capable of looking into the
situation on its own, without the intrusion of certain media which
only heighten tensions and do not do anything concrete to help the
investigation," the document added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai A-share Market Down at Thursday Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Composite index
closed at 1991.56 points on Thursday, down 6.87 points or 0.34
percent, compared with the last close.
</P>
<P>
The total trading volume was 12.89 billion yuan, 2.38 percent
more than Wednesday's 12.59 billion yuan, according to Homeway,
China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The 2000-point target in the year 2000 becomes a psychological
obstacle for most investors. The Shanghai composite index crossed
over the 2000-point again at the market open Thursday morning, but
it failed to create a new high. So investors decided to sell and
try to take profits, said Homeway.
</P>
<P>
Following Wednesday's two new A share listings, another two new
A shares made their debuts Thursday morning, the Bright Oceans
Inter-telecom Corporation and Zhejiang Sunlight Group Co. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia Ningcheng Laojiao Co., Ltd. was the biggest
loser. Its price shed 6.52 percent to 21.78 yuan per share.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that as two new A shares will be
issued on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets tomorrow, the
market index is likely to be pressed down.

RIYADH -- The National Saudi Limited Aircraft Service Company is
expected to receive the first plane in a Hooker 800-XB type
aircraft deal from the U.S. Rethion company.

<P>
The plane will be delivered during the British air exhibition

solving the problem of housing out of the oil-for-food formula
revenues, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohamad Mehdi Saleh said recently.
</P>
<P>
Iraq imported one million tons of reinforcing iron and has
contracted for purchasing a similar quantity expected to turn up
shortly, reported the Iraqi Rafedeen weekly.
</P>
<P>
This quantity will be enough for erecting 1.2 million housing
units, said the report.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economic Recovery Sustained, Comprehensive: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Finance Minister
Daim Zainuddin said Thursday the country's economic recovery has
moved towards more sustained and comprehensive growth.
</P>
<P>
The main economic indicators have clearly shown that economic
activity in the country is moving speedily, he said at the opening
of a two-day economic seminar in Malacca, some 140 kilometers
south from here, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has not only recovered from the regional financial
crisis but its economic growth is now on a stronger footing, he
said, adding the encouraging performance was achieved not only in
terms of the gross domestic product (GDP) but the country's
resilience against external risks has also risen.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia recorded an 11.7 percent GDP growth in the first
quarter this year and a 9 percent GDP growth is expected in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The encouraging growth in the country instilled greater
confidence among investors as foreign portfolio funds totaling 8.7
billion ringgit (2.28 billion U.S. dollars) entered the country
from the beginning of this year until June 7, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The strong economic recovery has been achieved in an
environment of low inflation and for the first half of this year,
the rise in the consumer price index rose by only 1.5 percent,"
the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Malaysia's external reserves rose to
34 billion U.S. dollars at the end of June this year, able to fund
5.8 months of retained imports and also 6.5 times higher than the
country's short term external loans.
</P>
<P>
The country's external loans are still lower at 51.8 percent of
the gross national product (GNP) and the national debt ratio
dipped to 5.3 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has achieved excellent results when compared with
other crisis-hit countries in this region in terms of
restructuring and establishing better governance in the finance
and corporate sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The level of non-performing loans of the financial institutions
dropped to 6.6 percent in April this year compared with 11.4
percent in September 1999 and the risk-weighted capital ratio
improved to 13 percent in May this year from 11.8 percent at the
end of 1998, much higher than the 8.0 percent under the Basle
Standard, he said.
</P>
<P>
The standard of living of the people returned to pre-crisis
levels and job opportunities are also extremely bright, he said,
adding that up to June 24 this year, there were only 956 cases of
retrenchment against 9,673 job openings to be filled.

PARIS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The black wave caused by the sinking
of the oil tanker "Erika" last winter off the western French coast
has killed 300,000 birds, most of them poisoned by the oil which
polluted the sea and coast, said a bird protection organization
Thursday.
</P>

While 69 species of birds were caught in the disaster, 80
percent of the victims were guillemots, the sea birds who are the
neighbors of penguins but immigrate to north Atlantic in winter,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The organization released 2,146 birds back to the sea on July
17 while 90 others are still undergoing treatment and are expected
to be released in August.

<P>
Under the agreement, the U.S. is to give Russia up to 200

</P>
<P>
Reprocessed plutonium shall not be used for making nuclear

<HEADLINE> Japanese Protesters Demand Withdrawal of U.S. Military Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OKINAWA, Japan, July 20 (Xinhua) -- About 27,000 people
surrounded the U.S. Air Force Kadena Air Base in central Okinawa
Thursday, shouting "no" to the U.S. military presence in Japan's
southernmost island prefecture on the eve of the Group of Eight
summit.
</P>
<P>
"We need no military bases for war," shouted the protesters
after forming a 17 kilometer human chain around the base.
</P>
<P>
The Okinawa People's Committee, organizer of the human chain,
adopted a peace message entitled "Imagining the 21st Century
Without Military Bases and Wars."
</P>
<P>
"We urge the summit leaders to discuss the establishment of
security for human beings not depending on the use of force and
promote a peaceful diplomatic resolution of issues through
dialogue. The G-8 leaders are responsible for this," the message
said.
</P>
<P>
A protester said, "Today's encirclement of the base fully
represented Okinawa residents' hopes that they need no bases. We
will continue to fight until this base is removed."
</P>
<P>
Thursday's human chain comes at a time of rising antipathy
toward the U.S. military presence in Okinawa in the wake of two
crimes allegedly committed by U.S. servicemen earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least 4,000 people in Yamato, Kanagawa Prefecture,
staged a demonstration, calling for reduction and eventual
withdrawal of U.S. military bases in Japan in support of the
antibase movement in Okinawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa accounts for only 0.6 percent of Japan's total land
area but some 75 percent of land occupied by U.S. military
facilities in Japan is in Okinawa.

<P>
CHENGDU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China is to build an information
industry base to battle invasions by hackers and other illegal
cyberspace activities over the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
The ground-breaking ceremony for the national information
security base was held today in this capital of southwest China's
Sichuan Province, with participants from the Ministry of Science

The new base will provide a platform for a number of companies
to develop products that can protect the country's confidential
files on the Net and prevent computers from being raided by
hackers, according to sources.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Tigers previously living in a zoo
in northeast China's Liaoning province today were all moved to a
new home for a more comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 Siberian tigers have said farewell to their old
residence in the Shenyang Tiger Garden, which is now considered
too small for them.
</P>
<P>
Fights over "territory" had started to break out between the
tigers, according to the keepers.
</P>
<P>
Their new home is three times the size of their old one, and
has easier access to food.
</P>
<P>
However, when the relocation began, many of the tigers were
reluctant to move, howling sadly.
</P>
<P>
"They have lived there for two years, and have an attachment to
the place and the visitors," said a keeper.
</P>
<P>
The new zoo is one hour's drive away from downtown Shenyang,
and surrounded by farmland and forests.
</P>
<P>
The Siberian tiger is an endangered animal, with only 300
surviving in the wild worldwide.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The 8.5-m-deep and 51.77-km-long
new sea route to the Yangtze River delta opened with a trial
voyage here today, according to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The new sea route at the Yangtze River estuary will greatly
enhance Shanghai's status as an international shipping center, and
promote social and economic development in the region, the
administration commented.
</P>
<P>
The former sea route to the delta was less than six m deep, and
had long been a bottleneck for Shanghai's development, for third-
and fourth-generation container ships could not pass through it.
</P>
<P>
The deepening of the sea route to the Yangtze River delta, with
a total investment of more than 15 billion yuan (about 1.8 billion
US dollars) began in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The trial voyages will last for one year, and then the new sea
route will be checked for acceptance by the authorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Yayan, mayor of Xiamen in east
China's Fujian Province, has called off his plan to visit the port
city of Kaohsiung in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Xiamen municipal government attributed the
cancellation to obstruction by a certain department of the Taiwan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Frank Hsieh, mayor of Kaohsiung, said that
the relationship between Xiamen and Kaohsiung should be that of
two cities belonging to the same country, and invited Zhu to visit
his city to enhance economic and cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Zhu sent a letter to his counterpart on July 13, saying that he
would like to accept Hsieh's invitation and visit Kaohsiung to
promote economic and cultural exchanges between the two port
cities.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and his delegation were scheduled to visit Taiwan from July
18 to 20.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taiwan authorities made a pretext that there are
some problems concerning "legal and operational procedures" to
block the visit, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh replied on July 14 asking Zhu to choose another date to
visit the city.
</P>
<P>
Because of the Taiwan authorities' lack of sincerity, Zhu had
to cancel his planned visit, the government sources said.

BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's publicity chief has said
that the Communist Party of China (CPC) should use important
theories to teach the people.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, head of the Publicity Department of the CPC
Central Committee, said at a meeting discussing the spread of the
Party's theory, held from July 17 to 19, that the Party and people
should use President Jiang Zemin's instructions to unite their

Ding, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, urged theorists to answer questions raised in the
course of the country's development, and solve practical problems
puzzling both cadres and ordinary people.

<P>
He said that the building of correct ideals and strong belief
should be the focus of the Party's theoretical work, and the Party
's basic theories, lines and principles should be well publicized.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Leads in Efforts to Build Personal Credit for Chinese (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- This east China metropolis, as
well as China's largest economic powerhouse and financial center,
is pioneering experiments to build a personal credit system for
the first time in China.
</P>
<P>
This marks another major progress in China's efforts to
restructure its financial systems compatible with international
standards.
</P>
<P>
As part of the experiments, more than one million local
citizens will be the first Chinese mainlanders to have their
personal credit standing recorded, which will lay a foundation for
the large-scale offering of mortgage loans by local banks.
</P>
<P>
The personal credit system is new to countries like China,
which long had planned economies, and bank loans were inaccessible
to individuals because they had no personal credit standing.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some local banks have been allowed to grant
mortgage loans to individuals for purchasing cars, houses and
other things, but it has been very difficult and complicated for
individuals to get loans from banks, despite the fact that local
banks have a large sum of unused funds.
</P>
<P>
In July 1999, the Shanghai Credit Information Service Co. Ltd (
SCIS) was set up, becoming the first of its kind in the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"The setting-up of a personal credit system is a triple
integration of demands by the state, enterprises and individuals,"
said Shang Heping, general manager of the credit information
company.

<TEXT>
<P>
The issue is of great importance to the development of the
entire national economy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Some local experts observe that the state wants to spur the
consumer market to develop the economy at a proper speed and get
state enterprises out of trouble. Meanwhile, the new generation of
Chinese consumers are changing their viewpoint on spending
tomorrow's money on today's consumer goods, no longer seeing it as
a capitalistic way of life.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Shanghai has witnessed the fastest growth of
individual loan borrowing in China. In 1999, 680,000 people
borrowed 54 billion yuan-worth of mortgages from local banks,
compared with 15,000 people and 570 million yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
So far, 15 local banks have acquired membership of the board of
directors of the Shanghai Municipal Center for Personal Credit
Information, a local supervisory and administrative organization.
</P>
<P>
Local citizens who have borrowed loans or used credits issued
by these member banks will be among the first to have their
personal credit standing put on file. The number of these
trustworthy local residents has topped 1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
The member banks will send all their personal credit records to
the data bank of the SCIS, and, beginning July 1, these commercial
banks have been able to obtain the data bank's personal credit
records about individual loan applicants by simply dialing a phone
number.
</P>
<P>
In the next stage, the board plans to accept members from
social security departments, the police, judicial bodies,
industrial and commercial administrations, and tax bureaus,
according to Feng Xiao, an SCIS official. The total number of
local residents opening personal credit records is expected to
reach six million to seven million.
</P>
<P>
The experiments have won a positive response from local banks.
The Shanghai branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
says it plans to provide local people with personal credit loans,
while the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPPB) has launched
students' credit loans and increased the amount of overdrafts for
its Dongfang (Oriental) credit card.
</P>
<P>
Local residents also support the trial move. A staff member of
a foreign-funded firm, who only gave his surname as Lu, said, "It
will no longer be so complicated for individuals to get loans from
banks, if a personal credit system is set up. I'll cherish my
credit as much as my life."
</P>
<P>
Following Shanghai, similar experiments are expected to be
undertaken in other large cities in China, as part of the efforts
to establish a personal credit system across the country,
according to official sources.

<HEADLINE> Barak Remains at Camp David due to Clinton's Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
told his confidants Thursday that he agreed to stay on at Camp
David for talks with the Palestinians only out of appreciations for
U.S. President Bill Clinton's peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon and
Science, Culture and Sports Minister Matan Vilnai by phone from
Camp David, Barak said that Clinton asked him to stay on for
another four days, Israeli officials revealed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who already postponed his Wednesday departure for an G-
8 summit in Japan for 24 hours, finally left Camp David, where he,
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had convened a summit
for reaching an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, on Thursday morning
and will return on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Barak also briefed Eli Yishai, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party, and Yossi Sarid, leader of the left-wing Meretz party, about
the latest developments at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The impression he got after the phone contact, Yishai claimed,
is that the negotiation has entered an extremely difficult stage.
</P>
<P>
Shas and Meretz, who holds 17 and 10 seats in the 120-member
Knesset (Parliament) respectively, are critical for parliamentary
approval of any agreement Barak reached with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Barak's office said that Barak now did not know
when he could come back.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which began last Tuesday, aims to resolve all the
core issues between the two sides, such as the future status of
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees, borders,
security and water.

commerce, the use of computers ought to be stepped up and Internet
access should be enhanced.

OKINAWA, Japan, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the Group of
Eight (G-8) are to kick off their annual summit here Friday to

States, Britain, Italy, France, Japan, Russia, Canada and Germany.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the G-8 leaders will discuss a broad range

On the first day of the summit, the G-8 leaders are expected to
issue a joint statement outlining their assessments of the global
economy, and other economic and financial issues, according to G-8

<HEADLINE> France to Triple Fine for Transporting of Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- France will triple the amount of
fine to be imposed on transporters of illegal immigrants,said
French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told a seminar on illegal immigration held in Paris that the
French government will present soon a law for raising the fine
from the present 10,000 francs (1,450 U.S. dollars) to 30,000
francs (4,350 U.S. dollars) for transporting each illegal
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
The fine will be imposed on air companies, shipping companies,
railway companies and other land transport companies if illegal
immigrants are found on the transport means which belong to them.
</P>
<P>
Soon after taking over the European Union (EU) rotating
presidency this month, France proposed better coordination among
the 15 EU countries in increasing the responsibility of
transporters and inflicting punishment against the organizers of
clandestine immigrants.
</P>
<P>
France has also asked EU countries to create a special network
of officers in charge of immigration, as well as closer
cooperation among the police forces of EU countries in cracking
down on false immigration papers and illegal immigration networks.

<HEADLINE> EU Chief Expresses Concern Over U.S. Missile Defense Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President Romano
Prodi on Thursday expressed concern over a plan by the United
States to build a national missile defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
The NMD project could lead to an arms race, Prodi said in a
meeting with Yukio Hatoyama, leader of Japan's main opposition
party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), party officials said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi is here as representative of the European Union (EU) to
attend the three-day summit of the Group of Eight (G-8) major
nations beginning Friday in Nago in Japan's southernmost
prefecture of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The United States says that it has proposed building the NMD to
shield against attacks from what it called "the rogue states."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan has drawn criticism not only from China, Russia,
but also from some of Washington's Western allies such as Germany
and France.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Vladimir
Putin issued a joint statement Tuesday in Beijing, expressing
strong opposition to the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
"Not only Russia and China, but also the security and strategic
stability of the United States itself and the entire world will
be very negatively affected by the realization of this plan, " the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Sue U.S. Firms for Cigarette Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will take
a legal action against some American tobacco companies for their
involvement in smuggling cigarettes into Europe, the European
Commission said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive Commission's announcement came after a
decision made on Wednesday by a group of officials in the
Commission.
</P>
<P>
EU spokesman for internal market Jonathan Todd told reporters
that the Commission made the decision in principle to launch a
civil action against several U.S. companies for smuggling
cigarettes into the EU countries. "But it will be some time for us
to take the action," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taking civil action, he said, "means we want our money back" in
lost revenues at the EU and national levels.
</P>
<P>
Todd said the EU will lodge a lawsuit in court for big frauds
worth of billions of U.S. dollars involved in this case. At
present stage, detailed names of involved companies and volume of
cigarettes in smuggling would not be exposed, he said when
answering questions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU executive body will continue to cooperate
with the national authorities to combat cigarette smuggling, which
the 15 EU member states have different concerns, according to the
spokesman.

MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia basketball captain Vasily
Karasyov said he would not attend the Sydney Olympics because of
health problems on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I will not go to Sydney because I want to put my health in
order," Karasyov said in an interview with newspaper Sport-Express.
"Last season was a big disappointment for me because I was sick
all the time."
</P>
<P>
Karasyov, the 29-year-old point-guard who play for the CSKA
Moscow, led Russia to the runners-up spot at the 1998 world
championship but struggled for most of last year both at his club
and in the national team.
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping for my health to get better so I could start
training for Sydney," he said. "But I was just running out of time.
I don't think I will be able to regain my top form in a month."
</P>
<P>
Russia head coach Stanislav Yeryomin questioned Karasyov's
desire to play for the national team.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly speaking, our coaching staff and myself, we just don'
t understand his decision," Yeryomin told Sport-Express.
</P>
<P>
"I know that Vasily just had a very painful surgery but he was
still one of our top players and his chances of going to Sydney
were very high -- unlike his desire to help the team."

<HEADLINE> China Offers Tax Incentive for Low Pollution Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China announced it will cut the
consumption tax by 30 percent for cars that have reached the
European 2 emission standard.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint notice released by the Ministry of Finance
and the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) recently, the cars
subject to the tax reduction include passenger cars, all-terrain
vehicles and compact cars.
</P>
<P>
To be eligible for the tax reduction, car manufactures must
have their products examined by government-authorized quality
control agents.
</P>
<P>
This move is aimed to encourage Chinese car manufactures to
meet higher environmental protection standards that are currently
in effect in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, China has adopted a three-tiered consumption tax on
cars. Depending on the size of cylinder volume of engines, the tax
rates are 3 percent, 5 percent and 8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a 30 percent cut will lower the tax rates to a range
of 2.1-5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tax reduction takes effect from January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The lower tax rates will benefit Chinese manufacturers the most
because imported cars are subject to higher tariff rates.
</P>
<P>
China has already adopted a compulsory limit for automobile
emissions that is equivalent to the European standards of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
According to international agreements that it has signed, the
country will adopt stricter standards on the level of emissions in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital city Beijing put into effect the European 1
standards for car emissions since the beginning of 2000. These
standards, equal to those of Europe in the 1990s, are the
strictest used in any Chinese city.

</P>
<P>
Poverty in China, especially as it affects women, is a complex,
multidimensional problem, points out the report, which deals with
the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for
Action, which were formulated by the United Nations Fourth World
Conference on Women five years ago in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The report claims that the main causes of poverty for women are
the income inequalities between women and men and the limited
opportunities for women to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
Poverty cannot be eradicated by anti-poverty programs alone but
requires full and equal involvement and economic development --
which China is doing now, says the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, local governments in China, in
accordance with various local conditions, integrate women's
poverty relief into their overall poverty-relief programs.
</P>
<P>
For instance, north China's Shanxi Province set up a gender-
based poverty-relief program statistics system that gives priority
to women. Under the system, poverty-relief projects that do not
address the needs of women cannot be registered.
</P>
<P>
In order to help the poverty-stricken households, the Chinese
government arranges special loans every year for their development,
and provides small amounts of credit mainly to women in the rural
areas. Financial institutions are encouraged to provide soft loans
to poor women.

<TEXT>
<P>
At the same time, China encourages women to find ways out of
their circumstances. Various measures, such as "courtyard economy
", projects that give full play to women's advantages, export of
labor force, special skills of minority nationalities, were
adopted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government calls on non-governmental
organizations to get involved in special programs for poor rural
women.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the All-China Women's Federation, the largest women's
organization in China, started a "women eradicating poverty action
" aiming to help at least one million poor women escape poverty by
the end of 2000. With the help of the action, 580,000 women were
free from poverty by 1998, and 23 million women in rural areas
were trained with farming skills.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the China Population Welfare Fund, China Family
Planning Association and China Population Journal initiated the "
Happiness Project" designed to assist poor mothers. The project
has been launched in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities and has input 95.87 million yuan (about 11.55
million U.S. dollars) to help 65,000 poverty-stricken mothers.
</P>
<P>
The report cites lack of information and poor education as the
main obstacles facing women. The illiteracy rate among Chinese
poverty-stricken women is as high as 70 percent currently.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests the government should increase funding for
poverty relief, provide credit options and market access to women,
accentuate human resources development for women in poverty-
stricken areas, continue to include women's anti-poverty as part
of the nation's anti-poverty program, and take gender into
consideration when formulating poverty-relief plans.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Fights Crimes from Three Gorges Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Local authorities in Chongqing
are launching a three-month campaign to deal with officials who
have illegally used their influence to profit from the
resettlement of the multi-billion yuan Three Gorges Dam Project.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at safeguarding the resettlement funds and
the quality of the relocation work, according to local prosecutors
in charge of the matter.
</P>
<P>
This southwestern municipality is home to 80 percent of the
more than one million people to be move due to the mammoth water
project being built on the Yangtze River, the longest river in
China.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 of the people affected have been relocated by
local government.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a series of crimes such as embezzlement and
misuse of huge amounts of resettlement funds have been exposed,
involving a large number of local officials.
</P>
<P>
So far 97 of the accused officials have been convicted and
punished. Among them are Huang Faxiang, director of the land
resources administration of Fengdu County, who embezzled 15.56
million yuan from land sales, and Wang Sumei, an accountant at the
relocation bureau of Wanzhou District who used over one million
yuan of resettlement funds for gambling.

<HEADLINE> Summer Locusts Under Control in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The summer attack of locusts has
been brought under control thanks to the concentrated efforts of
central and local governments, according to some Chinese
agriculture experts.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that while the threat of locusts to this
autumn's crops still exists, the worst is over.
</P>
<P>
Between May and June, huge swarms of locusts assaulted farmland
in 16 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, covering a
total area of six million hectares. In severely-affected areas,
mostly in northern China, 1,000-5,000 locusts were found per
square meter on average.
</P>
<P>
Central and local governments have tried many techniques to
prevent losses caused by locusts. The Ministry of Agriculture and
local agricultural departments have sent work teams to these areas
to help out.
</P>
<P>
So far, central and local governments have spent over 60
million yuan in the nationwide fight against locusts. Ten Y-5
aircraft and 160,000 people were sent to the affected areas to
battle the bugs.
</P>
<P>
The locust-elimination work has been carried out on two million
hectares of farmland across the country, with an effectiveness
rate of about 90 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Astonished at Iranian Allegations of Explosions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has expressed "vehement
astonishment" at statements made by the Iranian Foreign Ministry
alleging that Iraq is responsible for the explosions rocking Tehran
recently, an Iraqi foreign ministry spokesman said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is not Iraq but the Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO), the
Iraq-based Iranian opposition, that was behind the recent anti-Iran
activities in the Iranian capital Tehran, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has nothing to do with these accidents, he added.
</P>
<P>
Recently there have been a series of explosions in Iran and
fierce clashes between the MKO and the Iranian government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war that ended with a U.N.-
brokered ceasefire in 1988. The two neighbors never signed a peace
treaty and their relations since the end of the war have remained
tense. Each accuses the other of harboring dissident armed groups
fighting the other's government.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, which fled to Iraq after being outlawed by Iran's
Islamic government in 1981, has intensified attacks on Iran in
recent months amid heated power struggle between the conservatives
and reformists in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there have been three mortar attacks on Iraq this
year. On May 1, rockets exploded near the headquarters of Iraq's
General Directorate of Security in the Iraqi capital Baghdad,
wounding eight people.
</P>
<P>
On March 22, a mortar attack in the same area killed four people
and injured 38 others.
</P>
<P>
Both governments have distanced themselves from such attacks and
labeled them as acts of domestic resistance.

<HEADLINE> Al-Ma'unah Links with Opposition PAS: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday most of the 1,800 members of the Al-
Ma'unah deviationist group are also opposition Parti Islam
Malaysia (PAS) members.
</P>
<P>
He said he had to make such disclosure as PAS had charged that
the Al-Ma'unah group has links with UMNO (United Malays National
Organization) of which Mahathir is the president. UMNO is the
backbone party of the ruling 14-party Barisal Nasional (National
Front).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government at first refrained from disclosing
Al-Ma'unah's link with PAS and that Al-Ma'unah is a militant wing
of PAS.
</P>
<P>
"But today PAS tries to link UMNO with Al-Ma'unah," he said in
Alor Setar, capital of the northern state of Kedah, some 460
kilometers north from here, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
PAS symbols are all over at Al-Ma'unah premises, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
"They (AL-Ma'unah members) make up the extremist group among
PAS supporters. Although the Al-Ma'unah is not PAS-owned, the
members are people influenced by anti-government campaign carried
out by PAS. Al-Ma'unah is a direct design of PAS' hatred campaign
against the government," Mahathir was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Members of Al-Ma'unah group robbed a huge cache of arms,
including more than 100 assault rifles and machine-guns, from two
military camps in the northern state of Perak on July 2 and took
four men hostage. Two of the hostages were killed by the gang
members before they surrendered to the authorities four days later.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Al-Ma'unah was bent on setting up an Islamic
state in Malaysia whereas Malaysia is already an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
PAS' struggle is also to establish Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahathir said he also did not discount the possibility
of UMNO members being Al-Ma'unah followers.

<HEADLINE> Lanka Retains Foremost Place for Buddhism in New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government said
Thursday that the official stand on the foremost place for
Buddhism will remain unchanged in the proposed new constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The Chapter on Buddhism as contained in the government's
proposals of October 1997 remains unchanged," said Ariya
Rubasinghe, director of information.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no truth in recent media reports that the
Chapter has been deleted from the proposed constitution.
</P>
<P>
The proposed constitution, which aimed at trying to end Sri
Lanka's long-running ethnic war, is being discussed by the ruling
People's Alliance government, the main opposition United National
Party and minority Tamil groups.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has said she would present the draft
constitution before the parliament in early August and have it
adopted before the parliament is dissolved on August 24.
</P>
<P>
Rubasinghe said, "the central government will have exclusive
legislative and executive powers in respect of Buddha Sasana (
affairs)."
</P>
<P>
The Sinhala Buddhist clergy is very influential in Sri Lanka
where Buddhists constitute some 70 percent of 19 million
population.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Finance Commissioners of Nigeria' s
36 states have collectively pushed for more funds from the federal
purse by demanding 45 percent of the nation's total revenue.
</P>
<P>
According to the Guardian newspaper on Thursday, the
commissioners want 30 percent revenue to go to the federal
government and 25 percent to local councils.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of their meeting in the
capital Abuja on Wednesday, they advised the federal government to
urgently produce the new formula so that it could be incorporated
into the 2001 federal budget.
</P>
<P>
The statement by Lagos State Finance Commissioner, Olawale Edun,
noted that a large part of the long-term solution to several
current problems in the country hinged on a new and fairer revenue
allocation formula that better reflects the constitutional roles
of the various tiers of government.
</P>
<P>
The present formula of revenue allocation gives 35 percent to
the federal, 25 percent to states, 20 percent to local councils.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Unemployment Rate Down to 3.6 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of South Korean
unemployed dropped to 793,000, or 3.6 percent in June, due to a
fast economic recovery, an official report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the National Statistical Office (NSO),
said the June jobless number marked the lowest since the financial
crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial
institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, the nation's jobless numbered 657,000 and the
jobless rate was 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The jobless number has continued the downward trend since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
In January, it stood at 1.127 million, then down to 1.21
million in February, 1.02 million in March, 900,000 in April and
to 828,000 in May.
</P>
<P>
Amid the sustained economic expansion, employment chances are
increasing throughout the entire spectrum of industries in general,
in the agriculture, fishery and construction industries in
particular, said the office.
</P>
<P>
However, a temporary rise in unemployment is expected in July
and August due to such seasonal factors as college students
seeking for jobs in summer vacation.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Can not Cede Jerusalem: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat can
not cede Jerusalem and the Palestinians will never reach any
agreement with Israel excluding Jerusalem, said a Palestinian
official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Thursday morning that he
will head for Japan to attend the G-8 economic summit, and that
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will stay in Camp
David to continue their talks with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright will meet Arafat and Barak on Friday to press ahead
with the Camp David summit, which began last Tuesday and was
deadlocked due to wide gaps between the two sides over the final
status issues, particularly Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Barak and Clinton that the Arab leader who might
cede Jerusalem has not been born yet, and that no agreement will be
reached unless the future status of Jerusalem is properly
addressed, said Palestinian Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Ziad Abu
Ziad.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has proposed that a partial agreement be clinched and
more negotiations be held over the status of Jerusalem. But Arafat
insisted on an all-out agreement including Jerusalem, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation to the three-way summit categorically
declined to accept an idea suggested by Barak that Israel keeps
control over Jerusalem and, in return, grants the Palestinians
self-rule in some Palestinian suburbs of the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Arab eastern part of Jerusalem in the 1967
Middle East war. It insists that Jerusalem is its eternal and
indivisible capital, while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem to
be the capital of their future independent state.

"Based on a solid foundation and meeting each other's need very
well, the bilateral trade cooperation has a very broad prospect,"
Hu said at a banquet in his honor sponsored by the Thai business
circle and local Chinese community.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the two nations should explore new fields of
trade cooperation, and keep promoting the cooperation to a higher

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Waits for President's Answer on Interpellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- After refusing to answer the
parliament's interpellation, Indonesian President Abdurrachman
Wahid was strongly urged on Thursday by the House to give a clear
response over his decision in sacking two cabinet ministers in
April.
</P>
<P>
In a plenary session presided over by Speaker Akbar Tandjung,
the president said that the motion for interpellation is not
stipulated in the country's constitution and such a motion is
still questionable under the presidential system.
</P>
<P>
However Wahid's statement was unexpected and in turn it
triggered angry and disappointments among the parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Accusing him of arrogant and not cooperative, some
parliamentarians demand the President to apologize to the House or
facing another motion.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Law and Legal Affairs Yusril Ihza Mahendra said, "
It is true that our constitution does not stipulate motion for
interpellation. But it (the motion) is stipulated by the country's
parliament bill under which the House is allowed to file motion
for interpellation against the president over his policies."
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarian Ekky Syahruddin urged the President to
apologize to the parliament and the two ex- ministers, namely
Minister of Investment Laksamana Sukardi and Minister of Trade and
Industry Jusuf Kalla, he sacked in April. He said "after that we
finish our show down, and you will stay in office until 2004."
</P>
<P>
But if the president refuses to apologize he should be able to
provide evidences confirming that Sukardi and Kalla committed
corruption practices, he added.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Speaker of the House Akbar Tandjung said that the
House will wait for a comprehensive written answer from the
president by Friday afternoon at the latest.
</P>
<P>
"Just wait until tomorrow afternoon at the latest. And then we
will discuss again on what steps will be taken next. It depends (
on the president's response) tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
However, for the time being it seems that the show down between
Wahid and the parliament will not go to a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
"If the House does not satisfy with the response, we can file
another motion," Tandjung told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Laksamana Sukardi told reporters after attending the
session that, "I have pardoned the president. Now, I just want him
to make a clearance (that I didn't commit corruption practices).
But I am not expecting such position again (as a cabinet minister),
" he said.

"We will set new programs. And we will announce that by late

about the programs," Kwik told reporters without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the new programs will be outlined in the
third letter of intent (LoI) and will be signed by the government
and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have implemented all programs outlined in the second
LoI, we will go on to next program for the third LoI," he said,
adding that the government have hammered out a plan in meeting the
deadline set by the Fund for the programs' implementation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kwik said that Indonesia has made significant
achievement in realizing its economic recovery program, as the
country recorded an increase in its GDP by 3.21 percent in the
first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
But, it has to get around to some homework such as foreign debt
restructuring, and combating rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken 118 actions in connection with our economic
recovery program outlined in the letter of intent signed by the
government and the Fund," he said.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Diamond Dealer Arrested for Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Belgian judicial authorities in
Antwerp arrested a diamond dealer Wednesday for his connection
with a major case involving fraud with diamonds, local media
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The diamond dealer is suspected of having laundered 225 million
euros (about 209 million U.S. dollars). The police said most of
the laundered money came from other diamond dealers and possibly
also from drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
After the arrest, the police carried out house searches of the
man, who is a highly respected leading businessman in diamond
industry.
</P>
<P>
The authorities were tipped about the fraud by a woman, who is
former associate of the dealer. The woman was arrested earlier and
apparently ratted on the diamond dealer. She used to have an
illegal money exchange office and had processed money for the
dealer.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into the diamond fraud is part of a probe
into a fraudulent bankruptcy of a local bank called Max Fisher.
</P>
<P>
Antwerp, the northern port city of Belgium, is the largest
diamond processing and trade center in the world. The biennial
World Diamond Conference just concluded there Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Tracks Laid in China's Longest Railway Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The railing of the Mount Qing-1
Tunnel has been completed 18, as a crucial part of the Xi'an-
Ankang Railway Project, a state key project in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, 18.46 km in length, is the longest of its kind in
China and is dubbed as "the No.1 long tunnel in China". The 18.46-
km stainless tracks are also the longest of the kind in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The China No. One Railway Construction Bureau, the contractor,
spent three years designing special equipment for laying the long
rails in the tunnel which is composed of two parallel single-
tracked tunnels. With the equipment, the company laid a 250 m-long
track at once.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the successful track laying of the tunnel, the Xi'an-
Ankang Railway Project is expected to be completed in the middle
of this August, ahead of the time-table.

<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of State for Public Business Sector Mokhtar
Khatab said the sale of 135 public firms between 1992 and the end

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli settlers are continuing to prepare for attempts by
Palestinians to enter their communities en masse should the Camp
David summit fail to produce an accord.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli Army Radio, settlers from several
settlements met on Tuesday to discuss the issue. Moreover, settlers
in recent weeks received military instruction on how to respond if
faced with a mass of Palestinians at their gates. Some settlements
have begun self-defense courses for and provided weapons
instruction to their residents.
</P>
<P>
Israel Defense Forces has undergone intensive training in the
dispersal of demonstrations at settlements. A report noted that
unarmed troops will form a chain around the communities to prevent
the Palestinians from reaching entrances, but noted that snipers
would be deployed in the event there is an exchange of live fire or
the situation otherwise becomes life threatening.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton was continuing his efforts to
bring the Camp David summit Wednesday night (Israeli time) to a
successful conclusion and specifically to resolve the dispute over
Jerusalem, which triggered a crisis in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak sent a letter to
Clinton stating that he is leaving and pinning the blame for the
summit's failure squarely on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak ordered his plane readied for take-off at 8 p.m.,
Wednesday Washington time, but later delayed the departure.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The gap between the rich and the poor in Israel continues to
widen, according to the annual report of the State Revenues
Administration for 1999, released Wednesday by the Finance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
As of January this year, 1.1 million workers were earning not
more that NIS 3,000 (about 735 U.S. dollars) per month, 58 percent
less than the gross average monthly income of NIS 7,122 (about 1746
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli opposition Wednesday took advantage of the
disintegrating state of the coalition to inflict several stinging
defeats on the government's remaining supporter in the Knesset
(Parliament) over peace-related issues.
</P>
<P>
Two bills, sponsored by Likud legislators and approved in
preliminary reading by the Knesset, require the government to take
measures, such as annexing West Bank settlements and canceling Oslo
accords, in the event that the Palestinians unilaterally declare an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
Another two bills suggest any agreement that Prime Minister Ehud
Barak concludes with the Palestinians be subjected to a referendum
with stiff conditions, such as a special majority of registered
voters in a referendum, or 55 percent of referendum participants.

<HEADLINE> Hu: China's "West Campaign" Offers More Investment Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's west development campaign,
which is sure to create new room for the country's economy growth,
will also offer greater business opportunities to investors from
all over the world, visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"With abundant natural resources, comparatively low costs, huge
market potential, certain industry infrastructure and technology
forces, the vast west region of China will become the new favorite
of the foreign investors," Hu said at a great banquet sponsored by
Thai business circle and local Chinese community in his honor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, "the Chinese government will give greater
support to the west region and ease the limits for foreign
investments there, while carrying out a package of simulative
policy of finance, taxation foreign investment and trade, human
resource, technology and education."
</P>
<P>
"Together, all these factors will create a more favorable
environment for foreign businessmen to invest in China's west
region," Hu remarked.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the accelerating of China's "west campaign"
is a significant and strategic decision made by the Chinese
government in the new century.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming five to ten years, we will further boost this
grand and tough project, focusing on environment protection and
construction, adjustment of industry structure, and development of
technology and education," the Chinese vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the current economic situation in China, he said,
"the country is now following the right path of development, after
it shook off the bad effect of the Asian crisis."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government made great contributions
to solving the crisis and stabilizing the Asian economy by
sticking to the non-depreciation policy of its currency.
</P>
<P>
"During the past three years, the government has been taking a
series of methods to stimulate internal demand, keeping the annual
economic growth rate above 7 percent," he stated.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy witnessed a 8.2-percent growth in the first
half of this year, showing a strong recovery, he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
"While China enjoys the rights as a WTO member, it will fulfill
its responsibilities according to the rules of WTO. This means it
will offer more opportunities for foreign firms to develop in the
Chinese market," said Hu, who began his five-day official visit to
Thailand on July 18.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet in his honor sponsored by the Thai
business circle and local Chinese community, Hu said China is
revising and perfecting concerned laws and rules to ensure that
the national and foreign firms do business under a less-limited,
standard and transparent legal framework.
</P>
<P>
"China's entry into the WTO is not only a result of development
of the reform and opening-up process, but also a necessary choice
for the country to actively catch up with the globalization trend,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that the entry will see China's integration into
the world economy in a wider scope, more comprehensive fields and
on a higher level.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Customs Sees More Newsprint Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 12,800 tons of
imported newsprint entered the Chinese market through the Shanghai
Customs in the first half of the year, compared with less than 10,
000 tons a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials attributed the increase to the growing demand
in the Chinese market and the unsatisfactory quality of domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Newsprint imports passing through Shanghai Customs have
declined sharply since China started to impose antidumping duties
on newsprint from Canada, the United States, and the Republic of
Korea in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Imports of newsprint through Shanghai Customs stood at 27,000
tons in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Russia has become the major source of China's newsprint import
this year. In the first six months, imports of Russian newsprint
were valued at 5.88 million U.S. dollars, 16.8 times the figure
for the corresponding period last year. Russian newsprint also
accounted for 86 percent of the total newsprint imports Shanghai
Customs registered in the half-year period.

<HEADLINE> Seven Malaysians Still in Armed Abductors' Hand in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The remaining 7 Malaysian
hostages held by armed abductors in Jolo in Southern Philippines
have not been released, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid
Albar said Thursday dismissing Wednesday's media reports of their
release.
</P>
<P>
"What we gathered from the latest development there is that
none of the remaining Malaysian hostages have been released," Syed
Hamid told reporters at Parliament House lobby here.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is still negotiating with the armed
group for the release of all the remaining hostages -- the seven
Malaysians, two Germans, two French nationals, two Finns, two
South Africans, two Filipinos and a Lebanese woman.
</P>
<P>
"The moment we know positively that they have been released
from Jolo, they (the Malaysian hostages) will be taken home at the
earliest possible time. But for the time being there is no
information saying they have been released," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the foreign media reports about the release of
the Malaysian hostages were merely based on speculation.
</P>
<P>
Securing the release of the remaining hostages is of uppermost
importance for the good of countries in the region, he said,
adding "The task is not an easy one but we'll not spare any effort
to reach that objective."
</P>
<P>
Denying foreign media reports that Malaysia paid a ransom to
get all the Malaysian hostages freed, the minister said, "I can
only say that the Malaysian government will not pay any ransom and
we are not involved in any payment of ransom money for the release
of all the hostages. That's the Malaysian government's stand and
it remains so."
</P>
<P>
The armed group kidnapped 21 people from Sipadan Island off
Sabah, East Malaysia on April 23 and brought them by boat to their
hideout in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
They have so far released two Malaysians and a German woman
from among the hostages.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Expands in First Half of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, TDB said the trade is projected to expand by 15
percent to 17 percent this year on expected better domestic and
worldwide economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX), powered by
favorable product and market factors, went up 11.6 percent in the
first half of 2000, following the 15.2 percent expansion in the
second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's NODX to Asian economies registered double-digit
growth, while that to the United States and the European Union
declined by 0.4 percent and 10.4 percent respectively, affected
mainly by the contractions of exports of disk drives and PCBAs (
Printed Circuit Board, Assembled).
</P>
<P>
On a three-month basis, Singapore's total trade saw a hefty
growth of 20.8 percent in June, boosted by growing global demand
for electronic products and continued strong demand from Asian
economies, according to TDB statistics.

Robertson, who arrived in Sarajevo Tuesday for a visit, asked
the Bosnian government to honor its commitment of a 15-percent

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Sector Rises Over First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The index of the real estate
sector rose by 0.48 points over the year-ago period to 102.69
points in June, registering the first year-on-year rise over the
past 11 months.
</P>
<P>
Figures released today by the National Bureau of Statistics (
NBS) show the June index was also 0.49 points higher than in May.
</P>
<P>
Over the first half of this year, the Chinese government's
policies to reform the housing system and encourage construction
of housing for low-income persons began to take effect. The real
estate sector saw increasing investment, improving cash supply,
growing land development areas and accelerating growth of the
areas of newly-started and just-completed housing.
</P>
<P>
Housing prices were on the rise during the period as the demand
for apartments surged.
</P>
<P>
NBS said that the resurgence of real estate development and
fast growth of investment are the major factors that nudged the
industry forward.
</P>
<P>
The area of unsold housing was 81.15 million square meters by
the end of June, increasing 17.7 percent over the same period of
last year. The growth rate was much lower than that for the first
half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
NBS predicts that the real estate sector will continue to
improve in the latter half of the year. However, it said that
investment in real estate development is likely to fall and that
the index of the real estate sector will remain in a promising
zone.
</P>
<P>
NBS figures show that sub-indices of capital supply, newly-
completed areas, development areas, income from land transfer,
real estate investment and newly-started areas improved in June.
Meanwhile, the sub-indices of housing prices and unsold housing
declined.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the average price of apartments was 2,074
yuan per square meter, 1.2 percent higher than a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Soldier's Website Gets Hundreds of Thousands of Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- It didn't take hundreds of
thousands of dollars in advertising to get as many hits on a
website dedicated to a socialist hero.
</P>
<P>
While more than 2,300 messages have been sent to leifeng.com by
netizens, 1,000 of which came from international web surfers since
the site officially opened on March 5 last year, the site's
operators figure mega-thousands of others have logged on
anonymously, Workers' Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng was a truck driver with the PLA's (People's Liberation
Army) Shenyang Military Area Command, stationed in northeast China
's Liaoning Province, who gained fame in China for his social
conscience.
</P>
<P>
After his tragic death in 1962 at age 22, he was held up as a
model of the new socialist man: selfless and thrifty. His life
story was published across the country.
</P>
<P>
One Japanese web message reads, "We cannot resist the charm of
Lei Feng's quality, which is a priceless treasure belonging to the
whole world."
</P>
<P>
An international student in Shanghai's Fudan University said
that he liked the website very much. "I'm so impressed by his good
deeds, and I hope there will be more Lei Fengs in the world," he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Lei Feng is the only hero in China who has been honored with
inscriptions from New China's three generations of leaders," said
Tian Jingxiang, deputy director of the city People's Congress of
Fushun, where Lei Feng was stationed as a soldier.
</P>
<P>
A 1998 national survey of adults in major cities showed that
Lei Feng was one of China's top three heroes after Chinese leaders
Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
In 1963 Mao Zedong wrote an inscription urging the whole
country to "Learn From Comrade Lei Feng." Deng Xiaoping and Jiang
Zemin, top Chinese leaders after Mao, wrote their inscriptions in
the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
China has set March 5 as Lei Feng Day since Mao's inscription.
On this year's honorary day, the website invited one of Lei Feng's
fellow soldiers, whose story was portrayed in a 1997 Chinese
blockbuster film, to talk with web surfers. An estimated 320,000
people visited the site.

<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Any middle and primary schools
which overcharge students for their school fees face heavy
punishment, according to a recent circular issued by the Ministry
of Education.
</P>
<P>
The circular points out that overcharging is still a major
problem faced by middle and primary school students, and is a
problem that educational departments in provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities must solve this year.
</P>
<P>
It asks educational departments to rectify situations of
illegal fee charging during the nine year compulsory education
period and overcharging tuition from students who are attending
schools outside their enrollment district.
</P>
<P>
Local educational departments should keep tabs on unlawful
tuition charges in rural areas, and help lighten the homework
burden of middle and primary school students, says the circular.
</P>
<P>
It added that primary and middle schools in all municipalities
and provinces should stop enrolling students from outside their
authorized districts within the next three years.

<P>
BAGHDAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Britain have
put on hold 10 more contracts that Iraq signed with foreign
countries under the sixth and seventh phases of the U.N. oil-for-
food program, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a trade ministry official, the INA said that the U.S. and
British delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee shelved these
contracts for Iraq to import food, medicine and oil spare parts
within the framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
These contracts were signed between Iraq and Egyptian, Syrian,
French, Italian and British companies, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
The trade ministry announced on July 9 that a total of 1,989
contracts had been blocked because of obstacles set by the U.S. and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. statistics released in April, the U.S. and
Britain had blocked contracts worth over 3 billion U.S. dollars for
Iraq to buy daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly condemned the acts of the U.S. and British
delegates who represent their governments' "hostile policy" towards
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions ever since its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait, but the U.N. oil-for-food deal launched in 1996
allows Baghdad to export crude oil in return for U.N.-supervised
imports of humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says the decade-old sanctions have claimed the lives of
over 1.3 million people, causing a humanitarian crisis in the
country.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sends Strong Message to Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
summoned Fijian High Commissioner to New Zealand Isimeli Bainimara
here Thursday to formally express its condemnation of events in
the island nation, according to a media statement of New Zealand
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Phil Goff.
</P>
<P>
It followed Wednesday's announcement of further measures
against the troubled country, with 41 Fijian military personnel to
be sent home from New Zealand and an extension of a ban on
sporting contacts.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Fiji's top diplomatic representative,
Goff said his country is appalled at the damage Fiji is not just
doing to itself but to the region, and Fiji's crisis is harming
the reputation of the entire South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"The wider international community today sees the region as
being one of instability and insecurity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the friendly relationship between New
Zealand and Fiji is "destined to become cool and distant."
</P>
<P>
His comments echoes earlier statements from New Zealand Prime
Minister Helen Clark that a normal relationship can be re-
established only when there are firm indications that Fiji is on a
road back to democratic processes and a non-racist constitution.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Bainimara told reporters that the message
delivered to him by the New Zealand government is a "strong one",
and he will convey it to his country's president.
</P>
<P>
But, he said he is sure the relationship between the two
countries can be repaired.
</P>
<P>
According to Television NZ, New Zealand High commissioner to

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Dollar Creeps Towards Historic Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar has
devalued by more than four percent in the past month and is now
within striking range of its historical low of 43.5 cents of the U.
S. dollar established in March, 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Television New Zealand reported Thursday that at 11 am the
New Zealand currency was down to 45.56 cents of the U.S. dollar on
the wholesale market, or 2.2 cents of the U.S. dollar below its
value just a month ago, while the retail banks were offering just
44.95 cents of the U.S. dollar for every New Zealand dollar.
</P>
<P>
Chief Economist Brendan O'Donovan of the National Bank was
quoted as saying the weak currency is the result of poor
indicators for the New Zealand economy.
</P>
<P>
Currency values are being driven by growth differentials around
the world, and New Zealand's growth figures for the second and
third quarters of the year are expected to be weak, according to
the economist.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Confiscates Soeharto's Asset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia's Attorney General
Office (AGO) Thursday morning confiscated former president
Soeharto's villa and his 8,120 square meters property at Mega
Mendung district in Bogor, West Java, an AGO senior official
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
A investigation team of the AGO started the confiscating action
at 9:00 a.m. local time, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman told
newsmen at the parliamentary building.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision to seize the "Granadi Building", one of
Soeharto's assets which is located in Kuningan District, South
Jakarta, are considering.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the AGO Yushar Yahya said on Wednesday that the "
Granadi Building" would be seized on Thursday as a follow up made
by the AGO in settling the corruption cases which allegedly
committed by Soeharto during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chief of the information section at the AGO
Yushariayah also confirmed the seizure of Soeharto's villa. The
villa and the property are suspected to have been bought using a
foundation's money, he added.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was the first move made by the AGO against the
former strong man in its bid to bring the 79-year old man to court.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the South Jakarta District Court has endorsed seizure
by the AGO of the assets belonging to seven charity foundations
set up and chaired by Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto is suspected of abusing of power and authority during
his 32-years in power. He has been put under house arrest and has
undergone several investigations by prosecutors from the AGO.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said the AGO will bring the former president to court
before the holding of the general session of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) on August 7.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Apple Unveils New iMacs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer unleashed a
slew of new products Wednesday, including four upgraded versions
of its popular iMac personal computer, according to a news release
from the company.
</P>
<P>
At the MacWorld tradeshow in New York City, Apple CEO Steve
Jobs demonstrated an upgraded PowerMac professional computer, the
G4, which is used by many designers. The G4s feature dual 500 MHz
processors in a "velocity engine." Each processor is capable of
transmitting 3.5 gigaflops per second or can execute 3.5 billion
instructions per second.
</P>
<P>
The power is equivalent to 2 gigahertz in an Intel Pentium III
chip, which is not due to come to market for another 12-to-18
months.
</P>
<P>
"These are the first personal computers in history with dual
processors," said Jobs. "This is the kind of stuff many of our
customers do every day and this can save them an hour or two each
day."
</P>
<P>
Using the design software PhotoShop, Jobs demonstrated the
speed of the dual processors to open a file featuring a poster
from the movie "Inspector Gadget." Jobs also demonstrated the same
application using a Pentium III chip on a PC. It took the G4 60
seconds to complete the task, versus 124 seconds for the Pentium.
</P>
<P>
Apple experts said the new G4s are available in three models,
with the entry level computer containing one processor with 400
MHz, the second model featuring two processors with 450 MHz, and
the top of the line version containing the dual processors at 500
MHz.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the G4s will feature an added gigabyte ethernet on
the motherboard to speed applications and provide more bandwidth
storage. The feature usually costs 1,000 dollars as an upgrade,
Jobs said, and now is standard on the machines.
</P>
<P>
Jobs also previewed four new models of iMac consumer computers,
its third generation. The models are priced from 799 dollars for
an entry-level version up to 1,499 dollars for what Jobs said is
the "ultimate iMac," the iMac DVD Special Edition, which features
more speed, added disc space, a DVD slot drive, and iMovie video
software for making movies from the desktop.
</P>
<P>
Jobs unveiled a newly designed mouse and keyboard that are more
user friendly than previous models. Both will retail for 59
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
"Some people didn't like the old mouse. We have many faults,
but we listen. We are moving from what some people called the
worst mouse to the best mouse in the industry," said Jobs.
</P>
<P>
The previous version of Apple's mouse was round in shape and
some users complained that it was difficult to use. The new mouse
is oval and features optical tracking technology, which means it
has no moving parts. There is no mouse button and the entire
surface of the top of the mouse responds to finger pressure, so no
mouse pad is needed.
</P>
<P>
Both the mouse and keyboard updates will initially retail as
upgrades through the Apple store and will also be included as
standard features on new computers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the new product line is likely to boost revenues
in coming quarters. The company's current fiscal fourth quarter
and first quarter traditionally benefit from back-to-school and
holiday sales.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Co. Reports Better-Than-Expected Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the world's
largest aircraft maker, easily soared above Wall Street's second-
quarter earnings expectations Wednesday, as the company reported
25 percent increase in profit for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based company earned 654 million U.S. dollars, or
75 cents per share, before a non-recurring charge related to the
incurred costs of the planned demonstration launch of a Delta III
rocket next month, according to a news release from the company.
</P>
<P>
That marked a 25-percent increase from the 520 million dollars,
or 56 cents per share, the company earned during the comparable
period last year. Analysts polled by earnings research firm First
Call Corp. projected the company would earn 66 cents per share
before charges.
</P>
<P>
Initial response by the analysts to the earnings report was
favorable. They said the figures showed the company was sticking
to its plan to boost profits by cutting costs, shedding
underperforming units and avoiding a price war with rival Airbus
Industries.
</P>
<P>
"We've been positive on the company and this just reinforces
that," said analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.
</P>
<P>
Overall revenue for the quarter actually fell for the second
consecutive quarter, declining 2 percent to 14.8 billion dollars.
The drop reflected a decrease in commercial airplane revenue,
although the profit margin for that segment more than doubled
during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's delivery of commercial airplanes still remains about
23 percent behind last year's pace, the result of a 40-day
engineering strike during the first quarter. But the company
registered about 200 new orders during the quarter, and company
officials now believe their production operations are back on
track.
</P>
<P>
"The company's outlook reflects the strength of the commercial
airplane market and our continuing overall improved performance,"
said Phil Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive in a
prepared statement. "Commercial airplane demand appears stable and
we anticipate 2002 deliveries to look similar to 2001."
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Boeing raised its full-year revenue
projection to 51 billion dollars from 50 billion dollars and
boosted its cash flow expectation to between 3 billion dollars and
4 billion dollars from the 2.5 billion dollars it originally
forecast.
</P>
<P>
Should it hit that revenue target, Boeing would still fall
below the 58 billion dollars in sales it generated last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China witnessed a rapid increase
of online bookstores in the first half this year, with the number
of them topping 300 at the end of June, up more than 250 percent
from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Online bookstore has become one of the most distinctive and
active part of China's e-commerce, recording 30 million yuan in B
to C (business to consumer) transactions and eight million yuan in
B to B (business to business) transactions, respectively.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that the number of online bookstores
differs from region to region because of imbalanced economic
development. North China takes the lead in both the number and
quality of online bookstores, followed by south and east China.
</P>
<P>
The survey reveals that nearly 70 percent of the bookstores
provide online sales of various kinds of books and audio and video
products, while some 30 percent of them deal in books of a
specific field.
</P>
<P>
Most of the online bookstores sell 10,000 to 50,000 kinds of
books, and only six percent can provide 100,000 kinds. About 80
percent of them are engaged in B to C business, and about four
percent handles B to B business, with the rest of them adopting
both B to C and B to B modes in their business.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, Tibet Trade Suspended Due to New Trading System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The trade between Nepal and
Tibet, an autonomous region of China, has come to a complete halt
following the enforcement of a decision by the Nepali government
to channel the trade through banking system as per the new budget
beginning on July 16.
</P>
<P>
Import from Tatopani Customs, the main gateway for the Trans-
Himalayan trade, has remained standstill since July 16, custom
chief Bharat Subedi told the press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Beginning some 500 years ago, Nepal's trade with Tibet
withstood all the evolution of modern trade practices and was
based mainly on barter system. The Nepali government decided to
channel the trade through banking system following a mounting
pressure especially from local industries.
</P>
<P>
However, Trans-Himalayan Trade Association had objected the
provision from the very first day of its announcement, saying it
was impractical and favored the interest of a few big importers.
</P>
<P>
Besides, opening Letter of Credit is totally new to the
businessmen involved in the trade with Tibet and the government
should assure them such trading will be free of hassles, the
association contended.
</P>
<P>
Subedi said, however, the confusion is only transitional and it
will be over within a few days.
</P>
<P>
"Once they become accustomed to the new system, they will find
no reason to shy away from it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Subedi also said that special arrangements have been made to
address the problems of the small importers.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen who confine their business within 30 km of the
border and import goods worth less than 16,000 rupees (230 U.S.
dollars) can bypass the banking channel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 Nepali businessmen are now involved in the import-
export trade with Tibet and contribute over 1 billion rupees (14.3
million U.S. dollars) in revenue to the state coffers.

<HEADLINE> New Rules Imposed on Foreign Banks Operating in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Commercial Banks (FCBs)
operating in Bangladesh will have to ensure at least 10 million U.
S. dollars paid-up capital each by August 31 this year, The Daily
Star quoted a circular of Bangladesh Bank as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rules imposed on the existing FCBs and the
future ones in the country, it will be mandatory for the FCBs to
have at least one Bangladeshi national among the top three
executives. All other employees and executives must be locally
recruited.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the central Bangladesh Bank has imposed that
the FCBs will have to provide industrial and agricultural loans
alongside their engagements in trade financing.
</P>
<P>
Banking resources told the newspaper that of the 13 FCBs now
operating in the country, about five have the required 10 million
dollars paid-up capital. The rest will have to pump in fresh funds
to build their capacity.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a number of FCBs will have to get rid of
their expatriates from the top level.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Bank also slapped a number of preconditions for
giving permission to any foreign bank to operate in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Any foreign bank vying to open up branches in the country must
be financially solvent and have good reputation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country's business relation with the
country in which the foreign bank is incorporated, the volume of
trade and future scope will also be taken into consideration for
giving licenses, the sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
When a new foreign bank applies for permission, the Bangladesh
Bank will also look into the possibility of setting up branches of
local banks in the country in which the FCB is incorporated.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Behind Advanced Countries in Internet Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean internet industry has
been fallen three to five years behind advanced countries', said
the Korean Development Bank Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a report on the competitiveness of South Korean internet
industry, the state-run bank said the level of access services
which get on the internet is almost the same with advanced nations
like the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, when it comes to electronic commerce and protection of
private information on the internet, South Korea falls some three
to five years behind.
</P>
<P>
In terms of technology for network equipment, South Korea is
lagging about two years behind.
</P>
<P>
The process of installing superhigh-speed internet networks and
other related infrastructure will be necessary for South Korea to
catch up with advance nations, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, the vitalization of the internet industry
will bring about a recession for the print, postal and the paper
making industries while the education sector, the banking industry
and large-scale distribution networks will have to undergo drastic
restructuring to adapt to changes in the market.
</P>
<P>
But, the electronic commerce and information and communication
services will be thriving in the years to come, said the state-run
bank in the report.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 30 Plus in U.S. Southern Heatwave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Death toll rose to more than
30 in the southern region of the United States this year due to
heatwave, according to reports reaching here late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Texas alone, at least 19 people, most of them elderly, have
died because of the heat. In Alabama, state officials said 10
deaths were caused by the heat. In Louisiana, seven deaths were
being investigated as possibly heat-related.
</P>
<P>
A heat advisory was in effect for the entire southern region.
High temperatures were blamed for grass fires and withered crops,
while an increasing number of patients were sent to local
hospitals with heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
Two elderly women were found dead Wednesday in their Ruston,
Louisiana, home. Another elderly man in the house was in critical
condition with severe brain trauma, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the heatwave victims have been elderly people who
either had no air conditioners or did not use them, possibly
because of concerns over high electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
In addition, temperatures across the Southwest were heating up
as well. In Phoenix, Arizona, a temperature as high as 112 degrees
Fahrenheit (about 44.4 degrees centigrade) merged on Wednesday,
above its normal peak of 105 degrees (about 40.5 degrees
centigrade) at this time each year.
</P>
<P>
The intense heat drained water and electricity supplies across
the southern and southwest region. More than 120 Texas cities had
to impose water restrictions, while many Southern Californian
cities urged residents to limit electricity consumption.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian swimming star Ian
Thorpe on Thursday volunteered to be blood tested before the
Sydney Olympic Games and agreed to publicly release results of his
urine tests.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Sydney, he said he wanted to submit a
blood sample for performance-enhancing drugs that cannot be
detected by conventional methods.
</P>
<P>
The sample could be frozen then re-examined once a suitable
test had been found, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It's very frustrating for all the clean athletes in the world
that we don't have a way to prove we're innocent," Thorpe told a
news conference on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"So I want to volunteer to be the first athlete to undergo a
blood test. I know the testing procedure isn't quite ready yet but
I'm happy to do it."
</P>
<P>
Thorpe also signed a document, or "passport", giving permission
for the Australian Sports Drug Agency to publicly release details
of his past and future drugs tests.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Growth Rate for 2000 Revised up to 7.8 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Institute of
Economic Research (MIER) has revised upwards Malaysia's growth
rate for this year to 7.8 percent against its earlier forecast of
6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The upward revision for the whole year stemmed from a rapid GDP
growth of 11.7 percent in the first quarter and an estimated 9.0
percent growth in the second quarter, and also from a projected 5.
3 percent GDP growth in the second half of this year, MIER
Executive Director Mohamed Ariff said at MIER's 15th national
economic briefing here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the drivers of the economic rebound would be
from increased exports of semi-conductors to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ariff said that the inflation rate would be 3.0 or 4.0 percent
this year and would be in excess of 4.0 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Suggesting that the ringgit (pegged at 3.8 to a U.S. dollar) be
revalued closer to market value for the move would ensure that
economic losses resulting from the disparity would be minimized,
he said it is better for the ringgit to be re-pegged sooner or
later because the local currency is still undervalued by six
percent from more than 10 percent earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's fixed exchange rate has also brought some
concerns on the absence of major inflows of long term capital
though the system has helped to improve short term capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
He said MIER is not supportive of a free-float system for the
ringgit because it is risky to manage the local currency in this
manner.
</P>
<P>
A free-float system would also not enable a fair value of the
banking system, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Refuses to Answer Parliamentary Interpellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government here
Thursday refused to answer the interpellation issued by the House
of Representatives (DPR) over the reasons for the president to
sack two ex-ministers in April.
</P>
<P>
At a DPR's session held Thursday morning which was attended by
President Abdurrahman Wahid and Vice-President Megawati
Soekarnoputri as well as some cabinet ministers, State Secretary
Johan Effendy said the dismission of the two ministers was a
political decision and it is not necessary to explain the reasons
to the DPR according to the Institution passed in 1945.
</P>
<P>
When reading a written statement prepared by the government,
the state secretary said that two months ago the president had met
with the leadership of the DPR and answered the questions over the
same issue.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two sides had agreed to keep the secret
about the result of the meeting, so it is not necessary to answer
the question again.
</P>
<P>
However, result of the closed-Door meeting was let out. The
president said at the meeting that the two ministers were involved
in corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
Since the two ministers -- Investment Minister Laksamana
Sukardi from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P)
and Trade Minister Yusuf Kalla from the Golkar Party -- were
replaced, most DPR members have criticized the president's move
and launched the interpellation motion.
</P>
<P>
Before the state secretary read out the statement, Wahid said
that he hoped for all institutions in the country, including the
government and the DPR, to respect each other.

<HEADLINE> Camp David Summit Breaks Down, But Hope Lingers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Three-way summit at Camp
David, Maryland, on the Israeli-Palestinian peace concluded on
Wednesday night without reaching any agreement, but a last hope
has not fizzled out.
</P>
<P>
Despite the failure, officials from the Palestinian and
Israeli delegations said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will remain in Washington for a
last possible revival of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian Liberation Organization
representative in Washington, told reporters that "There are
efforts to resume and negotiations," and "Arafat is staying."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Israeli official told reporters in Frederich,
Maryland, where Israeli officials are staying, that "Israelis are
staying to continue the talks."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House spokesman Joe Lockhard announced that "
The summit has come to a conclusion without reaching an agreement.
"
</P>
<P>
White House National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley
told reporters at the press center in Thurmont near Camp David
that Clinton had tried in vain for several hours to strike a last-
minute deal.
</P>
<P>
"For the last three hours the president has been shuttling
between the two leaders (Barak and Arafat) but unfortunately was
unable to come to an agreement," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian sources had earlier voiced
pessimism that an overall settlement could be reached overnight,
particularly on the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Lockhart said Clinton had explored every avenue in the
search for an agreement for peace.
</P>
<P>
"The last 24 hours have involved very intensive discussions at
the leader level, at the negotiator level, between the teams,
within the teams," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton had telephoned four or five Middle East leaders
during the afternoon to brief them on the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, "to give them some sense of where we are ... in this
process."
</P>
<P>
Clinton will return to the White House at about 00:30 a.m. ET (
0430 GMT), and will leave immediately for Okinawa, Japan, to
attend G8 summit, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials blamed each other on
Wednesday for the failure of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said that "Israeli intransigence is behind the failure
of the summit, as well as Israeli rejection of international laws
which form the basis of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"The man who bears responsibility for this failure is Barak who
abandoned the basis of the peace process and international
legitimacy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Barak "behaved with the mentality of (Jewish) settlers," on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, he said after the White House announced
the failure of nine-day Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli source put the blame on Arafat. He quoted Barak's
letter released earlier on Wednesday as saying that the
Palestinian leader did not negotiate in good faith. He said Barak
was expected to hold a news conference before leaving for home.
</P>
<P>
The source said that shortly before the White House
announcement of the failure, there had been a U.S. proposal for a
partial deal excluding the thorniest issue of Jerusalem, which,
however, was not accepted by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> New Device Developed to Diagnose Spine Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has developed a new
computer device to help doctors easily diagnose spine cancer,
Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the help of Seoul National University, Chungnam National
University and Georgetown University of the U.S., the KAIST has
successfully developed a three-dimensional computer devise, with
which doctors can easily check out spine cancer.
</P>
<P>
The device adopts three-dimensional graphic technology to
provide vivid images of spines when a doctor injects a testing
needle into the spine of a manikin, said KAIST.
</P>
<P>
Operators of the machine can feel as if they were injecting the
needle into the spine of a patient because the machine can produce
resistance of the needle against the spine.
</P>
<P>
The new device can also help hospitals and clinics save money
to train doctors to master the skill, because it only requires
time-consuming efforts for doctors to master the skill, said the
KAIST.

<HEADLINE> Camp David Summit Breaks Down, But With Hope Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Three-way summit at Camp
David, Maryland, on the Israeli-Palestinian peace concluded on
Wednesday night without reaching any agreement, but a last hope
has not fizzled out.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton told reporters Thursday that gaps remain
substantial between Israelis and the Palestinians on a peace
agreement, but he said there has been progress.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat will remain at Camp David for more talks
while he travels to Japan for G8 summit in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Clinton described the talks as "the most comprehensive and
thorough negotiations ever between Palestinians and Israelis on
the core issues of their conflict."
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wanted to give up ... and I didn't think we should give
up," he said.
</P>
<P>
"After a round of intensive consultations this evening, the
parties agreed to say at Camp David while I go to Okinawa (to
attend G-8 summit)," he said, adding "Secretary (of State
Madeleine) Albright will try to close the gaps."
</P>
<P>
"There should be no limit to the effort we are prepared to make,
" he continued.
</P>
<P>
"The two parties have been making an intense effort to resolve
their difficulties," said Clinton who is scheduled to return from
Okinawa on July 23.
</P>
<P>
He said he would assess the status of the continued talks after
he return.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House spokesman Joe Lockhard announced that "The
summit has come to a conclusion without reaching an agreement."
</P>
<P>
White House National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley
told reporters at the press center in Thurmont near Camp David
that Clinton had tried in vain for several hours to strike a last-
minute deal.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian sources had earlier voiced
pessimism that an overall settlement could be reached overnight,
particularly on the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The last 24 hours have involved very intensive discussions at
the leader level, at the negotiator level, between the teams,
within the teams," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton had telephoned four or five Middle East leaders
during the afternoon to brief them on the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, "to give them some sense of where we are ... in this
process."
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials blamed each other on
Wednesday for the failure of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said that "Israeli intransigence is behind the failure
of the summit, as well as Israeli rejection of international laws
which form the basis of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"The man who bears responsibility for this failure is Barak who
abandoned the basis of the peace process and international
legitimacy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Barak "behaved with the mentality of (Jewish) settlers," on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, he said after the White House announced
the failure of nine-day Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli source put the blame on Arafat. He quoted Barak's
letter released earlier on Wednesday as saying that the
Palestinian leader did not negotiate in good faith. He said Barak
was expected to hold a news conference before leaving for home.
</P>
<P>
The source said that shortly before the White House
announcement of the failure, there had been a U.S. proposal for a
partial deal excluding the thorniest issue of Jerusalem, which,
however, was not accepted by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Watt Dropped by Australian Cycling Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Dual Olympic medallist Kathy Watt
will not compete for Australia in the Sydney Games, according to
the Australian cycling list released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cycling Australia said Watt had appealed her non-selection and
an independent hearing would be held within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Watt became Australia's first women's Olympic cycling medalist
when she won gold in the individual road race and silver in the 3,
000m Individual Pursuit track race at Barcelona in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Twenty year-old Alayna Burns, was selected to ride the
individual pursuit and points race. The Australian women's track
team consists of Alayna Burns, sprinters Michelle Ferris and
Lyndelle Higginson.
</P>
<P>
Cycling Australia president Ray Godkin said selectors were
unable to decide which four riders would make up the men's sprint
group, and he added that more time was needed to decide the final
four men.
</P>
<P>
The men's sprint training squad includes Shane Kelly, Darryn
Hill, Gary Neiwand, Ben Kersten, Sean Eadie and Jobie Dajka.
</P>
<P>
It is no doubt that former 1,000m time trial world record
holder and triple world champion Kelly's will be among the final
four, and that would leave the five other riders competing for the
three remaining places on the team.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Struggle to Beat Peru in World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Argentine-based striker Juan Pablo
Angel scored the only goal as Columbia struggled to beat Peru 1-0
in a World Cup qualifier here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Columbia secured the winner against the run of the play in the
48th minute when Angel turned inside a defender and placed his
shot beyond Peru goalkeeper Johnny Vegas.
</P>
<P>
The result was a huge disappointment for Peru, who attacked
throughout and hit the crossbar twice.
</P>
<P>
Colombia moved onto eight points from five games in the South
American group while Peru's third successive defeat left them on
four points and greatly reduced their chances of a first World Cup
appearance since 1982.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Beat Ecuador 2-0 in South American World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Argentina, despite being hit
by the absence of Gabriel Batistuta, maintained their unbeaten
record by beating Ecuador 2-0 in the South American World Cup
qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Hernan Crespo, replacing the injured Batistuta,gave Argentina a
first-half lead with a  header in 23rd minute and his striking
partner Claudio Lopez scored the second early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The two-time world champions dominated the whole match after
the kickoff and created a lot of chances.
</P>
<P>
But the game was stained by some controversial refereeing
decisions, particularly an astonishing penalty awarded to
Argentina in the second minute. Yet Juan Sebastian Veron missed
the undeserved penalty.
</P>
<P>
The free kick from which the incident arose also appeared to
have wrongly awarded foul on Ortega, who again threw himself to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in three home games that Argentina were
given a penalty for a clear dive by Ortega. The first, against
Chile, was converted.
</P>
<P>
Referee Daniel Bello also failed to send off Argentina defender
Roberto Ayala for a two-footed challenge that resulted in Alex
Aguinaga being carried off on a stretcher late in the game. Ayala
did not even receive a yellow card.
</P>
<P>
The win gave Argentina a maximum 15 points from five games
while Ecuador remained on six points.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Makes Efforts for Employment Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is making efforts for the
settlement of employment of people in the country as part of its
endeavors in developing human resources for national construction.
</P>
<P>
As for inland employment settlement, Myanmar has opened 79
labor offices throughout the country, undertaking systematic
registration of the people who seek employment.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Labor of Myanmar, out of the
total of over 273,000 employment seekers registered annually, only
14,000 persons were employed in the Yangon division through the
labor offices, while 26,000 others were absorbed in other
townships in the country.
</P>
<P>
As for foreign employment settlement (FES), a state
organization of FES was formed in 1990 to facilitate overseas
employers who wish to directly appoint Myanmar workers abroad. The
organization works in collaboration with all private employment
agencies both internal and external.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Myanmar Facts and Figures", a booklet
currently published by the Ministry of Information, the dispatch
of Myanmar workers abroad is made on the basis of contracts for a
prescribed limited period.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar workers are sent abroad not only to earn foreign
exchange, but upon their return they are to participate as
qualified skilled workers in national construction with expertise
and technical know-how from experience gained abroad, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a latest official report also said, a total of 130
skilled Myanmar workers are to be sent soon to work in Singapore,
Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates under the arrangement of the
country's labor department and the overseas employment company.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 3,915 Myanmar
workers have been sent abroad for employment in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
In July 1999, Myanmar enacted its first ever law relating to
overseas employment. The law empowers the Overseas Employment
Central Committee to lay down related policies for recruitment and
selection of workers for such employment.
</P>
<P>
Besides, according to a regulation issued in March this year,
Myanmar overseas employees shall have to pay income tax of 10
percent and remit 50 percent of their wages received abroad to
their families at home.

<HEADLINE> All-Party Talks on New Constitution to Be Held in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga will hold all-party talks next Tuesday (July 25) to
finalize the proposed new constitution which is due to be tabled
before the parliament in early August, The Island newspaper
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga for the first time will meet delegations
from the ruling People's Alliance, the main opposition United
National Party (UNP) and the Tamil parties together, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga struck consensus with the UNP on the proposed
constitutional reforms in early July after four months of arduous
bipartisan talks, but divergence remains in issues of the
Executive Presidency and the practical implementation of the
reforms. Kumaratunga wants to keep the Executive Presidency in a
transitional period extending to the end of her second six-year
presidential term in 2005, but the UNP wanted a shorter time frame.
</P>
<P>
Before the all-party talks, Kumaratunga will meet the UNP on
Friday for plenary sessions of the talks she has held with the UNP
on the divergent issues.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the issue of Buddhism to be included in
Chapter One of the new constitution will also be given priority at
Friday's talks.
</P>
<P>
Influential Buddhist clergy in this predominantly Buddhist
country protested against the removal of an article in the draft
constitution which grants the foremost place to Buddhism and
ensures its protection, accusing the government and UNP of doing
so to pacify the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the mainstream Tamil political parties who have also
been invited for the joint talks on July 25 have expressed their
displeasure that their proposal for a federalism had been ignored.
They are likely to raise the issue at the all party talks.
</P>
<P>
The issue of whether the upcoming general elections should be
held under the present proportional representation system or first-
past-the-post system is another matter likely to be discussed at
the all party talks.
</P>
<P>
The UNP sources said if the government was to change the
present system of elections, they would push for the establishment
of an Independent Election Commission before the next general
election to ensure fair and free elections.
</P>
<P>
With the current parliament due to be dissolved on August 24,
President Kumaratunga has said the next general elections will be
held during the first week of November.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has 82 biotech patents
registered in the United States from 1986 to 2000, the South
Korean Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for 0.6 percent of the 12,790 patents
registered in U.S. in this field, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Among these patents, U.S. ranks the first, followed by Japan
with 2,069, Germany 732, Britain 294, Australia 162, and Israel
109.
</P>
<P>
Of the 82 patented South Korean items, 61 percent were applied
by companies, 26 percent by research institutes while no patent is
applied by universities.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Asian countries like South Korea and China
lag far behind in biotech-related patents compared with Western
countries. It called for greater support for research and
development in the biotech industry in Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Self-Help Pedestrian Traffic Lights Used in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Xu Youbin, an old man living near
the Ping'an Avenue in Beijing, found it more convenient recently
to cross the six-driveway avenue.
</P>
<P>
"Look, the self-help pedestrian traffic light has been recently
installed at the street's intersections. When you push the button
yourself before crossing the avenue and the light turns green,
cars will stop to make way for you," Xu said in joyful tone.
</P>
<P>
This kind of traffic lights, first in Beijing, were installed
at all the six intersections along the Ping'an Avenue, according
to Beijing's traffic police.
</P>
<P>
As the city's second avenue parallel to and north of Chang'an
Avenue, the installation of such traffic lights could help reduce
traffic accidents at the intersections and nearby sections where
traffic accidents were reported at a relatively high rate, a
traffic official said.
</P>
<P>
The city has 1.5 million motor vehicles and over ten million
non-motor vehicles, he said, adding most of pedestrian-involved
accidents in Beijing are caused by pedestrians' crossing of
driveways in violation of traffic regulations.

<HEADLINE> Entrepreneur Chosen as Students' Favorite Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A recent national poll shows that
most Chinese students intend to become in the future entrepreneurs,
rather than the once-hottest career of scientist, according to
today's China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
Of the 7,000-odd high-school graduates surveyed, 20.8 percent
chose entrepreneur as their favorite career, 7.4 percentage points
higher than engineer, which ranks the second.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey conducted by the newspaper, scientists,
which was most admired by Chinese students and frequently cited in
their compositions about their ideals, has slided to the fourth.
</P>
<P>
The change of students' career list may result from the recent
trend that more and more college students have become promising
entrepreneurs by setting up their own companies, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Teaching, which students were reluctant to engage in because of
its relatively low salary, regained the favor of students as a
result of the country's efforts to better the treatment of
teachers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, statesmen and journalists, the most active occupations
in China's public life, did not enter the top eight.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Continue in Indonesian Riau Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of hotspots in Riau
province, Indonesia, increased to 350 on Wednesday and the local
residents were told to wear masks or even be evacuated from the
province in order to avoid respiratory problems, local leading
newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The condition is alarming. If there is no action, the number
of hotspots will increase," Head of the Environment Impact
Management Agency (Bapedal) Said Abdulrachman said.
</P>
<P>
He said about 80 percent of the fires are in areas managed by
plantation and logging firms. The firms were blamed for often
using slash-and-burn techniques banned under environmental laws to
clear land.
</P>
<P>
The latest fires, which started early July, have raised air
pollution to hazardous levels in part of Riau. In some cases, the
smoke of the fires have spread to neighboring countries such as
Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The quality of air above the Riau capital of Pekanbaru has
reached an alarming level. "People who want to carry out
activities outdoors, they, especially children, must wear mask,"
said an official.
</P>
<P>
Antung Deddy, a Bapedal official, said evacuations may be
necessary in some areas along the border of Riau and North Sumatra
provinces because of the pollution.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indonesian government has played down fears that
the fires would cause a repeat of Southeast Asia's haze crisis in
1997, but admits there is no strategy for extinguishing the blazes.
</P>
<P>
More than five million hectares of forest, plantations and
other land in Indonesia were razed by fires in 1997. The resulting
haze blanketed large swathes of Indonesia, Singapore and parts of
Malaysia for weeks. It also spread to Thailand and the Philippines.

government will send expert teams from the central level to
respective states and divisions to give training to artists of
those regions which have not fully taken part in the competitions.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Ministry of Information to make greater
efforts to ensure effectiveness in assigning artists duties to
revitalize folk songs, stressing that the songs of the national
people should also be invigorated.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to broadly study the international music
to systematically adopt its suitable portions in uplifting Myanmar
traditional culture, calling for extended conduct of international
music note courses to enable Myanmar artists to be well versed in
international music.
</P>

Mokran House here Wednesday evening in honor of visiting Russian
President Vladimir Putin, the Korean Central News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun said at the banquet that Putin's

importance to the DPRK-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the DPRK government and people greatly
treasure their friendship with Russia and will make positive
efforts to develop these relations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vienna Hosts Ceremony for Landmark Cold War Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Former German foreign minister Hans-
Dietrich Genscher on Wednesday urged the West to strengthen the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as a
security organ for Europe.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the
landmark cold war accord -- "The Helsinki Final Act," Genscher
expressed disappointment at neglect of the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the 25-year journey of the OSCE, which grew out of
the Helsinki accord, Genscher said the organization was tasked to
avert conflict and resolve crisis through non-violent means.
</P>
<P>
He said the organization now needs "re-politicalization" in
order not to shrivel into a group that only executes political
decisions of other political organizations.
</P>
<P>
He also called for better staff and financial resources for the
OSCE.
</P>
<P>
"The institutions of the OSCE must be strengthened."
</P>
<P>
He said the OSCE is playing an important role in maintaining
peace and stability within the area under its jurisdiction, and it
must become the framework of pan-European security.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's ceremony was hosted by Austrian Foreign Minister
Benita Ferrero-Waldner, current OSCE chairperson.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE, formerly known as the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe CSCE), now has 55 member countries.

<HEADLINE> Matthaus Will Stay With MetroStars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- 39 year-old Lothar Matthaus
will remain in Major League Soccer's MetroStars, but the German
superstar will watch from the bench unless he makes sure of being
in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
Matthaus' status with the New York-New Jersey club has been in
doubt since a photo of Matthaus and his girlfriend lounging on a
beach was released when he was supposed to be recovering from a
back injury after Germany's Euro 2000 debacle.
</P>
<P>
Matthaus reached an agreement with his club on Tuesday night at
a meeting between himself, MetroStars manager Nick Sakiewicz and
MLS executive vice president Ivan Gazidis.
</P>
<P>
Sakiewicz told Matthaus, holder of a men's world record 150
caps, that he would not appear in the starting lineup unless he
earn back his starting spot through his own efforts.
</P>
<P>
Sakiewicz said he did not expect Matthaus back competing until
at least early or mid-August. If the back injury is not fully
healed by then, he said, retirement was always a possibility for
Matthaus at 39, but he continued to say that Matthaus is still a
member of the MetroStars until the club is informed of his
decision of retirement.
</P>
<P>
Matthaus, a veteran of five World Cups and two-time Footballer
of the Year, signed a one-year MLS contract last August.
</P>
<P>
If the Metrostars had dismissed him, they would have had to
continue paying the remainder of his one million-dollar deal along
with his 10,000-dollar a month apartment until the end of his term.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Unheraleded players stole a little
bit of thunder in the first day of the Sanyo Indonesia Open here
Wednesday, although big names maintained their dominance.
</P>
<P>
World number 31 Budi Santoso, fresh from reaching the Thailand
Open final on Sunday, made an early exit in the second round with
a 13-15, 12-15 defeat to little known Ronald Susilo, an junior

the first test against world number 10 Chen Hong of China by
winning 8-15, 15-9, 17-16.
</P>
<P>
Coach Agus Dwi Santo said: "Budi was not in his best form after
the Thailand Open last week. He played anenergy-sapping match
against Chen in the morning. But I'm very disappointed he lost to
a little-known shuttler. I had expected him to play all out on the
court and force himself for the best. I didn't see that in Budi."
</P>
<P>
Another upset came when world number 12 Thomas Johansson of
Sweden, who earlier in the day had eliminated world champion Sun
Jun 15-12, 12-15, 15-8, lost to Agus Hariyanto, an Indonesian who
plays for Hong Kong, in straight sets 4-15, 7-15.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark overcame his first
hurdle, beating Kevin Han of the United States 15-12, 15-12 for a
place in the third round against Malaysia's Roslin Hashim. Earlier
in the day, the Danish 23-year-old tamed Ronny Agustinus of
Indonesia 15-9, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
On another court, defending champion Taufik Hidayat of
Indonesia fought his back injury and the resilience of Malaysian
Ismail Samanbefore posting a 15-6,15-13 win. The 18-year-old
Indonesian beat second-stringer Vidre Wibowo 15-10, 15-6 in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
World number three and Thailand Open winner Hendrawan of
Indonesia reached the third round comfortably with a 15-4, 15-1
defeat of Jean-Michael Lefort of France. The 28-year-old
Indonesian crushed Eric Pang of the Netherlands 15-6, 15-3 in the
earlier round.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, top seed Camilla Martin of Denmark
barely sweated to overcome Indonesian second-stringer Atu Rosalina
11-0, 11-4.
</P>
<P>
World number 11 Mia Audina of the Netherlands had an easy
victory over Budiani of Indonesia 11-1, 11-1. She will face

WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States has unveiled
its women's cycling team on Wednesday for the Olympic Games,
including a top time-trial rider, a former time-trial world
champion and an upstart road racer.
</P>
<P>
Mari Holden, Karen Kurreck and Nicole Freedman are the first
three women awarded the Olympic berths by the U.S. Cycling. It
marks the first Olympic appearance for all three.
</P>
<P>
Holden, 29, is a five-time national champion in the time trial,
while Kurreck, 38, won the time trial at the 1994 world
championships and was second behind Holden at the Olympic trials
in May.
</P>
<P>
Freedman, 28, who only began her cycling in the early 1990s
when her career as a middle-distance runner sputtered, earned the
spot by winning the road race at the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
"We have a strong women's road team, and the real strength of
the team lies in the individual time trial," said Sean Petty, U.S.
Cycling's director of athlete performance.
</P>
<P>
Holden and Kurreck will compete in the time trial at Sydney,
while all three women will ride in the road race.
</P>
<P>
Holden missed the 1996 Atlanta Olympics after a sixth-place
finish at the road trials, and raced in Italy since then to season
herself in the highly competitive European races.
</P>
<P>
Kurreck, a former college gymnast, might be America's most
seasoned time-trial rider. She has competed at the past seven
world championships.

<HEADLINE> Special Task Force for Economic Crimes in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- An economic crimes investigation
team affiliated with Shanghai Security Bureau has uncovered 2,300
economic cases within a year, seizing more than 1,400 suspects and
recovering 770 million yuan (about 93 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although the task force was still in its infancy, it has gained
popularity in this Chinese commercial hub.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after it was set up in July last year, the team
uncovered a case involving 500 million yuan and brought Weng
Changzhong, a swindler, to justice. Weng was sentenced to 15 years
in prison after he had been convicted of cheating 17 financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the team caught 78 suspects and recovered
25 million yuan from a tax evasion case after nine-month arduous
investigation in 16 cities.
</P>
<P>
Within the year, the team also netted Wu Guoxiong who was
responsible for a 480 million yuan swindling case. It also
uncovered a 13 million yuan funds misappropriation case.
</P>
<P>
"The team was set up at a time when economic crimes are
increasing sharply in Shanghai," said a senior police officer at
the bureau.
</P>
<P>
In 1980's, Shanghai has had only dozens of economic cases a
year, but now it has thousands a year," he said, adding that the
increase of economic crimes has outpaced that of the criminal
cases.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua)-- China's registered domain names
have increased by 20 times within the past two years, according to
today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Up to June 2000, China's network users have reached the mark of
10 million, with registered domain names ending with "cn"
amounting to 99,734. Whereas at the end of 1997, the figures were
only 620,000 and 4,066 respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the report of China Internet Network Information
Center (CNNIC) -- the national administration of domain
registration, domain names, or registered on-line trademarks and
identification cards, are becoming indispensable resources for
enterprises as Internet and e-business are gaining popularity.
</P>
<P>
How to facilitate Internet users with little knowledge of
English to enjoy the conveniences of Internet has long been a
problem in the development of Internet in China.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, breakthroughs were made in the Chinese Domain
System designed and developed by CNNIC. The new system functions
with Chinese characters instead of English letters.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the new system's release, applications
amounted to 36,000, equaling the past five-year total of
registered English domain names. Now applications have skyrocketed
to 70,000.

<HEADLINE> 4,000-year-old Observatory Well Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- An observatory built more than 4,
000 years ago is still well preserved.
</P>
<P>
The observatory is located 1.5 km southwest of Shangqiu City in
central China's Henan Province. Experts believe that it is the
oldest observatory in the world.
</P>
<P>
It is about 29 m high, and was probably first used to observe
the stars so as to give instructions for farming activities," said
Shang Qixing, a local historian.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the observatory was built more
than 4,000 years ago. "It is one of the earliest relics of human
civilization in the world, and it has survived numerous natural
and social disasters," Shang said.
</P>
<P>
Although the ruin has lost its function as an observatory, it
still attracts many local people, who believe that it will bring
them good luck, Shang said.

The Shangqiu Wholesale Market of Agricultural Products, with a
yearly trade volume of more than 180 million U.S. dollars and
occupying a total land area of 46 hectares, has been listed as one
of the biggest of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
Another market, the Shangqiu Bicycle Market, sold nearly two
million bicycles, or one third of the country's total bicycle
sales, last year, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, maybe the best example showing their commercial talent
is that they changed such small things as lighters and tape
measures into money-makers.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, there are some 1,000
household lighter factories in Shangqiu, producing 520 million
lighters a year and occupying four-fifths of the domestic lighter
market.
</P>
<P>
Shangqiu also produces the majority of China's tape measures,
which are sold not only in most cities in China but also in many
African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, for every eight people in Shangqiu
there will be one who is doing business in other parts of China or
even abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We have introduced computer science and English education in
primary schools, as we hope that even larger mercantile miracles
will be created by the younger generation," said a local official.

ZHENGZHOU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Legend has it that it was the
people of the Shang tribe living on the plain in today's Henan
Province some 5,000 years ago who were China's first merchants.
Moreover, the Chinese word for merchant is "Shang Ren", meaning
people from the Shang tribe.
</P>
<P>
Today, descendants of the Shang tribe have set up a huge
symbolic sculpture for their city, Shangqiu, in the east of the
central China province. The sculpture is in the shape of the
Chinese character "Shang" built of simulated bones and shells.
</P>
<P>
"We used to be poor, but now with the improvement of the local
infrastructure and the liberation of our thinking, we are making
rapid progress in social and economic development," said Liu
Xinmin, secretary of the Communist Party of China Shangqiu City
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Shangqiu is in a golden location, where two of China's major
railways intersect, and trading has come to be a trump card for us,
" Liu said, adding that Shangqiu has become the largest
distribution center in the border area of Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong
and Anhui provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to an official plan, Shangqiu will build ten big
markets, six of which have been completed.

<HEADLINE> Islamist Journalists End Hunger Strike After Securing Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Journalists employed by a suspended
Egyptian Islamist newspaper ended their hunger strike on Thursday
after the government assured that they will be paid until the fate
of the newspaper is decided, officials of the Syndicate of
Journalists said.
</P>
<P>
Two journalists of the bi-weekly Al-Shaab newspaper, Talaat
Rumeih and Khaled Yussef, went on hunger strike on July 9 to
protest the suspension of their salaries after the newspaper was
banned. Five of their colleagues joined them last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Manpower and Employment has agreed to pay
salaries of the newspaper's non-journalist staffers, while the
Syndicate of Journalists will pay the journalists, the state-run
Middle East News Agency quoted the syndicate officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
In May, the Party Affairs Committee, a government organ which
supervises activities of the political parties in Egypt, suspended
both the Islamist Labor Party and its mouthpiece, Al-Shaab, citing
internal conflict of the party.
</P>
<P>
Among the journalists on the hunger strike was Al-Shaab editor-
in-chief Magdi Hussein, who is serving a two-year prison term for
defaming Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister Youssef
Wali.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Renews Support for Palestinians at Camp David Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
said on Thursday that his kingdom fully supports the efforts by the
Palestinians to achieve progress at the ongoing trilateral summit
at Camp David near Washington.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a U.S. delegation headed by Chairman of
Washington Institute for the Near East Policies Robert Stalof, King
Abdullah stressed that the negotiations are crucially important,
and this phase of talks between Israel and the Palestinians
requires hard decisions by the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
However, few progresses have been made in the summit meeting
between United States President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The marathon meeting, which was opened 10 days ago, mainly
focused on thorny issues like the fate of Jerusalem, the future of
Palestinian refugees, borders of a future Palestinian state and
security arrangements between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Result of the summit will leave the greatest impact on the
future of this region since the Palestinian issue is the core of
the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the entire world is waiting for the
outcome of these negotiations, the king added.
</P>
<P>
Stalof and his accompanying delegation were on a tour of the
region to draw up a perspective for Middle East policies for the
next U.S. president, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Abdullah expressed hope that a just, durable
and comprehensive peace in the region will be completed in the near
future to provide security and stability to the peoples in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"With such a peace in the region we will be capable of catching
up with scientific and technological development in the world," the
king added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming the
second Arab country to sign such a treaty.

BEIRUT -- The Lebanese army Wednesday filed charges against five
members of the Amal movement over involvement in killing of two men
of the Hezbollah group last week, local media reported Thursday.
If convicted, the defendants might face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
In the incident last Saturday, members of Amal killed two
Hezbollah members in the southern Lebanese village of Markaba in a
gun battle which erupted after members of the two groups ripped up
posters of their rival's leaders.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The test of a Patriot PAC-3 missile was now set for Saturday
morning, depending on final checks of a pre-launch problem which
forced a postponement of the shot Wednesday morning, a Pentagon
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, the attempt will be made at 7 a.m. Mountain
Daylight Time (1300 GMT) Saturday at the White Sands Missile Test
Range in New Mexico State of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's test was delayed by trouble in safety equipment on
the PAC-3 launcher designed to respond to simulated launches.
</P>
<P>
The PAC-3, an improved version of the Patriots used against
Iraqi Scud missiles during the Gulf War in 1991, has tracked and
collided with Hera target rockets three times in a row since the
beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
Unlike a planned U.S. national missile defense (NMD) effort to
protect the whole country from long-range attack, the theater
program is designed to protect U.S. troops and bases from short-

<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. TMD and NMD, opposed by the

also threaten security and stimulate nuclear proliferation,
instead of promoting security and stemming the spread of nuclear

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Appeals for 8.4 MILLION Dollars for Angola Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNHCR sent an assessment mission to Uige, Zaire and Luanda in
March and has since deployed a 12-member emergency team to begin a
full-scale relief program for the displaced people there.
</P>
<P>
Widespread conflict has engulfed Angola since a peace agreement
hammered out in Lusaka fell apart in mid-1998, according to UNHCR.
By the end of 1999, some 3.7 million Angolans were reported to be
in need of assistance. Around 1.5 million of them were internally
displaced in disease-ridden camps with little food. Conditions in
the camps were described as some of the most appalling in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Following consultations among UN agencies, UNHCR will
principally operate in the three provinces where refugees from the
previous conflict had returned. The amount appealed will cover
life-saving activities for the first six months of the operation,
including provision of basic health and nutrition, water and
sanitation, shelter and household materials.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to providing basic health and nutrition
(815,000 dollars), water and sanitation (710,040 dollars), shelter
(411,875 dollars), essential household materials (691,000 dollars),
transport and logistics (1.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
UNHCR's program will gradually shift to more long-term
activities, such as strengthening local capacity-building,
education, training and some income-generating projects.

LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The British Foreign Office Thursday
published its Annual Report on Human Rights, stressing the
importance of human rights in its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"No British government has given a higher priority to human
rights than this one. When this government took office three years
ago, I placed human rights at the heart of foreign policy. We are
committed to making a difference wherever and whenever we can,"
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said after launching that latest
issue, the third such report.

<P>
"It provides a detailed overview of the full range of our work
in this area over the past year," he said.

"The report shows that we are making a difference, and that the
commitment I made to human rights three years ago is just as
relevant for the Foreign Office today," said the foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said in a statement that the report covers
the period from June 1999 to June 2000.

LUANDA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The TotalFinaElf Group (ELF), the
world's fourth biggest oil company, has stated that it "never paid
commissions or remuneration to the Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos or to his family members", the official news agency
Angop reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The denial, which came in a communique issued by the company on
Thursday, rejected the insinuation by former ELF director for
Africa Andre Tarallo.
</P>
<P>
The communique followed an document released earlier this week
in Luanda by the Angolan presidency office, who strongly denied
the statement of the former ELF director, accusing it blackening
the image of various African heads of state and their families
including Jose dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
The presidential document pointed out that the "dubious and
irresponsible character of those statements is at the helm of
rigorously groundless defamation and accusation campaigns against
the person of the Angolan head of state."
</P>
<P>
It added that the presidency office has the obligation to deny
the allegations, with which Andre Tarallo intended to hide
criminal acts attributed to him and his ELF colleagues.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Defense Chiefs End Meeting in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- West African chiefs of defense staff
Friday ended their three-day meeting in Ghana, which is aimed at
giving teeth to the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management
and Resolution of the Economic Community of West African States (
ECOWAS), according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, ECOWAS Executive Secretary, said at the end of
the meeting that the defense chiefs of the member states had
determined the size of a proposed stand-by forces to be deployed
in each country of the ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The stand-by force, as decided upon at last year's ECOWAS
summit as a part of the mechanism, is to, among other things,
strengthen co-operation in the areas of conflict prevention, early
warning, peacekeeping and control of cross border crime and arms
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
On how the new force will be funded, Kouyate said the Heads of
State of ECOWAS had decided that a Community Levy of 0.5 percent
would be imposed on all imports into the region, which will be fed
into a special account devoted to the equipping and providing
logistical needs of the standby force.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate said the case whereby the West African Peacekeeping
Force, or the ECOMOG, was hampered by logistical problems in
Liberia and Sierra Leone would soon be a thing of the past if all
members resolve to support the group to meet its defined roles.
</P>
<P>
He repeated calls for the UN to change the role of peacekeepers
in Sierra Leone from peacekeeping to peace enforcement to enable
it confront the difficult realities that they face in their duties.
</P>
<P>
"I will like to see us go beyond a strong peacekeeping mandate
to a peace enforcement mandate."
</P>
<P>
Kouyate said another requirement of the Mechanism is to
establish a Council of Elders who will move into countries found
to have tensions that could degenerate into wars and settle them
in pure African tradition.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, 12 countries have submitted names of persons they
wish to have on the Council who will be posted at "observatories"
in the Gambia, Burkina Faso, and Cotonou.
</P>
<P>
"The observatories will detect in different zones signs of
tension and act on them."
</P>
<P>
 He said the central observatory to be sited in Abuja, Nigeria,
would start in two weeks, after which advertisements will be
placed for the right support staff to man them.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Attacks White Farmers, Churches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday attacked white commercial farmers and some churches, saying
they want to retain European control on Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told the party's first Central Committee meeting after
the June parliamentary election that the white farmers had
retained their infrastructure and personnel to safeguard white
economic interests after independence.
</P>
<P>
"Their traditional identity and role in the national affairs of
this country must be properly understood," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a collectivity, they are a natural fissure and beachhead
for the retention or re-launch of British and European influence
and control over our body-politic," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the farmers began to show their true political colors
when the government began tackling the land reform when they
turned white commercial and industrial structures, farms and mine
compounds into hotbeds of anti-ruling party politics.
</P>
<P>
He said the most insidious side of the resurgence of white
power in Zimbabwe came from some church leaders who turned pulpits
into political stages.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the government was taking steps to correct
imbalances in land ownership because it could not continue to
surrender to its enemies on matters of sovereignty and principle.
</P>
<P>
He said he had appointed youthful ministers, which would see
the government moving swiftly to correct socio-economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the government had adopted a Millennium Economic
Recovery Program containing measures to restore macro-economic
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
 "Both the party and the government should remain aware that
we face formidable enemies who have thrown stiff hurdles along our
path," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Mourns His Party Loss in Parliamentary Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday mourned the loss of 58 seats to opposition parties in the
county's fifth parliamentary election, saying that signaled a
protest against the party.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, also First Secretary of the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Font (Zanu-pf), opened the party's
Central Committee meeting in Harare, describing the loss as a
political disaster.
</P>
<P>
He said, "In most of the constituencies which the party
conceded to the opposition, the margins of defeat were quite wide,
possibly indicating that the protest was quite strongly felt."
</P>
<P>
"This could very easily translate into a deep chasm between
such disgruntled supporters and the party," he said, adding that "
such a development would be inauspicious for the future of our
party,"
</P>
<P>
In the country's parliamentary election on June 24-25, the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) gained 57 seats
and Zanu (Ndonga) garnered one seat.
</P>
<P>
MDC swept almost all the urban seats and gained almost all
rural seats in the Matebeleland region of west Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said it was clear that Zanu-pf had lost in urban centers
because of the adverse economic conditions prevailing in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult to see how the party would escape the winter
of urban discontent and the harsh political verdict that this
brings about in electoral terms," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Little wonder then that the bulk of the support and
vote for the opposition came from urban or peri-urban dwellers,
chiefly from among the unemployed or frustrated youths."
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the country was facing a difficult
macro-economic condition, causing high inflation to raise the cost
of living and the erosion of real wages and incomes for the
workers.
</P>
<P>
In that situation, he said, the opposition did not need to
present any new policies because voters were more interested in
registering their unhappiness against Zanu-pf.
</P>
<P>
He said the greatest weakness facing Zanu-pf was that it lacked
strong structures needed for communication and mobilization.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Zanu-pf has been rocked by factionalism in
almost all the provinces with members attempting to dislodge each
other from provincial structures.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Former Burundian President
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya Friday urged the current military regime
under Pierre Buyoya to seize the chance of signing a peace deal
and return the tiny central African country to a democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
Ntibantunganya, who was toppled in a bloodless coup in 1996 by
Buyoya, said that two years of peace negotiations have reached "a
very advanced stage and all must sign the peace agreement on
August 28."
</P>
<P>
"We must respect the achievements of negotiations without any
further dillydallying," the former president said in the country's
northern town of Arusha, where another round of Burundi peace
talks is being held since last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ntibantunganya was partly commenting on remarks by President
Buyoya on Thursday that many issues have yet to be resolved before
the signing of a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"What's important is not the date of signing, but addressing
the outstanding issues," Buyoya told a press conference held in
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
He said the issues include the duration of a transitional
government, modalities of a ceasefire, the electoral system and
guarantees on the implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 Burundians, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the country's ethnic civil war since October 1993, when
the minority Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Melchior Ndadaye, who
was from the majority Hutu group and won the country's first
democratic elections.

</P>
<P>
The World Diamond Congress decided on strict new measures to
clamp down on trade in conflict diamonds, used to pay for wars in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The measures included a certification system to track rough
diamonds from the time they are mined, as well as penalties
against dealers who break United Nations embargoes on diamond
sales by rebels in Angola and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Mlambo-Ngcuka said the congress agreed that an international
council be formed to ensure that all countries comply with the
measures.
</P>
<P>
There was a recommendation that this should be a UN body. "It
must have teeth," she said.
</P>
<P>
The council would also ensure that each of the countries
comply with the regulations and put their own measures in place
for that purpose. Diamond-importing countries should enact
legislation to ensure that only legitimate rough diamonds be
imported.
</P>
<P>
If a member of the International Diamond Manufacturers'
Association failed to obey the regulations and knowingly dealt in
illegal diamonds, it would be expelled. Banks and insurers would
also be asked not to do business with those in breach of the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
An ethical code of conduct regarding conflict diamonds,
dealing with labor and good business practices, was also adopted
by the congress, Mlambo-Ngcuka said.
</P>
<P>
The proposals made thus far would be formally adopted at a
ministerial meeting in South Africa in September, Mlambo-Ngcuka
said.
</P>
<P>
All the countries involved had to indicate what needed to be
put in place to ensure the establishment of a comprehensive
mechanism to identify and certificate diamonds. A prototype of the
process and the proposed certificate would be put forward at the
ministerial meeting, to be attended by various governments, the UN,
diamond manufacturers and non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Warns Against High Internet Service Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has warned
that the high cost of internet subscription could drive the
country out of the booming e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), a governmental
telecom regulator, said in a report available on Friday that the
106,000 naira (about 1,060 U.S. dollars) per annum for an internet
account effectively keeps the service out of reach of a majority
of Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
A total number of about 50 internet service providers (ISP)
have been licensed by NCC, but most of them have only concentrated
their business on Lagos, the country's commercial capital, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
This actually makes impossible for the ISPs to venture into the
lucrative e-commerce areas.
</P>
<P>
The report also revealed that some foreign websites have been
programmed to bar Nigerians, surfing with a Nigerian ISP, from
visiting them, because of the cybercrime record of some Nigerians
in the past.
</P>
<P>
An efficient and reliable communications infrastructure in the
country is vital, if Nigeria is to have its place in the booming e-
commerce, which grossed at a value of 180 billion U.S. dollars
globally in 1999, said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Digital telephone services in
eastern Ethiopia have been trebled to 28,196 from only 6,696 five
years ago, local Walta Information Center reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 clients in Dire Dawa, Harar, Jijiga, Asbe
Teferi, Gode and Kebri Dehar are connected to the digital lines,
Taye Lema, general manager of the Eastern Region Branch of the
Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation (ETC), was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
 Taye said that the whole project cost 22.3 million birr (
about 2.6 million U.S. dollars), of which about half were provided
by the ETC, and the remaining were loans from the governments of
Sweden and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The corporation has also implemented several expansion projects
in rural towns in eastern Ethiopia, which up-graded existing
manual services to digital and semi automatic level, the general
manager said.
</P>
<P>
The ETC plans to undertake further expansion works in eastern
cities of Dire Dawa, Harar and Asbe Tefrei next year, at the cost
of eight million birr (nearly 1 million U.S. dollars), he said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Commander in Congo Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda People's Defense Forces (
UPDF) has appointed a new commander of its forces in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to replace Brigadier James
Kazini.
</P>
<P>
"Brigadier Katumba Wamala was appointed overall commander of
our troops in the DRC, while Kazini is coming back as Chief of
Staff," Army spokesman Phinehas Katirima told Xinhua in a
telephone interview here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kazini has commanded Operation Safe Haven (OSH), the UPDF
campaign in DRC, since 1998. He is now in London where he is
recuperating from severe malaria.
</P>
<P>
Since Ugandan and Rwandan troops exchanged fire in the
Congolese city of Kisangani last year and this year, several
Rwandan officers have accused Kazini of fueling the conflicts
between the two Armies.
</P>
<P>
At the recent summit between Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame, the Rwandans reportedly
asked Museveni to recall the Brigadier.
</P>
<P>
But Katirima said: "There should be no speculation, the
Commander-in-Chief appoints his officers and commanders the best
way he sees fit."
</P>
<P>
The newly appointed commander returned to Uganda last month
after a one-year military course in the United States. He was the
first Ugandan army officer to attend the U.S. Army War College in
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he earned a diploma in strategic
leadership.

<HEADLINE> WFP Cuts Food Aid to Refugees in Tanzania by 40 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
has slashed food rations by 40 percent to some 450,000 refugees in
Tanzanian camps because of a severe lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
According to a WFP statement issued here on Thursday, this
situation will continue until further donations are received and
the organization has to stretch available food stocks over the
months ahead.
</P>
<P>
WFP Acting Country Director in Tanzania Bai Bojang explained in
the statement that the long-standing nature of the Tanzanian
refugee crisis and its magnitude, which is one of the largest
refugee caseloads worldwide, has been increasingly difficult to
fund.
</P>
<P>
WFP is in urgent need of 7.7 million U.S. dollars through
December this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "WFP will ensure that the most vulnerable
refugees -- the infirm, elderly, lactating and pregnant women and
small children -- will continue to receive a full ration despite
the funding squeeze."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the hardship the refugees will face because of a
lack of food, the country director said his organization is also
concerned about an increase in camp insecurity because of this
scarcity of food.
</P>
<P>
There is already a strained relationship between the refugees
and the host Tanzanian population living in the vicinity of the
camps, he said.
</P>
<P>
Contributions to WFP for refugee feeding programs in Tanzania
have been generous in the past, with some 48 million dollars given
since August 1999 for providing 88,000 tons of food.
</P>
<P>
But attracting funding for prolonged refugee crisis worldwide
has become more and more challenging, with an increase in
emergencies such as natural disasters and internal conflicts,
Bojang said.
</P>
<P>
In the Great Lakes region overall, WFP is feeding about 1.5
million people.
</P>
<P>
The organization is the United Nations' front-line agency in
the fight against global hunger. In 1999, it fed more than 89
million people in 82 countries, including most of the world's
refugees and internally displaced people.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Picks S. African Airlines to Jointly Manage Lagos-New York Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has picked the South African
airlines (SAA) as its partner to jointly operate probably one of
Africa's most lucrative air routes, Nigerian press reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Lagos-New York air route is to be officially opened on
August 15 after years of suspension by the U.S. government as a
means to punish Nigeria's former military regimes.
</P>
<P>
A committee headed by Minister of Aviation Kema Chikwehad had
selected SAA out of 11 airlines, including some international top
brands as its partner for the route, while hailing the move a
fruit of South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The state owned Nigerian Airways has to split the profit from
the lucrative air route with a foreign partner, for the airlines
actually has no decent planes to fly due to years of mismanagement
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
SAA, established in 1934, has a fleet of 85 aircraft, including
23 Boeing 747s, three Boeing 767s, eight Airbus A300s (Cargo),
seven Airbus A320s. It is the largest aviation passenger carrier
in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Prices Improved at Nairobi Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Prices of clean coffee in the
highest grade AA fetched up to 139 U.S. dollars per bag (50 kgs)
this week compared to 119 dollars per bag last week at the Nairobi
Coffee Exchange, the Coffee Board of Kenya has said.
</P>
<P>
A price catalogue published by the coffee board said that
prices in grade AB also rose from 96 dollars per bag recorded last
week to 125 dollars per bag this week, the East African Standard
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The improved prices during the auction this week were
attributed to weather and frost speculations in Brazil, the
leading coffee producer in the world, the coffee board said.
</P>
<P>
The highest price recorded in grade C this week was 102 dollars
per bag compared to 82 dollars per bag realized last week, while
grade PB recorded 125 dollars per bag against 90 dollars per bag
in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The board said, a total of 32,679 bags were offered and sold
during this week's auction, with average prices in all categories
ranging from 63.6 dollars to 118.5 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange is set to close trading
starting August 8 to enable dealers to break for a three-week
holiday and will resume business on August 29 where the weekly
sales are expected to be in the range of 35,000 bags owing to a
substantial balance of the unsold stocks.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Build Reservoirs for Thirsty Animals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania plans to build more
water reservoirs in its national parks to save wildlife from death
by thirst, newspapers here reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted officials as saying that the situation is
particularly pressing at the Serengeti National Park bordering
Kenya where drought is ravaging plants, people and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism Zakhia
Meghji told the parliament in central town of Dodoma recently that
drought is threatening wildlife.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that efforts are being made to build water
reservoirs at the wildlife havens as was the case three years ago
with the Mikumi National Park.
</P>
<P>
Lota Melamari, director-general of the Tanzania National Parks
Authority, said the approach would be to harvest water and reserve
it by reservoirs especially for crocodiles and hippos.
</P>
<P>
He said animals are trekking from Tsavo in Kenya to Tanzania's
Tarangire, Serengeti and Manyara National Parks in search of water.
</P>
<P>
Abounded with wildlife in dozens of natural parks throughout
the country, Tanzania has attracted an ever-increasing number of
tourists, making the tourism sector second contributor to Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) after agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The sector attracted a total of 627,325 tourists last year,
earning the country 733.3 million U.S. dollars which accounted for
14 percent of total GDP.
</P>
<P>
Pining hope of poverty alleviation and improvement of the
national economy on tourism, Tanzania increased its tourist hotel
rooms from 6,935 in 1995 to 9,575 in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls on Health Professionals to Serve Rural Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has called upon health professionals to make inroads into rural
areas to disseminate preventative information on combating
diseases, the major newspaper East African Standard reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was unfortunate that most health professionals prefer to
wait in urban centers to receive and treat those already afflicted,
Moi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president made these remarks on Saturday when officially
closing a 10-day World Heart Foundation international seminar in
central Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that it was fortunate that research had indicated that
risk factors for heart diseases such as drinking, smoking,
increased salt intake and physical inactivity can be contained or
prevented.
</P>
<P>
However, the main problem is how research findings can reach
the ordinary people since most of them are published in highly
specialized professional journals which are inaccessible to many,
Moi said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that there was need for medical researchers and
the general practitioners to find ways of getting the message to
the people.
</P>
<P>
Most doctors and nurses are concentrated in towns and cities in
the east African country, while in remote areas most farmers have
to walk at least two hours to reach the nearest clinics.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament Hails EU to Lift Fish Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan parliamentary committee on
agriculture has welcomed the move by the European Union (EU) to
lift the ban on Uganda's fish exports to EU countries, the New
Vision newspaper reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
With the lifting of the ban, the country's export earnings on
fish would be restored, said Committee Chairman Anthony Kanyike.
</P>
<P>
The committee appealed to the fishing community to maintain
high standards and ensure hygienic conditions to intensify fish
farming when coffee, a major foreign exchange earner of the
country, is wilting.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry should ensure that the conditions that
caused the ban do not reoccur, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The ban, which was imposed by the EU in March last year, has
since cost Uganda some 30 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Ugandan Fisheries Ministry, the EU lifted its fish
ban on Uganda on Tuesday and the official announcement would come
in two or three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Poor Sanitation Claims 150 African Children per Hour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 150 children die
every hour from sanitation, hygiene and water related diseases in
Africa, media here reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director Dalous Bukenya of African Medical Research
Foundation told the regional Sanitation Initiative Forum held here
on Thursday that despite commendable efforts by many governments
in the last decade, Africa continued facing escalating challenges
in sustaining hygiene, sanitation and water programs.
</P>
<P>
He said population growth, declining economies, epidemic and
disasters have put tremendous pressure on scarce resources.
</P>
<P>
"About 500 million people are without sanitation facilities and
450 million lack safe water supply," he said, adding that huge
amount of time and energy have been spent in caring for the sick
as a direct result of diarrhea disease.
</P>
<P>
"Added to this is the daily burden by women and children in
collecting often unsafe water far from home," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Bukenya, although the United Nations declared 1981
to 1990 as the "Decade for Water and Sanitation" many years ago,
the problem is not only unresolved but has grown in number and
scope at the beginning of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Tanzania has tried a lot of interventions and
programs including the "safe water for all by the year 2000"
project but little success has been achieved so far. About 40
percent of the water systems in the country are not working today
and the water problem has increased beyond expectation.

<HEADLINE> Clan Clashes Leave 17 Dead in Northeast Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- About 17 people have been killed
in clan clashes between the Garre and Ajuran communities in the
Wajir district of northeast Kenya, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wajir District Officer Mohamed Mohamud said he could confirm 17
deaths, including 12 Garres and five Ajurans.
</P>
<P>
The skirmish occurred when more than 100 heavily armed bandits
believed to be from the Garre clan allegedly attacked Ajuran
pastoralists on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The attack sparked a fierce gun battle on Thursday between
armed gangs of the two communities. Kenya Army and police were
deployed to the area to disperse the bandits after hours of
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The feud between the two clans, which has lasted for one month
and claimed 50 lives, was caused by cattle-rustling and scramble
for grassland. It was worsened by the current drought which has
dried the pasture and led to the death of livestock.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet's Case Enters Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plaintiffs Gustavo Horovitz and Eduardo Contreras exposed their
arguments for 1.5 hours.
</P>
<P>
The 20 Supreme Court judges were holding the second of three
days of hearings to decide whether Pinochet can be tried for
thousands of deaths and disappearances blamed on his 17-year
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Ricardo Rivadeneira argued that Pinochet was
not responsible for 1973 summary executions carried out by a
military unit, the so-called "Caravan of Death," which toured the
country, killing 74 political prisoners one month after the former
Chilean dictator took office.
</P>
<P>
The three-day hearing was called after the retired general
appealed a June 5 ruling by the Santiago Court of Appeals that
stripped him of his parliamentary immunity.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet enjoyed legal immunity as a "senator for life," a
title he took after nominally stepping down as military commander-
in-chief in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rivadeneira also argued that the 84-year-old was too ill to
stand trial and defend himself. Pinochet suffers from
cardiovascular problems and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
British authorities had cited health reasons in freeing
Pinochet from 17 months of house arrest and allowing him to return
home on March 3, rather than extraditing him to Spain where he is
wanted for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
But under Chilean law, a defendant's poor physical health does
not prevent a trial from going ahead.
</P>
<P>
If the lower court ruling is upheld, Pinochet could go on trial
for any of the 146 criminal complaints lodged against him, all
stemming from incidents during his iron-fisted 1973-1990 rule,
when more than 3,000 people were killed or went missing.
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's three-and-a-half hour session, held behind
closed doors, the court heard a summary of the case, and the 20
high court judges rejected a request to order immediate medical
tests for the ailing general.
</P>
<P>
The second hearing's conclusion is programmed for this Friday.

<HEADLINE> Germany Urges US To Keep Promise In Helping Poor Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- German Minister of Economic
Cooperation and Development, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul on Thursday
criticized the United States for its failure to set aside funds to
lessen the burden of the poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the group of 8 meeting in
Koln last year,the rich countries pledged to grant debt relief of
70 billion US Dollars to the poorest countries in the world, but
the US congress has yet to approve the Clinton Administration's
commitment.
</P>
<P>
 By the end of this year, 20 poor nations are expected to get
debt relief with financial help from the developed countries
except the United States,according to Wieczorek-Zeul. In a later
phase, 16 other countries are expected to receive help.
</P>
<P>
"When the American money does not come in full, then the later
phase to
finance debt relieving would be put into question." she said at
the Deutschland Radio Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The rich countries can not live in peace for long, if the rest
of the world is becoming poorer, because poverty is the source of
many conflicts, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Continues Effort to Reverse Taliban Edict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, Erick de Mul, had
returned to Islamabad, Pakistan after travelling to Kabul,
Afghanistan, in an attempt to reverse a Taliban edict banning
Afghan women from working with the U.N. agencies and non-
governmental organizations, U.N. said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said during his stay in Kabul,
Erick Mul had meetings with the authorities of the Taliban and
asked the Taliban to provide him with an answer in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban asked for more time to provide a firm answer on the
issue, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Erick Mul would meet with his U.N. colleagues on Friday to
consult with them regarding the latest developments and he was
prepared to return to Kabul for more discussions, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said last week, Erick Mul was in Kandahar,
Afghanistan, where he had received positive signals from the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
He added the United Nations was very concerned about the edict
's impact on the delivery of humanitarian assistance in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban issued an edict early this month which banned
Afghan women from working with national and international
nongovernmental organizations and U.N. agencies in the country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations hoped that the issue would be resolved soon
as to avoid any negative impact on the provision of humanitarian
aid at such a critical moment for the Afghan population, which was
currently suffering from one of the worst drought in decades in
addition to the effects of 22 years of civil strife.

CARACAS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. government denied Thursday
participating in a project of an American company for building an

</P>
<P>
Washington's stance is contained in a communique sent out this

This question resides between private US firm Beal Aerospace

Esequeibo is a land plot of 159,500 square kilometers which has
been claimed for over 30 years by both Venezuela and Guyana.
</P>
<P>
Guayana in 1999 sold 50,000 hectares of Esequibo to American

</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel requested
United States information regarding its involvement in the project,
which Caracas is opposed to because Esequibo is a disputed border

<P>
NEW YORK, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose sharply
Thursday as investors were encouraged by the remarks on the U.S.
economy from the Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>

after six hikes in interest rates in the past 13 months but
inflation dangers remain. The chairman's remarks left the door

<HEADLINE> Illiteracy Eradication Forecast in Brazil within 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Childhood illiteracy will be
eradicated in 10 years in Brazil if the lowering tendency is kept,
forecast Thursday Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
(IBGE).
</P>
<P>
The illiteracy rate among young folk of 10 to 14 years old
went down from 14.8 percent in 1989 to 5.5 percent in 1999,
affirmed IBGE in a study made known this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of reduction is the considerable increase of the
number of children registered in schools, which arrived to 96
percent in 1999, while ten years ago, this amount was barely 16.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate of illiteracy among adults also registers a descending
tendency at slower rhythm, as it went from 18.2 percent in 1989 to
12.3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the study confirmed another tendency, that the
schooling level among women is higher than among men.
</P>
<P>
In the male population over 10 years old, the quota finishing
at least secondary education was of 17.5 percent in 1999, while
with females, the percentage went up to 20.4 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Thursday passed the final version of a bill
cutting taxes for millions of married couples.
</P>
<P>
The House passed the bill 271-156, with 51 Democrats and all
Republicans in favor. The Senate is also expected to pass the
compromise bill soon and dispatch the legislation to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
Republicans urged President Bill Clinton to reconsider his veto
threats and sign the legislation into law.
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason on earth why the president should veto this
bill," said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, a Republican from
Illinois. "I find it fiscally responsible to let hard-working
folks keep more of their own money."
</P>
<P>
But Democrats said the bill was still far too expensive. "This
bill is poorly targeted. It's tilted in favor of wealthier couples.
It neglects those Americans who need marriage penalty relief the
most," said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation agreed to by House and Senate negotiators,
millions of married couples would get some tax relief this
calendar year.

On July 20, 1944, a timebomb blew up under a table where

MONTEVIDEO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's trade deficit in year
2000's first five months reached 919.2 million U.S. dollars, above
the deficit registered in all of 1999, which was 915.7 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU), in
the January-May period of year 2000, exports grew 6.8 percent,
while imports went up 12.8 percent, over 1999's same period.
</P>
<P>
The unbalance was mainly due to greater purchases of oil and
energy caused by the dryness that hit Uruguay and made the
electricity potential go down, said a report of the bank.
</P>
<P>
As regards year 2000's first five months compared with 1999's
same period, sales of meat abroad grew 19.3 percent, textile and
manufacture products 8.7, and wools 15.1 percent.

As regards imports, electric energy purchases went up 246
percent, oil 95.4 percent and transport pieces and accessories 25.
3 percent.

UNITED NATIONS, July 20(Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan will bring together leaders from global business,
international labor and civil society organizations who are
expected to pledged their commitment to universally-accepted human
rights, labor and environmental principles, U.N. announced here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said nearly 50 companies will
attend the meeting at U.N. Headquarters on July 26 and they
include corporate giants such as Dailerchrysler, Unilever,

These were deemed necessary as the U.N.'s contact with
corporations has increased dramatically, particularly in the
context of the Global Compact. These guidelines provide a useable
framework for the organization's dealings with the private sector.

<HEADLINE> China Emphasizes Noninterference in Conflict Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preventative measures should only be taken upon request or with
the consent and cooperation by countries concerned, said
Ambassador Wang Yingfan, Chinese Permanent Representative to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, the goal of conflict prevention cannot be fulfilled,
" he told the U.N. Security Council which dealt with the issue of
the U.N. role in the prevention of armed conflicts in a day-long
debate.
</P>
<P>
The Council should play a leading role in this respect and it
should attach importance to the role of all regional organizations
and cooperate with them, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation should be carried out on the basis where
regional organizations observe the purposes and principles of the
U.N. Charter and accept U.N. guidance and monitoring, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the importance of addressing the issue of
economic development in developing countries as it is essential
for conflict prevention.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Calls for Massive Increase in Resources to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations lead
agency in the fight against HIV/AIDS on Thursday called on the
world's most industrialized countries to radically increase
spending to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came on the eve of the G-8 summit in Japan and one
the heels of the XIII International AIDS Conference in South
Africa which concluded last Friday in Durban, South Africa, and
the action by the U.N. Security Council which adopted a resolution
this week reiterating concern about the spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Rich countries can rewrite the history of the epidemic by
taking a decisive stand against AIDS and committing more resources
to fighting it," said Peter Piot, Executive Director of the Joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS) said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"In sub-Sahara Africa alone, we need a minimum of 3 billion U.S.
dollars a year if we are to turn back the tide of the epidemic,
but we are spending only a tenth of that," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the G-8 leaders earlier this month, UNAIDS urged
the G-8 countries to make available an additional 1.5 billion a
year to provide and distribute HIV/AIDS commodities.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS further urged the G-8 countries to support accelerated
action in Africa under the framework of the International
Partnership Against AIDS in Africa negotiated by governments, the
U.N. donors, civil society and the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Ad, Commerce Boost AOL's Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 20 (Xinhua) -- America Online reported
Thursday fourth-quarter profits, highlighting the strength of
continued advertising and commerce growth.
</P>
<P>
The Internet service company reported net income of 334 million
U.S. dollars for the quarter ending June 30, and revenue of 1.9
billion dollars, up 39 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Advertising and commerce revenue accounted for 609 million
dollars of the total, increasing 95 percent over last year's
corresponding quarter.
</P>
<P>
Net income for the full year rose to 1 billion dollars on
revenues of 6.9 billion dollars, compared to a fiscal 1999 net
income of 391 million dollars and revenues of 4.8 billion dollars.
Advertising and commerce totaled nearly 2 billion dollars for the
year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have been watching AOL's advertising and commerce
revenues as an indication of how well the company is increasing
earnings separate from the monthly subscription fees it collects
from its members. The company added 5.6 million net new members
for the full year, bringing membership to 23 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In the past quarter, the company took a step into interactive
television by releasing AOL TV, which enhances TV viewing with
Internet features.
</P>
<P>
AOL is in the process of closing its proposed acquisition of
Time Warner. The combination, which would marry the world's
largest Internet company with the world's media and entertainment
company, has attracted considerable attention among federal
regulators examining the competitive effect. Walt Disney is
reportedly planning to file a proposal to split the combined
company's cable TV networks.
