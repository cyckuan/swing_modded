<P>
The increase was 0.6 percent as against the previous May-July

<HEADLINE> Governor of Afghanistan's Badakhshan Province Killed </HEADLINE>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Moulvi Khairadmand, governor
of Afghanistan's Badakhshan, was killed by soldiers loyal to Ahmad
Shah Masood, said a report reaching here Monday from the Afghan
capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, did not say when Khairadmand, once a key
commander of the anti-Taliban Hizb-i-Islami, was killed.
</P>
<P>
The incident has caused unrest in Badakhshan area and an
alarmed Masood, commander of another major faction of the
anti-Taliban alliance, subsequently sent a representative there to
defuse the situation, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The representative, however, narrowly escaped an attempt on his
life by the sympathizers of the assassinated governor, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Afghan watchers say the elimination of Khairadmand
once again validates that Masood would not share power with any
other major warlords and would like to have a single-handed
control within the anti-Taliban alliance.

<HEADLINE> 9 Injured in Election Violence in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were reportedly
injured in an election campaign-related clash Monday between
supporters of the ruling People's Alliance (PA) and the opposition
United National Party (UNP) in Sri Lanka's North Western Province.
</P>
<P>
Tension continued to mount in the run-up to the North Western
Provincial Council polls scheduled for January 25 and 526
incidents of violence have been recorded since December 7, 1998,
the Center for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
The release said Monday's incident took place in the afternoon
when a group of about 100 UNP supporters were distributing party
leaflets near the PA office at Galgamuwa in the Kurunegala
district.
</P>
<P>
PA member of parliament for Kurunegala district Bandula
Basnayake alleged that the confrontation occurred when the UNP
supporters threw a couple of stones at the PA office.
</P>
<P>
However, former Minister of Posts and Telecommunications A.M.S.
Adikari, a UNP member, said the PA supporters initiated the clash
by throwing stones at a convoy of vehicles in which he was
traveling.
</P>
<P>
Complaints have been lodged by both the PA and the UNP alleging
that the other party initiated the confrontation, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
CMEV was formed in 1997 by the Center for Policy Alternatives,
the Free Media Movement and the Coalition Against Political
Violence as an independent and non-partisan organization to
monitor the incidence of election-related violence.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Withdrawal of U.N. Peacekeepers  From Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- All 15 Security Council
members on Monday are circulating a report on Monday by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who recommended the United Nations
put an end to peacekeeping operations in Angola because the
Angolan Government and UNITA rebels were both determined to wipe
out each other by force.
</P>
<P>
In his 26-page report, Annan told the Security Council there
was no more peace to keep and U.N. personnel could no longer
function. The shooting down of two U.N. aircraft last month was
"an outrageous crime" aimed at intimidating the world body, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The events of the last few months have clearly demonstrated
that, for all intents and purposes, the Angolan peace process has
collapsed and the country is now in a state of war," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected most of the 1,000 U.N. military, police and
civilian personnel to be out of the southwest African country by
March 20. Some 200 infantry soldiers would be asked to protect
U.N. property for another 4 to 6 months until the withdrawal of
the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) was complete.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the expressed determination of the parties to test
their fortunes on the battlefield, the steadily worsening security
situation and the inability of MONUA to carry out its mandate, it
has become increasingly clear that, for the time being, the
conditions for a meaningful United Nations peacekeeping role in
Angola ceased to exist," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said both the Luanda government and UNITA had "committed
themselves either to 'neutralize' their opponent politically or to
escalate the military confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Annan said he hoped a U.N. human rights unit would be able to
stay in the country. He also said it was necessary, in view of
thousands of displaced people and untold brutalities against
civilians, for relief workers to carry on their work. But this
meant assurances from all parties for their safety.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been in and out of Angola since 1989. In
1994, it brokered a peace accord that ended for nearly four years
of the country's two-decade civil war.
</P>
<P>
Annan attributed the collapse of the peace process to UNITA,
the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, because it refused to comply with the 1994
accord, called the Lusaka Protocol. This demanded UNITA
demilitarize its forces and allow a national administration in
territories it controlled.
</P>
<P>
He estimated the United Nations, its programs and relief
agencies, had spent up to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in support of
the peace process in Angola, a former Portuguese colony.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of African countries
fighting in Congo (K) have agreed to sign a cease-fire to end a
five-month civil war, Namibian President Sam Nujoma said in
Windhoek Monday, according to a report from the Namibian capital.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Laurent Kabila and rebels fighting to
topple him had agreed to sign, although on the basis they would
ink separate documents, said Nujoma, adding that regional leaders
would now be summoned to the Zambian capital of Lusaka for the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"The parties have agreed to sign a cease-fire. We also
discussed security concerns of Congo (K) and the deployment of a
peace-keeping force that will be created by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and United Nations," the Namibian president
said.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma was addressing a press conference after talks between
the leaders of Rwanda and Uganda, which have backed a Tutsi-led
rebellion against Kabila, and Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, whose
troops are fighting on the side of Kabila against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Neither representatives of the Congolese government nor the
rebels were invited to Windoek. The rebellion, which started in
early August, has drawn in troops from eight African nations
including Chad and Burundi apart from the above-mentioned six
countries, and threatened the stability of the entire central and
east African region.

<HEADLINE> Fixed Asset Investments in Singapore Fall in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore attracted 7.8
billion Singapore dollars (about 4.7 billion U.S. dollars) in
fixed asset investments in 1998, down from the record high of 8.5
billion Singapore dollars (5.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country attracted 1.6 billion Singapore
dollars (950 million U.S. dollars) in total business spending last
year, slightly lower than the 1.9 billion Singapore dollars (1.2
billion U.S. dollars), the Economic Development Board (EDB) of
Singapore announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Local companies have a 33-percent share in the fixed asset
investments while the United States, Japan and Europe accounted
29, 23 and 13 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies were the largest contributor to the country's
total business spending with a share of 33 percent. It was
followed by Singapore, Europe and Japan which shared 32, 27 and 3
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
EDB Chairman Philip Yeo told a press conference that the 1998
investment commitments in both manufacturing and services will
generate an added value of about 8.5 billion Singapore dollars
(5.1 billion U.S. dollars) and create more than 22,200 jobs when
they are fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Yeo Said the investment climate in 1999 will continue to be
challenging. But he expressed his confidence that the "EDB will be
able to attract investment commitments comparable to what we have
achieved in 1998."
</P>
<P>
Yeo also said, "Our priority is still to bring home investments
that create good jobs for our people."
</P>
<P>
Some 27,000 workers were retrenched in 1998, the highest yearly
figure since the 1986 recession in the city state.
</P>
<P>
In short term, the EDB will station more officers in overseas
centers to intensify investment promotion efforts in Europe, the
United States and Japan and it will help promising local
enterprises upgrade their capabilities and move beyond regional
markets in their efforts to weather the economic crisis, Yeo said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls for New Way of Responding to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said on Monday that France is considering all ways to respond to
the massacre last Friday of 45 ethnic Albanians by Serb forces in
the village of Racak in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Elysee presidential palace said that Chirac does not
exclude a complete change of the existing mechanism set up by the
international community for solving the crisis in the Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
No option is excluded when deciding new ways to respond to the
situation in Kosovo, said the same source.
</P>
<P>
France considers that the international community remained
"paralyzed" after the massacre took place.
</P>
<P>
The French president said that the agreement reached in
mid-October between the U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic is outdated after the Racak massacre,
which changed completely the situation, according to the Elysee
palace.
</P>
<P>
The agreement called for a ceasefire between government forces
and the Albanian separatist forces, the KLA, under the control of
the mission of verification of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was aimed at stopping the chain of
violence and helping relaunch peace process in Kosovo, has solved
nothing and should be re-evaluated in an impartial way while
taking into consideration all elements, said French presidential
entourage.
</P>
<P>
During a speech to the Paris-based diplomatic corps on January
7, Chirac called for a strong diplomatic action in Kosovo for
helping go out of what he called "the dangerous impasse."
</P>
<P>
He said that the situation in Kosovo was worsening and the
perspectives for a negotiated solution were "taken far away."
</P>
<P>
He said that those responsible for the crimes in Kosovo should
not be allowed to get away without punishment and should be
brought to the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague.

<HEADLINE> No Rush for Euro Banknotes, Coins: de Silguy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Commission
official said on Monday that most of the member countries of the
euro zone would not rush for the launch of euro banknotes and
coins.
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European commissioner in charge of
financial, monetary and economic affairs of the European Union,
told a press conference after the union's finance ministers met
that a large majority of the ministers felt that it is not
possible to start the circulation of euro banknotes and coins
ahead of the time schedule set forth in Madrid in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Most ministers saw no possibility for the change and they
think it would not be appropriate for logistic reasons," said the
commissioner who attended the one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Belgian Finance Minister Jean-Jacques
Viseur told the press that he would draw the attention of his
counterparts at the meeting toward shortening the transitional
period between now and January 1, 2002, when euro banknotes and
coins will start circulating in the 11 member countries.
</P>
<P>
Oskar Lafontaine, German finance minister who chaired Monday's
meeting, said that there was not much of a point in discussing the
change of the timetable for the entry of euro into circulation
though some suggested that it may boost the confidence in the
new-born currency.
</P>
<P>
Euro or the single currency for Germany, France, Italy, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Finland,
Ireland and Austria already started to serve as accounting units
on January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
There will be a transition period of six months after January
1, 2002 for each participating nation in the single currency to
replace its national currency with euro completely.
</P>
<P>
There are also suggestions that this transitional period be
shortened.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Ambassador Displeased with Swiss Police's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Yugoslav permanent
mission Ambassador Branko Brankovic said he was displeased with
Swiss police's reaction during a demonstration in front of mission
around noon here in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Roughly 25 people gathered at the Yogoslav mission to protest
the massacre which occurred over the weekend in Kosovo and
demanded to talk to representatives from the mission, Brankovic
said in a telephone interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
As no one in the mission came out to speak to the
demonstrators, he said, some of them attempted to jump over the
fence into the Yugoslav mission.
</P>
<P>
Brankovic said that Swiss police arrived at that time at the
mission's request but did not intervene, claiming that the
demonstration was "peaceful and political".
</P>
<P>
Brankovic said that he was unhappy that the Swiss police acted
as onlookers in the incident and insisted that they should stop
the intruders.
</P>
<P>
According to reports by the Swiss television, among the
demonstrators were Mayor of Geneva Andre Hediger and national
parliament member Christian Grobet.
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt during the demonstration which lasted about 30
minutes.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Says No Early Cut in Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Brazilian Finance
Minister Pedro Malan said on Monday that interest rates were
unlikely to fall soon following his country's decision to allow
the currency, the real, to float.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after weekend meetings with officials
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the U.S. Treasury,
Malan said IMF-backed changes to tax and spending rules were an
essential precondition to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Malan said Brazil needed to redouble its efforts on the
fiscal front.
</P>
<P>
Some of the parameters of 41.5 billion dollar rescue program
signed between Brazil and the IMF would have to be revised to take
account of the new exchange rate, said Malan.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's central bank said earlier on Monday it would allow the
real to float, abandoning a previous policy of holding the
currency within a broad range against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it would intervene occasionally in a limited
fashion to curb steep currency swings.

</P>
<P>
Speaking after the talks, Simitis described the talks as

Finland held identical views on the allocation of EU funds.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Lipponen, whose country will become the EU

Finland and Greece hoped for community solidarity for a just

The Finnish premier also said that Helsinki supported Cyprus'
accession efforts toward the EU and hoped Greece and Turkey to
settle their differences through the International Court of
Justice at the Hague.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Committed to Peacekeeping in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern Monday said his country is committed to the peacekeeping
mission in south Lebanon to help maintain stability and peace
there.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who started a three-day official visit to
Lebanon on Sunday, made the remarks in a tour of the villiage of
Qana outside the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 people, mostly Lebanese civilians, were killed in
the village during the 1996 Israeli blitz on the country in
retaliation for Hezbollah's rockets attacks on its north.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been leading a
guerrilla war to oust Israeli occupying troops out of Lebanon
since Israel carved out a self-styled security zone in the south
of the country in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said his country will work hard in the framework of the
European Union to help achieve peace and end the suffering of
residents in the area.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with relatives of victims of Israeli attacks,
Ahern came to the village of Tibnean where his country's 500
soldiers are serving within the United Nations peacekeeping
forces.
</P>

<HEADLINE> French Parliament Opens Congress on Constitutional Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The two houses of the French
parliament Monday opened a joint congress in Versaille, south of
Paris, on the reform of the 1958 Constitution, to pave the way for
the formal adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty by France.
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam Treaty, approved by 12 European Union countries
in 1997, requires France to abandon by 2004 some fields of
sovereignty over border control, immigration and political asylum,
which are protected by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The treaty also asks national parliaments to be informed on EU
plans on foreign, security and interior affairs, instead of
economic and monetary policies only.
</P>
<P>
This is the 10th time for the French Constitution to be amended
in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Although the congress is expected to collect a three-fifths
majority in support of the treaty from the deputies of the
National Assembly and the Senate, some political parties and
figures are strongly opposed to the move.
</P>
<P>
The French Communist Party national secretary Robert Hue said
that Amsterdam Treaty follows the logic of economic
ultra-liberalism, which he said is rejected by the people.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted that the French people are not given the
right to express their views on the treaty through a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Some rightwing politicians, including former Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua, and the far-right National Front are also firmly
opposed to the constitutional referendum.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of demonstrators protested outside the 17th century
wing of the Versaille Palace, where the congress was opened by
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
The protesters shouted "Shame to the traitors!" "Amsterdam,
treason!" and waved banners of the National Front and the French
tricolor national flag.

<HEADLINE> Pluto Set to Lose Its Status as Major Planet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The nine major planets orbiting
the Sun may soon drop to eight, as astronomers are holding a
global email ballot to decide whether to reclassify Pluto, the
solar system's tiniest planet.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of members of the International Astronomical Union,
the only internationally recognized authority for naming celestial
bodies, have beening voting on the issue, The Daily Telegraph
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A decision may be made within months," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
There is now a growing campaign among astronomers calling for
the demotion of Pluto, the smallest and most distant major plant
in the solar system, from its status.
</P>
<P>
Pluto, 500 times smaller than the Earth and only two-thirds the
diameter of our Moon, is just an over-sized comet or perhaps an
asteroid, some experts have claimed.
</P>
<P>
The argument about the reclassification of Pluto has been
brewing for decades and began shortly after Pluto's discovery in
1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in
Arizona, the United States.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of astronomers say that if Pluto was
discovered tomorrow, it would never even occur to them to link it
with the Big Eight planets, The Daily Telegraph said.

<HEADLINE> 200 Civilians Killed as UNITA Attack Angolan City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 200 civilians were
killed and 380 others injured when the rebel forces of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
launched an attack on malanje City, capital of the Malanje
Province in northern Angola.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA assault, which has lasted for 15 days, has destroyed
many houses and caused heavy casualties in the southern part of
the city, sources from the health departments said.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the central hospital of the city said that there was
even a supply crisis in medicine and blood with the hospital,
which was eased until the government airlifted some 800 kgs of
medicine and a great number of liters of blood.
</P>
<P>
The sudden influx of 20,000 people into the city from the
fierce fighting suburban areas, have further deteriorated the
living condition there, with the prices of daily necessities
shooting up to an unbearable level and many stores having been
closed down, social welfare department officials said.
</P>
<P>
UNITA forces have captured 11 of the 14 cities in Malanje
Province, and are trying to take the capital city since January 2.
And situation in northern Angola's Uige and Zaire provinces are
also very serious.
</P>
<P>
UNITA started its northward advance since the start of the year
from central Angola's Huambo and Bie provinces.

<HEADLINE> Countries Involved in Congo (K) Conflict Agree to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Five african countries involved
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) war have agreed to a
cease-fire Monday and made an undertaking to seek the assistance
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the U.N. in
establishing a peace keeping force.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing after a meeting of leaders of countries of
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola, Uganda and Rwanda who discussed the DRC
conflict in Windhoek, Namibian president Sam Nujoma said the
withdrawal of foreign troops would be worked out by the peace
keeping force, the Zimbabwean News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said the U.N. would be approached through U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan who in turn would make a presentation
to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting was attended by Zimbabwean president Robert
Mugabe, Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan president
Pasteur Bizimungu and Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
Angolan president Eduardo dos Santos was represented by his
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was initiated by Museveni with the hope of
translating previously held consultations into action.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad have sent troops to support
DRC president Laurent Kabila's government while Rwanda and Uganda
are reportedly backing the DRC rebels trying to topple Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was prepared for the Lusaka summit which was
postponed repeatedly for the third time after consultations
revealed it was not possible to have a cease-fire agreement
signed.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, Nujoma said the mini-summit was not a
diversion from the original Lusaka summit.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for this summit is to build up mutual trust and
confidence, to iron out any remaining technical matters and to
reach a firm agreement on the way forward," Nujoma said.

ATHENS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday condemned the
massacre of over 40 ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, saying that such acts were detrimental to a defusion of
the crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least 42 unarmed ethnic Albanians were
killed in Kosovo in recent days. Ethnic Albanians blamed Serb
police for the killings but the latter said that they killed
several dozen ethnic Albanian "terrorists' in clashes with them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that blame for the killings should be laid on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
He added that Greece hoped those responsible for the killings
would be arrested and held to account.
</P>
<P>
The only way to end the crisis would come from the U.N.
Security Council resolutions concerned, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Greece supports the peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis,
saying that the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo should be given a wide-
autonomy with the respect of the present Yugoslav borders.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Warns Against Possible Bubble In Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street sent a strong
signal Monday, warning U.S. investors against a possible bubble
in stock market.
</P>
<P>
The recent stock market could easily be described as more
"irrational and exuberant," the Wall Street Journal said in an
article carried in its front page. "Irrational exuberant" is a
phrase uttered by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
two years ago when the Dow Jones industrial average was at 6437
points.
</P>
<P>
The warning came two days before Greenspan testifies on
Capitol Hill. The Journal said, the recent buoyance in the stock
market worries both Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert
Bubin.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the financial trouble in Brazil provided at
least a temporary interruption in the euphoria in the New York
stock market. Still, after Friday's rally, the Dow index ended
at 9,340.55, a 45 percent higher than it was when Greenspan
issued his admonition, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The Federal had been expecting a weeker - or at least less
robust - stock market to help slow the economy this year. When
the Federal began its round of interest-rate cuts in the fall,
the market had slumped. That made it much more likely that the
long-predicted slowdown in economic growth would actually
occur," the Journal said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Federal officials insist that they can't
know for sure if the stock market has risen to the point at
which it is likely to burst, or whether its rise reflects the
impressive strength of the U.S. economy and the prospects for a
technology-induced era of prosperity and productivity gains. but
they know it was a bubble after it has burst.
</P>
<P>
The Journal quoted a published Federal summary of the
meeting last fall as saying that some Federal policy makers
argued against cutting interest rates in November presidely
because they feared it would boost stock prices.
</P>
<P>
"With almost any historical comparison suggesting that the
stock market is very pricey, Federal officials worry more about
this question than they used to, and they're talking about it
more in public," it said.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alice Rivlin has said in more
than one interview recently that the stock market is high by any
kind of valuation. "you have to be extremely optimistic about
earnings to justify these stock values," she said.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Doctor: Yeltsin's Gastric Bleeding Stopped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's gastric ulcer bleeding has been stopped and a surgery
may be avoided, his chief doctor, Sergei Mironov, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is more or less calm," Mironov told the NTV
television channel.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, was checked into the Central Clinical Hospital
Sunday for acute gastric ulcer bleeding.
</P>
<P>
"There is every reason to believe that we will overcome the
situation without surgery," Mironov said.
</P>
<P>
No micro-surgery is being performed except for the acupuncture
around the ulcer, Mironov said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a protracted ulcer disease. This is an acute
bleeding stomach ulcer," he said. "Such a condition may develop
within hours. This is exactly what happened."
</P>
<P>
Tests show "fortunately, the ulcer is flat rather than
exhaustively expanded," Mironov said.
</P>
<P>
A final decision on Yeltsin's stay in hospital will be made
Wednesday, when the main gastroscopic test is being planned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will have to stay at the Central Clinical Hospital for
at least two weeks, Mironov said. The president will be able to
resume going to the Kremlin for his work in two weeks and a half
or in three weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mironov said Yeltsin may be barred from air travel for the next
two and a half or three months, which means that the president
will not be able to make any foreign trips.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was scheduled to visit France January 28-29. His last
trip overseas was in early October, when he had to cut short the
visit to Central Asia because of illness.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the president "considered several documents and held
several telephone conversations," Mironov said.
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin's mood could hardly be assessed as festive, but it is
far better today than it was (on Sunday)," the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin's gastric bleeding could be caused by "the
difficult heart surgery, a somewhat weakened immune system leading
to a number of colds and a certain burden of medicines which are
having to be taken to correct the situation."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin underwent successful quintuple heart bypass operation
in the Central Clinical Hospital in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mironov said the latest check shows Yeltsin's heart performance
is "rather stable."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Cautious Not to Assess Shuttle Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government used
cautions on Monday while making assessment of the ongoing shuttle
talks by U.N. resident representative to Cyprus Dame Ann Hercus.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Christos Stylianides said the Cypriot government did
not know what Hercus had discussed with Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash each time.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides' remarks came in an apparent reponse to statements
made by Hercus earlier in the day that soome progress had been made in
the ongoing shuttle talks.
</P>
<P>
Hercus made the remarks after meeting with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the Cypriot government participated in the
talks because it was under the U.N. Secretary-General's auspices
and was supported by the Security Council and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to comment on a set of ideas adopted by the
U.N. on an overall framework agreement on Cyprus, which Hercus
previously described as a substantive document.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
Hercus began shuttle talks with the two sides last October in a
bid to reduce tension on the island and press a settlement.

</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has agreed to sell the state-owned Beni Suef
Cement Factory to Lafargue of France at 1.8 billion Egyptian
pounds (529.41 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under a deal between the two sides, Lafargue will invest 120
million dollars into the factory to double its annual production
to 2.8 million tonnes, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lafargue has also agreed to pay the factory's debts estimated
at 900 million pounds (264.7 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sale was approved Thursday at a meeting of Egypt's
Privatization Committee.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has decided to take part in Kazakhstan Expo '99
to be held in Alma-Ata from April 27 to May 2, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will display foodstuffs, clothes, leather products,
building materials, ceramics, electronic and electrical sets,
carpets and furniture, perfumes and medicines at the fair.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's state electricity Electricite du Liban
recorded an estimated deficit of almost 184 million U.S. dollars
for 1998, which is equivalent to 30 percent of its annual
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
According to Banque Audi, the country's leading bank, the
company's deficit is mainly due to rising debt-servicing, a
significant wage and salary bill, and on the revenue side, to low
collection of payments.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese Minister of Finance George Korom has pledged
not to devalue the Lebanese pound despite the fact that it has
steadily appreciated during the past six years.
</P>
<P>
His pledge came as a response to an international financial
report saying that Lebanese pound was 45 percent overvalued.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Lebanese economy is highly dollarized,
with the Lebanese pound used for relatively few transactions.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Celso Amorim, president
of the U.N. Security Council, said on Monday that he did not
expect the Council's upcoming consultations on Kosovo to be
productive, but "it is important for the U.N. to give appropriate
attention to the situation" in the Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Amorim, Brazilian permanent representative to the United
Nations, made the statement as he was stepping into the Security
Council chamber for the unusual meeting held on holiday, which
marks the end of Islamic Ramadan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that (the consultations) will be productive,
but I think it is important for the U.N. to give appropriate
attention to the situation" on the ground in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of two million, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I called the meeting on my own initiative," he said, adding
that he had got a letter from the Albanian ambassador to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Albania, condemning the killings as a "monstrous crime,"
called earlier on Sunday for an urgent debate in the Security
Council and direct intervention on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will meet behind closed doors on Kosovo
at 1:30 p.m. EST, and the decision came after the bodies of 45
civilians were discovered on Saturday last week in the village
of Racak in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
An earlier statement from the Yugoslav Permanent Mission to
the United Nations said that the Serb policemen came under
attacks from terrorists as they were on their way to the village
of Racak to arrest another terrorist group who killed a police
officer five days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Serb police were forced to fight back after one policeman
was wounded and several government vehicles were destroyed.
Although the Government of the Republic of Serbia sent an
investigation team immediately after the exchange of fire to the
fighting site, the efforts to conduct on-the-spot probe were
prevented by terrorist armed ambushes, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke in Kosovo after ethnic Albanians sought
independence from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<P>
LUANDA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos and his counterparts from both Congos mapped out a common
strategy in politics, foreign affairs, military and economics
during their meeting here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The strategy was reached by Dos Santos and Congo (K) President
Laurent Kabila and Congo (B) President Denis Sassou Nguesso after
their three-hour long talks on regional security, a joint
statement issued after talks said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that their countries are facing similar
questions, which have been caused by interest-propelled powers
from outside.
</P>
<P>
Only through a common strategy could the three countries solve
the problems within a common framework, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders also decided to have regular meetings after
the talks, ting, the first for the three in 1999. The three
leaders met in Luanda, capital of Angola and Brazzaville, capital
of Congo (B).
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos' armed forces are currently engaged in renewed
fighting with rebels of the national Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), an enemy for two decades.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe sent troops to Congo
(K) to assist Kabila in his five-month battle against tutsi rebels
claimed to be backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The meeting did not appear to be linked to the talks in
Windhoek, capital of Namibia, between the belligerents in the
congo (K) conflict.
</P>
<P>
Angola, but not Congo (K), sent representatives to the namibian
capital to attend the talks between Congo (K) allies Namibia and
Zimbabwe, and Uganda and Rwanda.

productive, but "it is important for the U.N. to give appropriate
attention to the situation" in the Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Amorim, Brazilian permanent representative to the United
Nations, made the statement as he was stepping into the Security
Council chamber for the unusual meeting held on holiday, which
marks the end of Islamic Ramadan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that (the consultations) will be productive,
but I think it is important for the U.N. to give appropriate
attention to the situation" on the ground in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of two million, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I called the meeting on my own initiative," he said, adding
that he had got a letter from the Albanian ambassador to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, at least nothing (was) prepared (for today's
meeting), maybe some delegations will come with something. I don't
have anything myself," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to bring about the discussion on the subject
because of the emergent situation (in Kosovo)," he said, "Of
course, the Council could not stand idle while these things are
happening."
</P>
<P>
Albania, condemning the killings as a "monstrous crime,"
called earlier on Sunday for an urgent debate in the Security
Council and direct intervention on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will meet behind closed doors on Kosovo
at 1:30 p.m. EST, and the decision came after the bodies of 45
civilians were discovered on Saturday last week in the village
of Racak in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
An earlier statement from the Yugoslav Permanent Mission to
the United Nations said that the Serb policemen came under
attacks from terrorists as they were on their way to the village
of Racak to arrest another terrorist group who killed a police
officer five days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Serb police were forced to fight back after one policeman
was wounded and several government vehicles were destroyed.
Although the Government of the Republic of Serbia sent an
investigation team immediately after the exchange of fire to the
fighting site, the efforts to conduct on-the-spot probe were
prevented by terrorist armed ambushes, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke in Kosovo after ethnic Albanians sought
independence from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federal Security
Service avoided comment on Turkey's claim Monday that leader of
the Kurdish Workers Party Abdullah Ocalan had arrived at an
air-force base outside Moscow, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said in Ankara that Ocalan
had left Italy for Russia.
</P>
<P>
"According to highly reliable sources, the separatist
organization's chief Abdullah Ocalan went to Russia and landed at
an airdrome outside Moscow," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted a high-ranking
Kremlin official as saying that Ocalan was definitely not in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"No man with the name of Abdullah Ocalan is going anywhere in
Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has ordered a
verification of the reports, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"On orders from the chairman of the Russian government, the
corresponding services are checking whether the information about
Ocalan has any grounds," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Russian Aeroflot office in Rome also denied
allegations that Ocalan had left Italy on board its plane, Tass
reported.

CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid expressed hope Monday that an upcoming meeting
of Arab foreign ministers would help restore Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation

Commenting on reports that Saudi Arabia will not take part in a
possible Arab summit to be attended by Iraq, Abdel-Meguid said the
question of such a summit has not yet been settled.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Prison Taken Over by Alleged Mutineers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The imprisoned Lesotho
mutineers Monday took over the Central Prison in Maseru, the
capital of Lesotho, South African National Defense spokeswoman
Laverne Machine said.
</P>
<P>
"They have taken control of the prison. They do have weapons,"
South African Press Association quoted Machine as reporting.
</P>
<P>
"Our task force commander, prison wardens and the Lesotho
police are in a planning meeting in Maseru. We do have a
contingency plan but we have to finalize the legal ramifications
first," she said.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how many people were involved.
</P>
<P>
On September 11 of last year, Lesotho junior soldiers aligned
to opposition parties staged a mutiny and arrested more than 20 of
their seniors, including army chief Lieutenant-General Makhula
Mosakheng.
</P>
<P>
On 22nd of the month, the South African National Defense Force,
followed by the Botswana troops, crossed the border into Lesotho
at the invitation of the Lesotho government to quell mounting

The prisoners took the weapons from the wardens and the LDF

<HEADLINE> Belgium Investigates into Deaths of Premature Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Belgium launched on Monday an
investigation into the deaths last week of two prematurely-born
babies whose deaths were blamed on the mis-labelling of a
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Belgian television RTBF said that the investigation would focus
on some 900 ampoules of medicine for injection that were declared
to contain glucose but instead contained chloride of potassium
that is a toxic substance to new-born babies.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Public Health Minister Marcel Colla is scheduled to
meet on Tuesday the executives of the German pharmaceutist Braun
that manufactures the medicine and that has expressed willingness
to compensate for the parents of the deceased babies if a link is
established between the use of its medicine and the deaths of the
premature babies.
</P>
<P>
The two prematurely-born babies, one with a weight of 900 grams
and the other two kilograms, died after receiving injections of
the medicine. The injection was claimed to have later caused
heart arrests in babies. The bigger baby died two days later than
the smaller one. Both deaths happened in a local university
hospital in Louvain.
</P>
<P>
The medicine in question has been produced by an affiliate of
Braun in Berlin and a Braun spokesperson said on Monday that the
factory would fully cooperate in the course of investigation.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1988, a similar case of mis-labelling of Braun medicine
caused dangerous situations in a Brussels hospital.
</P>
<P>
The medicine was wrongly labelled as containing chloride of
sodium for chloride of potassium. The injection caused heart
problems in two adult patients but did not turn out to be lethal.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia Monday urged Yugoslavia
to reverse its decision to declare the head of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission in Kosovo
persona non-grata.
</P>
<P>
"This decision may further aggravate the situation in Kosovo
and seriously complicate the process of settling the situation in
the area by political means," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in
a statement carried by Interfax.
</P>
<P>
Russia is calling on Belgrade not to implement the decision and
to create all necessary conditions for the work of the OSCE
mission in compliance with the tasks set for it by the U.N.
Security Council and the OSCE, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia resolutely condemns the escalation of violence in
Kosovo which may undermine the international efforts to settle the
Kosovo problem by political methods," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"All crimes, including the latest tragedy in the village of
Racak, should be thoroughly investigated with the participation of
international independent experts. The culprits should receive the
punishment they deserve," it said.
</P>
<P>
It was referring to the discovery over the weekend of bodies of
45 ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo village of Racak.

Russia has decided to send a special envoy, First Deputy
Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev, to Yugoslavia as soon as
possible, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made on Cyprus Problem: U.N. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Resident Representative
to Cyprus Dame Ann Hercus said Monday her efforts to resume
intercommunal dialogue and reduce tension in Cyprus has made some
progress.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, Hercus
said, "so you can make a sensible assumption that as long as you
see me shuttling, that means that some progress is being made."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy described her latest meetings with British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
as successful, adding both of them expressed commitment to the
U.N. initiatives over the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
She stressed a set of ideas adopted by the U.N. on the
fundamental issues of the Cyprus problem remains a "very useful
document."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula, but the peace talks have
been stalled since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hercus has been engaged in a shuttle between the two sides
since last October in a bid to reduce tension on the island and
pressing a settlement.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The direct or indirect
incorporation of Taiwan in the Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation
Guideline constitutes an infringement on China's sovereignty, and
is firmly opposed by the Chinese government and people, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi stated today.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in reply to a question concerning the
related issue at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed the Japanese government's clarification to
the Chinese side through the diplomatic channel that the recent
remark by Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the Japanese Liberal Party, is
totally wrong," Sun said, adding that the Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation is a bilateral arrangement made under special
circumstances in the Cold War period, and that such an
arrangement should be strictly limited within the bilateral scope.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa said on January 14 that the surrounding areas mentioned
in the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guideline include Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that if such an arrangement is extended beyond the
bilateral frame after the Cold War, it will certainly arouse the
concern of Japan's neighboring countries
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taiwan issue is entirely an internal affair
of China, noting that "no one has the right to interfere in this
issue."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's First Stock Market Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The opening of Vietnam's first
joint stock market will be postponed for the third time should the
country fail to equitize an additional 400 state-owned enterprises
this year, the Vietnam Investment Review reported in its latest
issue.
</P>
<P>
It had been hoped that stock markets would commence trading in
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City last October, but the plan was delayed
until at least the end of this year due to a shortage of public
companies for listing on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
State Securities Committee Chairman Le Van Chau said the
economic crisis in the region had forced a "re-calculation" of
plans to open stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam launched its equitization process in 1992, but progress
has been slow. It planned to equitize 150 state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) last year, but only 98 reached full equitization.
</P>
<P>
To date, 150 enterprises have registered for permission to sell
shares, but most are too small, according to Deputy Finance
Minister Tran Van Ta.
</P>
<P>
The official said, "We plan to equitize more medium and large
firms this year, but often small-sized companies do not attract
enough investors."
</P>
<P>
At least half of Vietnam's SOEs should be sold to the public,
merged or dissolved because they are too small and inefficient,
said another government official.
</P>
<P>
SOEs account for 42 percent of Vietnam's gross domestic product
and around 66 percent of industrial output.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Gain From Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The launch of the euro provides a good opportunity for Thai
exporters because they can export their products to all member
countries of the European Union (EU), Supachai, was quoted as
saying by Thai News Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The launch of the euro will also help enhance the
competitiveness of the exporters," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the establishment of an effective distribution network
is necessary to support the opportunity, Supachai said, suggesting
that local exporters jointly work out distribution strategies with
their partners to help expand their markets.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, also commerce minister, said Thai importers of
products from the EU would also benefit when individual countries
in the EU are phasing out of their currencies for the single euro,
but all trade must be quoted in the euro from January 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who is a front-runner in the race to become the new
director-general of the World Trade Organization, recommended that
Thai exporters open bank accounts in the euro and closely monitor
the movement of the currency.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Thailand's third largest export market after the
United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
Major exports are computers and parts, garments, vehicles and
parts, electrical circuits, gem and jewelry, shoes and footwear,
and television sets and parts.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Curbing Output Imperative for Price Pick-up(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The curb in production will help push the existing buyer's
market more towards a seller's, thus reversing the severe
imbalance in demand and supply and rationalizing the prices,
noted Yang Xiaoning, Director of the Development Research Center o
f Metallurgical Economy.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese government has already designated the
metallurgical industry as one of the four sectors for major
structural readjustment this year, analysts now believe it is a
good time for such improved efficiency to be introduced.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring is also imperative because of the Asian
financial crisis, which has dramatically reduced China's exports
to neighboring countries and thus worsened the imbalance in
demand and supply, Wang Wanbin pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The government has already announced a series of policies to
encourage the restructuring, which the industry has been seeking
for years.
</P>
<P>
Measures include closing a number of enterprises which are
heavy polluters, high consumers of energy and whose products are
of poor quality. Others include escalating the program of getting
rid of outdated equipment and production techniques; while others
require state-owned enterprises to take the lead in curbing
production and imports thus encouraging exports.
</P>
<P>
Although the plans have been welcomed, many pundits observe
that there will be many difficulties in implementing them.
</P>
<P>
The main questions taxing Chinese metallurgical experts are
how to effectively encourage a pick up in prices by readjusting
the demand and supply; and how to cut the production of poor
quality goods while increasing those still in short supply.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan and Zambia have just
signed an agreement under which Japan will provide Zambia's health
sector with equipment worth 600 million Kwacha (240,000 U.S.
Dollars) as well as technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
A five-man Japanese team is still in the country to do an
annual review on the Primary Health Care (PHC) project from
January 10 to 20.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's local newspaper, the Post, quoted lkou Takizawa,
representative of Japanese International Cooperation Agency
(JICA), as saying JICA would provide basic laboratory equipment to
nine health centers in Zambia this year to try to improve
diagnostic skills at health centers.
</P>
<P>
"We are also trying to promote a referral system between the
different levels of health care in Lusaka district," he said.
</P>
<P>
Takizawa said JICA was also providing support to health centers
through the training of health workers in a bid to improve the
management of staff there.
</P>
<P>
Kashiwa Bulaya, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Health
who signed the agreement for the Zambian government, said the
University Teaching Hospital (UTH) is not in a position today to
provide training for community health workers or carry out
research because of weak Primary Health Care (PHC).
</P>
<P>
"This is congesting the hospital. The project Zambia and Japan
signed in 1997 put in place a system with the objective to
strengthen PHC services and decongest UTH," said Bulaya.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Launches Campaign to Prevent Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China's capital of Beijing
recorded 4,763 fires last year, which killed forty people,
injured over 100 and caused 42 million yuan in damage losses.
</P>
<P>
In north China such incidents are generally concentrated in
the winter-spring period and authorities in Beijing met today to
plan how they can more effectively tackle fire-fighting this
year.
</P>
<P>
A senior governmental official acknowledged that the city has
many environmental and structural problems which may lead to furth
er fires.
</P>
<P>
Many parts of the city's 200-kilometer long gas pipes and
tunnels have not been properly maintained and need immediate
action and repair, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Fire-fighting squads have also been told to strengthen the
monitoring of the 760 petroleum or gas storage centers and
stations in the city which supply over two million local
residents.
</P>
<P>
In addition, old houses, basements and commercial centers,
especially furniture stores lacking efficient fire-fighting
facilities, can easily become engulfed in severe conflagrations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that these fire risks are eliminated," the
official warned, calling on all relevant departments involved to
make serious efforts to prevent fires and reduce the economic
losses.
</P>
<P>
The city also announced it had imposed penalties on 66
building complexes and work units, as well as five individuals,
who have violated the fire prevention regulations.
</P>
<P>
The complexes and units were closed or fined between 20,000 to
160,000 yuan (about 2,400 to 19,200 U.S. dollars) and the five
people were taken into custody for trial.

MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sunday explosion of a car
outside the U.S. embassy in Moscow was caused by an explosive
device, Interfax reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The device was attached to a rear wheel and connected to the

</P>
<P>
A police officer assigned to help guard the outside of the

car was damaged and several windows in the embassy building and
in an adjacent apartment building were blown out.

<HEADLINE> China Expels Doubt on Preparatory Committee for Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Portuguese Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) and the Preparatory Committee for the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) have separate functions and
the two will not influence each other, a Chinese official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
JLG, explained that the JLG was set up in accordance with the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration signed in 1987 to make
preparations for Macao's smooth transition and the transfer of pow
er from Portugal to China.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee, however, was organized to pave the
way for the establishment of the Macao SAR, Han told reporters at
a recess of the 34th session of the JLG, which began here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
"Their work may overlap to some extent while they carry out
their functions, but under no circumstances will one institution
influence the other," the Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
The confusion occurred after the Preparatory Committee, which
was founded last May, passed some resolutions concerning the
future Macao SAR, such as Macao's public holidays in 2000, the
stationing of Chinese troops in the SAR and the election of the
region's first chief executive.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many committee members have voiced their views
about certain issues in Macao, such as the use of accumulated
fiscal savings by the Portuguese Macao government and pension
payments for retired civil servants.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Curbing Output Imperative for Price    Pick-up (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China will limit the
production and imports of iron and steel and eliminate more
outdated equipment and techniques this year in a bid to reverse
the fast price downturn and improve the general efficiency of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
The measures, announced during an on-going national
metallurgical meeting held here, is seen as an enhanced
determination to curb the detrimental effects of the oversupply
and price falls in the industry, market analysts point out.
</P>
<P>
The iron and steel output respectively rose to 32.6 million
tons and 24.5 million tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, industrial profits fell sharply to two billion yuan
(about 240.96 million US dollars) last year, as against the
highest recorded profit of 29.4 billion yuan in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, steel output has grown at an annual rate of
five to six percent, much higher than the two to three percent
deemed necessary to ensure the eight percent growth of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Wanbin Director-general of the State
Administration of Metallurgical Industry (SAMI), although steel
output has exceeded 100 million tons, the industry's economic
returns have not risen accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Despite the surge in output, the country still has to import
huge amounts of high-tech products of high added-value which are
in short supply.
</P>
<P>
"The oversupply is relative, reflecting structural problems in
the sector," Wang observed.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Metallurgical Firms to Go Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua)-- Four to five of China's
metallurgical firms will go public this year to secure funds
which might lift the sector out of its loss-making state.
</P>
<P>
News of the plan came from Zhang Lailiang, head of the State
Administration of the Metallurgical Industry's structural reform
and legal construction department today at an on-going national
conference on metallurgical industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that another two to three already listed companies
will also seek permission to offer rights issues.
</P>
<P>
Zhang added that the funds raised on the stock market will be
about the same level as last year's 6.77 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Handan Iron and Steel, Taiyuan Iron and Steel and
four other companies were listed on the stock market, raising 5.2
billion yuan. The Panzhihua Iron and Steel and five others
offered rights issues and new shares, raising 1.517 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, 27 iron and steel companies in China have traded
on the stock market, raising 24.56 billion yuan of capital.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoning, an economist with the bureau, said that in a
relatively tight macro economic environment the industry has
suffered decreased profitability in recent years but that public
companies "are basically all profitable."
</P>
<P>
The expert declared that provided China scales down its
metallurgical output and imports, the industry is expected to
witness a substantial growth in profits this year.

BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's world renowned

</P>
<P>
Jiang Junxian, general manager of the original 135-year-old
Beijing Quanjude roast duck restaurant said it has applied for
registration of the trade mark in 37 countries.
</P>
<P>
Quanjude is so powerful and hugely popular that many

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States ambassador
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said Tuesday that
bombing of Yugoslav forces in Kosovo could begin immediately
unless Belgrade ended its offensive in the province.
</P>
<P>
Talking to journalists from the British Broadcasting
Corporation, Ambassador Alexander Vershbow said that air strikes
could take place within days if (Yugoslav President) Slobodan
Milosevic's posture was "one of total defiance".
</P>
<P>
NATO held an emergency meeting last Sunday to discuss the
situation in Kosovo after the killing of 45 ethnic Albanians in
Racak, a village in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance decided to send two of its top
officials to Belgrade to persuade the Yugoslav government to end
its offensive.
</P>
<P>
NATO Military Committee Chairman Klaus Naumann and NATO
Supreme Commander in Europe Wesley Clark left for Belgrade on
Tuesday and are expected to brief the NATO decision-making body

Directors of political affairs from the foreign ministries of
France, Germany, Britain and Italy will attend the meeting but
the level of representatives of the other Contact Group members
the United States and Russia is not yet known.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Muslims Celebrate Fast-Breaking Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 17 million Muslims in
Xinjiang, a multi-ethnic area in northwest China, gathered at
mosques today to celebrate the festival of Fast-Breaking, the
most important Muslim event in the calendar.
</P>
<P>
Xieri Pujiang, an 84-year-old Imam at the Yanghang Mosque, a
renowned one in the regional capital, asked young people to
respect the aged and keep on good terms with neighbors and
friends, and reiterated the harm of drinking.
</P>
<P>
At a family reunion, he said "Fast-Breaking is a festival of
reunion. My children come to my house whenever the festival
falls."
</P>
<P>
Iman's seventh son, Muhe Tarem, came to his father's house
early this morning and offered him a helping hand to stage the
religious ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The young man, a post-graduate in religious studies in Libya,
said he is more interested in new ideas compared with his father.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, a beeper is a must for me, with which I contact
with my friends and neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I watch TV news everyday and care about what is happening in
and out China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some people also held their family reunion party in

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Returns to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein flew his
plane and touched down in the kingdom for the first time in six
months, during which he underwent cancer treatments in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Apparently in high spirit, the king stepped down his Boeing 737
to the delightful crowd at Marka Military Base in northeast of the
capital who were here to welcome his return. Smiling, the king
kissed, hugged and talked with them.
</P>
<P>
Among thousands of people in the welcoming ceremony were
Jordanian Crown Prince and the Regent Hassan Ibn Talal, Royal
family members, Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh, cabinet ministers
as well as heads of diplomatic corps in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Also present were Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben
Khalifa Al Thani, whose planes arrived at the same airport hours
before Hussein's private plane touched down at 2:55 p.m. local
time (1655 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his wife Queen Noor, Hussein piloted the plane
himself during his flight from London.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab heads of state have also voiced their desire to
visit King Hussein after he returned home, including Saudi
Arabia`s Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, and the Sultan of Brunei Paduka Seri Baginda
Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Jordanians braved the freezing rain to
line the streets, waiting to see the king when his motorcade
marches through downtown Amman towards his home in Hummar, west of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
Workers of the Greater Amman Municipality raised flags,
millions of colored lights, and giant posters of the king across
the streets to celebrate his return.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's welcome ceremony marked the beginning of a three-day
celebration. The monarch left Jordan in mid-July 1998 for a
six-round chemotherapy for lymphatic cancer at the Mayo Clinic,
Rochester, Minnesota, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The king had stayed in Washington and London for more than two
weeks for recuperation after he left the Mayo Clinic last December.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said in a statement issued at his London house on
Monday that he would launch a comprehensive review of the
kingdom's situation during his six-month absence.
</P>
<P>
The king's return sparked hopes, joys and expectations among
Jordanians, who were experiencing two-digit unemployment rate and
a sluggish economy in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Study Mobile Phone Radiation Emission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia is going to start a
comprehensive study into the health effects of radiation emitted
by mobile phones within weeks in Adelaide, South Australia.
</P>
<P>
Closely watched by international health authorities and the
global telecommunications industry, the
1-million-Australian-dollar (630,000 million U.S. dollars)
two-year study is being launched by the Institute of Medical and
Veterinary Science (IMVS) and the University of Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press (AAP) said researchers will use
1,600 mice, half of which have been genetically manipulated to be
more susceptible to tumors, to examine the biological effects of
mobile phones' low-level radiation.
</P>
<P>
Five levels of radiation will be tested on the mice which will
be subjected to a dose of radiation for one hour a day, five days
a week, for two years.
</P>
<P>
The experiments will be conducted in a decontaminated
laboratory and monitored by an international panel.
</P>
<P>
Chief scientist Tim Kuchel, head of the IMVS veterinary
sciences division, said the study will be the largest and most
sophisticated of its kind in the world and could have far-reaching
economic and political ramifications.
</P>
<P>
The study follows other ones that have shown changes in cells
caused by radiation and a pilot study conducted in Adelaide four
years ago which found an increased incidence of tumors in
transgenic mice exposed to radiation.
</P>
<P>
"That was what has caused such interest, the fact that --
albeit with only one dose rate and perhaps insufficient animals --
a biological effect has been observed is very interesting," Kuchel
told reporters.

GUANGZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A combined promotion jointly
offered by tourist authorities of neighboring Hong Kong, Macao

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said on Tuesday that India is moving closer toward signing the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Brajesh Mishra, the top advisor of
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, Chirac called on
India to sign the CTBT and expressed satisfaction over the
progress made by India in this direction, said French
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Chirac and Mishra was held within the
framework of "strategic dialogue" between France and India, said
the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for Chirac to meet with Mishra since
June 1998, after India conducted four underground nuclear tests,
which were followed by five tests by its rival Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told Mishra at that time that France and the
international community were deeply worried by the risks brought
about by the tests to the stability of Asia and the future of the
non-proliferation regime.

KAMPALA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni returned home Tuesday after attending a one-day regional
summit on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) held in Windhoek,
Namibia on Monday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Yang Yang Tells Her Growing Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, Jilin Province, January 19 (Xinhua) -- She was
crying alone in the Beijing Capital Stadium Rink after her
teammates finished training and left. Half an hour later, she
felt better and walked out of the building.
</P>
<P>
The lonely girl was multiple world champion Yang Yang, who
just came back from the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano with
a silver medal in the women's 1,000-meter short track speed
skating race.
</P>
<P>
But it was not the medal she sought after.
</P>
<P>
"I have been trained really hard. I want to prove I can win
world and Olympic titles despite my Olympic failure," said the
24-year-old Yang Tuesday after she won three golds in the
National Ninth Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I was so tired and frustrated that I have to cry to
relieve pressure," she explained.
</P>
<P>
Yang led over defending champion Chun Lee-Kyung all the way in
the 1,000-meter final in Nagano until the South Korean beat her
by a tip of a skate at the finish.
</P>
<P>
Coming back more mature and stronger, she impressed the world
championships in Vienna last March, grabbing three gold medals in
1,000m, 1,500m and 3,000m relay to take the all-round title.
</P>
<P>
"I became a mature skater after the Olympics. I got more
consistent in the World Cup Series and in the world
championships. Above all, I no longer fear to lose."
</P>
<P>
For the first time competing in the World Cup Grand Prix
Series, Yang eventually emerged as an all-round winner after she
took all the six legs around the world.
</P>
<P>
Just two years ago, however, no one tipped her as the future
world number one as she was only a backup for her namesake Yang
Yang (Older Yang) and Wang Chunlu, who both skated in the
Lillehammer Games in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"I recruited her to the national squad in 1995 for she was
from Heilongjiang Province, not because of her results," said
Chinese head coach Xin Qingshan.
</P>
<P>
The national squad was mainly composed of skaters from
Changchun and Jilin, two cities of Jilin Province, with Yang the
exception.
</P>
<P>
"I never imagined Yang could be the leader of the team and the
best skater in the world. She is the biggest surprise to me," Xin
added.
</P>
<P>
Yang won the confidence of the coach after she rose from
nowhere to take the women's 1,500m gold in the Asian Winter Games
in Chinese city Harbin in February, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something to show my strength. The Asian Games
was the best chance for me to stand out in international races."
</P>
<P>
"Some skaters from South Korea were better than me, but I have
confidence in myself. The South Koreans were tamed by my prowess."
</P>
<P>
Older Yang, who won three silvers in the Nagano Games, said
Younger Yang was the one who held her rivals in awe.
</P>
<P>
"She was even aggressive in practice and usually intimated her
rivals before the competition started," Older Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"Competition makes me stronger," said Younger Yang. "Once a
South Korean journalist asked me what helped me most, I answered,
'competing against top South Korean skaters.' He fell wordless."
</P>
<P>
"My dream is to win gold medal in the 2002 Olympics in Salt
Lake if there is a Games there," Younger Yang said. "I hope to
keep my form for three more years."

<TEXT>
<P>
Supported by a vocal center court crowd, the energetic
Australian thrashed the Frenchman 6-3, 6-1, 6-1 to set up a
second round match against Germany's Tommy Haas.
</P>
<P>
Punching the air after each point, Hewitt got inspired by the
crowd as the match swung his way early.
</P>
<P>
He held his first service game to love and lost only one point
the second time he served. By the seventh game he had broken
serve before he wrapped up the first set in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
The second and third sets saw the 17-year-old run down passing
shots, charge the net and volley his way to an unbelievable
victory.
</P>
<P>
Not once did Hewitt ease the pressure on Pioline who has a
better than average record at grand slams having been runner-up
at the French Open (1997) and the US Open (1993).
</P>
<P>
Hewitt may now be a big upset in the severely depleted top
half of the draw where Andre Agassi is the highest seeded player
at No.5.
</P>
<P>
He first thrust himself into the limelight just over 12 months
ago when he won the Australian hardcourt title in Adelaide in
only his second senior tournament.
</P>
<P>
This year he started off similarly with a final appearance
again in Adelaide and last week he ousted Patrick Rafter in the
opening round in Sydney at the Adidas International
</P>
<P>
Pioline's scalp will go alongside that of Andre Agassi whom
Hewitt defeated in Adelaide, Rafter, Nicolas Keifer, who Tuesday
knocked out Carlos Moya, and Jason Stoltenberg (twice).
</P>
<P>
French Open champion Carlos Moya was also disposed of on
Tuesday by Germany's Nicolas Kiefer in the first round match at

MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has abandoned plans to visit France next week and tentatively
rescheduled the journey for mid-March, a senior aid said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's foreign policy assistant Sergei Prikhodko said the
understanding was reached during Yeltsin's telephone conversation

Mironov, said Monday that Yeltsin would be barred from air travel
for two and a half to three months.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin regretted that his sudden sickness did not allow him
to make the visit on the planned date, which originally scheduled
for January 28-29.
</P>
<P>
Chirac "expressed full understanding of the situation and
wished the Russian president a speedy recovery", Prikhodko said.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Better Settlement of Major Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The localization of civil
servants and the law and the use of Chinese as an official
language remain to be the major issues concerning Macao's smooth
transition and power transfer from Portugal to China, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG), made the remarks in a
recess of the 34th session of the JLG, which began this morning.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and Portuguese officials with the group
acknowledge that the Macao government has made new progress in
localizing civil servants in the past year.
</P>
<P>
However, Han noted that quite a lot of work has to be done to
localize civil servants at the department level, the highest rank
of Macao's civil service.
</P>
<P>
"A proper settlement of the problem has close relations with
the stability of civil service in Macao and the smooth transfer
of civil servants," he said. "The work must be handled well."
</P>
<P>
With the fact that many laws in Macao have been copied from
Portugal and large quantities of government decrees were issued
only in Portuguese, officials from both sides believe that there
remains work of large magnitude in localizing the law.
</P>
<P>
"Experts from both sides need to pore over the law and then
hold consultations with good preparations," Han said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the use of Chinese, Han pointed out that the
official status of Chinese must be carried out practically, so
that it can be used successfully as soon as the Macao Special
Administrative Region is established.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Crasher Maker Breaks Land in China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Finland-based Nordberg Group
launched its first wholly funded factory of rock crushing
equipment in the Asia-Pacific region here today.
</P>
<P>
Olli Vaartimo, president and chief executive officer of
Nordberg, said that the establishment of the Tianjin factory will
greatly promote the competitiveness of the company's products in
China market.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is planning to invest one trillion U.S.
dollars in infrastructure and other construction projects in the
next three years. He said that these construction projects will
create great demand for powerful crashers that produce large
amount of aggregate.
</P>
<P>
China's increasing investment in infrastructure aims to
stimulate economic growth and invigorate relevant industries
including construction equipment. However, China's rock crasher
manufacturers cannot turn out products that reach the
technological and quality levels of similar foreign products.
China uses 1.6 billion tons of aggregate every year. However,
because of poor crashing equipment, only two percent of the
aggregate meets the national standard.
</P>
<P>
Vaartimo said that Nordberg's crashers are especially good at
producing quality aggregate for highways and large construction
projects. In the past few years, the company has reported
double-digit growth of sales in China market.
</P>
<P>
As one of the leading crasher makers in the world, it has
already supplied crashing equipment to several major construction
projects in China, including the Three Gorges Dam, the Hong Kong
new airport and the Dexing Copper Mine in Jiangxi province.
</P>
<P>
Nordberg opened a representative office in Beijing in 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Tuesday that there is a growing risk of war in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and that time is running out for
avoiding such a war.
</P>
<P>
"If the talks don't start soon, if the status quo continues
and anti-guerrilla actions multiply, guerrilla warfare will
increase in Kosovo and the conflict will get out of control,"
said Vedrine in an interview with the daily Le Parisien published
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He blamed both Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
Albanian separatist forces, the KLA, for failing to honor the
ceasefire agreement signed in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
He said that those responsible for the killing of 45 ethnic
Albanians in Racak last Friday should be brought before the Inte
rnational Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also expressed his fear that the fighting
in Kosovo could spread to neighboring Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro.

BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin
announced today that 1999 has been designated "the greening year"
for China's pollution-ridden capital.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that the city has already reached its 2000 year
target for 40 percent of Beijing's public areas to be covered
with grass and trees. However, more trees are to be planted, as
an average Beijing citizen now occupies a piece of greenery of
only about eight square meters, much smaller than the world
average.
</P>

The face-lift campaign, according to observers, will support
Beijing's program to bid for the 2008 Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Acting PM Sees More Lively Debate on Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Acting Prime Minister Tim
Fischer Tuesday predicted an even more lively debate among
ministers on the country's republic movement as the year advances.
</P>
<P>
Fischer denied that the government was being unsettled by
differences in opinions among senior ministers on the matter,
despite the fact that pro-republic ministers and
pro-constitutional monarchy ministers had opened up serious and
bitter divisions.
</P>
<P>
"A year ago we had the constitutional convention which made
certain decisions by way of a communique," Fischer told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The federal government is honoring that communique and as part
of that decision there was always going to be those for, those
against, there was always going to be a case of a referendum being
held in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We will deliver on that, there will be a referendum in 1999
and there's going to be an onward debate and more detailed debate
later in the year as we get close to that referendum."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Employment Services Minister Tony Abbott stirred up
pro-republicans in the coalition by declaring the republic
Australia's constitutional Viagra.
</P>
<P>
Pro-republic ministers Monday hit back over attacks that they
do not represent mainstream sentiment and promised to wage a
strong campaign in what they described as a "battlefield" to win
support for a republic.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister John Fafey and Environment Minister Robert
Hill have declared their determination to support the "yes" vote
when the republican question is put at the November 6 referendum.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard, who is now on vacation, Deputy
Prime Minister Fischer and Industry Minister Nick Minchin among
others are believed to be supporters for a constitutional monarchy
system.

<HEADLINE> China to Step Up Financial Supervision (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank announced
today that in 1999 it will implement appropriate monetary
policies and further step up its supervision of the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC),
said at the annual national financial working meeting which
opened today that financial reforms will be continued and efforts
will be made to maintain balanced international payments, prevent
financial risks and further improve financial services.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that China's financial sector operated smoothly in
1998. By the end of last year, the amount of deposits in
financial institutions was 10.3 trillion yuan, up 16.2 percent
from the beginning of the year, while the amount of loans was
9.39 trillion yuan, up 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1998 the supply of money increased 15.3
percent, which played a significant role in promoting national
economic development.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the central bank took a critical reform
step in 1998 by restructuring its organizational system, with the
financial macro control smoothly shifted toward indirect control.
</P>
<P>
Effective supervision measures adopted in the year helped
alleviate the risks of some financial institutions, he said,
which played an important role in maintaining social stability
and preventing financial risks.
</P>
<P>
An important achievement last year was maintaining the
stability of the yuan exchange rate and international balance of
payments, which reinforced China's status in the international
financial community.

He said that major credit support will be given to infrastruc
ture construction, the upgrading of enterprises' technologies and
consumption. Equal support will be given to foreign trade
companies, small enterprises with good performance and rural
township construction.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the focus of financial supervision, he said by
the end of 2000, a financial risk management warning system and a
financial supervision responsibility system will be established
in a bid to cut down commercial banks' bad loans, prevent payment
risks for medium-sized and small financial institutions, achieve
a marked improvement of the financial order and protect national
financial security.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central bank will implement a series of
effective measures to reinforce its supervision of state-owned
commercial banks, including the establishment of a board of
supervisors, the completion of a new loan classification system,
and the establishment of financial asset management companies.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that maintaining a stable yuan exchange rate
and sufficient foreign exchange reserves will be the key for
foreign exchange management in 1999, stressing that China has the
ability to reach the two goals.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts will also be made to improve the central
bank's services, which include financial expertise and technolog
y, the clearing of transactions, treasury management, cash supply
and financial statistics.

<HEADLINE> Germany Warns Against NATO Military Moves in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer warned Tuesday against resorting to any swift NATO
military action in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo district.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said in an interview with German Press Agency (DPA)
that "the situation is far too serious for muscle flexing".
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the West needed to keep a cool head in dealing
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and rejected
accusations by Germany's conservative opposition that Bonn was
not taking a clear position on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Asked about possible NATO military operations in Kosovo,
Fischer said the West should wait and see if any results came
from talks between NATO military leaders and Milosevic in
Belgrade later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO suspended - but did not cancel - its activation order for
air strikes last October. The activation order clears NATO
military commanders to launch bombing strikes on Yugoslav
military targets.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's comments came amid mounting tensions after the
Yugoslav government declared Monday it was expelling the head of
an international truce monitoring team in Kosovo after an alleged
massacre of some 45 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- An official with the China
Power Corporation said today the company recorded a profit of 8.6
billion yuan last year thanks to the restructuring of the power
generation industry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country generated 1,160 billion kwh
of electricity last year, up 2.5 percent from a year earlier. The
company sold a total power volume of 410 billion kwh, up six pe
rcent, and absorbed contractual overseas investment of 1.79
billion U.S. dollars, up 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official declared that this year the company has set a
target of earning profits of at least 8.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The corporation made significant breakthroughs in
restructuring the country's power generation system, he added.
With 160-billion-yuan of state capital and 770-billion-yuan of
state assets, the corporation aims to transform itself with
modern operating methods and a stock-holding system.
</P>
<P>
The country's power transmission grid has also been upgraded,
and 87 urban grid projects and 1,590 rural ones are under
construction.
</P>
<P>
The country also restructured its power generation industry by
closing small thermal power plants with high coal consumption and
poor efficiency. So far, a number of small thermal power
generators, which have been the cause of severe pollution, have
been forced to cease their operations, with a total capacity of
2.84 million kw.

BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- With a 7,000 strong audience
resonating to the rhythm of his hugely popular hit Right Here
Waiting," and young music fans lighting up the darkened concert
hall with fluorescent sticks, American singer Richard Marx tran
sformed Beijing's Capital Stadium into the world largest
karaoke house.
</P>
<P>
The rock and roll star performed his first concert in China

cold to see the singer, kept their spirits high during the
18-song performance which they had been invited to freely sing
along with.
</P>
<P>
Hearing his most famous romantic ballad,Right Here
Waiting", the excited audience even sang louder than their
favorite performer.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving his chilly Chicago hometown, Marx said that he
was confident about the success of the China tour. He said he
loved the music fans here who are familiar with his albums.
</P>

The 35-year-old Marx has been at forefront of the pop music
business for many years and is one of the earliest western
singers introduced to Chinese music fans ten years ago. At least
20 million copies of his four albums have been sold in global
markets.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Marx, who likes wearing jeans, has great number
of Chinese fans.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing pop fan, who tried desperately to get a ticket, said
outside the stadium, "I studied English while listening to
Richard's songs."
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about the style of his music, but I'm so
interested in knowing about Western culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You can dance as you want, you can also sing with me," Marx
shouted to the audience at his first concert in the capital. And
Chinese fans showed their enthusiasm and knowledge of his songs
with loud applause.
</P>
<P>
Marx, together with his five American accompanists, gave Bei
jingers a special song named One More Time", which had never
been performed outside the United States.

The singer also invited a Chinese girl sophomore to play sax
as accompaniment. The 20-year-old Zhou Haiyan, who studied at
Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, joined Marx
for his Endless Summer Nights"song.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's food prices continued
rising last December as the inflation rate for the month increased
by 4.l percent to reach 5.6 percent compared with an inflation of
1.5 percent recorded in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Director of Census and Statistics, David Diangamo, said in a
press statement released Tuesday that the inflation, or the
persistent increase in the general level of prices, has been
increasing since early this year, making acquisition of basic food
even more expensive.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the rising inflation observed last
December was mainly due to price increases in food items, fuel,
charcoal, electricity charges and clothing.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Statistics Office, the year-on-year
inflation rate for the composite group, both low and
non-metropolitan plus high metropolitan income groups, now stands
at 30 percent compared with 26 percent in November.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Control over Release of Quake Forecast (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China will strictly implement
new regulations on earthquake forecasting and will punish those
who release quake forecast without authorization, said Cao
Kangtai, deputy-director of the Legislative Affairs Office of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
Cao stressed today at a press conference that any person or
organization with earthquake forecast results should send the
information to the local earthquake departments and should not
release them to the public, or they will suffer penalties.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations, which include specific guidelines for
Beijing, came into effect on December 17, 1998 and stipulates
that all such forecasts should be released by governments above
the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
Anyone spreading quake rumors will be detained for 15 days as
well as receiving a fine.
</P>
<P>
Short-term forecasts for possible earthquakes in the capital
have to be discussed by relevant departments under the State
Council as well as the Beijing Municipal Government before being
delivered to the State Council for approval. The final results
will be released by the Beijing Municipal Government, according
to the regulations.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Consumer Inflation Drops in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's official
year-on- year consumer inflation rate was 9.0 percent in December
1998, 0.4 percentage points lower than in November, Statistics
South Africa announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The annual increase of 9.0 percent in the consumer price index
for metropolitan areas was mainly due to annual increases in the
price indices for housing, food, medical care and health expenses,
household operation and transport, Statistics South Africa said.
</P>
<P>
The core inflation rate for metropolitan areas was 7.8 percent
in December 1998, compared with 7.7 percent in September, October
and November.
</P>
<P>
The difference between the official inflation rate of 9.0
percent and the core inflation rate of 7.8 percent was still
mainly due to the impact of rising interest rates on existing
mortgage bonds during the months from July to September 1998,
which were included in the official inflation rate but excluded
from the core inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The core inflation rate is usually considered a more reliable
indicator for inflationary pressures as it is used by the South
African Reserve Bank as reference to monetary decisions.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition Opens on Works Through Eyes of Two Cultures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of paintings by
Australian Chinese artist Zhou Xiaoping and Australian aboriginal
artist Jimmy Pike was opened today at the National Gallery of
China.
</P>
<P>
With paintings from the hands of two artists from two
different cultural backgrounds, the exhibition, "Through the Eyes
of Two Cultures", presented Australia's unique indigenous
heritage.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, an artist of Chinese traditional painting, met with
Jimmy Pike in 1990, and they soon developed a kind of friendship
which became the basis for a series of collaborative works.
</P>
<P>
During his ten years in Australia, Zhou spent a lot of time in
the jungles with the aboriginal people and was deeply impressed
by their indigenous living style and their way of painting, and
that was gradually reflected in his works.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy spent his childhood in the traditional way, hunting,
gathering, learning the lore and knowledge of his people.
Although his people's art was previously expressed in body
painting, wood carving, and cave painting, Jimmy soon mastered
the techniques of painting in color on paper and canvas, and
began to produce distinctive works derived from his own heritage.
</P>
<P>
One could not find two more different artists: Zhou trained in
an old and sophisticated tradition of fine and highly cultured
work, and Pike with almost no artistic training, from an ancient
hunting and gathering culture in which the only four colors are
applied to the works.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Russell Jack, director of the Golden
Dragon Museum, a sponsor of the exhibition, each artists' work
complements the other's, and their collaborative pieces are
living emblems of cooperation across cultures.

from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Port authorities in Lebanon's second largest city of
Tripoli announced fees cut from February 1, the Arabic-language
newspaper An Nahar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The costs on such services as handling, loading and unloading
cargoes, will be reduced in a bid to attract more business to
Lebanon's northern ports.
</P>
<P>
However, the new rates are not available so far. The cost cuts
will apply to the port's renovated duty-free zone.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Germany will grant Egypt 16 million German marks (9.82
million U.S. dollars) in 1999 to finance its agricultural
projects, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Tuesday.

carried by local newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's reserves fell 220.95 million dollars to 6.148

<HEADLINE> Part of Yellow River in Inner Mongolia Frozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China's famous Yellow River
froze today along a stretch of 580 km in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, according to a report from the regional flood
control office today.
</P>
<P>
The river freezing up is usual but this year is over 20 days
later than in other years as temperatures in many areas along the
Yellow River have been higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
The report said that this year's task of preventing the river
icing up is quite formidable. During the freezing period, water i
nflow from the upper reaches of the river has been increasing,
coupled with high water levels, which has created great
difficulties for local residents in their fight against the ice
in spring.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia in northern China has done its best to combat
icing up along the country's second longest river. A total of
52,000 people from all over the region have been drafted in to
form emergency teams, and supplies of materials and equipment
have been made ready for any rescue work in case dangerous
situations occur.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, special personnel have been assigned to carry
out the work of combating icing in the Yellow River and promptly
deal with the problems found.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has also increased contacts with
reservoirs on the upper reaches to reduce water inflow during the
entire ice period, while asking the air force to blast away the
blocks of ice, if necessary, said a report.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The direct or indirect
incorporation of Taiwan in the Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation
Guideline constitutes an infringement on China's sovereignty, and
is firmly opposed by the Chinese government and people, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi stated today.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in reply to a question concerning the
related issue at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed the Japanese government's clarification to
the Chinese side through the diplomatic channel that the recent
remark by Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the Japanese Liberal Party, is
totally wrong," Sun said, adding that the Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation is a bilateral arrangement made under special
circumstances in the Cold War period, and that such an
arrangement should be strictly limited within the bilateral scope.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa said on January 14 that the surrounding areas mentioned
in the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guideline include Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that if such an arrangement is extended beyond the
bilateral frame after the Cold War, it will certainly arouse the
concern of Japan's neighboring countries
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taiwan issue is entirely an internal affair
of China, noting that "no one has the right to interfere in this
issue."

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Inflation Drops by 7.1 Percent in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate for 1998 in
Mozambique dropped by 7.1 percent against 5.8 percent in the
previous year, said a senior official from the Bank of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Adelino Pinpao, an senior official frorm the Bank of
Mozambique said that the inflation has been kept within the range
of one digit for the second running year.
</P>
<P>
Pinpao attributed the favorable economic climate to the growth
of the country's gross domestic product, the stability of its
currency Metical and the depreciation of South African Rand, the
Noticias newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Institute of Statistics of
Mozambique, Mozambique harvested 1.69 million tons of grain in
1998, a 10 percent growth over the previous year while the prices
of food, beverages and tobacco products decreased by some 2.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The cost of houses dropped by 0.9 percent and that of clothes
and shoes also lowered by 0.4 percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
The value of Metical remained stable. On July 1, 1998, one
U.S. Dollar could buy 11,868 Metical and by December 1 one Dollar
bought only 12,276 Metical. The difference between the official
exchange rate and that on the black market was only two percent.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the devalued Rand, the cost of the imports from South
Africa for January to November of 1998 went down by some 66
million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
And the Mozambican government is trying to keep the inflation
within 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Flu Virus Unlikely to Hit South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Experts with China's National
Influenza Center (NIC) have ruled out the possibility of a
mutated flu virus outbreak in south China.
</P>
<P>
The A-type virus mutation, identified by experts as H3N2, has
swept through north China over the past two months, with doctors
and residents in the south maintaining a high state of vigilance
to ward-off the unwelcome guest.
</P>
<P>
Experts point to a "slim possibility" of a recurrence of last
summer's flu epidemic due to improved immunity measures.
</P>
<P>
"It will be impossible for the virus to cause another epidemic
in such a short period, regardless of the mutation," according to
NIC Director Guo Yuanji.
</P>
<P>
Northerners remain wary of a new flu outbreak since the
previous virus affected almost all age groups and caused patients
to complain of high fever and breathing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, experts have warned of other virulent strains of
flu since the country still stays in the peak season for
influenza epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The mass media in south China has attempted to enhance general
public awareness and advised local residents to ventilate rooms,
particularly rooms inhabited by the elderly, children and
patients with heart problems and chronic illnesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 12.5 billion people
traveled China's highways during 1998, up four percent on the
previous year, according to Minister of Communications Huang
Zhendong.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned figure represented 91.3 percent of the tota
l number people traveling by various means of transportation,
including railways and civil aviation. Huang released the figures
during a national meeting held today in Jinan, capital of east
China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The highway system also handled 10 billion tons of cargoes, or
77.2 percent of the total for all means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
Huang attributed the increase to the construction of new
highways. Total investment in road construction doubled the
original plan and surpassed 210 billion yuan last year due to
national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also adopted a series of measures to develop the
passenger transportation on expressways and in rural areas, as
well as container transport, said Huang.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Decides Not to Retire From Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) --Kenneth Kaunda, the President of
Zambia's opposition party, the United National Independence Party
(UNIP), has reaffirmed that he will not retire from active
politics, responding to the government calls to make his stand
clear.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who was former state president, also made it clear
that he will not hand back retirement benefits he was receiving
from the state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking through his press assistant Muhabi Lungu, Kaunda said
 the retirement package was in line with the law, which he enjoyed
after 27- years of unbroken service to the nation,
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Tuesday quoted Kaunda as claiming
that during his nationwide tour, people pleaded with him not to
retire and urged him to lead the UNIP back to power in the 2001
general elections.
</P>
<P>
 "The BBC report was correct because the issue of Dr. Kaunda's
 retirement has been suspended indefinitely. This follows the
nationwide tour which suggested that this could not be the right
time to retire," said the newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was last week quoted by the British Broadcast
Corporation as saying that he would contest the 2001 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
 Upon his release from prison in mid-1998, Kaunda indicated
his intention to retire from active politics.
</P>
<P>
The government last week challenged Kaunda to make clear his
political stand or face the withdrawal of retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
But the UNIP said that the government had no legal backing to
withdraw the retirement benefits from him.
</P>
<P>
 It is said that Kaunda and the government has concluded an
agreement under which he will get all his retirient benefits as a
former president on condition that he retires from active
politics.
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to force Kaunda to retire, the Zambian
parliament endorsed last September the Benefits of Former
President Amendment Bill which states that a former president
would lose his benefits if he participates in active politics.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Construction Bank of China
(CBC), one of China's top four banks, has pledged to expand its
overseas business in spite of increasing competition on the
international financial market.
</P>
<P>
A research team is currently drafting a plan which will enable
the bank to gain a greater share of the international market,
according to CBC President Zhou Xiaochuan. Zhou made the comment
at today's annual CBC work conference.
</P>
<P>
CBC plans to establish overseas subsidiaries and expand
financial services, in addition to offering traditional services
related to international settlements, overseas fund-raising and
merchant banking, said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
The bank opened a branch in Singapore last year and plans to
establish a branch in Frankfurt later this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the bank is also considering the introduction of
deposit services for the euro and other currencies used in the
euro zone, as well as expanded exchange services for individuals.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the euro has sparked increasing competition
between Chinese and foreign banks, and said the CBC will
introduce concrete measures to deal with the impact and
reconstruct its debt structure in an effort to reduce risks.
</P>
<P>
The bank registered net profits of 850 million yuan in 1998,
with total deposits rising to 14.69 trillion yuan and outstanding
loans climbing to 11.736 trillion yuan.

</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a meeting between South Korean

Kiefer, ranked 37 in the world, defeated the fourth seeded Spa

</P>
<P>
The win robs the Australian Open of yet another drawcard.
</P>
<P>
Moya was considered a serious contender for the tournament's
title following the late withdrawals of Goran Ivanisevic and
Marcelo Rios on Monday through injury and the non attendance of
world no.1 Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
With Moya's defeat, American Andre Agassi is now the highest
seeded player remaining in the top half of the draw.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, ranked sixth in the world and fifth seed for this
event,easily put away Argentinian Hernan Gumy 6-0, 6-3, 6-0 in a
first round encounter on center court this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It also means there are now only five seeded players in the
top half of the draw following Albert Costa's loss to Martin Damm
of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Damm disposed of the 12th seeded Costa 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in a
first round match earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Other than being runner-up in 1997 to Pete Sampras in
Melbourne, Moya has struggled on Melbourne Park's rebound ace

He was a first round casualty on debut in Melbourne in 1996

Kiefer, 21, is playing only his third Australian Open, having
lost in the first round in 1996 and making the quarter final last

north along Lumley Road, which runs on the western tip of the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian officer of the west African peace-keeping force
ECOMOG was quoted as saying that rebels had regrouped in hills
overlooking the Aberdeen District and the Wilberforce military
barracks before infiltrating the western end of the city.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday evening, a man wandering around Cockerill where
ECOMOG headquarters are located, was shot dead after having aimed
his AK-47 gun at ECOMOG soldiers, and the man turned out to be a
rebel, an ECOMOG officer said.
</P>
<P>
A helicopter hired by ECOMOG continued to circle around
Cockerill, marking sorties to and from the Lungi airport.
</P>
<P>
Fighting for control of the eastern part of the capital near
Hastings was still raging Monday although the rebels said they
adhered to the one- week cease-fire announced unilaterally by the
rebels last week.
</P>
<P>
Rebel field commander Sam Bockarie accused Monday the British
Navy of shelling rebel-held positions from off the coast of
Freetown, where its frigate HMS Norfolk is anchored.
</P>
<P>
But, the foreign office in London later denied the accusation,
saying that helicopters from the ship have been used to deliver
medicine and other humanitarian supplies to Freetown residents.

<HEADLINE> APEC China Enterprises Assembly Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China established a special
APEC enterprises assembly here on Tuesday in a bid to promote
economic, scientific and technological cooperation between
Chinese companies and their counterparts in APEC nations.
</P>
<P>
The APEC China Enterprises Assembly and Chinese government
will join in concerted efforts to promote cooperation with
enterprises located in APEC nations and help Chinese firms
cultivate international markets, according to Chen Bangzhu,
vice-minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade
Commission. Wang also chairs the assembly.
</P>
<P>
A total of 126 major Chinese enterprises from various sectors
represent the assembly's initial membership. The list includes
state-owned companies, as well as both private and shareholding
companies.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin announced China's decision to establish
the assembly while attending the 6th APEC Leaders Informal
Meeting last November in Kuala Lumpur of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Asian-Pacific Region is a major area for China's trade and
economic cooperation activities. The trade volume with APEC
nations reached 247.179 billion US dollars in 1997, 76 percent of
China's total trade volume. Foreign direct investments (FDI) from
APEC nations accounted for 82 percent of total overseas invest
ment in China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the Asian-Pacific Region will continue to
be China's leading long-term target for trade and overseas
investments.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang and State Council leaders attached great
importance to establishing the assembly. Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, met with assembly members on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that establishment of the assembly represents
China's new efforts to promote economic, scientific and
technological cooperation in the Asian-Pacific region and ensure
balanced development within the scope of APEC. The assembly
provides a new channel for Chinese firms to conduct cooperation
with APEC nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The fourth session of the
four-party talks on the Korean peninsula began with a plenary
meeting here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which were aimed at reaching a lasting peace
settlement on the Korean peninsula, were launched in December
1997 in Geneva. The four countries involved in the peace process
include China, the Democratic Republic of Korea, South Korea and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session, Qian Yongnian of China, Kim Gye Guan
of the DPRK, Park Kun-woo of South Korea, and Charles Kartman of
the United States shook hands and expressed their wish for the
success of the talks.
</P>
<P>
A preparatory meeting at deputy head level took place on
Monday. Apart from the plenary meeting, the two subcommittees,
established in the third session last October, will discuss the
establishment of a peace regime on the peninsula and tension
reduction during the current four-day talks.
</P>
<P>
Representatives to the meeting hope that the launching of the
two subcommittees will help them deal with certain specific
issues on "the establishment of a peace regime on the Korean
peninsula and tension reduction".
</P>
<P>
The DPRK is chairing this week's talks, which have been

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China hopes to see the formal
launching of the two subcommittees agreed at the last session of
the four-party talks on the Korean peninsula, said the head of
the Chinese delegation here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening meeting of the fourth plenary session
of the four-party talks, Ambassador Qian Yongnian said that to
start substantive work in accordance with the agreement reached
last October would be the major task of the current session.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that a formal announcement will be made on the
establishment of the two subcommittees and the commencement of
their operation at today's plenary," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We will actively participate in the work of the subcommittees
and put forward our propositions and proposals to facilitate an
early establishment of a peace regime on the Korean peninsula,
the tension reduction and an early realization of a lasting peace
and stability there, while giving full consideration to the
opinions of other parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, we hope that all parties will continue to
make unremitting efforts on the basis of what has been achieved
and work for further progress in the course of future talks
through patient consultations in the spirit of starting from easy
issues and moving step-by-step toward harder ones and seeking
common ground while shelving differences, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side, he said, will fully cooperate with the other
three parties in a positive, pragmatic and constructive manner so
as to play its role in the effort to usher in the dawn of a
lasting peace on the Korean peninsula at an early date.

BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China has noticed the recent

<HEADLINE> Net Capital Inflow to Israel Plunges in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Net capital inflow to Israel
was a mere 1.37 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, a plunge from an
average of 6.7 billion dollars in the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Haaretz reported on Tuesday the dramatic drop
came after capital inflow had reached their peaks as Israel was
regarded a favorable place for international investment.
</P>
<P>
Capital influx to Israel registered 7.28 billion dollars in
1997, 4.69 billion dollars in 1996 and 8.01 billion dollars in
1995, according to figures released by the Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of 1998, Israel posted a net capital
inflow of 2.54 billion dollars, before Russia defaulted on foreign
debt payments and brought down emerging markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
About 1.17 billion dollars in capital fled from Israel in the
last four months of 1998, a reversal of trend that an officer of
the Bank of Israel blamed on the Russian crisis and subsequent
events around the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the capital outflow in the last quarter of 1998 was
accelerated by a sudden decline in foreign currency denominated
credit taken by Israeli companies, after years of growth.
</P>
<P>
Companies stopped borrowing in foreign currency and sought to
replace their loans with local shekel-based ones, after the
shekel's rapid devaluation in October and November.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Orders Meetings with U.S. over Stolen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) - Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has instructed his staff to begin high-level meetings
with U.S. intelligence officials over documents allegedly passed
on to Israel by an American Jewish spy, a local daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's order came amid accusations that Israel has failed
to return all classified documents given by convicted spy
Jonathan Pollard, The Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials hoped that the meetings will facilitate the
release of Pollard, who was sentenced to life in jail in 1986 for
passing highly secret U.S. intelligence information to Israel,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is to review the possibility of
releasing Pollard Tuesday in response to the Israeli request.
</P>
<P>
The documents which the U.S. accused Israel of failing to
return include a key surveillance manual containing encryption
codes, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
A story published in the American magazine The New Yorker last
week said that the stealing of the manual, which was described as
so secret that it had never been mentioned in public, and other
documents gravely damaged U.S. intelligence systems.
</P>
<P>
But Pollard's lawyer Larry Dub argued that the manual was
useless because it did not contain encryption codes.
</P>
<P>
Dub said after meeting with Netanyahu Monday that the prime
minister plans to take action to combat what he sees as a
disinformation campaign being waged in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also reiterated his dissatisfaction with Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak for failing to sign a joint letter requesting
that Pollard be released on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
He said it was essential that Barak sign the letter, which was
initiated by cabinet minister Yuli Edelstein a few days ago, on
the day that Clinton is reviewing the question of Pollard's case.
</P>
<P>
In response, Barak said the public declarations about Pollard
had merely "buried him deeper," saying he believes in quiet
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Israel and representatives of Pollard in the U.S. have stepped
up a campaign for his release since Clinton promised Netanyahu
during the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in the U.S. last
October that he would review the case.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials in the U.S. State, Defense and Justice
Departments, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central
Intelligence Agency have submitted their recommendations to
Clinton on whether Pollard should get clemency.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have cautioned against expecting any decision
soon since the officials strongly opposed the idea of freeing
Pollard.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Clinton last week, 60 senators urged the
president to keep Pollard behind bars, saying that "any grant of
clemency would now be viewed as an acquiescence to external
political pressure and a vindication of Pollard's specious claims
of unfairness and victimization."

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Economy Grows at Slow Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) of Mongolia continued its slow growth at 3.5 percent at
constant prices in 1998, said a report on Tuesday by the National
Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The GDP in 1997 increased by four percent. The Mongolian
government had set the economic growth rate for 1998 at 4.5
percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The value of industrial output in 1998 was 234.3 billion
togrog (about 260 million U.S. dollars), 3.3 percent over that of
the previous year. But the country only harvested 190,000 tons of
wheat, the lowest in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate dropped sharply, from 20.5 percent in 1997
to six percent in 1998, much lower than the target of no more
than 20 percent set by the government for the year.
</P>
<P>
However, the exchange rate with the U.S. dollar fell from
831.2 togrog to one dollar at the end of 1997 to 902 togrog at
the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The state deficit stood at as high as 97.5 billion togrog
(about 110 million dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The direct or indirect
incorporation of Taiwan in the Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation
Guideline constitutes an infringement on China's sovereignty, and
is firmly opposed by the Chinese government and people, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi stated today.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in reply to a question concerning the
related issue at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed the Japanese government's clarification to
the Chinese side through the diplomatic channel that the recent
remark by Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the Japanese Liberal Party, is
totally wrong," Sun said, adding that the Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation is a bilateral arrangement made under special
circumstances in the Cold War period, and that such an
arrangement should be strictly limited within the bilateral scope.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa said on January 14 that the surrounding areas mentioned
in the Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guideline include Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that if such an arrangement is extended beyond the
bilateral frame after the Cold War, it will certainly arouse the
concern of Japan's neighboring countries
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taiwan issue is entirely an internal affair
of China, noting that "no one has the right to interfere in this
issue."

Meanwhile, the latest news out of Brazil, that the real
currency would continue to float against the U.S. dollar, was

At the close in Sydney, the Australian dollar was buying 63.31
U.S. cents from its close day of 63.69 U.S. cents.

The local unit languished in sleepy trading during Tuesday's

At the close the Australian dollar was also buying 0.5473 euro

ABU DHABI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- An American artist based in
Dubai is expected to stage what is believed to be the world's
biggest-ever art show in celebration of the advent of the
millennium 2000, the English daily Gulf News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium 2000 Show would dwarf all other art shows in
modern history and would put Dubai at the pinnacle of the artistic
world, said the American John Dishman.
</P>
<P>
"This show will be even bigger than the Salon des Refuses
in Paris 1863 which led to the birth of Impressionism and
the 1913 Armory Show in New York which led to the Abstract
movement."
</P>
<P>
And it will be publicized worldwide through the Internet,
museums, art schools, universities, arts magazines, newspapers,
radio and television.
</P>
<P>
The show is expected to attract up to 20,000 artists from all
over the world, said Dishman.
</P>
<P>
And an award of one million U.S. dollars will be set up for the
10 best works at the show.
</P>
<P>
So far five companies in the United Arab Emirates have shown
interest in the show idea.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Supervision Over Science Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The State Natural Science Fund
Committee (SNSFC) recently established a special committee to
supervise the approval and use of science funds, said an SNSFC
official.
</P>
<P>
The committee will examine reports concerning the approval and
use of the science funds offered by the SNSFC in order to improve
efficiency, according to Director Zhang Cunhao.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of science funds in China complicated the
examination and approval process, and in turn necessitated
establishment of a supervision committee, according to Committee
Director Liang Dongcai.
</P>
<P>
The SNSFC, founded in 1986, has successfully used funding to
enhance the enthusiasm and inspire the creativity of Chinese
scientists. China's science funds have grown by 100 million yuan
(12 million US dollars) annually to some 837 million yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The organization funded 3,553 general, 176 major and 28 key
projects during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said China will substantially increase science funds
during 1999, with related funds expected to account for over a
third of the total investments in basic research.

<HEADLINE> China to Reinforce College English Test (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every college graduate has been required to pursue a CET
certificate since the Ministry of Education revised the college
English teaching outline and established the standard college CET
system in 1987.
</P>
<P>
One expert pointed out that a modern education requires
computer literacy and mathematics, and knowledge of a foreign
language, specifically English.
</P>
<P>
The CET has been a standard used by governmental institutions
and non-governmental enterprises when deciding whether to accept
a college graduate.
</P>
<P>
For those desiring a position in a foreign-invested company, a
CET certificate is not as important, since most companies are
more concerned about practical oral English skills and listening
and writing abilities, which they consider more important than a
"paper certificate."

<P>
At some major institutions such as Qinghua University and
Beijing University, over 80 percent of their participants won
excellent marks in these exams, but some students doubt the
efficiency of such tests.
</P>
<P>
However, Yang Huizhong, director of the National College
English Test Committee, said that up until now, the college CET
has been a credible and efficient standard testing method, which
has gained worldwide recognition, although only partly reflecting
one's English ability. "Almost every test has contingencies and
incompleteness," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ding Ting, a professor of the Central University of
Nationalities, said there is no other testing method that can
replace the current CET, which has been a great benefit to
college English teaching.
</P>
<P>
To appraise a student's overall English ability, some scholars
have suggested that oral English be added to the exam. Shao
Yongzhen, deputy director of the National College English Test
Committee, said that because of the widely varying standards in
different regions, adding oral English is impractical right now.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the CET remains a basic requirement
for college freshmen.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Lambasts U.S.-Japanese-S.Korean Military Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) lashed out at the United States and
Japan over their plan to strengthen military cooperation with
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary published Tuesday, the Rodong Sinmun said the
visits to South Korea by senior U.S. and Japanese military
officials from the beginning of the year and their increased
military cooperation reveal that the three parties are at their
final stage of producing an "Asian version of NATO," the commentar
y said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the triangular U.S.-Japanese-South Korean
military alliance became fully established after Japanese Defense
Agency Director-General Hosei Norota reached an agreement
recently with South Korean officials on military cooperation, in a
ddition to the already existing U.S.-Japanese and U.S.-South
Korean military alliances.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and South Korea are holding talks on
setting up a Theater Missile Defense System. Their military
strengths have been integrated, operation commanding systems
unified and troops tempered in exercises. This demonstrates that
the triangular "Asian version of NATO" military alliance is in
any sense more aggressive and more inclined to intervene than
NATO.
</P>
<P>
The three nations alleged that they conducted military
collaboration because Pyongyang launched a satellite and they
suspect there is an "underground nuclear weapons site" in the
DPRK, but their real purpose is to ensure America's military
dominance in the Asian-Pacific region, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is pushing for the creation of the "Asian
version of NATO," boosting military cooperation with Japan and
South Korea and increasing its military power in the region. As a
result, the Cold War that has disappeared in Europe will come
back to life in Asia, and this is actually what is taking place
in Asia, the commentary warned.
</P>
<P>
It said the DPRK-U.S. confrontation is in essence not centered
on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, such as
nuclear weapons and missiles, but between their ideologies and
social and political systems.
</P>
<P>
As long as the United States maintains its strategic
objective, it is impossible for the DPRK and the United States to
improve their relations. As long as the United States sticks to
its attempt to overthrow the DPRK's social system, a military
confrontation between the two countries will be inevitable, the
commentary asserted.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshis Celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- After a month-long fasting during
Ramadan, Bangladeshi Muslims at last welcomed Eid-ul-Fitr on
Tuesday, their most important festival of the year.
</P>
<P>
Most people were staying at home to enjoy themselves after the
fast, while some others went to parks with their kith and kin, or
to graveyards to pray for their late dear ones.
</P>
<P>
With the Eid already here, the booming Eid shopping in the past
few days was gone, and all markets and shops were closed. The
streets became quite, with few vehicles, no traffic jams, and only
a few pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
The government announced a three-day holiday for the Eid for
people to go back to their home district to see their relatives,
or to visit friends to exchange Eid greetings.
</P>
<P>
Muslims account for nearly 86 percent of the 1.27 million
population of Bangladesh, the second largest Muslim country in the
world, after Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"May the most merciful Allah unite us with the bondage of
brotherhood and harmony on this holy day of Eid... On this day we
pray to great Allah let the coming days bring us peace, fraternity
and prosperity," Prime Minister Sheik Hasina said in a televised
speech on the eve of the Eid.
</P>
<P>
"Let us forget all differences and unite irrespective of party
and opinion... to build Bangladesh free from exploitation and
bring smiles on the faces of our people," she said.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed, in a message on the eve of the
Eid, hoped that the festival, in the ideals of peace, equality and
brotherhood of Islam, would be joyous and beneficial for all,
irrespective of rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
"The gaiety of Eid will help build greater unity and solidarity
among the people by eliminating differences and this will take the
country towards progress and prosperity in democratic
environment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Drop in Car Sales in Kenya Causes Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The automobile business in
Kenya is facing the worst crisis ever, with industry players
saying sales have dropped to an alarming level.
</P>
<P>
An influx of second-hand vehicles have affected the sale of new
vehicles while a depressed economy have led to a lower disposable
income for potential car buyers, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The second-hand vehicles sales have also been equally affected
by the downturn in the economy, with the previous high sales and
fat margins having thinned out, dealers were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Motor Industry Association (KMI) said last week that new
motor vehicles sales dropped by 15 percent to 9,407 units in 1998
due to economic woes among other factors.
</P>
<P>
KMI's bureau said that the down-turn to 9,407 vehicles was less
than half the number required to sustain a healthy and growing
national fleet.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Auto Bazaar Association (KABA) also lamented that the
sale of reconditioned vehicles had dropped because of heavy
taxation.
</P>
<P>
KABA claimed total charges on second hand imports amounted to
71 percent of the import value. Cars that used to sell for 300,000
Shillings (5,000 U. S. Dollars) to 350,000 Shillings are going for
400,000 Shillings to 450,000 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
KABA argued that second-hand imports are not a threat to local
assemblers as they target different markets.
</P>
<P>
However, local assemblers said that they are operating in a
hostile environment compared to overseas manufacturers who get
government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Dealers of both locally assembled and new imported vehicles
have over the years complained that the second-hand imports
threaten to put them out of business.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of reconditioned cars stems from afford ability
and the low purchasing power of many Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
This is partly due to high capital investment, high production
cost and relatively low duty on imported vehicles putting
franchise agents and local assemblers in tight spot.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa based Associated Vehicle Assemblers, General
Motors and Kenya Vehicle manufacturers are among major assemblers
in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a major policy shift, the Kenyan government in the early
1990s liberalized the industry, opening the floodgates for
importation of both new and used vehicles.

<HEADLINE> FAO, WFP Teams Assessing Tanzania's Food Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP) have made a
response to the Tanzanian government's appeal for urgent food
relief.
</P>
<P>
Seven teams sent by the two United Nations organizations, as
well as government officials and observers from the donor
community, left Dar es Salaam Tuesday for various parts of the
country, FAO sources confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The teams will make on-the-spot investigations and then present
their findings to the Tanzanian government and potential donors by
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Donors plan to provide food relief on the basis of the
investigation results, although assessment teams sent weeks ago by
the Tanzanian government reported a shortage of 600,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye
appealed to the international community to provide urgent food
assistance to his country as 13 out of 20 Mainland regions are
facing an acute shortage of food after a prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
A lot of people in the central Dodoma Region are reportedly
feeding on grasshoppers, wild fruits and birds. Some have died of
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
China has already donated 100,000 U.S. Dollars to Tanzania for
food relief.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has released 35,000 tons of food from
the Strategic Grain Reserves and will import 50,000 tons of food
on emergency basis.
</P>
<P>
The duties on maize imports to encourage commercial imports
have been waived for the next three months.

<HEADLINE> British Official Urges Lifting Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior British official has
called for lifting the U.N. sanctions on Iraq and urged the United
Nations to end the weapons inspections in Iraq with a new
monitoring forum, the Khaleej Times reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The only solution for easing the suffering of the innocent
Iraqi people is to lift the sanctions," George Galwy, a member of
the British Parliament and executive chairman of the Labor Party
parliamentary committee for foreign affairs, told the Emirates
News Agency Monday before his departure after a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The blockade has gone on for long enough and the sufferings it
inflicted on the Iraqi people are too much, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that not all British government officials were
in one voice on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of British Parliament members who are
opposed to the policy of bombardment and are beginning to see that
the sanctions are immoral and are not effective in weakening the
Iraqi leadership, Galwy said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the U.N. to reassert its dignity in the
situation as there were reports saying that some of its employees
had been acting as agents for the U.S. and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"There has been enough inspections," he said, and the U.N. has
to restore its credibility by getting rid of U.N. chief weapons
inspector Richard Buttler and coming up with a new form of
monitoring, not inspection.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the British
official held talks with Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Sultan Bin
Zayed al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
The two officials reviewed the possibility of setting up a
cancer convoy for treating Iraqi children suffering from
cancer.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Eases Freight Movements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, January 19 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region has recently introduced a series of positive
measures to improve the environment and service in freight
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the freight supervision bureau of the
autonomous region said that the basic principle of the new
measures is to offer good service and convenient procedures for
the clients, supervise transportation in strict accordance with
related laws and regulations, and try to conform to international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Frontier inspection stations will now concentrate on
monitoring people while the customs office will focus on goods,
thus avoiding repetitive examinations; inspection and quarantine
stations will finish their examinations and necessary procedures
on the exports at the factories or store houses, and they will
examine the imports and exports respectively according to the
categories.
</P>
<P>
The offices will try to perform a combined examination on
automobiles coming and leaving so as to save time. They have also
intensified their own interior management by introducing special
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The freight business has developed speedily in the past few
years as the autonomous region shares a 4,200 kilometer long
border with Russia and Mongolia. Statistics show that the number
of opened freight centers has risen to 18 from just one 50 years
ago, and the total amount of freight has increased from 560,000
tons in 1950 to 4.27 million tons in 1998, the total number of
incoming tourists reached 1.12 million in 1998, while the figure
in 1950 was just 8,000. And the volume of trade reached nearly
300 million U.S. dollars in 1998, a considerable jump on the 1.1
million U.S. dollars in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Financial Crisis Arouses Concern in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Abrupt changes in Brazil's
financial market over the past few days have attracted the
attention of financial professionals and members of the general
public in Beijing, the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the financial turmoil in Brazil is not expected
to have a direct impact on the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
Tan Yalin, an associate research fellow with the Institute of
International Finance under the Bank of China (BOC), said, "The
current international situation creates a slight possibility that
the financial crisis in Brazil will develop into a global
problem."
</P>
<P>
He Yang, director of the Beijing Enterprise Institute,
expressed his belief that the Brazilian financial crisis will not
directly affect Beijing and thus the impact will have little
influence on the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
Major stock exchanges in China have remained basically stable
with slight fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Zou Yongyuan, a professor at the Southwest University of
Finance, said the financial crisis in Brazil did not happen in a
single day. The Brazilian crisis erupted for quite different
reasons than the Asian financial crisis and has not as yet caused
panic in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, the world's eighth largest economy, shocked financial
markets worldwide on January 13 when it abruptly devalued the
real and raised the prospects for a recession in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Associate Research Fellow Tan Yalin said the banking situation
in Brazil has remained normal, and the Brazilian economy has not
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
She voiced optimism that the financial turmoil will calm down
in the near future, but noted that the negative impact of the
crisis on the confidence and psychology of different countries
concerning the developing economy can hardly be neglected.
</P>
<P>
Residents in various major Chinese cities have expressed deep
concern over the crisis. "I've paid special attention to news
about Brazil over the past few days since related events are
important for people investing in stocks," according to Beijinger
Che Dianying.
</P>
<P>
Bi Zhichu, another urban resident noted that "Brazil and China
are developing countries. What concerns me most is lessons the
Chinese Government will learn from Brazil's decision to devalue
its currency."
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe the negative impact on China will be
greater if the Brazilian financial crisis spreads to the United
States, Europe and Asia which are the major investors in China
and China's major foreign trade market.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shixuan, manager of BOC's Beijing Branch said, "The most
direct outcome of Brazil's currency devaluation will be a plunge
in the value of share denominated in U.S. and Hong Kong dollars.
The popular concern concerning the crisis centers on the desire
for stability in the world's financial markets and reversals of
sluggish economic performances."
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian currency was devalued once again on January 15
when the Central Bank of Brazil announced it would not interfere
in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian currency has depreciated 15.5 percent and the
worsening financial situation in the country has produced a chain
reaction worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Economist Xiao Zhuoji pointed to the difficulty in
judging the worldwide significance of the crisis. However, he
noted that the financial crisis of Brazil provides China and
other countries in Asia with a warning that fragmentation of the
state of finances in different countries is not conducive to
solving potential crises.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to intensify global cooperation and monitor
financial situations in order to prevent crises," according to
Xiao.
</P>
<P>
Financial turmoil swept the world in 1998. Nonetheless, China
managed to maintain the value of the yuan, while at the same time
expanding financial reform and adopting various measures to
prevent financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Zhou He, the official in charge of overseas investments for
the Beijing Municipal Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, told reporters that the negative impact of the Asian
financial crisis on Beijing has gradually been dispelled, and the
city's economy appears to be taking a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's 1998 gross domestic product grew by 9.7 percent on
the 1997 level, with the contracted value of foreign direct
investment (FDI) growing by 19 percent to two billion US dollars.
Statistics also show that a large number of multinational firms
invested in Beijing during 1998.

MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of the
Philippines Tuesday lifted a temporary restraining order which
suspended the country's first execution in 23 years and ordered a
lower court to set a date to put a child rapist to death.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the 15 Supreme Court justices voted to lift the
restraint order on the execution of Leo Echegaray, who was
convicted of raping his 10-year-old step daughter. Two justices

</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada hailed the decision and
urged the lower court to set an execution date as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court said that it was clear the Philippines'
Congress would not carry out a review and consequently could not
repeal the death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' Congress voted early Tuesday not to review a
law restoring the death penalty, which paved the way for the
country's first execution in 23 years.

<HEADLINE> Intel Plans To Build Encryption Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp. said Monday
that it plans to develop computer chips that can help scramble
data to keep it secret, a report from the company said.
</P>
<P>
"These high performance chips are going to get Internet
commerce more safe," said Michael Glance, general manager of
Intel's platform security division. And it helps the overall
computer industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Data scrambling technology, known as encryption, has mostly
been the product of software companies, which add it to programs
used to surf the Internet such as browsers.
</P>
<P>
Intel discussed the plans on Monday at a security conference
in San Jose sponsored by RSA Data Security Inc., of San Mateo,
California, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce, however, has imposed limits
on export of the most powerful encryption technology, fearing it
could fall into the hands of criminals and terrorists, who would

<HEADLINE> World Bank Sees Africa Safe From Global Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has expressed
its cautious optimism that African countries are unlikely to
suffer any more blows from the global economic crisis, Kenyan
Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank believes that the large falls in commodity
prices which occurred between June 1997 and September 1998 should
not continue into 1999, the paper quoted the Commodity Markets and
the Developing Countries report as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the report carried in a recent World Bank News
newsletter said that African countries remain highly affected by
volatile fluctuations in prices for primary commodity goods.
</P>
<P>
"Sub-Saharan countries are unlikely to suffer further blows
from the global economic crisis" largely because of their low
integration with the global economy, the currency depreciations in
a number of African countries and the relative strength of their
terms of trade, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that although African countries received lower
prices for their exports, most of that loss should be balanced by
the lower prices they paid for imported goods, especially for
energy and food.
</P>
<P>
The largest price fall in 1998 was for beverages including
coffee and tea which fell by an average of 32 percent, but oil and
petroleum prices dropped by nearly 30 per cent and the average
drop in the price for other commodity goods was 25 per cent., said
the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank report, grain prices may fall again
this year as world coarse grain stocks are expected to climb
above the 1998 level from 879 to 893 million tons. World wheat
stocks are, however, expected to fall to around 112 million tons
this year after reaching 123 million tons in 1988.
</P>
<P>
It is also feared that a good coffee harvest in Brazil could
also torpedo hopes of a recovery in coffee prices for some African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Many African countries still rely on exports or primary raw
materials in exchange for capital goods.
</P>
<P>
Their economic reform programs aim to reverse this by adding
value to the primary products and emphasizing the growth of
agro-based manufacturing enterprises, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Murder Rate Reduced in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's murder rate
has declined from January to November last year compared with
trends over the preceding four years, the latest crime report by
the Safe and Security Department shows.
</P>
<P>
The number of murders per 100,000 of the population stood at 52
in the 11 months of last year. This was down from a rate of 53.1
in 1997, 56.7 in 1996, 59.8 in 1995 and 62.1 in 1994, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
While the trend was heartening, Safety and Security Minister
Sydney Mufamadi said that there is cause for concern over a rise
in some other types of crime.
</P>
<P>
These included short-term increases, which saw housebreaking
rising from a rate of 542.8 in January-November of 1997 to 567.2
in the same period last year, and street robbery from 114 to
131.6.
</P>
<P>
The hijacking of cars between January and November in 1997
increased from 29.1 per 100,000 of the population to 32.7 in the
same period last year, and that of trucks from 9.4 to 12.6.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the rise in some crimes over the past two years
was the most worrying aspect of the latest. "These are receiving
attention," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a
550-million-yuan airport has just begun 11 kilometers from
downtown Bengbu, a major city in east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The airport, scheduled for completion in 2001, will be used to
replace the old one at the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
The old Bengbu Airport was built about 70 years ago. Though
easily accessed, it has done serious damage to the city's
environment and has hampered the development of Bengbu.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is designed to accommodate aircraft such as
Boeing 737s and MD-82s. At least six routes will be opened
linking Bengbu to other Chinese cities, including Shanghai and
Guangzhou, during the initial stage of its operations.
</P>
<P>
Bengbu is a communications hub along the Beijing-Shanghai Railw
ay, a trunk line connecting the country's two largest
municipalities.

BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China's publishing industry
has been thriving in recent years, and now has total assets of 70
billion yuan (8.4 billion U.S. dollars), according to a report in
today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The industry's profits have surged 25 percent annually for the

the Shanghai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China had 565 publishing houses and 120,000 types of
publications generating 7.3 billion copies annually. Total profi
ts for these publishers reached 3.7 billion yuan that year.
</P>
<P>
But in 1978, the country had only 105 publishing houses, with
profits of 300 million yuan, turning out 15,000 kinds of
publications and 3.7 billion copies.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Chinese readers have free choice among 7,918 types
of magazines, far greater than the 930 types in 1978, the paper

<HEADLINE> Shanghai People Help Twins from Flood-Ravaged Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As specially invited guests on a television program about the
welfare lottery, some residents of this metropolis were deeply
moved by the story of the sisters.
</P>
<P>
Last June, a journalist with the People's Daily took a photo
of the twins in the arms of their mother as she looked at her
flood-ravaged hometown.
</P>
<P>
This photo is now printed on welfare-lottery promotions and
can be seen in almost every Shanghai street. The mother's desire
for a new life and a new home and future for the twins aroused
sympathy among the local residents.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the Shanghai Charity Foundation and the city's
welfare lottery center came to Dongxi Village, home of the twins
who were suffering from rickets and poor health due to inadequate
medical care and poor nutrition. With the help of these
organizations, the twins were taken to Shanghai where they
received good medical treatment at the Shanghai Pediatrics
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Soon the skinny twins were gaining weight and becoming more
active, as the hospital's doctors and nurses and other Shanghai
folks continued their care for the twins by giving them food and
toys. At the same time, many other of the city's people and
companies donated large amounts of cash and medicine for the
twins.
</P>
<P>
On the top of the television tower, the picture of the twins
and their parents now look down on the panorama of Shanghai at
night.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks a lot to all the people who gave my daughters so much
concern and help," said the twins' father as the little girls
smiled at the television camera and the warm-hearted Shanghai
audience.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The rehabilitation plan of
Philippine Airlines (PAL) must be in place by March at the latest,
said Peter Foster, the newly designated chief adviser of PAL.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines News Agency Tuesday quoted Foster as saying
that the plan must be acceptable to the creditors and workable
long-term for the airline.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem confronting the national flag carrier is a
plan, which will be submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission of the Philippines, would satisfy its U.S., European
and Asian creditors, Foster said.
</P>
<P>
"But before this, we have to get cash by the end of this month
to pay our principal secured creditors, the people who own the
airplanes. Otherwise, there is danger that they will start to
repossess the fleet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foster urged PAL employees particularly in the finance
department to cut costs and expenses and those in the sales and
cargo were told to generate revenues.
</P>
<P>
Foster and other four have resigned from Cathay Pacific and
began to work with PAL this month as PAL's management advisors.
</P>
<P>
PAL's creditors have rejected the 150-million-U.S. dollar
rehabilitation plan submitted in December, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon to Become Natural Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China plans to enlarge the
current Medog Natural Reserve and change its name to the Yarlung
Zangbo Grand Canyon State Natural Reserve to better protect the
natural resources of the canyon, according to the State Administr
ation of Forestry (SAF).
</P>
<P>
When this is accomplished, the entire Yarlung Zangbo Grand
Canyon, the largest such natural formation in the world, will be
included in the Medog Natural Reserve.
</P>
<P>
"The time is right to extend the Medog Natural Reserve," said
an official with the administration's Wild Fauna and Flora
Protection Department.
</P>
<P>
One section of the grand canyon is currently included in the
Medog Natural Reserve, but, the official noted, this is not
enough to protect the rich natural resources of the entire canyon.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that it is better to establish one natural
reserve rather than set up several within one
biological-geographic system, so the bureau decided to extend the
current Medog Natural Reserve rather than establish a new one in t
he grand canyon area.
</P>
<P>
The Medog Natural Reserve currently encompasses an area of
62,620 hectares.
</P>
<P>
An overall plan has been drawn up in the Tibet Autonomous
Region, and the SAF is now bringing its report to the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
The SAF announced that it will provide funds and technological
support during and after the process of extending of the Medog
Natural Reserve.
</P>
<P>
China has now established two natural reserves in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, abundant in plants and rare wild animals.
</P>
<P>
During the past twenty years, China has sent scientists to
explore the grand canyon several times, and they have made great
achievements, especially recently when a research team hiked
through the canyon on foot.

YINCHUAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.78 million Muslims in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region visited 2,700
mosques throughout the region today to celebrate the end of
Ramadan, their most important religious event.
</P>
<P>
Markets and shops in Yinchuan, the regional capital, are
brimming with various commodities to mark the end of the fasting
period. Muslim cadres and staffers are enjoying a one-day
holiday, with Hui families inviting Han people to attend banquets.
</P>
<P>
The living conditions of Hui Muslims have changed dramatically
since the founding of the autonomous region in 1958. The region's
1998 gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8.5 percent on the 1997
level, with the local grain output hitting a record 2.9 billion
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita income of local farmers stood at 1,756
yuan (211 U.S. dollars), up 16 percent on the previous year. In
addition, some 250,000 poverty-stricken people living in southern
mountainous areas have gained access to adequate food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
 The region has enjoyed sustained economic growth since
initiation of the reform and opening up policies in 1979. Ningxia
has since enjoyed sustained economic development, social
stability and national unity.
</P>

More than 17 million people from a dozen ethnic groups in

<HEADLINE> Panda Bites Woman in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A peasant woman in Chengdu,
capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, was bitten and
seriously hurt by a giant panda on Monday at a suburban
panda-breeding center, local sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li Yuanzhen, a farmer from Shilin Village on the outskirts of
Chengdu, was cutting grass on a hill by the side of the
panda-breeding center when she lost her balance and tumbled down
the slope into a panda shed at the foot of the hill.
</P>
<P>
A panda in the shed jumped onto Li, and seized and scratched
her right hand with a paw, and then took a bite of her left
thigh, swaying its head until a large piece of flesh was ripped
off Li's leg. It also bit Li's right thigh without inflicting any
serious wound.
</P>
<P>
After being rescued from the shed, Li was rushed to an army
hospital in Chengdu where she underwent an emergency operation,
according to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said that Li is now completely out of danger, but
further observation is needed to see if the nerves on her left
thigh have been damaged by the bite.
</P>
<P>
A local zoologist said that the giant panda is a docile animal
and seldom attacks human beings.
</P>
<P>
"This time the panda might have been scared by the sudden
intrusion of the woman and therefore displayed its wild nature,"
he said, adding that the panda must have been further disturbed
when Li, out of terror, kept waving her hands and stamping her
feet in its face.

WELLINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A New Zealand minister
accused Chilean apple-growers of contravening intellectual
property rights (IPR) here today.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, John Luxton, New Zealand minister of food,
biosecurity and border control, said he is seeking more
information on allegations that some Chilean orchardists "are
unlawfully growing New Zealand-registered apple varieties"
Pacific Rose and Southern Snap.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the Chileans are "contravening intellectual
property rights in the ownership and commercial exploitation of
the varieties".
</P>

"The New Zealand Government is always concerned about
suggestions that New Zealand-registered plant varieties are being
exploited without approval of the owners and licence holders,"

<HEADLINE> LP Leader: Defense Guidelines Based on Geographical Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Liberal Party (LP)
leader Ichiro Ozawa, reiterated Monday that the revised
Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines are based on a
geographical concept.
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong to say it is totally not a geographical concept,"
Ozawa told reporters in Osaka, western Japan, referring to the
undefined "areas surrounding Japan" where the two countries will
engage in defense cooperation in emergencies under the new
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa made the remarks after Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Hiromu Nonaka made it clear once again that "areas surrounding
Japan" is not a geographical concept to clarify Ozawa's recent
comments over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Nonaka, the government's chief spokesman, said earlier Monday
that the launch of a new coalition government between the LP and
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) last Thursday has not changed
Japan's stance that the guidelines do not target a specific area.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa, speaking at a press conference in Tokyo soon after his
party launched the coalition with the LDP, claimed that the scope
of the guidelines includes Russia, the Korean Peninsula, China
and China's Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, updated in 1997, calls on Japan to provide
more active support to U.S. forces in the event of emergencies in
"areas surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States say the guidelines are not
targeting at any specific areas or nations as the guidelines
state that the concept of "areas surrounding Japan" is "not
geographic but situational," and such situations are limited to
those posing "an important influence on Japan's peace and
security."
</P>
<P>
The new defense guidelines were criticized by Japan's
neighboring countries including China.

<HEADLINE> Over 7,000 Automobiles Stolen in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 7,000 automobiles
were stolen in Beijing last year, five out of every thousand of
the city's 1.3 million motor vehicles, according to information
made public today by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Public Secur
ity.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this winter, the bureau has dealt with
32 cases of auto theft with an aggregate value of three million
yuan, smashed four automobile-theft gangs, and arrested ten
larceny suspects, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the stolen cars, mainly Santanas, Jetta Kings and
minivans, are then sold in Hebei, Shanxi and Henan provinces and
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, all near Beijing.
</P>
<P>
With the growing rise of auto-theft, more than 80 percent of
the private-car owners in the capital have equipped their
vehicles with alarm systems.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Yugoslavia to Let Kosovo Monitor Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Monday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must reverse a
decision to expel the American head of international monitors in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded statement, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said that Yugoslavia must drop its insistence that
William Walker, who heads the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM)
of unarmed monitors, leave the country within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Walker on Sunday blamed the Yugoslav security forces for the
slaughter of 45 ethnic Albanians in the village of Racak in
Kosovo last Friday. But the Yugoslav side argued that the
security forces were forced into an exchange of gunfire with
ethnic Albanian militants, in which dozens of militants were
killed.
</P>
<P>
Being a veteran U.S. diplomat, Walker most recently served as
head of the U.N. Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia
(UNTAES) in Croatia. He had also served as deputy assistant
secretary of state from 1985 to 1988 and ambassador to El
Salvador from 1988 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. national security officials met at the White
House to discuss the most serious Kosovo crisis since last
October, when an air strike by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) was averted after an agreement was reached bet
ween Belgrade and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rubin noted that NATO had reaffirmed an activation order for
air strikes against Yugoslav targets in Kosovo, but said the
order had been suspended for now, pending a political decision.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
also warned Yugoslavia against the "grave mistake" of failing to
live up to the cease-fire agreement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The activation order is on the table," Albright told
reporters, adding that NATO's supreme commander, General Wesley
Clark, and General Klaus Naumann of its military committee would
personally deliver "a very direct message" to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an interview with the Cable News Network (CNN),
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said that the situation in
Kosovo is very serious.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is as serious now, perhaps more serious than,
as it was in October," Holbrooke said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Fashion Week Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 19 (Xinhua) - A top official of Hong Kong
Trade Development Council (TDC) said Tuesday that Hong Kong
Fashion Week is now the premier fashion trade fair in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kenneth Fang, chairman of the Garment Advisory Committee of
 the TDC, was speaking at the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong
Fashion Week for Fall/Winter '99 at the Hong Kong Convention &AMP;
Exhibition Center which was officiated by Mrs. Anson Chan, chief
secretary for administration of the Hong Kong Special administra
tive Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Fang said the Fashion Week "has grown in step with the Hong
Kong garment industry to become more professional, more
customer-oriented, and more versatile. It is a forum for exchange
of trend and market intelligence."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the world's second largest clothing exporter
after the Chinese Mainland. It produces a wide range of garments,
and has successfully established its upmarket image through
design and quality.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 60s the clothing industry has been one of the
largest and most important industry in Hong Kong's manufacturing
sector. It was the largest manufacturing employer in Hong Kong in
1997, hiring 71,264 workers, or 24.7% of the total manufacturing
work force. The gross output in 1995 reaches 63.591 billion HK
Dollars, according to the latest statistics report from SAR.
</P>
<P>
This fashion event, being upgraded consistently every year to
meet the sophisticated needs of worldwide exhibitors and buyers,
is featuring a total of 710 exhibitors this year with 453 of whom
are Hong Kong exhibitors. They are accompanied by 257 overseas
exhibitors coming from 19 countries and regions, including
pavilions from the Chinese Mainland, India, the "Europe
Selection" and so on.
</P>
<P>
The major highlight of this Fashion Week is the Third
Asia-Pacific Young Designers' Show in which 15 young fashion
talents from the region join force to present their latest ideas
and creations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Achieves Progress in Field of Nutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) --Bangladesh has achieved
significant progress in the field of nutrition in the past years
due to the relentless efforts made by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has attached enormous importance in
the nutrition aspect of the agricultural policies and programs,
since the country is an agriculture-based one with about 85
percent of its 127 million people living in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The policy of "food-based approach" has been adopted by the
government, and it is reflected in the National Plan of Action for
Nutrition. Sufficient care has been given to "food" issues in the
National Food and Nutrition Policy.
</P>
<P>
As a result of multi-sectoral approach, some success has been
achieved in the nutrition sector.
</P>
<P>
Stunting among under-five children has decreased from 64
percent in 1992 to 51 percent in 1997, Vitamin-A supplementation
of children dramatically increased from 30 percent in the 1980s to
94 percent in 1997, and consumption of iodized salt increased from
44 percent in 1995 to 67 percent in 1997, official statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
The maternal mortality rate has been reduced to 4.4 per 1000
live birth from more than 10 per 1000 live birth in only 10 years'
time.
</P>
<P>
The achievements in the field of infant mortality rate are also
dramatic, and the rate has been reduced to 78 per 1000 live birth
from 140 per 1000 live birth in only 10 years' time.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is committed to achieve the goals set by the
International Conference on Nutrition held in Rome in December
1992.
</P>
<P>
The country is also committed to the Alma Ata (Kazakhstan)
Declaration to achieve "Health For All by the Year 2000". With
this end-in-view, Bangladesh has rightly recognized malnutrition
as the single most important factor hindering the overall national
development.
</P>
<P>
To address malnutrition, Bangladesh has already formulated the
"National Food and Nutrition Policy" and is about to declare the
Health Policy.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has extended the health and family planning services
up to the grassroots level, launching a national nutrition
intervention program named the Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition
Program to address the issues of malnutrition and to achieve rapid
socio-economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, the government is also implementing several
other important nutrition programs to address the issues of
malnutrition through various ministries.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, one of the least developed countries in the
world, the extent and magnitude of malnutrition is still alarming,
and the level of malnutrition in the country is the highest in the
world, though remarkable achievements have been made in the past
years.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of children under the age of six are suffering
from different grades of malnutrition as measured by
anthropometry, press reports said quoting recent studies.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of low birth weight (birth weight less than 2.5
kilograms) is around 40 percent, and more than 77 percent women
and children under five are suffering from nutritional anemia.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the population are suffering from iodine
deficiency disorders, incidence and prevalence of night blindness
and blindness due to Vitamin-A deficiency is also noticeable high.
</P>
<P>
Causes of malnutrition in this South Asian country are lack of
caring practice, lack of food security, lack of health service and
facilities and lack of environment sanitation including safe
water, the studies pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government, with assistance of international
donor countries and agencies, is striving hard to formulate a
comprehensive national nutrition program to bring down the
magnitude and extent of malnutrition to a point where it is no
longer considered as a public health problem.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's First Stock Market to be Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The opening of Vietnam's first
joint stock market will be postponed for a third time should the
country fail to equities an additional 400 state-owned enterprises
this year, the Vietnam Investment Review reported in its latest
issue.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that stock markets would commence trading in Hanoi
and Ho Chi Minh city last October, but plans were delayed until at
least the end of this year due to a shortage of public companies
for listing on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
State Securities Committee Chairman Le Van Chau said that the
economic crisis in the region had forced a "re-calculation" of
plans to open stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam launched its equitation process in 1992, but progress
has been slow. It planned to equities 150 state-owned enterprises
(SOES) last year, but only 98 reached full equitation.
</P>
<P>
To date, 150 enterprises have registered for permission to sell
shares, but most are too small, according to Deputy Finance
Minister Tran Van Ta.
</P>
<P>
The official said: "We plan to equities more medium and large
firms this year, but often small-sized companies do not attract
enough investors."
</P>
<P>
At least half of Vietnam's SOES should be sold to the public,
merged or dissolved because they are to small and inefficient,
said one government official.
</P>
<P>
SOES account for 42 percent of Vietnam's gross domestic product
and around 66 percent of industrial output.

BUENOS AIRES -- Argentine President Carlos Menem has
suggested that studies be made on replacing the country's
currency peso with the U.S. dollar, newspapers here reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Menem's call that the whole region adopts a dollar-based
economy was prompted by a financial crisis in neighboring Brazil,
whose currency has recently devalued sharply.
</P>
<P>
Several years would be needed for the country to switch over
to the dollar if Argentine federal legislators and the U.S.
Federal Reserve approve the idea, the papers said.

</P>
<P>
Lower rates will help boost economic growth, in particular
the domestic demand, said Czech Minister of Finance Ivo Svoboda.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut was considered a further easing of the country's

<HEADLINE> Over 171,300 Hectares Granted for Private Farming in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 171,307 hectares of
reclaimed vacant, fallow and virgin land as well as wetlands in
Myanmar's three divisions have been granted by the government to
local private entrepreneurs for extended cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The three divisions, where the entrepreneurs began their
cultivation of various crops this month, are Yangon, Magwe and
Ayeyawaddy.
</P>
<P>
Other states and divisions are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 8.9 million hectares of such land in the
country reportedly remaining to be reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government is encouraging domestic private
entrepreneurs to invest more in agriculture, which is the mainstay
of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the 1997-98 fiscal year,
fallow land in Myanmar came to 1.1 million hectares and cultivable
wasteland 7.89 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
The country expanded cultivated land to 12.51 million hectares
in the year, 185,540 hectares more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's paddy production fell from 19 million tons in 1995-96
to 17.66 million tons in 1996-97 and then to 17.3 million tons in
1997-98 with its rice exports reducing from 354,000 tons to 93,100
tons and then to 28,300 tons correspondingly.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the country's population is estimated to
have reached 46.4 million in 1997-98, growing by 1.84 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
In view of these facts, Myanmar is reclaiming more land for
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture, accounting for 36 percent of the gross
domestic product and 35 percent of export value, grew by 2.9
percent in output value in the fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Garment Industry to Brace a Tough Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's top export earner, the
garment industry, is bracing itself for a tough year in which the
search for additional markets could be fruitless, reported the
Vietnam Investment Review in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Trade (MoT), Vietnam earned some
1.38 billion U.S. dollars from garments exports in 1998, a 6.1
percent year-on-year increase, but 0.22 billion U.S. dollars
behind what had been hoped for.
</P>
<P>
The General Department of Customs recorded the 1998 figure as
1.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But, the English-language weekly said, whichever figures is
accurate, the total is far behind the high figures posted from
1992 to 1997, when year-on-year increases in annual earnings
always recorded between 30 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to say what this year's earnings might be but
we don't expect much more," said Nguyen Van Ky, an official at the
Vietnam Garments and Textiles Corporation.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that there will not be a jump in
exports if the regional financial crisis is still taking its toll
while there are no new markets and no upgrading of equipment to
produce better products.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's garment-makers, which have faced increased
competitiveness from regional counterparts since the South East
Asian financial slide sparked a devaluation of currencies,
generally said that new markets will be difficult to gain over the
year if the economic troubles persist.
</P>
<P>
Due to the intensifying competition, Vietnamese garments
factories have dropped their prices by 14 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of Vietnam's garments and textiles exports go to the EU
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been trying to break into the U.S. market.
However, a Vietnamese official said "we cannot make any
breakthrough into the North American market while Vietnam does not
have the most favored nation trading status with the United
States."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam plans to produce 700,000 tones of sugar in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has set targets to
produce 700,000 tones of sugar in 1999, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
To reach this goal, VNA quoted Vietnam's Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development as saying, the country put
250,000 ha under sugarcane with an average yield of 46 tones per
ha in the 1997-1998 crop.
</P>
<P>
The acreage produced an output of 11.4 million tones of
sugarcane of which around 80 percent were supplied to sugar mills.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will put into operation nine more sugar refineries in
the 1998-1999 sugarcane season, bringing the total number of sugar
refineries to 44 with a combined daily capacity of over 68,000
tones of sugarcane.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has 35 sugar mills with a total capacity of 51,000
tones of sugarcane per day. Nine of these mills have installed
production lines to turn out extra products like confectionery,
beverage, plywood chips and animal feed.
</P>
<P>
However, sugar mills, during the 1997-1998 crop, ran at only 40
percent of their total capacity due to the shortage of materials.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has planned to have 51 sugar mills in operation by the
year 2000 with a combined daily capacity of 97,000 tones of
sugarcane. These mills will turn out approximately one million
tones of sugar per year.
</P>
<P>
Investment capital to develop sugarcane planting areas amounts
to 400 million U.S. dollars while that for the construction of new
sugar mills is estimated at 920 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges Peaceful Settlement of Dispute with Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Foreign Ministry has
reiterated its call for a peaceful settlement of alleged Maritime
intrusions and clashes with the Myanmar side.
</P>
<P>
The message was conveyed by the ministry's Deputy Permanent
Secretary Soawanit Kongsiri to Myanmar Ambassador U Hla Muang, who
was summoned to the ministry, according to the Nation newspaper on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Soawanit handed a protest note to the envoy over the alleged
intrusion of Myanmar vessels on January 12 off the Thai Ranong
province bordering Myanmar, the paper said. The intrusion resulted
in an exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
"As members of the ASEAN family, Thailand and Burma (Myanmar)
should seek peaceful means to solve the problem of alleged
maritime intrusions to prevent them from jeopardizing bilateral
relations," the paper quoted an unidentified official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Thai and Myanmar navies clashed twice in less than
a month on the Andaman Sea. In the latest clash last Tuesday, four
Myanmar navy officers were killed. The first clash on December 19
claimed the lives of two Thai navy officers.
</P>
<P>
Following the latest clash, both Thailand and Myanmar promptly
protested to each other, claiming that the clash had taken place
in their respective territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Thai foreign ministry officials and military officers
maintained that the shooting on Tuesday had occurred in Thai
waters. They said the Thai Navy boat had fired on a "modified
armed vessel" which bore no flag to identify its country of
origin.
</P>
<P>
But reports reaching here from Myanmar said the Myanmar
"Tatmadaw (military) patrol vessel Yan Naing 510" had been on a
routine patrol when it was attacked.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has reportedly proposed that Myanmar station a
representative at the Thai-Myanmar Border Coordination Center in
Ranong to coordinate with Thai officials and that the two
countries establish telephone hot lines for prompt contact so that
future conflicts could be prevented.

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Step Up Anti-Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombia plans to
intensify its anti-drug actions in 1999, anti-narcotics police
chief Col. Leonardo Gallego said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gallego said that the government aims to destroy and seize
more drugs in the year.
</P>
<P>
Anti-drug operations would be carried out in regions which
have hitherto remained untouched due to lack of funds, Gallego
added.
</P>
<P>
Colombia produces about 80 percent of the world's cocaine and
supplies about 60 percent of the high-grade heroin sold on U.S.
streets, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Gallego noted that drug ring leaders in a number of regions
were trying to develop or create new drug cartels, but the police
had located the would-be drug lords.
</P>
<P>
Last year, police and the military sprayed herbicide over 60,0
00 hectares of land to destroy illegal crops, such as opium
poppies and coca leaves. About 55 tons of pure cocaine base, 55
tons of pressed marijuana and 6,500 tons of chemical materials
were seized.
</P>
<P>
A substitute development program would be launched to help
poor farmers to switch to non-drug crops, he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Congress To Speed Up Budget Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Congress will
hold an extraordinary session before February 15 to hasten the
approval of budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
Senate president Antonio Carlos Magalhaes made the
announcement Monday at a news conference held jointly with
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Vice-President Marco Maciel
and lower house leader Michel Temer.
</P>
<P>
President Cardoso said he was pleased by Magalhaes' decision,
adding that an alliance between the executive and the legislative
branches of government would help restore Brazil's financial
credibility, which was weakened by an 8 percent devaluation of
the country's currency, the real, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The federal government must have the political support of the
Congress to pass severe budget-cutting reforms, a precondition
for a 41.5 billion dollar aid package from international lenders.
</P>
<P>
Global financial turmoil hit Brazil full force last August
when investors pulled their money out. They were concerned the
government couldn't cover a 65-billion-dollar budget deficit and
might default on loans.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Cuts Key Banking Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of the Czech
Republic cut key interest rates starting Monday, the eighth rate
reduction since the start of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate for bi-weekly commercial loans was lowered
to 8.75 percent from 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lower rates will help boost economic growth, in particular the
domestic demand, said Czech Minister of Finance Ivo Svoboda.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut was considered a further easing of the country's
stringent monetary policies, which have led to tight credit for
businesses and sagging production and exports.
</P>
<P>
The successive rate cuts during the past year have brought
down the interest rate level of the Czech Republic to approach
the average level of Europe. The country's discount rate for
commercial banks currently stood at 10 percent and the inter-bank
lending rates at 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Alkali Land along Yellow River Attracts Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Once barren and deserted, the
alkali land along the Yellow River in east China's Shandong
Province has been turned into a hot-spot for investment with the
development of ecological agriculture in the region.
</P>
<P>
The alkali land is being developed in a unique way in
Shandong: people dig ponds for freshwater acquaculture, grow rice
and lotus root, and use the earth from the dug-out ponds to grow
grain, cotton, fruits, vegetables and forage grass.
</P>
<P>
This development method is of special importance to Shandong
since it not only makes efficient use of land resources, but also
alleviates draught in the province with all the freshwater stored
in the newly created ponds.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of hectares of previously uncultivated land
has been turned into high-yield land, with ponds for acquaculture
now covering nearly 133,000 hectares, according to provincial
agriculture officials.
</P>
<P>
To increase the appeal of developing the alkali land, the
provincial government has worked out a series of preferential
policies aimed at attracting more investors, those from overseas
in particular.
</P>
<P>
Freshwater breeding and processing and tourism are both areas
that interest overseas investors, and business people from Hong
Kong and Taiwan and several foreign countries have already
invested in such projects.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Hold More Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has decided that apart from North Western Province all
five provincial council polls should be held soon.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has conveyed this decision in a letter to
Elections Commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake, said a government
news release available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In her letter, the president decided to rescind the Gazette
Notification of 4th August 1998 nullifying the date of poll in
respect of five provincial councils.
</P>
<P>
The new Gazette Notification rescinding this notice is due to
be issued within a few days, said the letter.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner of Elections will then be able to fix the new
date of poll in respect of the provincial councils of Uva,
Central, North Central, Sabaragamuwa and Western.
</P>
<P>
The term of the Southern Provincial Council has not yet
expired.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is consisted of nine provinces, of which eastern and
northern provinces don't have their provincial council polls due
to the long protracted civil war there since 1983 between the
government and Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
The date of five provinces poll was nullified last August under
section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The president indicated in her letter that the government was
compelled to take that step in view of the security situation
prevailing at that time.
</P>
<P>
Since then the security situation has been under constant
review.
</P>
<P>
She said that it has been now observed that the security
requirement for the conduct of these elections can be provided in
addition to the maintenance of normal law and order in the country
in general, and in particular in these areas.

The bonds will allow the private bank to grant a large number

"The areas returned by the U.S. government to Panama in the

<HEADLINE> Mexico, EU Discuss Reduction of Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and the European
Union on Monday started a second round of negotiations for a free
trade agreement, according to a European Commission statement
issued on Monday in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, held in the Belgian capital of Brussels,
delegates from the two sides are studying lifting of tariffs on a
number of products.
</P>
<P>
The talks also covered essential clauses on human rights and
democracy, which Mexico must accept in order to gain access to
the European markets.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on increasing high-level contacts between
European and Mexican officials, while widening the range of
actions included in a cooperation accord signed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, due to end on Friday, EU delegates will
request Mexico to revoke tariff hikes of between 3 percent and 10
percent which it set for European products on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mexican ambassador to the European Union, Jaime Zabludovsky,
said that as the world's 10th most important import and export
economy, Mexico should boost its exchanges with Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tariff hikes on European exports to Mexico
are a temporary measure and could be annulled "if oil prices
become favorable or if other alternative sources of revenues are
found."
</P>
<P>
Zabludovsky said the tariff increases were imposed because of
shortfalls in the Mexican government's revenues resulting from a
world crude prices slump. Oil sales represent about 40 percent of
the country's state revenues.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Mexico's second largest trading partner after the
United States, but the two-way trade has shrunk to about 6
percent from 10 percent since Mexico entered the North American
Free Trade Agreement. Both sides are keen to reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Mexican exports to the United States totaled 94
billion dollars, and only 4.5 billion dollars went to the EU,
prompting fears that the Mexican economy is too dependent on a
single market and could be vulnerable in case of problems.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Mexico registered a large trade surplus as
the EU exported 10.7 billion dollars worth of products to the
country, but high tariffs put European companies at a
disadvantage with the North Americans.

<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese-made "home theaters"
will be popular in 1999 in China's household electrical-appliance
market, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
A "home theater" is what most Chinese call their household
audio-visual systems which includes big-screen television, video
compact disk (VCD) players and a stereo system.
</P>
<P>
According to Jin Zhenglong, vice president of the China
Association of the Electronic Stereo System Industry, the market
potential for "home theaters" in 1999 is 2.6 million units.
</P>
<P>
Digital technology is now being integrated into these products
manufactured domestically, and now Chinese-made televisions, VCD
players and digital video disk (DVD) players are up to
international standards.
</P>
<P>
Amplifiers and speakers made in China are also closing the
gap, Jin said. Some name-brand speakers such as Hushan, Feile and
Dasheng already are doing well on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Jin also attributed the marketability of domestically produced
"home theaters" to the competitive price offered by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say the Chinese people will continue to spend a
large part of their incomes on household products such as
electrical appliances and furniture, and this will give a strong
boost to the makers of "home theaters."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Private Bank Adds Branch in Border Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Wealth Bank, one of the
leading private banks in Myanmar, has added a branch in Muse, the
country's northern Shan state bordering China, bringing the total
number of its branches to 20 across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister of Finance and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein said
at the opening of the branch on Sunday that the move is aimed at
encouraging regular border trade to ensure effective banking
services in the activities.
</P>
<P>
Muse is one of the six border trade points with China.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Central Bank of Myanmar U Kyaw Maung also
attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
There are 19 private banks in Myanmar now with the Asia Wealth
Bank, the Yoma Bank and the May Flower Bank leading in business.
</P>
<P>
Private banks in Myanmar have been allowed to operate again
since 1990, 27 years after all private banks in the country were
nationalized in 1963.
</P>
<P>
The private banks hold 42.3 percent of saving deposits of the
banking sector while their loans account for 44.9 percent of the
sector's loans to private sector.
</P>
<P>
There are five state banks in the country -- the Central Bank
of Myanmar, the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, the Myanma Economic
Bank, the Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank and the Myanma
Agricultural and Rural Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks stationing in the country as representative
offices total 38 now. They are mostly from Japan, Thailand,
France, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The country's financial reform, which started in late 1988, has
now entered the second phase after memorandums of understanding on
setting up joint venture banks were signed respectively between
six Myanmar private banks and six foreign ones which have already
opened offices in the country.

<HEADLINE> Thai Army Denies Soldiers' Involvement in Blasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The army, while denouncing the
recent bombing attacks, has denied that its soldiers were involved
in bombing campaigns to discredit the government.
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Col. Somkuan Saengpattharanet was quoted by
Tuesday's Nation newspaper as saying that he had been authorized
by Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Surayuth Jullanont to dismiss
rumors that the Army was involved in any bomb blast intended to
discredit the government.
</P>
<P>
Somkuan said the army has been monitoring the situation, and
does not yet know who is behind the bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-December, Bangkok has been gripped by a spate of bomb
blasts and telephone threats, including the most recent explosion
on Friday near the headquarters of the ruling Democrat Party. But
no one was injured. Police were investigating the motives. There
have been reports that army and police personnel might get
involved in the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Somkuan pledged that the army would fully cooperate with the
government and police in the investigation and search for
suspects.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have not found that our soldiers were involved. The
army commander-in-chief will take drastic action against anyone
who is involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the armed forces understand budget constraints and the
government's plan to restructure the forces, so soldiers would not
use these as reasons to launch campaigns to discredit the
government.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Monday dismissed reports that
the bombing campaign resulted from his attempt to reform the
military, according to government spokesman Akaphol Sorasuchart.
</P>
<P>
"The allegations do not make any sense. Those who made them
only want to distract the public from believing that the bombings
are politically motivated," Akaphol said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart said the bomb blasts and threats should not be
linked to the restructuring of the armed forces or the plan to
change the criteria for granting privileges to war veterans.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey conducted by
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) shows that the Selected
Works of Deng Xiaoping has been the most influential book among
the Chinese people for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Along with political books, many literary and economics
volumes are also considered influential, according to a report of
the Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The three volumes of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping
received a good market response in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 55.9 percent of those surveyed named
Lu Xun as the greatest Chinese writer. Cao Xueqin, author of the

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Markets Rebound, Uncertainties Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Asian currencies and share
prices began rebounding again after fears of a financial meltdown
in Brazil receded, but it is hard to make specific predictions now
about the likely effect on the Asian economy until the crisis is
over in the Latin American nation.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's decision to float its currency last Friday and the
resulting strong bounce in Wall Street over the weekend promoted
share prices and currencies across Asian markets to climb up
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bourses in Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and Manila
surged Monday, gaining 2.5 percent, 1.27 percent, 2.5 percent, 2.2
percent and 4.4 percent respectively from the previous trading
session. Most of Asian currencies also appreciated slightly in the
day.
</P>
<P>
During the morning trading session Tuesday, the rebounding
trend has continued in Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Brazil caused a panic all over the world last Wednesday after
it devalued its currency by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
But all the gains in the Asian market Monday and Tuesday
indicate that the moves in Brazil has eased fears about its own
economy and possible instability in Latin America, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
After all, Asian markets reacted calmly in the past trading
sessions compared with markets in other regions.
</P>
<P>
Markets in Asian countries fell in the wake of Brazil's
devaluation of the real, but not by much, because of recent
improvements in their external accounts.
</P>
<P>
The record levels of current account surplus, the increasing
foreign exchange reserves and the manageable short-term debt in
Asian countries have protected their economies from a fallout in
Brazil, economists said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still early to say that the Brazilian crisis
will have little impact on Asian economies, which have just showed
some signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
Although Asian markets appeared to survive the turmoil in
Brazil, the aftershock of Brazilian crisis may have not felt yet
in the rest of Latin America and other regions, including Asia,
economists warned.
</P>
<P>
If the Brazilian crisis spreads to the rest of Latin America,
economies of the United States, Europe and other industrialized
countries will be inevitably affected as they have important links
with the region, they said.
</P>
<P>
The slower pace of economic growth in the United States and
Europe, the major export destinations of Asian countries, will be
certainly bad news for Asia's recovery from a 19-month old
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration of the Brazil crisis could also hurt Asia by
rising interest rates. The more troubles in Brazil could make it
harder for Asian countries to cut further their domestic interest
rates, thus keeping production costs higher and hindering recovery
process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Another potential danger for Asia lies in the threat of weak
investor confidence, as any withdrawal of funds from Latin America
by investors will also have a negative impact on other emerging
markets, including Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
So far, it is too early to predict now whether Brazil's trouble
could hinder a recovery in Asia since the Brazilian story is not
over yet.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Give Nicaragua 11,460 Tons of Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Rome-based World Food
Program (WFP) and the Nicaraguan Red Cross will distribute over
11,460 tons of basic grains to over 21,000 families, a Red Cross
spokesman announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The program will feed the families daily for a six-month
period, and each family will receive nearly 82 kilos of rice,
beans, corn, oil sugar, oats and salt a month for a total of 490
kilos, he said.
</P>
<P>
The families were chosen in an October census among the most
affected by Hurricane Mitch, he said.
</P>
<P>
In October, Mitch left 870,000 Nicaraguans homeless, nearly
18.2 percent of the total population. It also left 2,400 dead,
another 938 were reported missing and 287 injured.
</P>
<P>
In his annual state-of-the-nation address, President Arnoldo A
leman said that Nicaragua had prepared an estimate of the amount
needed to repair, rebuild and modernize the damaged
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said a total of 1.4 billion U.S. dollars were needed, plus
another 227 million dollars earmarked for a new environmental
protection and management plan.

<HEADLINE> Swedish FM Criticizes Expulsion of OSCE Mission Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Foreign Minister
Anna Lindh on Monday called Yugoslavia's expulsion of the head of
the Kosovo Verification Mission of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe "a most serious violation" of the agr
eement reached between Belgrade and the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said in a statement that William Walker,
chairman of the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission, is doing an
important peace-making work, as authorized by the international
community and in accordance with relevant United Nations
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Lindh believed that the international community should
continue to investigate the killings which happened last Friday
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
She said that she was scheduled to visit Moscow on Tuesday and
the deteriorating situation in Kosovo will be a major topic in
her talks with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, Serb police were
forced to exchange fire with ethnic Albanian militants last Friday
 at the village of Racak, South Kosovo, killing at least 15
militants.
</P>
<P>
However, Walker announced Saturday in Pristina that he was
sure the Yugoslav police force had killed 45 ethnic Albanian
civilians in Racak. Walker also called on the war crime tribunal
in the Hague to send investigators to the scene within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav political parties, outraged by Walker's report on the
killings, have demanded his immediate removal from the mission.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government Monday declared Walker persona non
grata and ordered him to leave the country within 48 hours.

BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The State Council's Academic
Degree Committee and the Ministry of Education (MOE) yesterday
launched China's Academic Degrees and Graduate Education
Development Center in the prestigious Qinghua University, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The center will conduct quality examinations of the training
of graduates and academic degree awards, said Wang Yajie, an MOE
official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will choose and recommend textbooks for
publication or for graduates' use and organize examinations for
those having the same academic achievements when they apply for
master or doctoral degrees, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The center will allow the academic degree and graduate
education departments to concentrate on the elaboration of
programs and the enhancement of macro-management, instead of
getting involved with all aspects of the sector, said Zhao
Qinping, deputy secretary-general of the State Council's Academic
Degree Committee.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of 1997, China trained nearly 400,000 graduates
with master degrees, and 35,000 with doctoral degrees. They are
playing a key role in promoting science and technology," Zhao
said.
</P>
<P>
However, to revitalize the nation through science and
education, China needs to improve the quality of graduate
education, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Turns Down Reviewing Death Penalty Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Congress voted
early Tuesday not to review a law restoring the death penalty and
an execution.
</P>
<P>
The Congress voted after an order by the Supreme Court for a
delay of the execution of a child rapist.
</P>
<P>
Leo Echegaray, a house painter convicted of raping his
10-year-old step daughter, should have been executed on January 4,
but the Supreme Court of the Philippines ordered a six-month delay
to allow the legislators to review the law.
</P>
<P>
"Echegaray's execution is just a matter of time," said House
Speaker Manuel Villar after the vote.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court earlier said it might cut short the delay if
Congress decides not to review the law.
</P>
<P>
A new constitution of the Philippines abolished the death
penalty in 1987.
</P>
<P>
But in 1994, alarmed by a rise in crime, legislators reinstated
capital punishment for "heinous" crimes such as murder,
kidnapping, rape and drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Calls for Increased Self-control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie called on the people and Muslims in the country to
increase self-control to avoid acts that might harm the people and
particularly those threatening national unity and cohesiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Let us meet all kinds of problems with a clear mind and
rationally and avoid being carried away by emotional acts or group
interests," Habibie said in his address made on the eve of Idul
Fitri (feast celebrating the end of fasting period) here on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
Habibie also asked the people to face the current crisis with
patience.
</P>
<P>
"Self-control based on religious faith is needed particularly
now when we are facing deep concerns and various sensitivities in
the political, economic and social fields," he was quoted by
Antara News Agency Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president attended a prayer service at the Istiqlal Grand
Mosque here to mark the evening together with around 5,000 Muslims
on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of people paraded in cars, trucks and
motorcycles along the capital city's main thoroughfares Monday
night to mark the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
They beat drums and sounded trumpets along the way while
chanting "Allahu Akbar" (God is Great). Some also lit firecrackers
filling the air with explosive sounds sporadically.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, a 12-year-old boy died during
the parade after he fell from a van. Another three people admitted
into hospitals for injuries in traffic accidents.

<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 90 percent of the
architectural designs now being created in China are made with
the use of computers, according to sources at an architectural

<P>
They said Chinese architects began using computers in their
work in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Technicians from architectural design units, artistic design
units and art colleges have now replaced hand-drawn designs with
computer-generated ones, and consider this method more accurate
and more convenient.
</P>
<P>
At the Shanghai exhibit, the 170 designs on display were
chosen from among 532 offered by provinces, autonomous regions

<P>
CARACAS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will continue
exporting products to neighboring Brazil despite the prolonged
financial crisis in that country, Industry and Commerce Minister
Hector Maldonado Lira said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Venezuela's trade relations with Brazil "will
not be affected by the samba effect," the minister said his
country was closely following the developments of the Brazilian
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In today's globalized world, everything has an "immediate
impact," he added. "We shall have to wait until Brazil's central
and federal governments can improve the situation."
</P>
<P>
Maldonado said that Venezuela's exchange market was "calm,"
since the country had managed to "solve its problems with
multilateral organizations and commercial banks."
</P>
<P>
He also said the bolivar, the national currency, would not be
devalued, adding that the Brazilian crisis "is not a catastrophe
which deserves a study of a possible devaluation of our
currency."

Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Department.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of collectively owned enterprises stood at
31.95 percent and that of township enterprises at 61.83 percent
last year, the department said.

</P>
<P>
Gansu's non-state gross domestic product increased by 15

</P>
<P>
The readjustment of product structure, technical renovations

The growth rate of non-state enterprises is expected to remain

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso Monday emphasized the importance of a Latin
America-Europe summit slated for June in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
"The summit is a very important meeting between the European
Union and Latin American presidents," Cardoso said at an
inauguration ceremony of a Volkswagen automobile plant.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to create more alliances, constructive alliances,
alliances which ensure the continuity of investment programs, of
(trade) exchanges, of growing expansion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil wants to eliminate existing protectionist barriers and
reach a "growing understanding with the European Union," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped Brazil would "get help from Germany," which
will head the European Union in a few months.
</P>
<P>
He said Volkswagen should expand in the future into the whole
Mercosur trading bloc and into the entire South American market.
Mercosur, the largest trading bloc of Latin America, groups
Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay, with Chile and Bolivia
as its associate members.
</P>
<P>
The new Volkswagen plant, funded with a 680 million dollar
investment, will produce 550 cars a day in its 205,000 square
meter plant in Sao Jose Dos Pinhais, Parana state.
</P>
<P>
The plant will directly generate 3,000 jobs and nearly 10,000
jobs indirectly.

<P>
In addition, China will use elements of credit, taxation and
economic cooperation to expand its exports of high-tech and high
value-added commodities and mechanical and electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
China will try to boost exports through increasing imports,
and step up efforts in responding to overseas anti-dumping cases
against Chinese products, said the minister in an article in
China Business Times, adding that the strategy of cultivating
multiple markets will continue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shi stressed that China will make use of overseas
investment but only where it is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
"The preferential policies on overseas investors will be
vigorously implemented. We will firmly stop all kinds of random
charges and improve laws so as to refine China's investment
environment."
</P>
<P>
The minister pledged that China will continue to extend the
fields of overseas investment to the service sector in a firm but
gradual, step-by-step manner.
</P>
<P>
Trans-national companies, in particular, are to be encouraged
to make more investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that favorable conditions do exist despite the
current harsh economic environment. China's rapid growing
national economy has evidently raised the country's profile and
laid solid foundation which can be weighed against potential
risks. That, essentially, is the basic favorable factor for
China's foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, the continuation of domestic reforms and the
development of bilateral friendly relations between China and
other parts of the world will provide many opportunities for
China's trade and investment.

<HEADLINE> Austrian FM Calls For Efforts to Solve Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vienna, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel on Monday denounced the massacre of 45 ethnic
Albanians in the separatist Serbian province of Kosovo and
demanded greater efforts toward a peaceful solution to the Kosovo
issue.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed to the Federation of Yugoslavia to allow
the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague to launch an
on-the-spot investigation of the killings in the village of Racak
in southern Kosovo last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The recent hostilities in Kosovo call for an immediate renewal
of negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina, the provincial
capital of Kosovo. But before the talks begin, ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo should establish a common position, said Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a final realization of peace or the renewed
full-scale fighting in Kosovo will be decided in the next few
weeks. He said the international community and the European Union
must consider the possibility of exerting pressure on both sides.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) standing committee convened a
special meeting on Kosovo on Monday. During the meeting,
diplomats from the United States, Norway and other OSCE members
denounced the killings.
</P>
<P>
According to reports by the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, the
Serb police were forced into an exchange of gunfire last Friday
and 15 Albanian militants were killed.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Construction Materials to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The demand for construction
materials will rise this year, but prices will remain fairly
constant, according to a report in the China Material News.
</P>
<P>
This rise in demand will be triggered by the steady growth of
consumption, and according to estimates the demand for building
products will rise by about six percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite rising demand, the oversupply of resources will not
change substantially, the paper pointed out. High quality
products will continue to maintain good market potential while
substandard goods will be shunned, and the need to limit the
production of wire rod, cement, screw steel and flat glass will
remain.
</P>
<P>
The report expressed confidence in the plan to stem
oversupply, pointing to tighter bank loan policies, more
strenuous crack-down on smuggling, the continued closing of
seriously polluting small factories, and the shutting down of
inefficient plants.
</P>
<P>
Prices are likely to remain about the same because of the low
capacity-utilization rate, below 70 percent, of many construction
material plants as well as continued cuts in production costs.

WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls will
trade Scottie Pippen to the Houston Rockets immediately after the
lockout ends, according to a press report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, who will sign Pippen to a deal worth more than $70 m
 illion for five years before trading him, will get draft picks
in return.
</P>
<P>
Under NBA rules, Houston have enough salary cap room to fit in
Pippen's contract.
</P>
<P>
Pippen, a six-time champion with the Bulls, should clear the
way for Charles Barkley to re-sign with Houston. It will give the
Rockets a formidable front line of Barkley, Pippen and Hakeem
Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
Pippen, 33, has been with Chicago since the 1987-88 season
when he was drafted out of Central Arkansas. Last year, the
forward averaged 19.1 points and 5.2 rebounds per game.

</P>
<P>
Pistons vice president of basketball operations Rick Sund said
Irvine had agreed to terms and joins coach Alvin Gentry's staff,
which includes John Hammond, Gar Heard and Bob Ociepka.
</P>
<P>
Irvine spent 16 seasons with the Indiana Pacers. Last season,

vice president of basketball operations, two as coach and five as
an assistant.
</P>
<P>
"I'm real excited to be back on the bench," Irvine said in a
statement. "Detroit presents a very promising situation with some
good young players, including Grant Hill, and a solid coaching
staff. I look forward to working with Alvin and the rest of the
guys in helping Detroit become one of the league's top teams."
</P>
<P>
Gentry took over for the fired Doug Collins during the 1997-98
season. He had the interim tag removed from his title during the
off-season and the hiring of Irvine completes his staff.
</P>
<P>
A former NBA player with the Virginia Squires and Denver
Nuggets, the 49-year-old Irvine spent four seasons as an

Yugoslavia said Walker's activities went far beyond the
defined limits of the OSCE (Organization for Security and

</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Walker asked the International Tribunal in the

village of Racak, where 45 ethnic Albanians were killed. NATO
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization) ambassadors made similar
suggestions when they met in Brussels Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia however stressed that the conflict in Kosovo was
between the state and terrorist organizations, not a war, thus
there is no ground for International Tribunal personnel to
conduct investigations in the embattled land.
</P>
<P>
Walker was ordered to leave the country in 48 hours after he
accused Serb forces of killing 45 ethnic Albanians in Racak, 25
kilometers south of the provincial capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia also refused to allow chief U.N. war crimes
prosecutor Louise Arbour to enter its border from Macedonia
Monday, the Tanjug reported.

CARACAS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's President-elect
Hugo Chavez warned on Monday that he would dissolve congress if
it blocked his plan to call a referendum to create a popular
assembly with the power to rewrite the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to mark the 28th anniversary of the
foundation of his party, the Movement to Socialism, the former
army general said that if congress blocked his project, "it would
be outside of the law, and in that case, it would have to be diss
olved."
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who is due to assume power on February 2, has given
three weeks to the new congress to hold a poll to see whether
Venezuelans approve or reject his request to set up a National
Constitutive Assembly.
</P>
<P>
If congress fails to hold the poll, Chavez is expected to sign
a decree calling for a nationwide referendum on February 15.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has said that Chavez' plan to call for the
creation of a new assembly was "unconstitutional" since such a
mechanism did not exist in Venezuela's 1961 Constitution.

URUMQI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian Tu-154 airplanes
leased by Xinjiang Airlines in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region left here for home recently after a six-year
term of service.
</P>
<P>
This return is part of the airline's effort to replace
Russian-made planes with advanced ones manufactured by the United
States and European countries, such as Boeing 757-200s and
ATR72-210As, said Zhang Ruifu, general manager of the airlines.
</P>
<P>
The Russian planes were leased under the practice known as
wet-leasing, the leasing of planes and crew members from foreign
airlines, which was first introduced to China by Xinjiang
Airlines in 1992 in a bid to reduce maintenance costs and cope
with transportation demand. Other airlines plagued by the same pro
blems soon followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, the two Russian planes carried 1.1
million passengers, transported 18,662 tons of goods, and made an
outstanding contribution to the development of the

<HEADLINE> Menem Suggests Dollar Be Adopted As Official Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President
Carlos Menem has suggested that studies be made on replacing the
country's currency peso with the U.S. dollar, newspapers here
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Menem's call that the whole region adopts a dollar-based
economy was prompted by a financial crisis in neighboring Brazil,
whose currency has recently devalued sharply.
</P>
<P>
Several years would be needed for the country to switch over
to the dollar if Argentine federal legislators and the U.S.
Federal Reserve approve the idea, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the Argentine government had already proposed
dollarizing the economy, protecting it to some degree from the
dire effects of the 1994 Mexican peso devaluation.
</P>
<P>
As Brazil struggled against its economic problems last week,
Menem said that Argentina would not devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
The peso has resisted the recent crisis due to a plan pegging
the peso to the dollar at a one-to-one rate.
</P>
<P>
But nearly 30 percent of Argentine exports go to Brazil, and
the country's economy has close ties with the largest economy in
Latin America, through the Mercosur trading bloc, which is made
up also of Paraguay and Uruguay.

The Philippine Star:
</P>

</P>
<P>
Today:
</P>
<P>
-- Interest Rates in the Philippines Monday fell to the lowest

despite lingering jitters over the Brazilian crisis.
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine government ended 1998 with a final budget
deficit level of 1.24 billion U.S. dollars, 15 million U.S.

by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine government has endowed six industry sectors -
iron and steel, garments and textile, pulp and paper, automotive
battery, disposable lighter and petro-chemicals - with tariff
relief this year to shield them from ill-effects of the regional
economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> SOCCER-Queens in muscle building exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ACCRA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's national women soccer
team, the Black Queens, are under-going strenuous physical
exercises to improve on their physique and stamina towards next
June's women's world championships in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Our ladies have the skills but they seriously need to improve
on their speed and physique if they really want to make an impact
in their maiden appearance at the world Championship", Emmanuel
Kwesi Afranie, head coach of the team, said in a radio interview
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said he realised the problem when the Queens played their
Nigerian counterparts, the Falcons, in the finals of the first
ever African Women Nations Cup in Nigeria, where the Queens were
beaten 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Coach Afranie said though the Queens played much better than
the Falcons, they lost all the 50-50 balls especially in the
midfield while they lacked stamina.
</P>
<P>
He said currently, the ladies who are in camp at the Winneba
Sports College, are concentrating on the 100 and 200m sprints at
the beach, climbing of hills and coconut trees and other
strenuous exercises to toughen them.
</P>
<P>
Afranie said it is not automatic that all those who
participated in the tournament in Nigeria will definitely make
the trip to the U.S. Between now and June, every player will
have to justify her inclusion in the team, he said, to correct
the impression that he had included his favourites.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Falcons and the Queens are representing Africa in
the June World Championship.

<P>
MONACO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Gilles Panizzi of France led
after the first day of the Monte Carlo Rally Monday after
officials upheld an appeal against a 30-second penalty that had
been imposed against him.
</P>
<P>
Panizzi had penalized after pushing his car after an engine
problem because that practice is banned under world regulations.
However, the Monte Carlo Rally's rules which allow it were
adjudged to take precedence as they were put in place earlier.
</P>
<P>
Panizzi, in a Subaru, finished the 161-kilometer course in one
hour 51 minutes and 5.9 seconds.
</P>
<P>
He edged Finland's Tommi Makinen, winner of the World Rally
Car championship for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Makinen, in a Mitsubishi, is 5.9 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Finland's Juha Kankkunen, in a Subaru, was third with one
minute 18.9 seconds behind the leader.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, defending champion Carlos Sainz of Spain seriously
damaged the front of his Toyota when he crashed off the road on
ice just outside Gap within five miles of the start.
</P>
<P>
The three-time Monte Carlo Rally champion Sainz had no injury.
</P>
<P>
A total of 84 cars began the three-day event, which finishes
in Monte Carlo on Wednesday.

required."
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in a statement that
he was "personally very satisfied with the conversations that IMF
staff and management have had" with the Brazilian team.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief said he welcomed pledges Malan had made about
solving the budget deficit problem and controlling inflation and
said he would be sending an IMF team to Brasilia promptly to see
what adjustments should be made in the IMF targets in light of the
currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government pledged to boost taxes and slash
spending to trim the deficit as part of an agreement in which the
IMF initiated a 41.5 billion U.S. dollar rescue package intended
to keep Brazil from being pulled into the economic crisis that has
already hit a number of eastern Asian nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
While Brazil had held out hope that the IMF would accelerate
its disbursement of loans to the country, no such announcement was
made Monday.
</P>
<P>
Malan told reporters he would be in intensive discussions with
IMF officials in order to renegotiate whatever targets must be
changed in light of the devaluation. He said he had reassured
officials during his talks of Brazil's commitments to achieving
the necessary economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, Malan said he intended to travel to New York either
Tuesday or Wednesday to explain Brazil's devaluation to investors
on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Brazil Not Seeking Enhanced Financial Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. official said Monday
that Brazil had not sought early disbursement of funds from a 41.5
billion U.S. dollar rescue package during talks following its move
to a free-floating currency.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said there
was no talk of speeding up a second instalment due at the end of
February from a rescue package put together by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan met with IMF and U.S.
Treasury officials over the weekend to discuss the fallout of the
new exchange policy that devalued a strong currency that was the
pillar of Brazil's economic stability since 1994.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, the IMF put together a rescue package of
41.5 billion U.S. dollars for Brazil in November with
contributions from major industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
"We did not have any discussion -- they did not initiate any,
nor did we -- of questions relating to the size or timing of IMF
support," the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
"There was a shared judgment that the most important thing in
Brazil is the pursuit of strong policies, especially the carrying
through of deficit reduction measures, strong anti-inflationary
and monetary policies, and continuing structural reform," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malan told IMF and U.S. authorities that President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso was determined to push ahead with
reforms despite a "very complex political environment."
</P>
<P>
"That was certainly something that we welcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said it was "critically" important that
Brazil maintain close consultations with the international
financial institutions and countries involved in providing the
financial support.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Demands Yugoslavia Let Kosovo Monitor Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must reverse a decision
to expel the American head of international monitors in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded statement, a State Department spokesman
said that Yugoslavia must drop its insistence that William Walker
-- who heads the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) of unarmed
monitors -- leave the country within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Walker, who is a veteran U.S. diplomat, most recently served as
head of the U.N. Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia
(UNTAES) in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Walker also served as deputy assistant secretary of state from
1985 to 1988 and ambassador to El Salvador from 1988 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
As head of the mission to Kosovo, which was coordinated by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), he was
charged with verifying that Yugoslavia kept its promise to end its
crackdown on Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Lashes Out at Massacre in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Monday "strongly condemned" the massacre of Kosovar
Albanians in southern Kosovo, a Serb province of dominant
population of ethnic Albanians, and called for "an immediate and
full investigation" into the mass killing.
</P>
<P>
The condemnation came as the president of the Security Council,
Celso Amorim of Brazil, made a press statement at the end of the
council's closed-door consultations, which was prompted by a
letter from the Albanian Mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the statement, a U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard,
said that Secretary-General Kofi Annan "supports the statement 100
percent."
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Security Council strongly condemn the
massacre of Kosovar Albanians in the village of Racak in southern
Kosovo on January 15," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The massacre was reported by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Kosovo Verification Mission
(KVM), the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The council members also deplored the declaration by Belgrade
of KVM Head of Mission (William) Walker as person non grata and
reaffirmed their full support for Walker and the efforts of the
OSCE to bring about a peaceful resolution," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government Monday declared Walker, the American
head of the international monitors, person non grata and ordered
him to leave the country within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "called on Belgrade to rescind this
decision and to provide full support for Walker, the OSCE and KVM.
The council members condemned actions endangering KVM and all
international personnel" in Kosovo, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 unarmed monitors organized by the OSCE are currently
deployed throughout Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The members called for immediate and full investigations of
the massacre in Racak. They reminded the parties of their
commitments under relevant Security Council resolutions and
agreements, including full and complete cooperation" with the
International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the council's emergent session,
Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Sergey
Lavrov said that an investigation has to be made to ascertain who
is responsible for the massacre.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov also criticized Louise Arbour, the chief U.N. war crimes
prosecutor, for her decision to enter Yugoslavia without
consultations with the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav border guards Monday refused to allow Arbour to enter
the country to investigate the massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo after ethnic Albanians, who make
up some 90 percent of the province's population of 2 million,
fought with Serbs to seek independence from the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> UK Says Kosovo Peace Head Expulsion Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom said Monday
that the Yugoslav government's decision to order an American
monitor in Kosovo to leave the country was "provocative and
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"I condemn the decision by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(FRY) to declare Ambassador (William) Walker persona non grata,"
Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government had earlier ordered the United States
head of the Kosovo peace mission to leave the country within 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
Its demand came after William Walker accused Serbian forces of
massacrering 45 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"His activities go far beyond the limits of the mandate of the
OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) mission
chief that was defined by the agreement on the OSCE mission he is
heading," the Yugoslav government said.
</P>
<P>
Cook said it was up to the OSCE, not the Yugoslav government,
to determine the composition of the mission, including the person
who headed it.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Meet African Group on Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is scheduled to meet the African Group in the United
Nations Tuesday afternoon to brief African countries on his
proposal that the world body pull out its peacekeepers from the
war-torn Africa, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told Xinhua that "it is
really a hard decision" for Annan, who has been attaching great
importance to peace and security in Africa since he became the
first black African to head the world body about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"African countries do not want the U.N. to abandon Angola," he
said. "There is not too much to be discussed, the
secretary-general is trying to get smooth with African countries."
</P>
<P>
In his 26-page report to the Security Council Monday, Annan
recommended that the United Nations end peacekeeping operations in
Angola because the government and rebel UNITA, namely the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, were bent on wiping
out each other by force.
</P>
<P>
He said that he expected most of the 1,000 U.N. military,
police and civilian personnel to be out of the southwest African
country by March 20. Some 200 infantry soldiers would be asked to
protect U.N. property for another four to six months until the
withdrawal of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) was
complete.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to appoint a new envoy to replace his special
representative in Angola, Issa Diallo, and "the new appointee is
expected to be from this U.N. Secretary building," he said, adding
that "Mr. Diallo is finished."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is expected to approve Annan's
recommendation. The council president, Celso Amorim of Brazil,
told reporters Monday that he hoped some of the U.N. presence in
Angola "so we don't give the impression the U.N. is turning its
back on Angola."

ATHENS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday criticized
neighboring Turkey for the latter's attack on Athens concerning
the issue of Athens Flight Information Region (FIR) and the
disputed islets in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman

He also urged Turkey to resolve its disputes with Athens over

<P>
Turkey should take recourse in the International Court of
Justice at the Hague, since Turkey had the problem, he said.

<P>
Turkey, which enjoys bad relations with Athens, accused Greece
recently of not being able to cope with large amounts of air
traffic in the FIR, which Greece has run since 1952, and
questioned once again Sunday Greece's sovereignty over a number of
islands and rocks in the Aegean Sea separating the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 18 (Xinhua) - The warring factions in
Burundi began their fourth round of peace talks Monday in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha in a bid to realize a real
national reconciliation and early lifting of the economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Arusha said that delegates from the military
regime, armed rebels and other parties focused on debating issues
like the economic reconstruction and development in a plenary
session chaired by the mediator, Tanzania's former President
Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
"They also discussed the proposed vice-chairperons of the
committees on the peace and security and the reconstruction and
development," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere suggested General M. Masonda of South Africa as
vice-chairman of the peace and security committee chaired by
Father Matteo Zuppe of Italy and Canada's Carloyn Makaski as
vice-chairman in the reconstruction committee led by George Lannkh
of Australia.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed, at the downtown Arusha International
Conference Center, Perry Ruth of Liberia to become
vice-chairperson of the committee of nature of Burundi conflict.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere said last month that significant progress have been
achieved during the three rounds of talks which started in June
and that he will suggest to the regional leaders a debate on
lifting the economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight heads of state from the Great Lakes region are
expected to meet in Arusha to discuss mediation progress on the
Burundi conflict on January 23, and sources say big decisions,
including lifting or easing of sanctions, might be announced.
</P>
<P>
Those expected to attend are the presidents of Ethiopia, Kenya,
Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The invitation has also been extended to the President of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Laurent Desire Kabila, but due to
the ongoing conflict in his country, his attendance was not yet
confirmed, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the summit is yet to be established but there are
a number of issues that might be covered.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed on July 31, 1996, a week after
Pierre Buyoya seized power in a bloodless military coup which
toppled an ethnic Hutu president.

<HEADLINE> UK Health Minister Sets Targets for NHS Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- British Health Secretary Frank
Dobson on Monday set the year 2000 as the target date for
completion of the first wave of NHS modernization.
</P>
<P>
He set the target as the Labor Party published a report by the
health secretary -- Modernizing the National Health Service (NHS)
for the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
It made a series of pledges over hospital building, nurses'
training and health care reform.
</P>
<P>
Dobson originally outlined the plans last July after Chancellor
Gordon Brown announced an extra 21 billion pounds (33 billion U.S.
dollars) over three years for the NHS in his comprehensive
spending review.
</P>
<P>
Dobson has now given the government 50 weeks to deliver its
promises to modernize the NHS by the start of 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, health authorities have warned that if reports of an
11 percent pay rise for new nurses prove correct, the increase may
have to be partly financed from the modernization budget.
</P>
<P>
In his report Dobson repeats Government manifesto pledges to
cut waiting lists, increase the number of nurses and give the
health service a greater presence on Internet.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Dobson said: "For the past 50 years the NHS has
been one of the stunning achievements of the 20th Century.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next 50 weeks it needs to be modernized to make it
one of the stunning inheritances for the 21st Century," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Somalis Moving to Escape Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Somalis in the
south have fled heir homes due to hunger and trekked toward the
Kenyan border areas in search of food, aid workers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Many residents in the drought-stricken Bay and Bakool region
are forced to use the skin of camels to cook soup, they said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands are camped at Somali border towns of Luuq and Bulo
Hawa, aid agencies said.
</P>
<P>
The displaced people are not getting aids from local people who
themselves may be in trouble, said Michele Quintaglie at the
U.N.'s World Food Program, which has distributed 3,000 tons of
relief food in Somalia since November.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers said acute water shortages have caused outbreaks of
infectious diseases across southern Somalia, and cholera is
spreading in the southern port city of Kismayu, where fighting was
intense last month.
</P>
<P>
"The famine is spreading stealthily, slowly and quietly," a U.
N. official was quoted as saying in a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition rates among children have jumped to more than 20
percent in Bay and Bakool, Somalia's traditional agricultural
region, where unpredictable fights between rival militia have
exacerbated the hunger crisis.
</P>
<P>
Delayed rains have made the harvest due at the end of this
month already a failure, after last year's harvests were ruined by
El Nino floods. The U. N. says 300,000 people, one-fifth of them
under five years old, are at "very high risk'' of starvation.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Somalia said 10 people, including children, died
in one day last week in the town of Hoddur close to the Ethiopian
border of hunger and thirst.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Call for Independent Anti-Doping Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- European Union sports ministers
Monday called on the International Olympic Committee and
international sports federations to step up the fight against
doping.
</P>
<P>
They called in an eight-point catalogue of recommendations for
a unified international standard for doping controls and the
creation of an independent anti-doping agency.
</P>
<P>
If federations violated regulations, state subsidies should be
reduced or withdrawn, the ministers said at an informal meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Otto Schily said the fight against
doping in sport was being given top priority during Germany's
six-month presidency of the EU Council.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union should speak with one voice in the fight
against doping to lend more force to its demands at international
conferences," Schily also said.
</P>
<P>
The World Doping Conference will be held in Lausanne from
February 2 to 4.

<HEADLINE> Warring Parties in Congo (K) Agree to Cease Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 18 (Xinnua) -- Warring parties in the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have agreed
to sign a cease-fire agreement, Namibian President Sam Nujoma
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The parties direct to the conflict in the DRC have agreed to
the signing of the cease-fire," South African television, the
SABC, quoted Nujoma as saying in Windhoek after a mini-summit.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said the cease-fire agreement included the security
concerns of the DRC and its neighboring countries, and the
deployment of a peace-keeping force by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU secretary-general would consult the
secretary-general of the United Nations, informing him that the
warring parties have agreed to the signing of the cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said the document would be signed in Zambia, but he did
not give any indication of when this would take place.
</P>
<P>
DRC President Laurent Kabila has been meeting with Angolan
President Eduardo dos Santos and President of the Republic of
Congo Denis Sassou- Nguesso in Luanda, capital of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Although the details of the meeting are not known, observers
at the mini-summit agree that Angola is under huge pressure to
withdraw its troops from its two neighboring countries to defend
itself from renewed onslaught of the rebel UNITA movement, the
SABC said.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit was held after a meeting ond Rwanda and Uganda
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe are fighting on Kabila's side
while Rwanda and Uganda are behind the rebels fighting to oust
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, dos Santos and the rebels fighting Kibila were absent
from the summit. South Africa, which has played a key role in
brokering previous cease-fire talks, was not represented at the
summit.

<HEADLINE> Greece Says Not Received Ocalan's Request to Come </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Monday that it had
not received any request made by the leader of the Kurdish Workers
Party (PKK) Abdullah Ocalan to come to Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the PKK had no contact with Greek
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Athens had not been in touch with the Italian government before
Ocalan left Rome and consequently the issue did not directly
affect Greece, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Greece did not believe the entry or
stay of Ocalan in Greece to be of any benefit to the Kurdish
issue.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested in Italy on November 12 on a German warrant
when he flew in from Moscow. Italy had refused the request by
Turkey to extradite him because the Italian constitution bans the
extradition of suspects to a country where they could face the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The PKK leader reportedly left Rome on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Greece has supported Ocalan in receiving political asylum and
has urged the international community or the European Union (EU)
to sponsor an international conference on the Kurdish problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Greece of supporting the PKK and its leader,
to avoid being dragged into the trouble with Turkey for the PKK
issue, Greece has in fact distanced itself from the PKK.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Faces Another Failure in African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday presented a 26-page report to the Security
Council, calling for the withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers from the
war-torn Angola.
</P>
<P>
The reluctant proposal by Annan, who has been attaching great
importance to peace and development in Africa since he came to
power two years ago, signals that the United Nations is meeting
with another failure in peacekeeping operations in Africa after
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Many sources here compared the awkward situation for the world
body in Angola to that of Somalia, a reminiscence of a Security
Council decision several years ago to shut down peacekeeping
operations in Somalia as of March 31, 1995. At present, the
185-member United Nations is still being haunted by what Annan has
described as "the Somalia syndrome."
</P>
<P>
"The events of the last few months have clearly demonstrated
that, for all intents and purposes, the Angolan peace process has
collapsed and the country is now in a state of war," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the expected determination of the parties to test
their fortunes on the battlefield, the steadily worsening security
situation and the inability of MONUA (the U.N. Military Observer
Mission in Angola) to carry out its mandate, it has become
increasingly clear that, for the time being, the conditions for a
meaningful United Nations peacekeeping role in Angola ceased to
exist," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. failure looms large after its two cargo planes were
shot down with eight days after Christmas, prompting the world to
ask questions on the future of the MONUA, which groups about 1,000
members, including military observers and civil police observers.
</P>
<P>
Before and after the plane crashes, which involved 23 people
whose fate currently remains unknown, Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos in his repeated public statements called for an
early end to the implementation of the 1994 Lusaka Protocol,
mediated by the United Nations, and the termination of the MONUA's
mandate.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, Angolan government and military officials as well
as rebel UNITA representatives have both made open remarks,
claiming that the United Nations was responsible for the present
deterioration of the security situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The government says the United Nations failed to disarm UNITA,
namely the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
while the rebels blame the United Nations for failing to stop the
government from attacking insurgent bases.
</P>
<P>
In return, "the negative public atmosphere created by the
Angolan media campaign against the United Nations has been
compounded by incidents of harassment and non-cooperation with
MONUA in several areas of the country, including (the capital of)
Luanda," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Faces Another Failure in African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The exposure of United Nations personnel in Angola to grave
security risks was demonstrated by the apparent shooting down of
two U.N. aircraft in central highland of the southwest African
country, the site of fierce fighting between the Angolan
government troops and UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
At present, the two warring Angolan parties denied any
responsibility for the tragedy. Furthermore, the parties do not
allow MONUA to visit the first crash scene because of renewed
heavy fighting in the area. Simultaneously, persistent attempts
were made to ascertain the site of the second crash although UNITA
told the world body that it has located the wreckage of the plane
brought downed on January 2.
</P>
<P>
In response to these developments, the United Nations decided
to limit its air operations in Angola to the most essential
medical and casualty evacuations and to expedite the withdrawal of
all its personnel to Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The root cause of this deeply regrettable state of affairs is
well known. They lie in UNITA's refusal to comply with basic
provisions of the Lusaka Protocol which demanded that it
demilitarize its forces and allow the State administration to be
extended throughout the national territory.
</P>
<P>
Annan has openly described the presumed shooting down of the
two U.N. planes as "a particular outrageous crime apparently
intended to intimidate the United Nations and force it to curtail
its operations."
</P>
<P>
ON June 30, 1997, the Security Council decided to send the
observer mission into Angola to monitor the peace process in the
war-raged country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been in and out of Angola since 1989. In
1994, it brokered the Lusaka Protocol that ended for nearly four
years the country's two-decade old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Civil war broke out after Angola's 1975 independence from
Portugal. A 1991 peace accord also collapsed after UNITA rejected
its defeat in the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
Annan's pullout proposal has to be approved by the Security
Council. However, the United Nations and the international
community should not and must not turn its back on Angola and the
Angolan people.
</P>
<P>
Annan voiced his hope that a U.N. human rights unit would be
able to stay in the country, and it was necessary, in view of
thousands of displaced people and untold brutalities against
civilians, for relief workers to carry out their work.
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, the resumption of the war will bring increased
suffering for the civilian population and will have serious
consequences for peace and security beyond Angola's borders," the
U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations must therefore remain actively involved and
persist in its efforts to assist the Angolans to find the earliest
possible resolution of this fratricidal conflict which has lasted
longer than any other in Africa," he added.
