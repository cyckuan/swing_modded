<HEADLINE> Saudi Defense Minister to Visit US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Defense Prince Sultan ibn Abdul-Aziz is
scheduled to pay an official visit to Washington on February 24 to
promote bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoting Saudi newspapers as saying that
the prince would be accompanied by a high-level delegation for
talks on the Saudi-U.S. bilateral relations during his five-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to hold talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Secretary of Defense William Cohen on security in the Middle
East and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
He denied the reports saying a contract with Washington would
be reached during the visit to purchase some 30 F-16 warplanes
worth billions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said Riyadh wanted to get acquainted with new approaches of
the U.S. administration, particularly in regard to the Middle East
peace and Gulf security.
</P>
<P>
But the prince did not deny that his country was seeking to
modernize its air force and swap F-5 for F-16 fighters.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has been looking for a substitute for its
21-years old F-5 aircraft since two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Sultan has said that "perhaps they (the F-5 aircraft) can
discharge their duties from five to 10 years."
</P>
<P>
Israel, the U.S. close ally in the Middle East, expressed
concern that the sale of the aircraft would tilt the regional
military balance in favor of the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers said the Saudi prince is also expected to
proceed to France to meet President Jaques Chirac and French
Defense Minister Charles Millon for talks on military, economic
and political issues.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Allays Fears of Military Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today allayed fears of a military coup in the country by
promising categorically that he will abide by the Constitution and
step down when his six-year term ends in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Six years for President Fidel Ramos as president, according to
our 1987 Constitution, is enough," he told a meeting of veterans
from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
The president was hitting back at Senator Raul Roco who accused
Ramos Sunday of laying the groundwork for a military coup d'etat
by openly supporting constitutional changes.
</P>
<P>
On February 8, Ramos openly expressed support to changing the
Constitution to limit the power of the Supreme Court after the
court voided a winning bid of a Malaysian firm to buy Manila
Hotel. The court ruling has generated wide concern over the
country's investment procedures.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing Roco's charges as "rumors," Ramos said no coup will
succeed in the country and reiterated that he has no intention to
lift his term limit. Under the country's 1987 Constitution, the
president can only serve one single six-year term.
</P>
<P>
But also today, the Senate passed a resolution with a majority
vote criticizing Ramos for vetoing a provision of the 1997
national budget, which prohibits any budget fund to be used for a
national plebiscite on charter change.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the 24 senators voted for the resolution which
accused Ramos of abusing his presidential power and leaving the
door open to charter changes.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Albania's Former President Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The trial of Albania's former
president Ramiz Alia was indefinitely adjourned shortly after it
opened here at a local court today.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Alia, accused of "genocide and crimes against
humanity," was put off after the defendant's lawyer, Kleanthi
Koci, charged the tribunal of "bias."
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer also alleged that the country's judicial
procedure had been violated because his client had not officially
been informed of the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
Alia, 71, was charged with ordering the shooting of Albanians
who tried to flee the country from 1986 to 1991, and sending
dissidents into internal exile from 1982 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
For his role as the small Balkan nation's head of state from
1982 to 1992, he was convicted for similar charges and sentenced
to nine years in jail in 1993 but was released in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Also standing trial this time are two former interior
ministers, Simon Stefani, 67, and Hekuran Isai, 63.
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered to the press by his lawyer on Monday,
Alia said the trial was a government effort to "divert public
opinion away from the grave economic and political crisis."
</P>
<P>
The former president was referring to the recent mass protests
against President Sali Berisha after the collapse of
make-rich-quick investment schemes that resulted in the loss of
many Albanians' life savings.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has liberalized
foreign exchange control in hopes of encouraging national
economy, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the Bank of Botswana, limits
on domestic foreign currency accounts, offshore institutional
portfolio investment, investment overseas by companies, and
lending to foreign non-resident controlled companies were raised
as of today.
</P>
<P>
"This is in line with government policy to de-regulate the
financial sector," SAPA quoted the announcement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Botswana Bank also announced that it was working to
introduce offices of "change as an alternative to the foreign
exchange counters of commercial banks."
</P>
<P>
"It is the intention of government to encourage a greater
number of players in the provision of services for the buying and
selling of foreign currency and on the spot exchange with the
Pula," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Pula is a national currency of Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency accounts in Botswana can now be opened to a
maximum of the equivalent of one million Pula in the case of
individuals, and 10 million Pula for companies.
</P>
<P>
Previous limits were 100,000 Pula for individuals and one
million for companies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, by the end of this January Botswana's inflation
rate registered 9.1 percent, dropping 1.4 percentage point
against 10.5 percent a year ago, a report from the Central
Statistics Office in Gaborone said.

<HEADLINE> Record Tobacco Crop Expected in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Tobacco
Association (ZTA) has estimated that the country will this year
produce between 225 and 235 million kilograms of flue-cured
tobacco provided the rains make way for fine weather.
</P>
<P>
ZTA President Rob Webb today said there have been reports of
incessant rains and water-logging in the northern areas where
most of the tobacco are grown, while the southern areas have,
however, not experienced heavy falls.
</P>
<P>
But generally, he said, the crop is looking good.
</P>
<P>
Webb said the irrigated crop is doing well and reaping and
curing are now underway on the dryland crop which appears to be
ripening very fast.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the country's chief foreign currency earner. Last
year, the country produced 202 million kilograms of tobacco worth
about 600 million U.S. Dollars. This year, a figure of about 700
million U.S. Dollars has been projected.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Dollar Expected to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Dollar is
expected to depreciate by between five and 10 percent during 1997
provided inflation does not spiral again, a top banker said here
today.
</P>
<P>
First Merchant Bank Managing Director Ray Feltoe said, ''a lot
depends on inflation and if the past is anything to go by, then i
would say the Dollar will depreciate by five to 10 percent this
year.''
</P>
<P>
He said the Central Bank is most likely to keep a close watch
on currency movements, particularly during the tobacco auctions,
expected to start on April 22 and last for more than seven
months.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank usually maintains a stable currency during
tobacco auctions, mainly due to the huge inflow of foreign
currency during the auction season.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank said the Zimbabwe Dollar was
unlikely to depreciate much against other currencies this year.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Dollar is currently quoted at about 10.9767 to
the U.S. Dollar, compared to 9.4518 a year ago. Last year, the
Zimbabwe Dollar fell by five percent in real terms against major
trading partner currencies.

U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Helms-Burton Act in

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Agency on Rediscount Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries (CZI) today described the recent cut in the rediscount
rate as a bold move which will help sustain the economic recovery
process.
</P>
<P>
CZI chief executive Joe Foroma said the resultant decrease in
lending rates, together with last week's announcement of new
tariffs, would encourage increased investment in job creating
projects by the productive sector.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank, in response to the general decline in
inflation, on February 7 slashed the rediscount rate from a high
of 27 percent to 23.5 percent, the most dramatic cut since market
reforms were launched in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have been forced to adjust their minimum
lending rates, with most charging an average of 26 percent from a
high of between 28 and 29.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only last Friday, the government released details of the new
tariff structure, which has resulted in a major reduction in duty
on raw materials and intermediate goods, while capital goods
would now be imported duty-free with effect from March 1.
</P>
<P>
Foroma said it is essential that the economic recovery being
experienced is sustained this year, which would in turn improve
the investment climate as well as business optimism.
</P>
<P>
Last year, gdp growth was estimated at eight percent following
a rise of 49 percent in agricultural output, while this year,
economists are predicting a growth of between six and seven
percent.

<P>
BRUSSELS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
the United States are still far from an agreement over the
disputed Helms-Burton Act, after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright held a half-hour meeting with European Commission (EC)
officials.
</P>
<P>
The possibilities of coming to an agreement before Thursday,
when the World Trade Organization (WTO) forms a panel to resolve
the dispute, "remains not so good," EC Vice President Leon Brittan

</P>
<P>
Over the past year, EU-U.S. relations have been strained after

trading with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has twice suspended the law for six
months -- the last time on January 3.
</P>

It is expected that in the absence of a better offer than that

Director-General Renato Ruggiero on February 20, the deadline for

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister
Ntsu Mokhehle today accused the country's monarch of harboring
and allowing the leader of a police mutiny to escape.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to parliament, Mokhehle said his government is
concerned that King Letsie III would harbor a man wanted for
criminal activities, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The man is police Second Lieutenant Phakiso Modise. He is the
alleged leader of an 11-day police rebellion which ended at the
weekend, with the army storming the national police headquarters
where the rebels were held up.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister claimed that Modise and 24 other police
officers took refugee at the royal palace in capital Maseru.
</P>
<P>
He said the King refused to hand over them when other
mutineers were surrendering to the army before two church
leaders. The King's office has since reported that Modise and
another unidentified rebel leader have escaped, he added.
</P>
<P>
There has been no comment from the King's office on the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny began on February 6 when eight junior police
officers accused of murdering three colleagues seized control of
the police headquarters in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Relations between King Letsie and Mokhehle have been uneasy
since the King ousted him in a royal coup in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho Prime Minister was reinstated only after pressure
from other Southern African leaders.

<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A 25-year-old man in Britain is
reported to have become the latest and the 15th victim of the
human form of BSE or mad cow disease, according to local press
reports here today.
</P>
<P>
The victim, named Adrian Hodgkinson who was a young Royal Air
Force corporal from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, died 12 days ago
from Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), the human brain
deterioration related to BSE.
</P>
<P>
Hodgkinson was examined by specialists from Edinburgh, the
capital of Scotland, after doctors in Harrogate diagnosed his
gradual deterioration as CJD two months ago.
</P>
<P>
However, his mother said that he developed the first symptoms
last March, suffering weight loss and recurrent pins-and-needles
in his hands. Then his symptoms worsened to include hallucinations
and burning spasms.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank Operating Profits Up by 37 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest commercial bank
Deutsche Bank registered an increase of 1.6 billion marks (987
million U.S. dollars), or 37 percent in its operating profits last
year, the bank reported today.
</P>
<P>
With profits totaling 5.8 billion marks (some 3.58 billion
dollars), the bank obtained an annual surplus of 2.2 billion marks
compared with 2.1 billion marks in 1995 and a balance of 886
billion marks, or 23 percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the rise in profits to its stronger trading
in investment banking. According to it, in 1996, its credit volume
increased by 31 billion marks to reach 410 billion marks, while
customer deposits rose by 25 percent to 375 billion marks.

<HEADLINE> Peace Seminars Held in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Somali Scouts
Association and the Somali Peace Line concluded the two peace
promoting seminars at Omar Qorei building of south Mogadishu and
Amana hotel of north Mogadishu respectively today.
</P>
<P>
They were the first of its kind ever held since former
president Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Somali Scouts Association Hashi Abdulle Abikar
said more than 100 trainees have attended the 15-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
Youngsters between 8 and 25 years old were taught 11 different
subjects including peace and reconciliation, youth development,
drug prevention, modalities and first-aid programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony attended by some of the
international and local aid agencies and intellectuals, Abikar
said he hoped the trainees have acquired substantial knowledge
about the taught subjects.
</P>
<P>
"this is the first and more will follow in some parts," said
Abikar who is the first individual to launch a scouts association
in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, the uniformed trainees showed the skills
they have laearnedU during their course of education. Young boys
and girls sang songs of peace, nationalism and patriotism
together with the national anthem of the country.
</P>
<P>
Abikar said the pacification of the Somali people should start
from the grass roots level so as to restore trust, peace and
harmonious co-existence among the different clans of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
However, the participants of the ceremony were guarded by
heavily armed militiamen supported by two battle wagons. Some of
the attendants wonder why the battle wagons were brought to the
area when peace is in question.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the scouts association said the technical wagons
were there to secure the safety and the smooth running of their
program.
</P>
<P>
The other seminar by the Somali Peace Line was attended by 20
community members from women's groups, traditional leaders,
religious scholars and youth.
</P>
<P>
During the threenedU-day seminar, the attendants have
discussed three agendas about the role of the social groups in
the peace making process, traditional mediation mechanisms on
solving contemporary conflicts and resources sharing after
independence.

<HEADLINE> UK New Trade Promotion Campaign Targets SEA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A new three-year trade
promotion campaign to boost exports of British goods to South East
Asia was launched today by the Board of Trade and the Foreign
Office.
</P>
<P>
The campaign entitled "South East Asia -- Lands of Opportunity"
is aimed at those small and medium sized companies that overlook
the many opportunities that exist for their products in the
markets of the region.
</P>
<P>
President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang told a press
conference that the campaign would also help businesses already
active in the region that want to expand into other countries in
South East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will focus on Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
South East Asia is Britain's ninth largest export market with
sales worth 5.7 billion pounds (9.12 billion US dollars) in 1996.
However, Lang said Britain's market share is only two and a half
percent which means there is much room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 400 million, a rapidly expanding consumer
base and economies buoyed by growth rates averaging six to eight
percent, British companies must keep their eye on the "tiger" and
the opportunities available there, Lang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Research has shown that many small and medium sized companies
that are already active in the region or the established markets
of Europe and North America overlook the wider potential of South
East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ian Lang pointed out that products that attract buyers in
Thailand were just as likely to find similar interest from
consumers in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will focus on these types of companies and
Britain's aim is to introduce an additional 750 businesses to the
markets in each of the next three years, according to Lang.
</P>
<P>
Key elements of the campaign are: -- initial program of
seminars across Britain to raise the profile of the markets and
the export support available to companies,
</P>
<P>
-- Promotional events in the markets to concentrate on priority
sectors - oil and gas, transport, healthcare, telecommunications
and construction,
</P>
<P>
-- Utilization of Business Councils in Singapore, Thailand,
the Philippines and Indonesia to provide additional support to
companies beyond market entry.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Hanley, Minister of State at the Foreign Office, also
said at the press conference that people in his office would do
their utmost to promote British interests.
</P>
<P>
realising South East Asia is the most exciting area of the
world for British companies involved in overseas trade today, "our
Embassies and High Commissions are well aware of this and fully
committed to playing their part in promoting British interests,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Opportunities and Challenges Facing  Pakistan's New PM (1)  by Yang Shilong, Xu Yuenai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Armed with a massive popular
mandate, Nawaz Sharif, who sat on the opposition bench for three
years, has come back to the office of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, whose tenure as prime minister was cut short in 1993 by
a power struggle with the then president, Ishaq Khan, was sworn in
late Monday for a new five-year term after a two-thirds majority
of the 217- seat National Assembly reposed confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
However, for the 46-year-old Sharif, chief of the Pakistan
Muslim League, a landslide victory in elections is a two-edged
sword: while it enables him to implement his agenda, it also
leaves him no excuses for failure, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
With an absolute parliamentary power in hand, Sharif's
government is given an opportunity to break the vicious cycle of
unnecessary political confrontation and waste of time in the
National Assembly on frivolous issues.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's government can adopt policies with confidence because
its survival will not depend on the support of the smaller groups
which often changed sides in the past, analysts said. There would
be no political blackmailing to hinder the smooth functioning of
the administration.
</P>
<P>
The expectations of the common people from the new government
will center around its economic performance, particularly the way
it affects their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after taking oath, Sharif, who clearly sensed the
expectations, announced that his top priority was to revive the
ravaged national economy.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed determination to control inflation, increase
employment, continue the process of accountability and deal with
the phenomenon of widespread corruption in the country with an
iron hand.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed that the way ahead is no plain sailing.
Putting the economy back on the right track is the most difficult
job facing Sharif.
</P>
<P>
In addition to restoring confidence and setting the
macro-economy in order by looking into GDP growth, the new
government, which is leading a country on the verge of economic
collapse, will have to solve Pakistan's key problem of funding
foreign debt which has amounted to more than 23.1 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Add to this the domestic debt burden of 860 billion rupees
(21.5 billion dollars), and the new economic managers have their
work cut out for them.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficit is also an overriding concern for the Sharif
government. The country's fiscal deficit is now running at 6.3
percent of GDP. It is required by the International Monetary Fund
to be brought down to four percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Difficult as it is, this can be achieved either through a cut
in expenditure or an increase in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe increasing taxes will be politically
difficult and unpopular, especially for a new government. And
cutting current government expenditure is a tough call.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, to reduce deficit is certainly part of the new
government's plans. Nawaz Sharif has said that he expects to
rationalize the tax system, make drastic spending cuts and create
an investor- friendly environment.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Opportunities and Challenges Facing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another primary concern for the new government is to solve the
balance of payments problem. Pakistan's trade gap now has reached
a stunning 30 billion dollars. It is believed that to increase
exports in short term does not seem to be realistic. It is
optimistic if Pakistan can increase its industrial production.
</P>
<P>
However, to increase industrial production the new government
will have to build the business confidence as about 40 percent of
the country's industrial units have virtually closed.
</P>
<P>
Cleaning up the political life is also a most formidable
challenge for the Sharif government, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The new government's handling of corruption cases will be
closely watched by the people who are tired of the rampant
corruption and misuse of state resources by the high-up.
</P>
<P>
Though Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly promised to carry on the
accountability process, a major question still harbors in most
citizens: Can Nawaz give a better, cleaner and transparent
government? Otherwise, they will face public wrath similar to the
one faced by the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Law and order is another important area which demands immediate
attention. Protection of life and property of citizens has to be
an important consideration because such insecurity weakens the
confidence of the people in the government.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, analysts believe that it is also a major problem for
the new prime minister to keep a sound relationship with the
president.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution has tilted the balance
of power in the political system decisively in favor of the
president who has the upper hand if differences develop between
the president and the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The power of the president will remain an undeniable reality
even if Nawaz Sharif has a comfortable majority in the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the new government will find its hands
bound by the newly-established Council for Defense and National
Security as it has provided institutional arrangement for their
input to policy-making on core policy issues.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to do away with the council or abolish the power of
the president to remove the elected government is likely to strain
relations between the prime minister and the establishment.
</P>
<P>
Although it is still a question if Nawaz Sharif can lead
Pakistan out of the economic crisis and political instability, one
thing is clear: this is Nawaz Sharif's last chance.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani people are weary not only of one general election
after another but also of failed promises of successive
governments. The low voter turnout at the recent election,
estimated at between 30 to 35 percent, is evidence to this.
</P>
<P>
If Nawaz Sharif can not succeed in stabilizing the country's
finances and tackling the macro-economic problems, the foreign
debt problem in particular, the people will not give him such a
mandate again.

LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense
(MoD) has decided to establish a new military college for 16 and
17 year-old soliders in an effort to tackle the shortage of
recruits.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo is expected to
announce later this week the establishment of the Army Foundation
College, which is to cost 15 million pounds (about 24 million U.S.
dollars), according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the most significant step taken by the British
government to cover shortage of some 4000 soldiers in British army
by lowering the recruitment age from 18 to 16.
</P>
<P>
The new college in Harrogate, which will have places for 1,300
boys and girls, is expected to open in September 1998.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Three Outlawed Killed in Central Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Three men of an armed
opposition group were killed in clashes with Iranian security
forces in Isfahan, 440 kilometers south of Iran's capital of
Tehran, an Information Ministry official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the three men were killed after an
anti-terrorism squad of the Information Ministry put a siege on
their houses in the city Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added that
the three belonged to the Iraq-based armed opposition group of
the People's Mojahedin of Iran (PMOI).
</P>
<P>
A member of the anti-terrorism squad was said to have
sustained minor injuries during the clashes with the anti-
government elements.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, another PMOI member had been injured and later
arrested after a street shooting near Isfahan's Revolution Square
Sunday. A passer-by caught in the crossfire was reported to have
also been slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
The clashes in Isfahan have been the second round of
confrontations this month between the Iranian security forces and
the anti-government militants operating inside Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian security forces have recently stepped up control
and order in various cities of the country on the occasion of the
18th anniversary of Islamic Revolution and plans to launch the 7th
presidential elections in June.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, PMOI staged a series of bombing attacks across the
country during the fourth parliamentary elections. The government
reacted by staging an air raid on a PMOI base inside the Iraqi
territory.
</P>
<P>
There are about 20,000 Iranian anti-government forces in Iraq
with Mass'oud Rajavi as their leader who lives in Iraq at the
moment.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia Outruns OECD Members in Attracting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries in Southeast
Asia have outrun the established developed countries in the
worldwide competition for foreign direct investment (FDI), a
German economic institute said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cologne-based Institute for German Economy
(IW), members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) attracted 83 percent of the world FDI flows in
1990. But five years later, the OECD's share in world FDI flows
dropped to 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the Southeast Asian countries had seen
their share in the world FDI flows doubled to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The German institute stressed that "Germany has played in the
global competition for FDI a rather insignificant role."
</P>
<P>
According to its statistics, Germany absorbed only 15.4 billion
marks (about nine U.S. dollars) of FDI between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, FDI inflows to Britain, China, and France during
the five years were all about seven times as large as that to
Germany. As for the United States the figures were 15 times as
large, the IW said.
</P>
<P>
According to the institute, the global FDI flows grew by nearly
19 percent annually between 1985 to 1995, doubling the growth of
world trade.

<HEADLINE> UAE Urged to Introduce Laws on Industrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) will have to introduce some laws with regard to industrial
property rights in keeping with its commitment to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a top UN official said.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Starein, senior counselor of the Development
Cooperation Department for Industrial Property Law at the
Intellectual Property Organization of the United Nations, made the
remarks at a seminar on intellectual property rights held here
today.
</P>
<P>
He said the UAE needs to keep up with international standards
and regulations approved by the member states of the WTO on
industrial property rights and introduce some laws in this field.
</P>
<P>
He said these regulations and standards are stipulated by the
agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights
signed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The UAE joined the WTO in 1992 and began to issue laws to
protect intellectual property rights, but they are not up to the
recognized standards, especially in the field of the industrial
property rights, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Starein hinted that the introduction of laws should focus on
the protection of the geographical indicators of some famous
products and combat unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
There is no law in the UAE to ensure the indicators of some
products enjoying a world renowned reputation and the indicators
are often not authentic in UAE's markets. Meanwhile, the public
are often misguided when some competitors advertise qualities or
features on the products that the products do not have,
Starein said.

BONN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe and his Swedish counterpart Bjoern von Sydow agreed during
talks here today to expand military cooperation between the two

They also voiced reservations about the possibility of the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon Accuses Israel of Violating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 18 (Xinhua) -- After one south Lebanese
villiger was killed and two others were wounded in Israeli
bombardment this morning, the Lebanese government accused Israel
of violating a bilateral cease-fire understanding reached last
April.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Radio Lebanon announced this afternoon that the
Lebanese Foreign Ministry filed a complaint over the Israeli
bombardment to a five-state committee monitoring a limited truce
on the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in the Foreign Ministry were quoted as
saying that the committee is to hold a meeting in the south
Lebanese border town of Naqoura Wednesday morning to discuss the
Lebanese complaint.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising representatives of France, Israel,
Lebanon, Syria and the United States, was set up under the April
understanding.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second meeting of the committee in 72 hours
and the third meeting since this year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery pounded a number of villages from a hilltop
position overlooking the area of Nabatiyeh in south Lebanon this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Several shells hit the village of Habboush at 9:00 a.m. (07:00
GMT), killing a villager and wounding another, police sources in
the area reported.
</P>
<P>
The shelling also caused damages to some a dozen of houses,
according to the anonymous sources.
</P>
<P>
A third civilian was injured in the village of Arab Salim, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the Israeli bombardment, the pro-Iranian
guerrilla Hezbollah, or Party of God, launched attacks at
Israeli positions of Dabbesheh, Soueida and Dhuhra, but no
casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
The civilian casualties were reported only hours after the
cease-fire monitoring committee ended a meeting in Naqoura
without denouncing any sides for the cease-fire breach.
</P>
<P>
The committee met at the headquarters of the U.N. peace-keeping
forces at 11:00 a.m. (09:00 GMT) Monday to discuss complaints
filed by Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
After ending its meeting around the midnight, the committee
issued a statement urging all belligerent sides to respect the
terms the cease-fire understanding brokered by the U.S. and
France.
</P>
<P>
In the complaint lodged to the committee, Beirut wanted Israel
to be held accountable for the wounding of a shepherd and damages
to homes in the Beqaa during a string of Israeli air attacks last
week.
</P>
<P>
Israel laid a counter claim after its forces discovered five
bombs planted within its self-styled security zone in south
Lebanon which they said put civilians at risk.
</P>
<P>
The committee accepted both claims as "factual" and "deemed it
necessary to urge all combatants to abide strictly and fully by
the provisions of the April 26, 1996 understanding."
</P>
<P>
The April understanding bars all the parties from targeting at
civilians in their military operations.
</P>
<P>
However, the understanding does not impose a ban on guerrilla
attacks on Israeli occupation forces and the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia, and gives the Israeli troops
and the SLA the right of "self-defense."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the committee statement, the Lebanese Foreign
Ministry said today that the committee "stressed the right of the
Lebanese resistance movement to launch attacks on the Israeli
occupation forces and the Israeli client militia on the Lebanese
land."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said that the monitoring
group did not accept the Israeli claim that the bombs planted by
guerrillas put civilians at risk.
</P>
<P>
It clarified that the Lebanese delegation to the committee
rejected Israeli threats that the Israeli forces would make
responses which could "hurt civilians" as long as the Lebanese
guerrillas use bombs in their operations.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Muslim guerrillas and bombardment by
Israeli forces in south Lebanon constitute a daily scene on the
last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from
crossing-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Chief Justice, Chief of Police Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Bull and Joe Tate were appointed last year by former warlord
Charles Taylor, head of the now disbanded National Patriotic Front of
Liberia (NPFL), who ignited the country's civil war in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Bull handed in his resignation from the United States, where he is
seeking asylum, a report reaching here said, quoting the radio run by
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
The former supreme court chief justice fled Liberia last April
when renewed factional fighting broke out in the capital of Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Tate has been strongly criticized for recruiting poorly-trained and
unprofessional police officers.
</P>
<P>
The police was accused of backing the NPFL in factional fighting in
Monrovia last April and May, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The resignation followed the announcement of the decisions made at
last week's meeting of foreign ministers from the Committee of Nine on
Liberia of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting ended with a re-affirmation of May 30 this year as the
date for the general elections to formally end the Liberian
conflict, during which more than 150,000 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, ECOWAS foreign ministers decided to take immediate
steps to reform the existing supreme court so that it can be free from
factionalship or political influence in adjudicating all matters
arising from the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Liberian police will be trained by the ECOWAS
peacekeeping force operating in the country, known as ECOMOG, to take
the charge of security.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, lauded for its recent success in monitoring the disarmament
and demolibization of Liberia's warring factions, has expressed
support for the forthcoming general elections and announced its
withdrawal from the country six months after the elections.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Taylor, preparing to run for the
presidency, has re-appointed Gloria Scott to occupy the slot
allocated to the NPFL on a restructured Electoral Commission. Scott
has presided over the commission until now.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS foreign ministers meeting last weekend agreed with
Liberia's ruling Council of State to set up an independent election
commission that will replace the current one comprising factional
appointees.
</P>
<P>
The new election commission will comprise seven members, with
three of them to be appointed by the three former factional
leaders in the Council of State, namely Alhaji Kromah, George
Boley and Taylor.
</P>
<P>
The four remaining members will each be appointed by the alliance
of seven political parties, women's organizations, youth organizations
and labor and trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The elections commission will also include technical advisors
from ECOWAS, the United Nations and the Organization of African
Unity without voting power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Council of State, the interim government, will
appoint the chairman of the new elections commission in consultation
with ECOWAS.

<HEADLINE> Potential of Trade between Greece, China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece could serve as a
junction for the development of trade relations between China and
the Balkans, the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the countries
of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
This is the conclusion of a study by the Institute of Studies
on the Greek Economy (IMEO), published today in the weekly
bulletin of the Hellenic Overseas Trade Organization (OPE).
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the study said, the possibilities for the
development of trade relations between Greece and China are
unlimited.
</P>
<P>
To date, it notes, only four Greek enterprises have become
active in China as far as investing and becoming established in
that country is concerned.
</P>
<P>
The study underlines that long-term strategy and marketing is
necessary in order to identify those sectors in the Chinese market
which Greek products could rapidly penetrate.
</P>
<P>
In addition to those products already being exported to China
with the assistance of OPE, the study said, other Greek products
identified by Chinese experts during bilateral contacts as being
attractive include marble, olive oil and solar water heaters.
</P>
<P>
The IMEO study also notes particular interest in the Chinese
market for cooperation with Greece in the sectors of tourism and
technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
The past several years have witnessed a steady growth in trade
between the two countries. In 1996, the total volume of the trade
between the two sides reached 262 million U.S. dollars, a 23.2
percent up compared with that of the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Head Warns Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's security head Ami
Ayyalon today warned the government that implementation of the
planned building project in eastern Jerusalem could lead to
Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
In his briefing to the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee, Ayyalon, head of Israel's secret service
General Security Service, said that the Palestinians would react
violently if Israel began building in the Har Homa area in
southeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ayyalon issued similar warning over the opening of an
underground tunnel in eastern Jerusalem which led to the bloodshed
last September that killed over 70 people.
</P>
<P>
He said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who himself had
no interest in encouraging more violence, could not be able to get
situation under control.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side, which claims East Jerusalem as the
capital of an independent Palestinian state, has warned recently
that the building project in Har Homa neighborhood could spark
Palestinian violence and endanger the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli rightist camp continued today exerting
pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to begin
immediately the housing project in Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu convened a meeting of the Ministerial Committee on
Jerusalem Affairs today, which approved several road projects in
Jerusalem areas including a ring road in eastern Jerusalem.
The committee did not discuss the Har Homa issue today, but
would likely tackle it next week.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu rejected criticism by some of his coalition
partners over the Har Homa issue, saying that he did not
need any preaching on the matter. He reiterated that Israel
would maintain sovereignty and full control over all Jerusalem
to ensure its unity and security.
</P>
<P>
Hardline Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, currently abroad, was
quoted by Israel Radio as saying that plans to build roads
were no replacement for the Har Homa project.
</P>
<P>
Olmert said Israel should start the project in order to
send a message to the international community and its neighbors
that it would never allow Jerusalem to be divided. He
complained that Netanyahu had failed in his pledge to start
construction in Har Homa after the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Third Way's lawmaker Alexander Lubotsky said today that if the
government failed to go ahead with the Har Homa project, it could
send out a misleading message that "our deeds in Jerusalem depend
on getting permission from Yasser Arafat."
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace movement Peace Now today criticized the
government for the Har Homa project, saying it was "provocative
and dangerous." A spokesman for the movement said the group would
fight a legal struggle against the project in Israel's High
Court.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police dispersed a group of far rightist
protesters who gathered outside the Prime Minister's Office to
denounce what they called Netanyahu's policy of dividing
Jerusalem.

million U.S. Dollars in aid this year, compared with 100 million
Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>

assistance, medical care, food, technical help, administration of
the state, the restoration of agricultural production and some
development projects in the war-torn southern African country,
she said.
</P>
<P>
The total U.S. aid to Africa will reach one billion Dollars
this year, up from last year's 670 million Dollars, she noted.

Expanding the PC market beyond existing users is critical for
PC makers. Two-thirds of U.S. households with incomes of more than
100,000 U.S. dollars own computers, market researcher Dataquest
says. Market saturation is starting to show. Last year, U.S. PC
sales grew 14 percent, down from a 21 percent growth rate of a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said 12 percent of households with incomes less
than 30,000 have PCs. PC makers believe the bulk of the PC growth
will come from this group in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
But the effort to tap that market is expensive, because profit
margins on under-1,000-U.S.-dollar PCs are thin. In addition,
first-time buyers require more support than do experienced PC
users.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Introduce Note of 20,000 Shillings </HEADLINE>

<P>
KAMPALA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda, the
official central bank, has announced a plan to introduce a
20,000-Shilling (about 20 U.S. Dollars) note in a bid to
harmonize the country's currency structure.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here today said the bank now is reviewing
the feasibility of note introduction in attempts to rationalize
the cost-effectiveness of the currency structure.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at reducing the risk of transporting a
bulk of low value notes and meeting the increasing demands for
higher currency denominations so as to raise efficiency in
commercial operations.
</P>
<P>
The bank is inviting relevant comments from the press and
welcomes people to deliver their opinions directly to the bank's
senior officials, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Uganda introduced notes of 5,000 and 10,000
Shillings respectively in February, 1994 and September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Before February, 1994, the highest denomination of the Ugandan
notes is 1,000 Shillings. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Sector Pay Rises Remain at 3.1 pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Pay rises in Britain's
manufacturing industry averaged 3.1 percent in the final quarter
of last year and were unchanged since last June, according to
figures today from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
The CBI's latest pay survey says that the figure is unchanged
from the third-quarter level and down from the 3.7 percent
recorded in the final three months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
A third of manufacturers said that pay deals were being kept
low because of an inability to raise prices while just over a
quarter said low profits were restraining rises and 20 percent
cited a low rise in the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the figure will be taken up by the government
as another indication that inflation pressures in the economy
remain subdued and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's
determination not to raise interest rates before the general
election will be further underpinned.
</P>
<P>
However, in the service sector, pay awards increased slightly
in the same period to an average of 3.8 percent, compared with 3.6
percent in the third quarter and 3.4 percent in the last quarter
of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture in Iraq Deteriorates, Says FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior FAO (Food and
Agriculture Organization) official in northern Iraq has said
agriculture has been deteriorating because of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
English newspaper Baghdad Observer today quoted Al-Khair
Khalafallah Khalid as saying that worse agricultural situation is
due to the lack of agricultural machinery, seeds, pesticides and
fertilizers that Iraq used to import before the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
According to Khalid, the acute shortage in imported
agrucultural inputs as a result of the sanctions has caused a
considerable decline of cereal production.
</P>
<P>
The overall agricultural situation is catastrophic,
particularly in the most productive northern part of the country,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iraq since 1991
after the end of the Gulf War to drive out the Iraqi troops from
Kuwait following its 1990 occupation of the oil-rich emirate.
</P>
<P>
Khalid warned that the situation will get worse if no immediate
action is taken to rehabilitate agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He attributed fluctuation in cereal production during last
year's cropping seasons to a set of factors including lack of
agricultural machinery, pesticides, seeds and fertilizers as well
as plant diseases and soil degradation.
</P>
<P>
"With the economic sanctions in place, Iraq was banned from
importing agricultural machinery, tractors or spare parts and
tyres to maintain and repair old machinery, which in consequence
delayed land preparation for plantation," said Khalid.
</P>
<P>
Immediate action is urgently needed to rehabilitate the
agricultural sector, he concluded, adding that the rehabilitation
process will take a relatively long time.

BONN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Government leaders decided today
to allow private competition into Germany's mail services and to
make it government policy. However, the upper house, which is
dominated by opposition Social Democrats who oppose privatization,
may insist that private mail delivery is illegal.
</P>
<P>
The government says it must abolish the state monopoly because
the Post Office has been turned into a stock company. It is 100
percent state owned but there are plans to float it around the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, about 20,000 postal workers demonstrated in Bonn
against ending of the monopoly. Their unions has predicted losses
of over 10,000 jobs as a result of the government plans.
</P>
<P>
German Post will reportedly open about 13 percent of its mail
volume to private competition during the five-year period for
transition. Formerly as a government department, it says it has
annual payroll and pension costs of seven billion marks (4.1
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some people also expect that the entry of private competition
would help bring down the prices of mail services. In Germany,
mailing an ordinary inland letter now costs 1 mark (59 cents), and
this has prompted some big customers to take bulk mails abroad and
mail them home from places like Denmark where charges are lower.

<HEADLINE> Albright Proposes New NATO-Russia Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- US Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has proposed today that NATO and Russia
"immediately" begin to develop a joint military brigade.
</P>
<P>
She announced the proposal in a speech to NATO foreign
ministers aimed at solidifying the alliance's position on eastward
expansion.
</P>
<P>
At the special ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic
Council held in Brussels, Mrs. Albright called for a NATO-Russian
Joint Council to promote regular dialogue between the two sides on
major security issues.
</P>
<P>
She told a press conference after the meeting that "we are
addressing Russian concerns in the form of a NATO-Russia charter
that will make Russia a full participant in the new security
system, although without a veto".
</P>
<P>
As for the initiative to create a NATO-Russia brigade, Mrs.
Albright said: "Basically this is a concept, it is a new idea that
we have put foreword about the possibility of NATO-Russian action
together in ways based on the very positive experience we had in
Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
She said it was an idea about how to plan, train and exercise
together, but that there was no number attached to it at the
moment, adding that the mission of the joint brigade was expected
to be peacekeeping together in appropriate areas.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said to reporters after
the meeting that the US's proposal for a NATO-Russia brigade was
"a very good initiative", but "it is difficult to elaborate the
idea further at this stage," he added.
</P>
<P>
Russian has fiercely opposed any expansion of the alliance to
central and eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR: About 10,000 Somali Refugees in Ethiopia to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) expects that about 10,000 Somali
refugees in Ethiopia are likely to be repatriated by May as about
200 of them returned home today at the start of UNHCR's voluntary
repatriation for 290,000 Somali refugees in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"The 200 returnees were provided with food for nine months and
a travel grant of 200 EB (30 U.S. dollars)," according to a UNHCR
press release. "About 1,000 Somalis are expected to return this
week in the first of a series of five trial weekly movements until
May. About 10,000 Somalis are likely to return during that
period," says UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one million Somalis fled the country because of a civil
war and a prolonged drought. Since mid-1993, UNHCR has been laying
the ground work in northwest Somalia for the return of refugees
from neighboring countries, say UNHCR. It has been implementing
quick impact projects, mainly rehabilitation of health,
sanitation, water and education facilities.
</P>
<P>
Many Somali refugees have returned home, but substantial
numbers remain in neighboring countries. In addition to the
290,000 Somali refugees in eastern Ethiopia, there are also
126,000 in Kenya, 20,000 in Djibouti and 10,000 in Yemen.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Condemns Israel's New Measures in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Faisal Husseini, member of
the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
today strongly condemned the Israeli authorities for adopting new
measures in East Jerusalem against Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Husseini's condemnation carried by the East Jerusalem-based
Palestinian press service JMCC came amid reports that the Israeli
government will strengthen control of the city at the expense of
local Palestinian residents following Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Israel's Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem
Affairs decided to build more roads in the city at a meeting this
afternoon. Israel has also threatened to close some Palestinian
institutions in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Husseini, a senior Palestinian official in charge of the
Jerusalem affairs, said in an interview with Voice of Palestine
radio that Israel is withdrawing Palestinian IDs, confiscating
land, threatening to establish new settlements and planning to
close public institutions.
</P>
<P>
These acts will lead to a possible explosion in the region, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the Israeli government wants Jerusalem to
pay the costs of Israel's withdrawals from other parts of
Palestinian territories, it can only increase tensions and lead
to an explosion in the city.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of new roads, Husseini said, "We have
made appeals against them. In some cases, the Israeli courts have
responded positively on this subject." "On our part, we will
confront all the measures that might harm the Palestinian
interests in Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the planned building of Har Homa settlement in southeastern
Jerusalem, the PLO official said that if construction begins, it
will be tantamount to a declaration of war on the part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that according to the Oslo Accords it is not
permitted for any party to conduct unilateral acts that might
affect the final outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations. On the other hand, he said, the lands were occupied
in 1967 and Israel has no right to act in them.
</P>
<P>
Husseini called on the Israeli government not to take
unilateral actions, saying these can only be taken in time of
war. "We will grasp all the promised opportunities to save the
peace process, but at the end we have to defend our lands," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Confirms Holding of Japanese Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz confirmed this afternoon that the security
authorities had detained several members of an international
"terrorist organization" and investigations on them were currently
under way.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the announcement when commenting on
reports that Lebanon had detained five people allegedly belonging
to the Japanese Red Army at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Red Army, founded in 1971, has reportedly about
40 members operating mainly in Lebanon and allied with hardline
Palestinian factions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said several people "suspected of being members of
international terrorist and extremist organizations" had been
rounded up by the Lebanese security forces in a raid since Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Lebanese authorities were conducting investigations
on them which started "since a few hours ago."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister added that after the completion of the
investigations, positions will be taken by the state prosecutor
on whether to extradite them to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency (LNNA) said this
evening that the five captured persons include three Japanese and
two Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Judge Adnan Addoum, the country's prosecutor general, received
in his office today a Japanese delegation led by the first
secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, Addoum told reporters that "things
pertaining to the detained members of the Japanese Red Army will
be clear in 24 hours."
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources said, on condition of anonymity, that two
Japanese were captured in a house owned by a Palestinian in the
Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon and a third Japanese and two
Lebanese women were detained in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Red Army was accused of involvement in a series of
terrorist activities in the Middle East in the 1970s, including
the Israeli Lodd Airport massacre in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese judicial sources confirmed that the detainees
included Kozo Okamoto, 49, who was involved in the May 1972
shootout at Tel Aviv's Lodd Airport in which 24 people died and
100 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
Okamoto was captured by the Israeli forces and sentenced to
life imprisonment but was released in a Palestinian-Israeli
prisoner swap in May, 1985.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Home Affairs Minister Katsuhiko Shirakawa was reported
to have said Japan would wait for the result of Lebanese
investigations before making a decision on whether to apply for
their extradition.
</P>
<P>
"Since the detention was made according to domestic laws, the
Lebanese government has the right to take necessary measures
first," Shirakawa told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has started to crash down terrorists and other
outlaws as part of its efforts to re-establish state authority
and enforce the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Red Army leader Fusako Shigenobu, 51, is still at
large and is high on the international wanted list.

<HEADLINE> US Reportedly Suggests "Specialized Command" in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States has privately
suggested that a NATO "specialized command" be created for the
Mediterranean region under the Naples-based South Command, in
order to let Europeans have more power within the regional
command.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted an unidentified senior
U.S. official as saying in Brussels today that the United States
meant to maintain its control over the South Command, while such a
"specialized command" be headed by a European officer.
</P>
<P>
He also described as "hardly clear" a proposal made by French
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette today at a special session of
the Atlantic Council, a political organ of NATO, on "a balanced
sharing of responsibilities between a European command and an
American command on the same level in the Mediterranean region."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said that Washington would accept neither a
"double command" for South Command, nor a division of the
command into two separate entities, as has been suggested by
France.
</P>
<P>
France suggested in January that the South Command be split
into two, with a European officer to be in charge of NATO's
ground-stationed forces in southern Europe, and a U.S. admiral in
charge of the U.S. Sixth Fleet and some air and navy forces of
NATO in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said today in Brussels that the relationship
between Europe and the United States within NATO should be one of
"parity" and not that of "hierarchy."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister pointed out that there are "considerable
difficulties" for France and the United States to attain a
compromise over NATO's reform.
</P>
<P>
He also for the first time officially suggested that France
continue to stay out of the NATO integrated military command
structure, if the reform of the trans-Atlantic military alliance
does not take on a clearer European defense identity.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Italy in Fresh Talks on Gas Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Fresh talks are currently
underway between Nigeria and Italy over the hitch in a
multi-billion U.S. dollars contract for the supply of Nigerian
gas to the European country.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Stefano Dejak, a counsellor at the
Italian Embassy in Nigeria, today.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in 1992, the ENEL company of Italy will
buy 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas from Nigeria annually when the
Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Project (NLNG) is completed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
ENEL's purchase accounts for about 50 percent of the total
production of NLNG, which involves an investment of 3.6 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the Italian firm last December informed the NLNG of
its unilateral pullout from the project, which rocked the business
circle across the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The crisis arose from the delay by the Italian company
in building a gas reception terminal at Monfalcone, Italy, due to
pressure from the locals and environmentalists, the counsellor said.
</P>
<P>
The terminal project, he explained, was discontinued following
a referendum conducted at the request of the people of
Monfalcone, who were campaigning against the project on the ground
that it would further promote depletion of the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government is prepared to assist ENEL to reach an
agreement with the protesters for the execution of the NLNG-ENEL
contract, he said, adding that the matter will be resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources here, NLNG has three other
buyers -- the ENAGAS of Spain, Gas De France and Botas of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The NLNG, jointly owned by the Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation and such big foreign oil firms as Shell, Elf and Agip, has
initiated arbitration proceedings to seek compensation from ENEL for
the breach of the contract.
</P>
<P>
The compensation is calculated by the contract term of 22.5 years
and totals at least 12 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> New Agricultural Revolution Urged at Seattle Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture in the United
States should start another revolution to provide new food systems
which can decrease certain illness, professors attending a
national science conference in Seattle said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty percent of women of child-bearing age are iron
deficient in this country," said Ross Welch, Comell University
professor and a scientist with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's research service, adding that most men have an
over-abundance of iron due to a diet heavy with red meat.
</P>
<P>
Both cases may be factors accelerating heart disease and
cancer, the professors said.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 percent of American heart disease could be avoided with
dietary changes.the disease costs 56.6 billion U.S. dollars
annually, while 104 billion dollars is spent to treat cancer
patients every year in this country, according to statistics
released by American Heart Association and American Cancer
Society.
</P>
<P>
A healthful food system could reduce 35 percent of cancer
patients, participants in the discussion estimated.
</P>
<P>
"We need to find a way to make the foods we eat," Welch
claimed, disclosing some researchers are delving into breeding
human disease-preventing crops as part of a sustainable food
system.
</P>
<P>
Comell scientists believe that plant breeders could begin
examining ways to increase non-heme iron into staple crops such as
rice, wheat, maize and cassava.
</P>
<P>
The payoff, Welch explained, would not only be a healthier diet
for Americans, but also for people in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization estimates that 2 billion people
-- one third the global population-- are iron deficient, which
lead to other diseases such as malnutrition, impaired body
temperature regulation and detrimental behavioral changes.
</P>
<P>
Comell experts called upon their colleagues to work together on
the sustainable food system approach, and upon the U.S. government
to develop policies urging consumers to buy micronutrient-rich
food and helping farmers to meet that demand.
</P>
<P>
If agricultural research pays off, Welch predicted, the new
revolution may succeed within a period of a generation.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian-Palestinian Trade
Committee met here today to explore ways to facilitate trade flow
between Egypt and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee will also discuss the role the banking and
private sectors can play in enhancing cooperation and boosting
trade.
</P>
<P>
Proposals for granting preferential treatment to exports
between the two sides will be under scrutiny, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency quoted Trade and International Cooperation Ministry
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The committee meets every year since its first session in April
1995 within the framework of an agreement on economic and
technical cooperation signed between Egypt and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) in 25 January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for the promotion of trade exchange, the
swap of preferential treatment as well as the exchange of visits
by businessmen and formation of a joint trade committee, an
offshoot of the economic and technical cooperation committee.
</P>
<P>
The trade committee is also responsible for setting up branches
for the Egyptian financial institutions and banks in the West Bank
and Gaza and encouraging trade and investment between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Headed by ministers of economy in both sides, it follows up on
the progress of work on the trade track and make recommendations
for better trade relations.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil
Sha'ath arrived here earlier today heading a delegation including
a number of ministers and experts in different domains.
</P>
<P>
First Trade and Supply Undersecretary Essam Farrag of the
Egyptian side has said the committee will try to eliminate
administrative barriers facing the transfer of goods and create a
cross-border free zone to encourage investments.
</P>
<P>
Egypt exports mere 3 million U.S. dollars of goods to the
self-rule areas every year.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have blamed the drop in the volume of
two-way trade on the difficulties caused by Israel.
</P>
<P>
An Arab League report indicated that the Israeli embargo
imposed against the Palestinian self-rule areas had incurred 6
million dollars' economic losses a day in the Gaza Strip.

intellectuals to stage a street protest in Paris Saturday against
the new immigration law presented by Interior Minister Jean-Louis
Debre.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Albright Takes Tough Stand on NATO Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- US Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said today that NATO would stick to its plan to
announce the first group of countries at its Madrid summit in July
to have them join the alliance by 1999, regardless Russia's strong
opposition to its eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special North Atlantic Council meeting attended by
foreign ministers or their deputies of the 16 NATO allies here at
the NATO headquarters, Albright said that "we must stand by our
commitments" to begin accession talks after the Madrid summit with
those who had received the invitations to join.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal should be to complete the membership negotiations by
the end of this year, so that we can sign accession instruments at
our meeting in December," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright reaffirmed that NATO's door must remain open for those
aspirants who were not invited to join this year.
</P>
<P>
"The process of enlargement... will not end in Madrid," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The US secretary of state took a rather tough stand towards the
strong opposition voiced recently by various Russian leaders
concerning NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that Russian leaders oppose the enlargement of
our alliance and that this is not likely to change. But neither
will we change," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that NATO was addressing Russian concerns in the form
of a NATO-Russia chart that would make Russia a "full participant"
in the future security system, although without a veto.
</P>
<P>
"A critical task in the weeks ahead will be to build the
partnership with Russia from which both Moscow and Europe would
clearly benefit," she said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will come to Brussels
Sunday to hold the second official negotiating session with NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana, who said today that he hoped to
make progress in defining a special relationship between NATO and
Russia at their second meeting this year.
</P>
<P>
Also at today's meeting, the US secretary of state proposed the
creation of a NATO-Russia brigade to help overcome Moscow's
opposition to NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright told a press conference after the meeting
that this proposal was "basically a concept" which needed to be
further worked out.
</P>
<P>
The US proposal was described by NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana as "a very good initiative."
</P>
<P>
Brussels is the fourth leg of Albright's inaugural tour of nine
world capitals in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
She will visit London Wednesday before flying to Moscow
Thursday to meet Russian leaders.

<HEADLINE> More Than 600 Flood Sufferers Rescued in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 600 people besieged
by floods in central Mozambique have been rescued since planes
began to be used in rescue operations there Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people surrounded by water from the Zambeze
River were pulled out to safe areas this week. Some of them had
stayed on roofs or trees for several days.
</P>
<P>
Two helicopters, a small plane and a cargo plane carrying fuel
and logistics, all from South Africa, have participated in the
rescue operation, the Mozambican Information Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Air Force has also dispatched three helicopters
and a small plane to Mozambique's Manica and Tete provinces where
a large tract of farmland and many roads were flooded, causing
hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Those rescued by South African planes are from the counties of
Mutarara, Sucamiala, Mutarema and some other areas in the Zambeze
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
Some 120,000 people, or 70 percent of the population in Caia
County, Tete Province, have been forced to abandon their home.
They are now facing severe shortages of food and clothes, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The Tete authorities today used two planes and several boats
to deliver medicine, fuel and goods for daily use from its
capital city of Tete to the worst flood-hit Mutarara and Zumbo
counties.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Pungue River in central Mozambique
has begun to decrease, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambeze's water level seems unlikely to decline soon,
meaning that floods in some parts of the Zambeze River valley
might linger for a longer time. enditem

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Spain Pledge Support to Abidance by Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Spanish King Juan Carlos today expressed support of the full
implementation of the Madrid peace conference and the Oslo
agreements signed between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and the Spanish monarch underlined that adherence to
the Madrid conference is the only guarantee for establishing a
just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, said the Egyptian
MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders made the statements at a dinner banquet held
this evening in honor of King Carlos and Queen Sophia at Abdine
Palace.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak praised the effective role played by Spain in pushing
forward the Mideast peace. King Carlos opened the Madrid Peace
Conference in 1991 which brought the Arabs and the Israelis to the
negotiating table and set the land-for-peace formula as the basis
for regional peace.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president expressed hope that the European Union
would exert more effort in the upcoming phase not only in
enhancing peace but also in realizing more equality of chances
between the advanced and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The international community's ability in facing future
challenges is based to a great extent on realizing equality among
countries regardless of the rate of growth they attained," he said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation of the Egyptian foreign policy in
the mideast peace process, King Carlos said Egypt did an excellent
job in rallying the Arab ranks and helping reach the January 14
agreement on Israeli pullback from the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish monarch also confirmed his country's support of
the peace process at all international forums which falls within
the EU framework.
</P>
<P>
King Carlos also underlined Spain's interest in the
Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which started in the Spanish city
of Barcelona in November 1995 with a view to enhancing security
and prosperity in the Mediterranean basin.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona Declaration Conference II to open in Malta in
April will probe economic partnership between the EU and the
Mideast within the context of agreements that Morocco, Tunis and
Israel have already signed and Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon are still
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the Egyptian-Spanish cooperation, Carlos said that
the participation of Spanish businessmen and senior economists in
the joint meetings between both countries testifies to their
confidence in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Spain invests over 85 million U.S. dollars in nine projects in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The royal couple arrived here Monday night on a four-day visit
which is their second in 20 years. They are accompanied by a
50-member businessmen delegation, representing major industrial
companies in the southwestern European country.
</P>
<P>
Carlos and Mubarak held talks this morning on bilateral relations,
Euro-Egyptian partnership talks and the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Invest More in Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources is planning to invest 600 million dinars (about
857 million dollars) in energy sector until the year 2000 to meet
the growing demand for energy and electricity.
</P>
<P>
In a lecture delivered Monday to army officers at the Royal
Jordanian War College, Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources
Hisham Dabbas said Jordan consumed about 490 million dollars worth
of imported oil and oil products in 1996, a sum equivalent to 7.5
percent of the country's gross domestic product, according to
Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the huge oil bill poses a serious challenge
to the country's social and economic development and continues to
burden the kingdom's balance of trade.
</P>
<P>
Energy consumption in Jordan is expected to rise by an annual
6 percent while electricity consumption to increase by an annual
11 percent, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Dabbas noted that the total national investments in the energy
sector between 1986 and 1990 totaled about 343 million dollars
while a total of 200 million dollars has been spent on refining,
transporting, storing and distributing oil and oil products.
</P>
<P>
According to Dabbas, the ministry's plan includes linking the
national grids of Jordan with those of neighboring Arab countries
as well as supplying electricity to some 600 villages.
</P>
<P>
Referring to oil and gas exploration operations, he said that
Jordan has thus far spent 260 million dollars, but the country's
oil production still remains marginal. In 1996, only 2,000
barrels of crude oil were produced, hardly sufficient for a
fraction of a day in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, Jordan's gas production reached 10
million cubic feet in 1996, accounting for 15 percent
of the country's total electric power production.

CAIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- TAIB Bank E.C., the majority shareholder of
Yatirimbank of Istanbul, will continue its strong business ties

</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted the Vice-Chairman of
the Bahrain-based financial bloc, Iqbal G. Mamdani, as saying
that TAIB would provide Yatirimbank with stronger support in
treasury markets this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's booming economy, despite political uncertainty earlier
this year and balance of payments constraints brought about by
Turkey's entry into the European Union's customs union, encouraged
TAIB to make such a decision, Mamdani said.
</P>
<P>
TAIB Bank E.C., which operates six branches in five countries,
gained a record 10.4 million U.S. dollars net profit last year, up
7.5 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to open a new branch in Kazakhstan, TAIB Kazak
Bank, according to the senior TAIB official.

of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, as saying that the drinking
water will be mainly exported to Central Asian, Arab and some

</P>
<P>
Beirut' business weekly Eco News reported lately, annual
investment in the construction sector is estimated at 4 billion
U.S. dollars, but in most cases this investment has a slow return
due to a lack of liquidity among the residents.

BEIRUT -- Lebanon's state-owned Middle East Airlines (MEA)
suffered 50 million U.S. dollars of loss during 1996, and
predicted losses of about 20 million dollars in 1997.

blamed a 17-day Israeli blitz in Lebanon in April 1996 and a sharp
oil price rise for the losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio said here today that Portugal and China should look beyond
1999 in developing their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"We should orient the Sino-Portuguese relations beyond 1999,"
said the president at a ceremony marking the issue of a book on
the history of Sino-Portuguese relations. "We should make great
efforts for the development of the region (Macao) with the wisdom
of both."
</P>
<P>
Sampaio arrived here Tuesday afternoon on a six-day visit prior
to his week-long official visit to Beijing. He has met with
leading officials of the Macao government and will hold talks with
heads of some leading local communities and Chinese officials
stationed in Macao during his stay here.
</P>
<P>
Portugal and China established diplomatic relations in 1979.
The two sides signed in 1987 a Joint Declaration on the Question
of Macao, which rules that China will resume its exercise of
sovereignty over Macao as of December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The president said the signing of the joint declaration "is a
milestone" in the history of Sino-Portuguese relations.
</P>
<P>
"History has proved that the Portuguese people and the Chinese
people know how to accept the other instead of repel, and can
handle their disputes in a way that is flexible, tolerant and
pioneering," he said. "That experience is important to all
political decision-makers."
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the Portuguese president visited Macao
after he assumed office last March. He is expected to discuss with
Chinese officials in Beijing a wide range of issues concerning
Sino-Portuguese political, economic and trade relations as well as
the transitional affairs of Macao.

BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Communist Party and
military official today called for the improvement of scientific
and technological standards of China's national defense system.
</P>
<P>
Rapid scientific development in the world has prompted
unprecedented competition, characterized by the use of high

Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission.

funding by cutting waste and upgrading efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The successes scored during the country's Eighth Five-Year Plan
period (1991-1995) and the first year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan

<HEADLINE> Kaddoumi and Boueiz Call for Arab Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Foreign Minister
Farouk Kaddoumi and his Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz called
here today for an Arab action in face of the newest developments
in the Middle East peace process and Israel's intransigent
positions.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi, who is also the chairman of the Political Department
in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), arrived in Beirut
from Damascus this morning and held a meeting with Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in the Lebanese Foreign Ministry said
that the problem of a bulk of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon was
on the top of their talks.
</P>
<P>
The sources said, on condition of anonymity, that during the
meeting, the Palestinian foreign minister briefed his Lebanese
counterpart outcomes of the peace talks between the Palestinians
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after their meeting, Kaddoumi and
Boueiz stressed a "necessity of an Arab action, at least on a
ministerial level, in face of developments taking place in the
peace process including an intransigence of the Israeli
government."
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi criticized the agreement the Palestinian leadership
and the Israeli government signed last month on a redeployment of
Israeli forces from most of the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The PLO official said that he was not satisfied with the
results of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations because Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had been "given some non-proper
benefits."
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi expressed his distrust of the Israeli government,
noting that Netanyahu had not received any pressure from the
United States "which does not seem a neutral sponsor" of the
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated a refusal of resettling Palestinian refugees
outside Palestine, and said, "We are demanding now and tomorrow a
return of the Palestinian refugees to their homeland."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister said that his government "handles
 the problem of Palestinian refugees in a way which will
preserves their national identifications."
</P>
<P>
There are more than 350,000 Palestinian refugees living in
camps and other places all over the country and the Lebanese
government rejects a resettlement of them, fearing the
resettlement would lead to a break of the fragile sectarian
balance in this country.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz announced that the views of Kaddoumi about the Hebron
agreement "are not different from the Lebanese positions."
</P>
<P>
He argued that what the Palestinians obtained from the
agreement were less than what they deserved of rights, noting
that Israel won a "certification of clean slate" from the public
opinion of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official underlined his understanding of the
difficulties facing the Palestinian leadership and their needs
to accept any gain.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that what had happened could give the Israeli
Likud prime minister an opportunity to "dismantle an
international encirclement" which was set up following
Netanyahu's election last year.

BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Ma Jian scored 31 points
to lead the Beijing Ducks, which erased a 15 points deficit, to
overwhelm the Shandong Flaming Bulls 95-74 in the Chinese
Basketball Association (CBA) league on Wednesday.

Pegasus 81-77 on Sunday on the road.
</P>
<P>
"They are much quick and can shot everywhere," said Zhou
Xuanmin, head coach of Shandong. "The turnpoint we began to go
down was last ten minutes of the first half when American Branton
was off the bench. He was very fast. Ma Jian, of cource, was
another key player for Beijing's victory."

Beijing trailed by 15 points, at 14-29, with 10:30 to go in
the first half. But Branton left the bench to lead a 25-9 run

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Following the good harvest of
1996, the State Council has issued a circular urging local
governments to do a good job of storing grain.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of January, the State had
purchased 105 billion kilograms of grain from farmers. Problems
occured when open-air grain storage and that of grain with high
water content were found in the northern part of China.
</P>
<P>
To ensure safe grain preservation, the circular called on local
authorities to speed up the drying process of grain. It also asked
local high-ranking officials to supervise their own work.
</P>
<P>
"All levels of society should be motivated to join in the
process of drying," said the document, adding that all available
space, including idle ground and rentable equipment, airports,
roads and playgrounds, should be used for drying.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the central authorities will issue loans to
major grain producers to build simply-equipped storehouses and to
maintain or buy drying equipment.
</P>
<P>
The notice also asked the local governments to help farmers
deliver grain in an orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
"In the regions which see large amounts of household-stored
grain, the administration departments should send experienced
technicians to the rural areas to help farmers store grain
safely," said the document.

BRUSSELS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
expected to tighten its safety check on non-EU countries' aircraft
under a draft directive prepared by the European Commission (EC).

<HEADLINE> Law On Animal Epidemic Prevention To Be Deliberated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A draft of the law on animal
epidemic prevention was submitted for deliberation to the 24th
meeting of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng wrote in a motion to the committee that
the law is aimed at guaranteeing people to eat high quality meat.
</P>
<P>
Designed to promote husbandry production and rural economic
development, the law is critical for the prevention, control and
elimination of animal epidemics, and will ensure public health,
the motion said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang, who explained the draft at
the meeting, pointed out that many problems occurred in animal
epidemic prevention in recent years due to the diversification of
husbandry producers.
</P>
<P>
He said that cost-cutting management styles that overlook
animal epidemic prevention practices have resulted in epidemics
among animals and people, and that disease-infected animal meat
has entered into the market in some places.
</P>
<P>
The draft was based on similar experiences in China, and
according to international practices.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on prevention and strict management, the draft
included detailed restrictions on prevention, control and
elimination of animal epidemics, and quarantining of animal
products throughout the entire process of animal breeding,
slaughtering, processing and marketing.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, China will adopt a mandatory
vaccination system to safeguard against diseases that seriously
threaten husbandry production and public health.
</P>
<P>
Bodies of animals that have been poisoned or died of illness
without clear reason as well as diseased animals and their
excrement should be handled according to special regulations.

Ministry of Education said here.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Stance Unchanged: Syrian Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu has not changed his stance over restarting the peace
talks with Syria after his recent visit to Washington, Syrian
Ambassador to the U.S. said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Voice of Arab radio of Egypt, Syrian
Ambassador Walid Moallem said that what Washington has relayed to
Syria proves that the gulf between Syrian and Israeli stances was
wide.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu discussed the resumption of peace talks on the Syrian
track with U.S. President Bill Clinton during his four-day visit
last week. After the talks, the United States said it saw no great
breakthrough on the score but still expected some progress in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian talks have been frozen since last March after a
series of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants the full return of the Golan Heights captured in
the 1967 Mideast war in exchange for peace as promised by previous
Israeli Labor government, a position rejected by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Moallem said that Damascus had reached an understanding with
former Israeli government, under which Israel would have pulled
out its forces until the borders of June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu wants the negotiations to start from square
one, the Syrian envoy told the Egyptian radio.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that he will not guarantee to accept
anything that is not written into agreement during previous talks.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that the negotiations will not be resumed
soon and urged the U.S. to exercise its role as a fair and honest
mediator to convince Israel to pick up the talks with Syria from
where they had reached.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing Netanyahu's claims that the Golan Heights were of
importance to Israel for security reasons, the Syrian ambassador
said that this is a shaky pretext in the light of the
technological development.
</P>
<P>
"The Golan Heights are Syrian land and are of importance to
Syria too," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the importance of the concomitance of the
Lebanese and Syrian tracks. Israel will fail in its attempts to
drive a wedge between Syria and Lebanon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel accuses Syria of using Hezbollah guerrilla attacks in
south Lebanon as a means of pressuring the Jewish state into a
peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese, Vietnamese Communist Party Officials Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese Communist Party
(CPC) official Hu Jintao said here today that the CPC will work
steadily with its Vietnamese counterpart on the basis of the four
principles of party-to-party relations.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a member of the standing committee of the Political Bureau
of CPC Central Committee, made the statement during a friendly and
cordial meeting late this morning with his Vietnamese counterpart
Nguyen Tan Dung.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the friendly cooperative ties between the two parties
and two countries have been completely restored and promoted since
the normalization of China-Vietnamese relation in the early
1990s. He noted that in particular, the close high-level exchanges
on issues of mutual concern have enhanced the cooperative ties
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, it is the common wishes of the two peoples and
in their best interests to further develop the traditional
China-Vietnam friendship. This is also of great significance to
safeguarding peace, stability and development in the region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On party-to-party relations, Hu called for more exchanges
between the two sides so as to learn from each other and to boost
a long-term, steady development in the friendly cooperative
relations between the parties and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The CPC official spoke highly of the achievements made by the
Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) and its people in their
innovations. He believed that under the leadership of the CPV
headed by its General Secretary Do Muoi, and guided by the
principles set by the CPV's Eighth National Congress, CPV and its
people will realize their goals with hard work.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hu also briefed the Vietnamese guests on
China's political and economic situation as well as the CPC's
construction.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said that for the past few years, especially since
General Secretary Jiang Zemin's visit to Vietnam in 1994 and Do
Muoi's return visit in 1995, relations between the two countries
have progressed greatly. He stressed that relations between the
two parties and two nations have always been friendly and
cooperative.
</P>
<P>
The CPV and its government will continue to promote mutual
understanding and trust with its Chinese counterparts, in order to
further their friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Praising China's achievements and experiences in reform and
opening up, Nguyen pledged that the CPV will promote exchanges in
this regard to benefit its cause of socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen and his party arrived in Beijing Tuesday. During their
stay in China, the Vietnamese guests will hold talks with people
from the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee, the
State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, and the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. They will also visit
east China's Hefei, Shanghai and the city of Guangzhou in south
China.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Court Lifts Ban on Privatization of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Court of Appeals
today lifted a temporary restraining order which it issued last
month to stop the privatization of the water system in the
country's capital region.
</P>
<P>
With the cancellation of the order, chief presidential adviser
Rene Cayetano said there is no more legal impediment for President
Fidel Ramos to endorse the privatization project worth 7 billion
U.S. dollars, the largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
To improve efficiency of the water service system in Metro
Manila, the government decided to privatize the Metropolitan
Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS).
</P>
<P>
Two local firms, backed by their foreign partners, separately
won the bid to operate the MWSS starting in May.
</P>
<P>
But later, the Court of Appeals ordered the Committee on
Privatization to temporarily delay its approval of the
concessional agreement the two firms won.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Philippines' judiciary has been widely criticized
by the domestic and foreign business communities for its
intervention in the country's privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court voided a winning bid of a
Malaysian firm to buy Manila Hotel and ordered the government to
sell it to a local bidder.
</P>
<P>
The court's ruling prompted Ramos to openly declare his support
to changing the country's Constitution to limit the power of the
judiciary in the economic field, triggering off a new round of
public debate over charter changes.

Affairs of the NPC Standing Committee, said here today that the
NPC address the legislative problem in line with the 160th Article
of the Basic Law of the HKSAR, which was adopted by the NPC
Standing Committee in April of 1990.
</P>
<P>
The article stipulates that after the handover on July 1, China
will maintain the existing laws and regulations in Hong Kong
except those regarded as contradictory to the Basic Law by the NPC
Standing Committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
It also says that the NPC has the right to amend contradictions
in remaining laws or to abolish them.
</P>
<P>
The examination of the laws by the Commission of Legislative
Affairs focused on existing regulations and auxiliary laws. To
date, Hong Kong has a total of more than 640 chapters of
regulations and 1160 auxiliary laws.
</P>
<P>
Qiao pointed out four categories of contradictions in those
regulations and auxiliary laws.
</P>
<P>
First, China will renounce those regulations and auxiliary laws
that completely contravene the Basic Law, embody the British
colonial governance, and were adopted in accordance with the
"constitutional package" formulated by Hong Kong's British
Governor Chris Patten.
</P>
<P>
Second, the NPC will eliminate some parts of the specific
laws. The Third and Fourth articles of the Bill of Rights
Ordinance of Hong Kong, for example, will not remain in the laws
of the Hong Kong SAR after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Third, the Chinese top legislative body will also re-phrase
some terms and expressions that contradict the Basic Law, which
exist in almost all Hong Kong's regulations and auxiliary laws.
</P>
<P>
Finally, after adopting Hong Kong's existing laws, the NPC
Standing Committee still has the right to amend or renounce those
laws it may hold contradictory to the Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> Ramos to Delay Dealing With Charter Change Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today said he will deal with the proposal to change the
country's constitution later at a proper time.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the remarks when asked to comment on a resolution
passed Tuesday by the Senate, which rejected any change in the
1987 Constitution whether by Congress or by a constitutional
convention.
</P>
<P>
"I have already put the Charter change problem on the back
burner," Ramos told reporters at his weekly press conference.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said there are many things that must be done other than a
proposed amendment of the Constitution, such as information and
education programs.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen senators Tuesday signed a resolution opposing any
amendment to the country's basic law after Ramos expressed his
support to revising the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
But today Ramos refused to comment on the recommendation of the
Philippine Constitution Association that any amendment to the
charter shall not benefit any of the incumbent elective officials.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has repeatedly said that he will step down from office
when his term expires in June 1998. But speculations have been
circulating in the country that Ramos will change his mind and
seek a new term.

<HEADLINE> UN Hosts Afghan Talks in Islamabad Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Special Envoy
for Afghanistan Nobert Holl has invited the Afghan Taliban militia
and its rivals to hold peace talks here next week.
</P>
<P>
The agenda for the three-day meeting has yet to be worked out,
Afghan sources were quoted as saying by the Associated Press of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Taliban militia and three-party opposition
alliance mainly controlling northern provinces of Afghanistan had
inconclusive talks last month in Islamabad under the UN auspices.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition includes the ousted Afghan government
led by Burhanuddin Rabbani, northern militia led by warlord Rashid
Dostum and Hezb-e-Wehdat of Karim Khalili.
</P>
<P>
The rival Afghan sides in their first direct contact discussed
matters ranging from demilitarization and deployment of a neutral
force in Kabul to the formation of a neutral interim government.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban sources in Islamabad said their leaders would
decide on the participation in the second round of UN-sponsored
talks.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested to know first what they want to talk about,"
they said in reference to the demand of the opposition for the
demilitarization of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of Afghan "working group," comprising three
representatives each from Taliban and the Supreme Council for the
Defense of Afghanistan in Islamabad bogged down after the
opposition demanded the student militia to demilitarize the Afghan
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban rejected the demand as "illogical" and feared such
a move would allow opposition forces to return to Kabul and start
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Taliban soldiers overran Kabul last year and pushed the forces
of the ousted government towards the north.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular rise of the Taliban prompted the rival groups
mainly concentrated in northern provinces to close their ranks.
</P>
<P>
The student militia has also opposed deployment of an
international peacekeeping force or creation of a mixed force of
Taliban and opposition factions for Kabul's security.
</P>
<P>
In return, the militia, which now controls two-thirds of
Afghanistan, has proposed the formation of a joint commission to
iron out matters relating to truce, exchange of prisoners and
finally setting up of a strong government.
</P>
<P>
The UN envoy who has been shuttling between warring Afghan
groups over the past year described the meeting of working group
as "a step forward" towards reaching reconciliation in the
war-ravaged country but stopped short of raising hopes for a major
breakthrough.

<HEADLINE> Airport Core Program Finished by 80 Percent: Mrs Chan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Chief Secretary
Anson Chan said today that close to 80 percent of the Airport Core
Program (ACP) had been completed at the end of January this year.
</P>
<P>
She made the remark when officiating an opening ceremony for
two major access roads to the Chek Lap Kok new airport, which is
expected to be put into use in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
West Kowloon Expressway (WKE) and Kwai Chung Viaduct (KCV),
constructed under ACP, will be opened to traffic at 10 a.m.
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The two highways form part of the 34-kilometer ACP transport
corridor linking Hong Kong island with the new airport and Tung
Chung new town.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the roads will serve Kwai Chung and the South
Kowloon areas and will come as a timely relief to the heavy
traffic in West Kowloon, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Only in a week's time, another ACP road project, the Sai Ying
Pun Section of a road network on Hong Kong island will be opened
to traffic, and in April, the Western Harbor Crossing, Hong Kong's
third cross-harbor tunnel, will be put into use, she said.
</P>
<P>
And in May the Lantau Link will connect the North Lantao
Expressway to the road network of Kowloon and Hong Kong island,
"which means we can drive all the way from Hong Kong island to
Tung Chung new town and marks the completion of the ACP transport
corridor," Chan noted.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning a series of events to mark the
completion of the corridor, she added.
</P>
<P>
According to Director of Highways Leung Kwok-sun, WKE is a
4.2-kilometer dual three-lane expressway, and KCV is a
three-kilometer dual four-lane expressway. The two projects cost a
total of 4.5 billion HK dollars (577 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Apart from forming a key part of the corridor, the two roads
are also important sections of a new strategic route providing a
direct link to the northwest New Territories and the border with
the interior of China, Leung said.

Japanese Red Army, who had been hiding for several years in the

<HEADLINE> Six Top Racing Officials Tried for Senna Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Nearly three years after the
death of Ayrton Senna in a crash during the San Marino Grand Prix,
six top Formula One figures face manslaughter charges in a trial,
according to reports from Imola, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Frank Williams, head of the successful Williams-Renault team,
is among the defendants brought to trial by prosecutor Maurizio
Passarini, who contends a mechanical failure caused the fatal
crash at the Imola track on May 1, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Senna, a three-time world champion, suffered fatal head
injuries when his Williams car failed to take the Tamburello
corner and smashed into a concrete wall during the initial laps of
the race.
</P>
<P>
While the prosecution has long claimed that a badly welded
steering column caused the crash, the Williams team and race
officials charged in the case will offer their explanation in
court.
</P>
<P>
Frank Williams, technical director Patrick Head and designer
Adrian Newey are being tried on the grounds that the steering
column on Senna's car was badly welded after it was shortened so
that the Brazilian driver could have a better view of his
instrument panel.
</P>
<P>
Senna, who had won three world titles with the McLaren team,
joined Williams-Renault for the 1994 World Championship and was
racing at Imola in his third GP of the season with his new team.

<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
called on local officials in charge of overseas publicity to help
more people around the world understand China and win the support
of more countries.
</P>
<P>
Overseas publicity is an important component of the Chinese
Communist Party's overall promotional work, and a necessary factor
in the country's opening up to the outside world, Li told local
officials who attended a national conference on overseas publicity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that over the past several years, publicity campaigns
overseas have been successful in letting the outside world know
China's reform, opening-up, economic and social progress, and in
safeguarding the integrity of national interests.
</P>
<P>
All open-minded people in the world will be able to view China
favorably, and believe that China's economic growth will maintain
long-term momentum.
</P>
<P>
However, there are some people who are not willing to consider
a powerful China, he said, adding that they want to "westernize"
and "disintegrate" the country.
</P>
<P>
The premier expressed his hope that the publicity officials
will contribute more to the country's prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Food Supplies to Reach Iraq Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The first shipment of food
supplies is expected to reach Iraq in mid-March and will be
distributed in April, U.N. sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
A number of U.N. observers in charge of monitoring the
distribution of food supplies have arrived in Baghdad via the
Jordanian capital of Amman, and some others may arrive across the
Habbaniya Airport, 60 kilometers west of Baghdad, after the Iraqi
authorities agreed to provide facilities required to enable the
the observers to contact each other in their work in Baghdad and
other Iraqi cities, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that 34 U.N. observers of several
nationalities have arrived in Baghdad for the past few days, and
others are expected to arrive soon.
</P>
<P>
So the total number of U.N. observers in Baghdad has reached
38, including four four observers who had previously arrived in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food agreement reached between Iraq and the
U.N. stipulates that 151 U.N. observers should monitor the
distribution of food supplies in central and southern Iraq, while
U.N. Food Program workers should distribute food supplies in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq officially complained about the delay of the arrival of
food supplies despite the fact that two months have passed since
the oil-for-food agreement came into operation.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food agreement -- which took effect last December
-- allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil every six
months to enable it to purchase food supplies and medicines under
strict U.N. supervision.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Parties Oppose Savimbi Being Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A series of Angolan parties
have in the past few days voiced opposition to UNITA Chairman
Jonas Savimbi's assumption of the post of leader of the
Opposition.
</P>
<P>
Nzau Puna, chairman of the Democratic Thinking Party,
considered it "illegal" for the government to appoint Savimbi as
the Opposition leader, saying Winning the biggest votes during
elections as leader of one of the opposition is quite different
from those of other opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Puna said the setting up of a special post for Savimbi should
not be detrimental to the livelihood of other opposition parties,
and that the government has got no right to air its ideas on this
viewpoint on behalf of other parties.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Liberal Party leader Victoria Pereira said Savimbi
is only a leader of the biggest opposition party and not a
representative of others. He said neither can the government nor
can UNITA represent other political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
A Social Democratic Party leader also said his party is of the
view that Savimbi should not become the leader of the Opposition
since each party has its own principle and charter.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) signed the Lusaka agreement in
1994 to pave way for achieving peace in Angola. And the post of
Savimbi in the government is one of the major issues in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
As Savimbi refused to become second vice-president of the
government, and then a special advisor to the head of state, and
asked to be the leader of the Opposition, the country is now
discussing the matter.

<HEADLINE> China Formulates Highway Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China has formulated a law to
promote the construction and management of highways, which the
country considers vital to its economic development.
</P>
<P>
The draft law on highways was submitted for deliberation to the
24th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, which opened
today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong was authorized by the
State Council, China's cabinet, to explain the draft law to the
legislators.
</P>
<P>
Calling highways an important foundation for the national
economy, Huang said that China has witnessed rapid development in
highway construction since the reform and opening up started in
1978.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had 1.157 million kilometers of
highways, covering all counties, 98 percent of towns, and 80
percent of villages.
</P>
<P>
However, Huang conceded that there are also a number of serious
problems haunting China's highway network, which include lack of
highway construction funds, poor quality of roads, imbalance of
road construction between eastern and western areas, rampant
unlawful fees and fines on highways, and illegal destruction and
occupation of highways.
</P>
<P>
"The backwardness of the communications infrastructure has
seriously held up the economic development of our country," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, it is necessary to formulate a special law
on highways that can regulate the construction, maintenance,
protection, and management of roads.
</P>
<P>
He said that the drafting work of the highway law, which
started in 1990, was based in part on the existing Regulations on
Highway Management, took into account new problems that emerged in
recent years, and referred to some other countries' good ideas on
highway laws.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, some domestic and foreign economic
entities set up a number of highway development and management
companies, which invested in road construction or purchased the
management right of existing roads, and made profit through fee
collection on passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"The draft law consists of a special chapter that addresses
this kind of highway management, which should be both protected
and standardized," Huang explained.
</P>
<P>
The draft law has nine chapters and 100 articles, which
stipulate the planning, building, maintaining, protection, and
mangement of highways, as well as the legal liabilities.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ruling Party Starts Caucus on Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine ruling
Lakas-NUCD party's members to the House of Representatives have
started a 10-day caucus on the controversial constitutional
amendments, the speaker of the lower house said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Jose de Venecia, who is secretary-general of the ruling
party, confirmed today at his weekly press conference that the
caucus started Tuesday night and may go on for the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia said the party's leadership has agreed to adopt a
"hands-off" policy on the contentious charter change initiative in
a bid to dispel rumors of a Lakas-led move to convene the
bicameral Congress into a constitutional assembly for the purpose
of charter amendments.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the "hands-off" policy means discouragement
from any discussion on the charter change issue at present since
the debate will obstruct the House's legislation work.
</P>
<P>
After the caucus within the Lakas group in the House, the party
will begin wide-ranging consultations with their constituents to
determine the position of the people on the proposed
constitutional amendments, according to the speaker.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, who himself is a potential presidential candidate,
said the results of the two stages of consultations will be
submitted to the Lakas-NUCD national directorate caucus which will
be presided by the party chairman, President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lakas party, which enjoys a majority in the lower
house, has been accused of pushing for charter changes to lift the
limit of the terms for all elective officials, including Ramos.
Under the 1987 Constitution, Ramos can only serve one single
six-year term.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the lower house which tried to distance itself from the
contentious charter change issue, the opposition-controlled Senate
has already taken its side.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the upper house easily passed a resolution
opposing any amendment to the Constitution and criticizing Ramos
for his open support to changing the basic law.
</P>
<P>
But also on Tuesday, Ramos promised again that he will abide by
the Constitution and step down when his six-year term ends in
1998.
</P>
<P>
A new round of fierce debate on charter changes was triggered
off this month after Ramos openly expressed his support to
revising the Constitution to redefine the power among the
country's legislative, executive and judiciary branches.
</P>
<P>
Ramos declared his backing to charter change after the Supreme
Court voided a winning bid of a Malaysian firm to purchase Manila
Hotel. The court ruling has worried the country's foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
But the country's opposition accused the president of trying to
open the door to amending the Constitution to extend his term.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many politicians, including Vice President Joseph
Estrada and former president Crazon Aquino, have warned Ramos of
political instability if he tried to extend his term.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Helps Uganda Fight Wetland Drainage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, Februray 19 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands government
has granted Uganda 2.2 million U.S. dollars for the country to
fight wetland drainage, reported the local daily "the Monitor"
today.
</P>
<P>
Chris Vugt who represented the Netherlands government at the
wetlands program workshop held here yesterday said that the money
will be used to strengthen and develop national capacity and
extend new methodologies for weltand resource management in local
communities.
</P>
<P>
The program to be implemented at two levels will put emphasis
on developiong the wetlands conservation and managment at
national level.
</P>
<P>
"At the district level, we shall train technical officers to
assess wetland resources whereas at the community level
methodologies for local management will be developed at selected
demonstration sites and be extended to new communities," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's minister of state for natural resources, Baguma
Isoke, cautioned participants against draining wetland areas
which he said has affected the changes in the climate and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
A biogas study carried out in 1996 in Uganda ranked Jinja
district, 80 km east of Kampala, as having the biggest percentage
of drained wetlands (76 percent). Kabale wetlands, southwestern
Uganda, have been reclaimed at a level of 58 percent, Iganga (32
(32 km east of here) 49 percent, Tororo, bordering Kenya, 48
percent and Pallisa (eastern Uganda) 36 percent.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Defers Decision on Nigeria Till </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group (CMAG) met in London on Tuesday and deferred taking
decisions on further sanctions against Nigeria till October, a
local newspaper, the Guardian, reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Commonwealth membership was suspended in November
1995 at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) held
in Auckland, New Zealand, over the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and
eight other Ogoni activists by the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
It was decided then that Nigeria would be expelled from the
Commonwealth if its human rights record achieves no major
improvement by the 1997 CHOGM meeting scheduled for October.
</P>
<P>
Some British opposition members in the parliament have been
pressing for earlier actions, saying that the delay in acting
would benefit only the Nigerian military government.
</P>
<P>
But the CMAG said it is still inviting more information from
interested parties before writing up a report for the coming
CHOGM meeting.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated its concern that many political detainees in the
country, including Chief Moshood Abiola, the self-claimed winner
of the 1993 elections, have been neither released nor tried.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese President Stresses Friendship With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio said here today that the transfer of Macao provides a
chance for both Portugal and China to strengthen bilateral
relations and friendship.
</P>
<P>
The president, who arrived here Tuesday afternoon prior to his
week-long official visit to Beijing next week, made these remarks
at a reception held this morning by the Macao Legislative
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"The transitional procedure in Macao provides another chance
for the two countries (Portugal and China) to significantly
develop their relations and further strengthen their friendship,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The president anticipated that Macao and its residents will
continue to serve as an ideal role in boosting exchanges between
the East and the West after the transfer in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The transfer of Macao to China does not mean that the
territory and its residents will lose its ideal role boosting
exchanges between the Orient and the Occident," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Sampaio to visit Macao after he took
office as the Portuguese president in March last year. He is
expected to discuss a wide range of issues concerning the transfer
of Macao and Sino-Portuguese political, economic and trade
relations with Chinese leaders during his trip to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have maintained good relations since the
establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979. Under the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao signed
in 1987, China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao
as of December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated the importance of the joint
declaration, saying it has fixed the common understanding between
the Republic of Portugal and the People's Republic of China on the
future of Macao "in a very sensible and balanced way."
</P>
<P>
He said that Portugal will carry out the promises in the joint
declaration together with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Macao until Sunday, the 57-year-old
president will meet with top officials of the Macao government and
heads of local leading communities.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong rehabilitation
group has proposed to launch a school for teenager drug addicts,
who have been rejected by mainstream schools.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Christian Zheng Sheng Association, Jacob Lam
Hay-sing, hoped that the school could provide a place for those
adolescents to shake off their drug habits and receive qualified
education.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 3,076 young drug addicts in Hong Kong,
aged between 11 and 20, according to the Central Registry of Drug
Abuse.
</P>
<P>
The proposed school would be affiliated to the Christian Zheng
Sheng College, which offers psychological counseling, drug
education and general subjects for 34 former drug-abusing
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Jacob said that his association has applied for 11 million HK
dollars (1.4 million US dollars) from the Beat Drugs Fund of the
Hong Kong government to fund the project, and the result of
applications would come out in April this year.

known as the poorest state in Malaysia, were from the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Of the total number of people infected, 37,031 were locals and

<HEADLINE> 6 Armed Robbers Grab 96m Shillings in Kenyan Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Six armed gangsters robbed
the Standard Chartered Bank in Nairobi Tuesday and took off with
96 million Kenyan Shillings (1.74 million U.S. Dollars) without
firing a single shot, local papers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bank's guards said the gangsters approached an
unsuspecting guard at 7.30 a.m. on Tuesday morning at the staff
entrance and forced him into the bank at gun point.
</P>
<P>
Once inside the bank, they ordered every employees to lie down
after which they forced the custodians with keys to open the
strongroom and took away three sacks stuffed with 40 million
Shillings and 900,000 Dollars in just five minutes.
</P>
<P>
The gangsters, who did not appear to be in a hurry, escaped in
a waiting vehicle which had all along been parked on Moi Avenue
in front of the bank, an eye-witness said.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi area Criminal Investigations Department boss Salim
Salwe who led police officers to the scene, said, "I have not
seen anything like this and I can assure you that it was an
inside and well-executed job."
</P>
<P>
The cash robbery which is the biggest in Kenya's history did
not affect the bank's operation which opened at 9.00 a.m. as
usual.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, in an even more dramatic manner, one
business executive, Charles Omondi, walked into the Embakasi
strongroom of Kenya Air Freight Handling Limited and left with a
whopping one million Dollars which was wrapped in an 11-kilogram
parcel.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police have launched an intensive manhunt for the
suspect who is still on the run out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Facing Employment Pressure Amid Population Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has shown that
28 percent of Vietnam's rural population aged over 15 had been
affected by under-employment in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Vietnam Investment Review,
urban unemployment was at 5.88 percent among the working age
population, a slight improvement compared with the 6.08 percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Labor Ministry, was based on
sample interviews with 125,090 households.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Vietnamese population reached 76 million
with annual growth rate of 2 percent. The current birth rate
nationwide is three births every minute, which means the
population grows to the size of one new commune every day, or a
new province every year.
</P>
<P>
According to international population agencies, if the
population growth is running at around 2 percent, it requires the
creation of 1.5 million new jobs each year.

<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The first ever Palestinian stock market officially
opened in Nablus, West Bank, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 companies were listed on the exchange for
trading and another 20 are in the process of being listed,
according to Palestine Securities Exchange general manager Safwan
Bataina.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are some 60 joint-stock companies in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with a combined market
capitalization of some 700 million U.S. dollars eligible for
listing.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel and Mexico have agreed to negotiate a
free-trade agreement, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The understanding was reached during a meeting earlier this
week between Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and
visiting Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is a member of the North American Free Trade
Agreement. Israel maintains free trade ties with the body's other
two members, the U.S. and Canada.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Telemedicine can save the country a total of 1.3
billion shekels (about 393.9 million U.S. dollars) a year,
reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
It will also greatly increase accessibility to high-quality
medical services around the country, Eitan Levy, a senior
official of the state-run Telecommunication Corporation (Bezeq),
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Telemedicine uses high-speed, broad-band phone lines to
transmit voice, video, computer and scan data so that doctors in
major hospitals can offer their opinions on patients' conditions
to clinics and hospitals in the periphery.
</P>
<P>
This system, said Levy, will reduce repeated testing of
patients and save hospitalization days.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Israel will open the largest ever exhibition of
Israeli plastics and rubber industry at Tel-Aviv's Exhibition
Gardens on September 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the Israeli Embassy here
today, the four-day exhibition will display plastics in packaging
products and agricultural products such as drip irrigation and
photo-degradable plastics sheets, furniture, kitchen and bathroom
fittings and medical and engineering high-tech
component.
</P>
<P>
Plastics in the medical field and in defense and aviation will
also be on display.

The plastics and rubber industry is one of the most
advanced industrial sectors in Israel. The plastics industry in
Israel employs over 20,400 people and the export figure for
1996 was 789 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Food Supplies to Reach Iraq Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The first shipment of food
supplies is expected to reach Iraq in mid-March and will be
distributed in April, U.N. sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
A number of U.N. observers in charge of monitoring the
distribution of food supplies have arrived in Baghdad via the
Jordanian capital of Amman, and some others may arrive across the
Habbaniya Airport, 60 kilometers west of Baghdad, after the Iraqi
authorities agreed to provide facilities required to enable the
the observers to contact each other in their work in Baghdad and
other Iraqi cities, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that 34 U.N. observers of several
nationalities have arrived in Baghdad for the past few days, and
others are expected to arrive soon.
</P>
<P>
So the total number of U.N. observers in Baghdad has reached
38, including four four observers who had previously arrived in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food agreement reached between Iraq and the
U.N. stipulates that 151 U.N. observers should monitor the
distribution of food supplies in central and southern Iraq, while
U.N. Food Program workers should distribute food supplies in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq officially complained about the delay of the arrival of
food supplies despite the fact that two months have passed since
the oil-for-food agreement came into operation.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food agreement -- which took effect last December
-- allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil every six
months to enable it to purchase food supplies and medicines under
strict U.N. supervision.

Beijing, February 19 (Xinhua) -- As Xinhua correspondents
learned from some relevant quarters of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Hwang Jang-yob, secretary of the Central Committee of the
Workers' Party of Korea, made transit stops in Beijing recently

given no prior notification by the side of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).

<P>
It was informed later that after his arrival in Beijing on
February 11, Hwang stayed at the DPRK embassy in Beijing. He left
there in the morning of the following day and entered into the

international law and conventional practices, the Chinese side has
taken certain security measures towards the resident agencies and
personnel of the countries concerned in China. The Chinese side
does not want to see any new tension occur on the Korean Peninsula
because of this incident. It is hoped that the relevant parties
will, with a calm and objective attitude, judge the nature of this
incident and work to seek a proper solution to it, so as to help
preserve the overall interests of peace and stability on the
Korean Peninsula.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's industrial
output for December 1996 declined 0.3 percent compared with a year
ago, because of the slowdown in the electronics and
electronics-related industries, the Economic Development Board
(EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall in December, the EDB said the cumulative
output for 1996 was 3.4 percent higher than that of 1995.

</P>
<P>
The industry recorded a cumulative growth of 6.7 percent in the
whole year of 1996, it said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the decreased output in the electronics
industry, fabricated metal products and plastic products
industries declined 7.9 percent and 21.6 percent respectively in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Within the fabricated metal products industry, the output of
metal precision components and metal containers was reduced due to
weak demand. For the plastic industry, the output of plastic
electronic parts, plastic film and bags was also reduced.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative output of the two industries for the whole year
of 1996 declined 2.7 and 7.8 percent respectively.

<P>
The chemicals industry, including petroleum, petrochemical,
pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals, grew 3.3 percent in
December, while the cumulative output growth for 1996 was 5.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The output of machinery industry grew 17.4 percent in December
as more work done was recorded in the oil rig activities. The
cumulative output for 1996 was 5.7 percent, higher than 1995, the
EDB said.

1991, concluded that the Union government was overstaffed by
about 80,000 employees.

<HEADLINE> ADB Aid to Alleviate Water Crisis in Dar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- About 21.57 million
U.S. Dollars will be released by the African Development Bank
(ADB) to alleviate the short-term and medium-term problems of
water supply in Tanzania's capital city of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian government officials confirmed here today that the
funds are to be disbursed following an accord signed by the
Tanzanian government with an ADB mission recently in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, ADB funds would be allocated to
Phase one of the project, which includes the reduction of
leakages and rehabilitation of the Ruvu plants to increase water
supply to the city by 40 to 50 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The National Urban Water Authority (NUWA) will be required to
identify priority areas of Phase one water supply rehabilitation
for funding consideration by the ADB.
</P>
<P>
Co-financing would also be required from other donors to
complete the project, as the total cost of Phase one has been put
at 30 to 40 million U.S. Dollars. The entire project is projected
to cost about 115 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania government has agreed with the bank that
continued reliance on Ruvu river to feed the city with water
would not be sustainable in the long run.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: No-devaluation Statement by Thai Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Persistent speculation and
pressure and rumors of a possible devaluation of the Thai currency
have prompted the central bank of Thailand to issue a formal
statement reiterating its stance of not devaluating the baht.
</P>
<P>
The statement came at a time when the baht sank to its lowest
level since May 4, 1990. The central bank Tuesday set the mid-rate
at 25.99 baht to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, the baht has hovered around 25 baht to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in the Tuesday statement that the baht
devaluation is "definitely not a policy option" to tackle the
country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand said the baht was not fundamentally
over-valued, adding that devaluation would cause more harm than
good.
</P>
<P>
The weakening of the baht in recent months resulted from the
appreciating U.S. dollar, the slowdown of the Thai economy,
sluggish export growth and high current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Although the statement, coupled with less volatility in the
dollar's movement against the Japanese yen, has slowed speculation
on the baht, many foreign investors are not convinced by the Bank
of Thailand's strong statement, currency dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign investors still see opportunities to attack the
baht, while others hesitate to believe the baht will slip further.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the exchange rate regime of the baht,
which has been pegged to a basket of currencies including the U.S.
dollar since November 1984, had made the baht one of the most
stable currencies in the region.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that although the recent sharp appreciation of the
U.S. dollar had led to some weakening of the baht against the
greenback, in real terms the baht remained fairly valued.
</P>
<P>
Any policy to devalue the currency would cause more damage to
the overall economy than could be offset by the gains expected
from improved price competitiveness, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank can not take it for granted,
promising that it would continue monitoring the currency market
closely and would take the necessary measures to stabilize the
external value of the baht.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that it will take the Thai central bank a few
months more before a final decision is made.
</P>
<P>
Factors to influence the decision-making include the trend of
the Thai economic performance, the movement of the U.S. dollar
against the Japanese yen and results of the Thai government's
implementation of tight financial policies, spending cuts and
promotion of exports and curtailing imports.

<HEADLINE> 93 Tory MPs Revolt Against Gun Curb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Conservative Government
suffered its worst backbench revolts of the present Parliament
last night as 93 Tory MPs voted against gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
The government had to rely on Opposition backing in the Commons
to avoid an embarrassing defeat over the firearms legislation
brought in after the Dunblane massacre.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-three Tories voted to increase compensation for
gun-clubs forced out of business by the Government's proposed ban
on high-calibre handguns.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-two Conservatives called for concessions to allow the
owners of small-calibre weapons to keep them at home. Among them
were five former Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Government won by 394 votes to 115 after
winning the backing of the Labor leadership.
</P>
<P>
In a debate on the Firearms Amendment Bill, the Home Secretary,
Michael Howard, had to rely on Opposition support to reverse
changes made after a rebellion by the gun lobby in the Lords.
</P>
<P>
Several rebels said last night that they hoped the Lords would
continue their campaign and send the Bill back to the Commons
again.
</P>
<P>
Peers voted earlier this month to allow owners of .22 weapons
to keep their guns at home rather than in clubs so long as they
were "disassembled" in advance.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that Peers will consider the Firearms
Amendment Bill tomorrow.

HONG KONG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong launched the first
dual-chip identity and stored-value card in Asia, which applies
innovative technologies into the daily life in campus.
</P>
<P>
The CitySmart card, jointly launched by the City University of
Hong Kong and Hang Seng Bank, will provide convenient electronic
access and an easy payment means for students and staff at the
university.
</P>
<P>
The card is installed with a contactless chip for the purpose
of access to all campus facilities, and a contact chip, which
supports the stored-value function.
</P>
<P>
With the cardholders' data put on the contactless chip, the
card can enhance security control, for instance, by limiting
access to potentially dangerous areas such as the laboratories. It
can also serve as a means of purchasing small-value goods and
services at campus outlets, saving the trouble of dealing with
coins and notes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Strives for Improving Women's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has in recent years
strived for improving women's status in society.
</P>
<P>
In July 1995, the National Association of Women Organisation
in Uganda (NAWOU) launched a program to provide over 1,000 women
organisations at the grassroots levels with information about the
emancipation and development of women in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NAWOU established the National Women Center,
providing books on health, business and education for rural
women.
</P>
<P>
In February the same year, the Uganda Disabled Women's
Association held a seminar on legal education with the topic
"Rape and Defilement" in order to safeguard women's rights.
</P>
<P>
In June 1995, the country's Ministry of Health, together with
international donor agencies, decided to provide the minimum
requirements to pregnant women in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the status of women in the political
field, the country's new constitution, which started to be
carried out in October 1995, prescribes that women should account
for certain proportion in parliaments from grassroots to national
levels.
</P>
<P>
An article on women's rights in the constitution recognizes
the right of women to equal dignity with men, the right to equal
treatment, the right to affirmative action and the prohibition on
tradition and cultures which debase women.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, some women pressure groups have regularly
organized peaceful demonstrations against persecution of women.
</P>
<P>
In January 17, 1997, in order to call upon the society to
protect women's lives, a peaceful march was organized by a women
pressure group to honor women killed in domestic violence during
Christmas in the country.
</P>
<P>
With measures taken by the government and non-governmental
organizations, Ugandan women's status has been much improved in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, Uganda had the first woman vice-president and
six female cabinet members. The country had had only four female
cabinet members in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In Makerere University, the largest and oldest higher learning
institution in Uganda, the number of female students has
increased by a great number in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Now the number of female students accounts for over one third
of the total enrollment in the university while the figure in
1985-90 was 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will also have the first university with a female
majority. That is Martyrs University where girl students are
expected to account for 55 percent of the enrollment in the
academic year starting on October 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still many problems, especially in the
rural areas where social status of women is still very low.
</P>
<P>
Almost three quarters of Ugandan girls are defiled before the
age of 18. By the age of 17, 59 percent of them have sexual
intercourse and 56 percent start sex at 15.
</P>
<P>
About 23 percent of girls under 15 in the country are married
for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is still a long way to go for Ugandan women
to improve their social status.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Commercial Banks' Gain Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti banks enjoyed a
strong operating profit of 299 million U.S. dollars in the first
half of 199, a rise of nearly 100 million dollars over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Institute of Banking Studies
available here today, Kuwaiti commercial banks achieved this on
the basis of a combined net profit of up to 400 million
U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report which covered 45 major banks from the six Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries said the profit of 1995
surpassed the corresponding figures realized by the local banks
before the Iraqi invasion of the country.
</P>
<P>
It said the banks occupied second position among their
counterparts in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman,
Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The assets of the six Kuwaiti banks it covered rose by
5 billion U.S. dollars compared with 1989 to reach to 35
billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The funds deposited in these banks jumped by 4 billion
U.S. dollars to 28.3 billion U.S. dollars, the report said,
adding that loans extended by the banks climbed by
approximately 1 billion U.S. dollars to touch 9 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The equity/assets portfolio realized an increase of around
3 billion U.S. dollars and the total of such equities
was estimated at 4 billion U.S. dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The banks covered by the study were the National Bank of
Kuwait, the largest commercial bank in the country, the Gulf
Bank, the Commercial Bank, the Bank of Kuwait and the Middle
East, the Burgan Bank in addition of two state-owned Kuwaiti
banks.
</P>

The National Bank of Kuwait occupied the top slot among
local banks in relation to profitability, deposits, assets,
loans and equity volume.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Possible To Become China's Fourth Municipality (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to name the
southwestern city of Chongqing as its fourth municipality, in a
bid to pave the way for the efforts for Three Gorges Dam relocation
and add momentum to the economic takeoff in the whole southwestern
China region.
</P>
<P>
If Chongqing becomes a municipality, its administrative area
will be extended to include Wanxian and Fuling cities, and
Qianjiang Prefecture, and the area will be 82,000 sq km and the
population 30 million.
</P>
<P>
The city of Chongqing is currently under the Sichuan provincial
government and is the largest industrial city in southwest China
and a major port on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
A municipality has the same status as a province in China and
is under the direct leadership of the central government. The
three currently designated in China are Beijing, Shanghai, and
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's cabinet, today submitted a motion
for setting up Chongqing Municipality to the 24th session of the
Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's legislature, which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng said in the motion that the elevation of
Chongqing to the level of municipality will be helpful for the
Three Gorges Project and its relocation scheme, and make full use
of the city's role as a major economic center.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Li explained, "the upgrading of Chongqing will help
promote the economic and social development of the southwest area
and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, while easing pressure
on the Sichuan provincial government for managing the outsized
population and area."

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Possible to Become China's Fourth Municipality (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In explaining the motion on behalf of the State Council, Doje
Cering, minister of civil affairs, told legislators that more than
two thirds of the population to be resettled to make way for the
Three Gorges Dam live in the Chongqing, Wanxian, and Fuling area.
</P>
<P>
"Chongqing Municipality could handle the general administration
of the relocation work, which will contribute to the full
implementation of the relevant state relocation policy and the
good use of relocation funds," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, the world's largest
water and hydro-electric power project, is expected to result in
the resettlement of more than one million people in the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
Doje Cering recalled that in September of 1996, with the
approval of the State Council, the Sichuan Province already named
Wanxian, Fuling, and Qianjiang as part of Chongqing, which in turn
set up agencies of relocation and agriculture to help manage the
relocation of the large number of people and new rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China's Constitution stipulates that new municipalities must
have the approval of the NPC. The State Council motion has to go
through discussion at the upcoming Fifth Plenary Session of the
eighth NPC, which will start on March 1.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, which began to be called a city in 1929, was a
municipality directly under the central government by the early
1950s. In 1983, it became one of the country's first cities
designated by the State Council as experimental bases for economic
restructuring, and was granted equal powers as the provincial
government in dealing with economic affairs. It was also
recognized as a port for foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Ambassador Denies Exporting Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran never has a plan to
export its Islamic Revolution to Turkey, local newspaper Daily
News today quoted the Iranian Ambassador as saying.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper, Iran's Ambassador to
Turkey, Muhammad Reza Bagheri, denied that he had indicated that
the Islamic Revolution was a "presentation of thoughts and
ideas".
</P>
<P>
A revolution is not like a commodity that can be exported
by force, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bagheri has been under criticism of Turkey's press and public
opinion following his speech at the commemoration of " Al-Quds
(Jerusalem) Night" on February 1 in Sincan, 40 kilometers west
of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry had summoned the disputed Iranian
ambassador and lodged a protest note against his presence and
supportive remarks at the rally with a strong religious color.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's secularism supporters had called for the expulsion
of Bagheri, which is believed to be a setback in
Turkish-Iranian relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the current view that Iran is actively involved
in Turkey's anti-secular activities, Bagheri said all the
accusations were aimed at tarnishing Iran's international image,
describing them as "old and obsolete".
</P>
<P>
These views were produced to prevent other neighboring
countries from developing friendly relations with Iran, the
ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
Sincan has been at the center of controversy for some
time due to its former mayor Bekir Yildiz's anti-secular
practices and rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
Yildiz, who had called for a Shariah-based state system at
the Sincan rally, was arrested last week on charges of
supporting illegal religious activities.

<HEADLINE> Australian Merchandise Imports Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian merchandise
imports rose by six percent in January to 6.79 billion Australian
dollars (5.23 billion US dollars), with capital goods imports
surged by 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
While the consumption goods imports dropped by one percent, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics said today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the economic situation, economists said a solid
rise in imports in January was a further evidence of a pickup in
the Australian economy.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the latest data reinforces other recent partial
economic indicators, such as employment, housing finance and
building approvals data, pointing to economic activity picking up
speed in recent months," Westpac Banking Corp senior economist
John Peters said.
</P>
<P>
Citibank Ltd chief economist Stephen Koukoulas said, the intake
of capital goods supported the positive outlook for equipment
investment, "The sharp rise in capital goods imports now sits
squarely with the optimistic framework for equipment investment."
</P>
<P>
However, Nomura Australia Ltd economist Louise Pollard held,
"Despite today's strong result, we expect overall import growth to
remain subdued over the coming months as domestic demand remains
sluggish and do not see the January outcome as an indication that
imports are about to balloon."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The nationwide strike by
Zambian council workers continued today, leaving piles of garbage
remaining uncollected in various cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
Council workers began strike at first only in some towns two
weeks ago, demanding higher wages. The strike was later spread to
many other towns including capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The council workers in Ndola, Kabwe and Mumbwa joined the
strike on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There is a fear that an outbreak of a serious disease will be
inevitable if the garbage remains uncollected.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Liberal Progressive Front said: "We are
very much concerned about the amount of uncollected refuse at the
city center in Lusaka and we wish to appeal to those concerned to
remove it or at least do something about it right away before we
all catch typhoid or some thing equally devastating."
</P>
<P>
Some traders also complained of the loss of business because
the garbage has blocked customers' access to their shops.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka council said the council has no immediate solution to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
The workers on strike are also demanding improved working
conditions and removal of the local government and housing

<P>
The agreement is expected to help boost economic ties and trade
between the two countries.

<P>
Bilateral two-way trade totaled about 175 million US dollars in
1995, according to argentine figures.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding on anti-narcotics cooperation was
also signed today by foreign ministers of the two countries,
namely, Prachuab Chaiyasarn of Thailand and Guido di Tella of
Argentina, to deter use of illicit drugs and control the
production of narcotic plants and chemicals.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Questioned by Police on Corruption Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu was questioned Tuesday night for his role in
an alleged corruption scandal involving appointment of the
Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu answered dozens of questions from Sando Mazor, head
of the Police Investigations Division, on the so-called "Bar-On
for Hebron" scandal in which former Jerusalem attorney Roni
Bar-On was allegedly appointed Attorney General in a plea-bargain
deal arranged by Shas Party's leader Aryeh Deri.
</P>
<P>
Mazor said Netanyahu cooperated well in the four-hour
questioning held in the Prime Minister's Office and answered all
the questions without asking for any privilege.
</P>
<P>
Police investigators are now comparing Netanyahu's statements
with other evidence gained from questioning other people
involved, in attempt to trace how Bar-On's appointment was
approved and whether anyone pressured or threatened Netanyahu
regarding the matter.
</P>
<P>
Bar-On, also a member of the ruling Likud's central committee,
resigned on January 12 only two days after his appointment
because of the strong protests from across the political spectrum
over his political affiliation and insufficient professional
qualification.
</P>
<P>
But Bar-On's resignation was only the start of a political
scandal on government corruption, which was exposed January 23 by
the state-run Television Channel I and shocked the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
Crime reporter Ayala Hasson revealed that Bar-On was named the
attorney general in a plea-bargain deal reached between the
government and Deri, who conditioned Shas' support of the Hebron
deal on Bar-On's approval.
</P>
<P>
Without the support of the two Shas ministers in the cabinet,
the Hebron agreement could have failed to clear the cabinet vote
held on January 15 as seven of 18 ministers had already decided
to vote against it.
</P>
<P>
Before the cabinet approval of Bar-On's appointment, Deri, who
has been under legal investigations over corruption charges, had
reportedly obtained promise from Bar-On to offer him a convenient
plea in future trials. Both Deri and Bar-On have flatly denied
the allegation.
</P>
<P>
The report caused a political storm in the country, as
politicians and legal commentators described the alleged affair
as smacking of mafia tactics and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure, the government decided last month to
launch a police investigation into the scandal and the alleged
involvement of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Prime Minister Office's
Director-General Avigdor Lieberman and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Many political analysts predicted that the scandal, the
biggest ever in history of the Jewish state if proven true, could
bring down the government. But Channel I late backtracked on the
original report that Netanyahu was personally involved in the
affair.
</P>
<P>
Following the TV exposure of the "Bar-On for Hebron" deal,
Netanyahu immediately and strongly denied his involvement, terming
 the report as "entirely baseless, absolute gibberish."
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, police will continue questioning Deri, who
had been questioned for four times already, and Lieberman, who is
believed to be a major player behind the deal.

<HEADLINE> Record Oil Output In China For First Month Of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China is off to a good start
this year in oil and gas production with average daily oil and gas
output of 389,500 tons and 46.15 million cu m respectively in the
first month, a notable increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
China has set a goal of producing 142 million tons of crude oil
this year, meaning average daily output of 389,000 tons, higher
than the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
The first month's progress indicates a promising year in oil
production, said a senior official with the China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC), who noted that even aging oilfields in east
China, except for the Liaohe Oil Field which suffered from a heavy
snowstorm in January, met production targets.
</P>
<P>
The Shengli and Jilin fields exceeded state-set monthly targets
by 1,051 tons and 118 tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Daqing, the country's leading oilfield, produced 153,400 tons
of crude oil daily on average for January, higher than the desired
daily target for the year.
</P>
<P>
Oil production in the Bohai Bay area, which has seen an overall
decline in output in recent years, is picking up again. The
Shengli Oilfield in the area had an average daily crude output of
78,000 tons in January, or more than 1,000 tons above the desired
target.
</P>
<P>
In western China, progress was also reported. The Tarim,
Turpan-Hami and Qinghai fields had all had higher outputs than for
the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a bottleneck in transport that was holding up oil
production in the area, has been eased, and 772,400 tons of oil
was moved in the first month of the year.
</P>
<P>
The country has put an increasing number of oilwells into
production from the beginning of the year, with a total number by
the end of January of 64,150, providing a solid foundation for oil
production this year.

<HEADLINE> Pretoria Ready to Assume African Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has trained
two battalions of troops to be ready for multinational
peacekeeping operations, local daily the Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
The South African government is willing to contribute up to
1,000 men to any peacekeeping operation in the world, the report
quoted unidentified government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the remarks on the eve of a regional summit
called by South African President Nelson Mandela in the country's
legislative capital of Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who is also current Chairman of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), is due to meet President Robert
Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Joachim Chissano of Mozambique,
President Ketumile Masire of Botswana and President Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda today.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, a military power in Africa, was last year urged
by regional states as well as the international community to
contribute to a multinational peacekeeping force to be deployed
in war-torn eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela, who took power in 1994, hesitated at sending
soldiers at the time on reason that South Africa's new national
defense force, comprising former rivals during the Apartheid war,
was not yet fully integrated.

<HEADLINE> Discovery of Melanin Link to Skin Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and British scientists
have found that a structure formed by melanin, the pigment in
skin, works to prevent skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
The findings are the result of a two-year study of 52 people of
different races from a dozen different countries, conducted by Lu
Hongguang, an associate-professor from the Guiyang Medical College
in southwest China's Guizhou Province and a group of British
scholars.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, when he was a visiting scholar at the Medical
Institute of the University of Wales, Lu began to study the link
between the amount of melanin in the skin and the effect of
ultraviolet rays with Dr. C. Edwards and Professor R. Marks.
</P>
<P>
The study revealed that melanin granules in black and brown
skin can form a cap-like structure in part of the skin cells under
the effects of ultraviolet irradiation, but that the melanin in
skin of the white people does not react in a similar manner.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the content of melanin in the skin of black people
is ten times that of the skin of whites and five times that of
people with brown skin.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the cap-like structure is also affected by the
eumelanin content, or dark melanin pigment, which is found only in
blacks' skin cells, he noted.
</P>
<P>
White people only have phaeomelanin in their skin, which does
not have eumelanin's ability to protect the skin from harmful
ultraviolet rays.
</P>
<P>
This can help explain why in some European and North American
countries, skin cancer has a far more higher incidence rate among
whites than among black people, Lu suggested.
</P>
<P>
A survey done in North America shows that the incidence of
melanoma, a malignant tumor that starts in a black mole on the
skin and spreads rapidly, is 12 times more likely among white
people than among blacks and seven times more likely among people
with other skin color.

<HEADLINE> 127 Cattle Die from Anthrax in Southeast Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Six more properties were
today confirmed to have anthrax in Australia's southeast state of
Victoria, bring the total to 65, while 127 cows have died from the
disease, up from 119 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are testing soil, wind movement and dead
animals other than cattle for clues to the spread of the deadly
disease, which was first detected in the Tatura-Stanhope area on
January 26.
</P>
<P>
Regional Manager of the Department of Natural Resources and
Environment Chris McRae said that blood samples had been taken
from animals other than cows that had died in the area since the
disease was discovered. "We certainly want to try and track down a
cause and effect, but so far no real leads had yet resulted from
these investigations," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that an aerial survey had also been conducted to detect
any soil disturbance and wind movements were being studied,
anthrax spores could be distributed by wind, although it had never
been proven that this had caused an outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett said the government was doing
all it could to help farmers but could not control the anthrax
spores germinating in hot weather after remaining dormant for more
than a hundred years.

<HEADLINE> Society Helps Girls In Muslim Areas Return To School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China has set up its first
non-governmental organization to help girls who have dropped out
of school finish their schooling in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
A large portion of the region's residents are from the Hui, or
Muslim, ethnic minority, who, according to local authorities, are
sometimes too poor to send their children to school, in spite of
the fact that the rate of enrollment in the region was 96 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of China's school drop-outs are girls,
government figures show.
</P>
<P>
The new organization is based in Guyuan country, one of the
poorest counties, where the majority of residents are Muslims. It
intends to study the phenomenon and propose ways of dealing with
the problem.

<HEADLINE> Ecological Protection Emphasized In Chinese Dam Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese environmentalists
have proposed establishing an ecological economic zone in the
Three Gorges area, where the world's largest reservoir is to be
built.
</P>
<P>
The zone would extend 600 km along the Yangtze River Valley and
would have ecological industries and ecological townships.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Delin, the secretary of the Chongqing City Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party, said that environmental protection of
the Three Gorges region will be crucial to the economic
development of Chongqing, the largest city in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
China's environmental protection body has established 150
stations to monitor water quality of the Yangtze. According to
environmental protection departments, acid rain has caused direct
economic losses of 15 billion yuan (about 1.9 billion US dollars)
in the Yangtze River Valley.
</P>
<P>
Plans have been drawn up to bring "clean water, green
mountains, and blue sky" back to the region as part of the Three
Gorges Project, which also involves relocating populations and
fighting poverty.
</P>
<P>
Experts think that an effective approach would be to build the
whole reservoir area into an ecological economic zone, and that
Chongqing's environmental protection is closely related to that of
the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
Before the year 2000, the goal is to contain pollution and
restrict the total volume of waste discharge, with the ultimate
goal being a sound ecology and environment.

SHANGHAI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has shown
that macro-economic conditions for industry in Shanghai have been
improving in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey of 247 enterprises, the overall
performance of industrial enterprises has shown signs of
improvement, and 47 percent of the enterprises surveyed have plans
for additional investment in the near future.
</P>

Per capita income for workers in the city's industrial
enterprises has gone up in the first quarter, according to the

for energy and raw materials as factors affecting the development
of many enterprises, something that must be dealt with

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Market Recovering In Southern China Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The real estate market in
Shenzhen, which lies next to Hong Kong, is showing signs of a
recovery as the date for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland
gets closer.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, Shenzhen sold a combined floor
space of 2.9 million sq m of apartments last year and recovered a
great deal of idle capital.
</P>
<P>
The city also reduced the amount of land available for real
estate and leased 12.47 million sq m of land last year, half the
previous year's amount.
</P>
<P>
Local state land administration departments have tightened
controls on the real estate market to maintain order, and handled
1,246 violations of land or architecture regulations and rules
last year. They also demolished illegal construction projects with
a combined floor space of 1.12 million sq m and handled cases
involving 2.1 million sq m of illegally occupied land.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen City Government developed an 11-article regulation
to help the real estate market, and local financial organizations
issued 3.4 billion yuan worth of loans for construction of various
housing projects last year, which played an active role in the
recovery of the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the city will continue to restrict
land development and have strict land supply plans this year, and
will reclaim land from companies that cannot carry out
developments.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Clash with Rival Afghan Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Tuesday had a fierce clash with a rival Shiite Muslim faction in
central Afghanistan, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Taliban, which now control two-thirds of Afghanistan, early
Tuesday launched an attack on the Hezb-e-Wahdat led by Karim
Khalili in the outskirts of Bamyan province.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic student militia staged a vigorous ground offensive
in several bordering towns between Bamyan and the adjoining Parwan
province which is located in the north.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which continued till Tuesday evening, forced
large number of local people to flee their homes but led to no
major change in position, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
There was no report of casualties in the fighting. However, the
Hezb-e-Wahdat sources claimed that 20 Taliban fighters were killed
and their attack repulsed.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Taliban attack, three major Shiite groups
including the Khalili faction, which had differences among them in
the past, have reportedly joined hands against the student
militia.
</P>
<P>
The clash broke out shortly after the Taliban and the Shiite
groups in central Afghanistan had reached a peace agreement last
week. The agreement provided that none of the two sides would
resort to fighting whatever be the circumstances in other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who overrun the Afghan Capital Kabul last
September, recently have made major gains in the fronts north of
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to divert Taliban's attention, the oppositions forces,
which hold northern Afghanistan, have recently agreed to enter
fighting with the Islamic student militia in various parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are said to be combating the opposition forces on
four different fronts including that in Bamyan and Parwan
provinces.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Striker Romario was
selected on Tuesday by the Brazilian national squad for next
week's friendly international against Poland.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time he has been picked by the national team
for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
The last time that Romario played for his country was in the
World Cup final against Italy in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
Coach Mario Zagallo picked him for a friendly in late 1994 but
Roamrio refused, saying he only wanted to play at the Atlanta
Olympic Games in 1996. Zagallo no longer selected Romario since.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his U-turn on attitude toward Romario, Zagallo
said: "Obviously, his behaviour has changed."
</P>
<P>
Romario, who turned 31 in January, has 19 goals in 38 full
international appearances.
</P>
<P>
The friendly against Poland is slated for February 26 in
Goiania, some 150 kilometers from the capital of Brasilia.

<P>
SUZHOU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zhuozhengyuan Garden, one
of the four most famous ancient Gardens in China, is now holding a
display of 31 paintings based on its scenery.
</P>
<P>
The garden is located in Suzhou, a city in east China's Jiangsu
province, famous for its scenic beauty.
</P>
<P>
The paintings on show are duplications of paintings by Wen
Zhengming, a famous painter of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) whose
works were used as a blueprint for the Zhuozhengyuan, which was
built later.
</P>
<P>
Now, even more than 400 years later, one can still locate the
scenic spots in the garden according to the pictures.
</P>
<P>
The three other gardens -- the Changlangting from the Song
Dynasty (960-1279), Shiziling from the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368),
and the Liuyuan, from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), are all
located here.

<HEADLINE> Mummies Provide Clue To Lost State Along The Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- They have a high bridge on
their noses, deep-set eyes, polished nails, braided hair, and wear
fashionable woollen caps, blouses, culottes, stockings -- and have
slept for at least 1,400 years in China's largest sandy wasteland.
</P>
<P>
The ladies, who died young or in middle-age, are mummified
reminders of what was once a thriving state along the Silk Road,
but which was later buried by the shifting Taklamakan Desert in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Qiemo, one of 36 states in the Western Region during the
Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD), vanished some 1,500 years ago
and remained a riddle to historians until recently when
archaeologists found tomb groups from the state at the desert's
southeastern edge.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists have excavated 29 of the tombs and unearthed
nearly a hundred mummies and skeletons and more than 300 funerary
items.
</P>
<P>
There are from two to 15 of the bodies in each tomb, usually
wrapped in a mat or placed on a wooden bed. What is surprising
perhaps is their position -- they are lying on their back with
their knees propped up with the support of sticks.
</P>
<P>
Most of the dead were mummified. The men wear finely-made felt
hats, fur garments and shoes. Some are buried with fur bags full
of wooden arrows with iron tips and a 20 cm bronze knife. These
things and a wooden basin containing the skeleton of a goat found
in the tombs led scholars to infer that the Qiemo people lived by
hunting and from animal husbandry, with meat as their main food.
</P>
<P>
Cosmetics were the major burial items for females. Yellow
powder was found in boxes with spoons, buried with the ladies, but
the powder's ingredients are yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
Silk fabrics with Chinese characters and fragments of bronze
mirrors from the Western Han Dynasty have also been found,
suggesting trade between Qiemo and central China some 2,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The scholars expect to learn more about the state after further
exploration of the site, which is near the present-day Qiemo
county.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The 211 soldiers from

19 bombs, a hand grenade and thousands rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
All weapons and ammunitions have been handed to the police for
custody. The Zairean troops claimed to have fled heavy fighting
with rebels in eastern Zaire.

SHANGHAI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The suburbs of China's
largest city of Shanghai had a GDP accounting for 27.3 percent of

Experts attribute the achievement to cumulative economic
strength in the past several years in the suburbs. In 1996, their
GDP was 78.5 billion yuan, up 20.54 percent from the previous
year. Their industrial output amounted to 204.3 billion yuan, up
29.1 percent.

<P>
Intensive farming methods brought new vitality to the rural
economy, experts say. A number of firms linking farming and

HANGZHOU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 60,000 laid-off
workers in east China's Zhejiang province have found new jobs over
the past three years, aided by all sides from society.
</P>
<P>
An unemployment insurance fund of 250 million yuan (about 31
million US dollars) has also been set up, with more than 80
percent of the cities and counties across the province drafting
plans to help the laid-off workers find jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou city government has offered various kinds of
preferential treatment to encourage the workers to open their own
businesses, and Ningbo, Jiaxing, and Huzhou have formed leading
groups to strengthen re-employment operations.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 unemployed workers received job training in
Ningbo from 1995 to 1996, and 16,300 received unemployment
benefits, with the relief fund totalling 29 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,335 employment agencies have been established
throughout the province, sponsoring employment information fairs
on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
In addition to state enterprises, which are the main source of
re-employment opportunities, some collective and individual firms
have also hired more laborers.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the Hangzhou city trade union organization, 22
former textile workers have become toll collectors on the
Hangzhou--Ningbo expressway, 44 laid-off women in the silk
industry got new jobs in the pager stations, and the newly-opened
Sanshuiwan Market in Jiaxing has reserved 200 stands for laid-off

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Face Worst Load-shedding in Summer Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Load-shedding, which is causing
enormous suffering to the Bangladeshi people and loss to the
productive sector, is unlikely to end in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"There is no possibility of raising the generation of power
even by June next," said a senior official of the Power
Development Board (PDB), signaling that the worst days were ahead.
</P>
<P>
At the fag end of the Winter season when power consumption is
normally lower than that in Summer, the power shortage is about
200 to 300 megawatt (mw) daily throughout the country. At least
200 mw additional power is required to meet the need in the Summer
season.
</P>
<P>
Thus the shortage of power will be about 400-500 mw in the dry
season and people will have no escape from the power crisis in the
coming days, said the PDB official.
</P>

Bangladesh experienced record breaking power crisis of 674 mw

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urged to Lay Down Long-term Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Investment Minister
H.E. Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo today urged ASEAN countries to lay down
a long-term strategy to cope with future challenges and
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at a joint seminar organized by the ASEAN
Secretariat and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the pacific (ESCAP), the minister said ASEAN must
continue to provide a stable macroeconomics environment.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a prudent macroeconomic policy alongside the
political and social stability which has been in place for many
years" is needed and should be maintained, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
member countries must continue improving its efficiency and
competitiveness and making its economy more market-oriented by
continuing with deregulation efforts. By doing so, ASEAN will be
successful in integrating its economy into regional and global
market economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sanyoto called on ASEAN members to place more emphasis on human
resource development, investment in basic infrastructure and
promotion of private sectors' role.
</P>
<P>
The minister held that the seminar is very timely as the
Southeast Asia subregion has become one of the fastest growing
economies in the world and the competition between the region and
the rest of developing countries, particularly in trade and
investment, has become more intense.
</P>
<P>
To sustain its economic growth under this condition, one should
establish a strategic economic alliance with other countries and
be active in regional and international economic cooperation such
as ASEAN, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) and
the World Trade Organization (WTO), he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures revealed by the United Nations
in its 1996 World Investment Report, the total available world
capital for foreign direct investment (FDI) in 1995 increased by
almost 40 percent to 315 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among developing countries receiving world FDI inflows,
countries in south Asia, east Asia and Southeast Asia received 65
billion US dollars in 1995, accounting for 65.2 percent of the
total FDI inflows into developing countries. In the meantime, the
ASEAN region absorbed about 20 billion US dollars or more than 30
percent of the total FDI inflows into south Asia, east Asia and
Southeast Asia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar on enhancement of trade and investment
cooperation in Southeast Asia is being attended by senior-level
government officials from the seven ASEAN member countries and
Cambodia and Laos as well as representatives from the Asian
Development Bank and the United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar will
join the grouping in July this year.

<P>
ALMA ATA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh Foreign Minister
Kasymzhomart Tokayev said today that Kazakhstan will make efforts
to build a long, stable and friendly relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking in an interview with Xinhua, and the
leading People's Daily of China, prior the coming visit of Kazakh
President Nursultan Nazarbayev to China.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Kazakh relationship was improving year-by-year as the
two countries kept communications at a high level, following
Nazarbayev's first visit to China as president of independent
Kazakhstan in 1993, said Tokayev.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin visited the
central Asian country in 1994 and 1996 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev, who visited China again in 1995, would mainly
discuss bilateral economic cooperation with Chinese leaders in the
coming talks, noted the minister.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Tokayev also rebutted the so-called
"China Threat" spread by some western countries. He said that
China, which repeatedly confirmed its pledge for Kazakhstan's
security, would not make threats to the world.
</P>
<P>
The minister voiced firm support for China's nationality policy
aimed at achieving ethnic harmony and national stability.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan was resolutely opposed to those activities meant to
separate China, which had an ethnic Kazakh population of about one
million in northwestern Xinjiang, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, which declared independence in 1991 after the
former Soviet Union collapsed, established diplomatic relations
with China in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Re-attach Boy's Severed Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The right foot of a boy, which
was cut off by an electric saw in the capital of northeast China's
Heilongjiang province, has been successfully re-attached by
doctors here.
</P>
<P>
Although there are instances of fingers being successfully
re-attaced, experts say that it is rare in China for a foot that
has been completely severed, to be re-attached.
</P>
<P>
The youth, Lan Lijia, 17, of Yuanbao township in Heilongjiang's
Shangzhi city, was cutting a piece of wood when something went
wrong with the saw he was using. In frustration, he kicked the
wood with his right foot, but the wood didn't move, and he caught
his foot with the saw.
</P>
<P>
It was three hours later when he was rushed to a hospital in
nearby Harbin, where doctors in the microsurgery department, who
examined the foot severed at the ankle decided to re-attach it.
</P>
<P>
The eight-hour surgical operation was a demanding one,
requiring an exact matching of the skin, bone, and blood vessels
of the leg and foot. But, the operation was a success, and eight
days later, the foot started to respond to external stimulation.
</P>
<P>
Doctors point out, however, that the youth needs further
treatment before he will be able to exert any pressure on the
limb.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Borrow More Debt in Next Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
expected to borrow 5.25 billion U.S. dollars in new debt from
overseas sources in the next fiscal year, up from 4.59 billion
dollars in the current fiscal year, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
At a house budget commission hearing on Monday, Minister of
Finance Mar'ie Muhammad said the new debts would come from
multilateral and bilateral plus export credits in the next fiscal
year which begins in April.
</P>
<P>
The government's foreign debt had fallen from 57.22 billion
dollars in September 1996 to 54.6 billion dollars in November,
official sources today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government announced earlier the country's total foreign
debt was about 110 billion dollars, including 55 billion dollars
in private foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said the fall in government foreign debt was because of
the early repayment of high-interest debts and a sharp
depreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the current fiscal year, the government would
have repaid 3.35 billion dollars in foreign debt ahead of schedule
since the 1994-95 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament Forms 11-Member Panel on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi parliament Tuesday
set up an 11-member committee to probe into the death of Sheema
Chowdhury, who was allegedly gangraped by policemen and died on
February 7 in the safe custody in Chittagong jail.
</P>
<P>
The sudden death of Sheema, a 17-year-old garment factory
employee, has stirred great concern in Bangladesh. Various women
and human rights organizations have strongly condemned the
incident and demanded further investigation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had ordered speedy inquiry into
the death of Sheema, saying her government is determined to take
stern action against women repression.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary committee headed by Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad will comprise representatives from all the main
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The committee will frame its terms of reference in the light of
the judicial probe committee set up earlier.
</P>
<P>
On October 9 last year, Sheema was taken to custody by Raozan
country police of Chittagong district after she allegedly eloped
with her lover. But Sheema was allegedly later gangraped at night
at the Raozan police station.
</P>
<P>
The four police personnel involved in the rape case were later
arrested and sent to jail after a case was lodged against them.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong jail officials, however, claimed that Sheema had
died from sickness. They said that she was earlier taken to
Chittagong medical college hospital for treatment on three
occasions.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sticks with Deficit Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Minister of Finance
Paul Martin, while offering modest budget spending increases to
fight child poverty and for research, says his government will
stay on course in its efforts to reduce the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Government has already had successes in containing the
deficit, in the face of numerous calls for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The minister presented the 154.8 billion dollar (about 113
billion United States dollars) federal budget to the Parliament
on Tuesday, with an election year promise to Canadians that "the
era of cuts is ending".
</P>
<P>
"Our effort to restore health to the nation's finances is very
clearly on track...and we are well ahead of our target," Martin
declared.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for 1996-97 is expected to be no higher than 14
billion U.S. dollars, bettering the target of 18 billion dollars,
or 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The figure is more than 3.7 billion dollars lower than the
target and 7.1 billion dollars less than the 1995-96 deficit --
possibly the country's biggest annual deficit decline, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that deficit targets for 1997-98 and
1998-99, which were 12.6 and 6.7 billion dollars, and accounted
for two percent and one percent of GDP respectively, would
hopefully be met.
</P>
<P>
Martin's ruling Liberal Party, facing a heavy budget deficit
when it took office in 1993, lunched an effective campaign against
the serious deficit problem in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mainly by cutting spending, the government managed to bring the
deficit down to 21.2 billion dollars in 1995-96 from the record 31
billion dollars in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
The success in the deficit reduction has resulted in the lowest
interest rate in Canada for decades, and won the confidence of
foreign investors as well as praise from other governments.
</P>
<P>
The minister resisted the calls for broad-based tax relief as
a means to stimulate the stagnant national economy, which grew
only 1.5 percent in 1996. He said the government would stick to its
methodology.

<HEADLINE> Italian Economy Predicted to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian economy will grow by 1.3
percent this year, compared to last year's growth of 0.8 percent,
the country's economic think tank, the ISCO, forecast today.
</P>
<P>
In its half yearly report, the ISCO urged the government to
take credible measures for permanently containing public spending.
</P>
<P>
Without adopting corrective measures, borrowing requirements in
the public sector this year would hit 3.7 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), 0.7 percent above the ceiling set by the
Maastricht Treaty for European Union members to join its single
currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The think tank predicted the prospects in 1997 were favorable,
particularly if the government opted for "reform programs aimed at
permanently correcting future imbalances". This was taken as a
reference to the controversial reforms of the pension and health
systems.
</P>
<P>
The institute believed the government's financial measures
would not impede steady economic recovery, but warned that the
lower-than-expected growth in France and Germany could boost
interest rates at a time when hopes of recovery were largely
pinned on them continuing to fall.
</P>
<P>
Domestic consumption this year would rise by one percent and
inflation average 2.4 percent, ISCO said. However, labor costs
were likely to increase by 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
ISCO noted that the government's endeavors to sort out the
country's public finances would be assisted by cutting markedly
the forecast debt servicing as interest rates fell.
</P>
<P>
Exports this year were expected to rise by five percent in real
terms, calculated on an exchange rate of 980 lire to the German
mark and 1,570 to the United States dollar.
</P>
<P>
The ISCO forecast that imports would be up 4.5 percent and that
industrial investment in machinery and fixed assets would rise 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the gradual economic improvement, unemployment was
likely to remain around its present level of 12 percent, the
organization said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Government to Open All-Party Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba has said that his government is to open dialogue
with all political parties in the country to identify and resolve
national problems.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a program held here Tuesday on the occasion of the
country's 47th National Democracy Day, the prime minister called
on all parties and the main opposition in particular to cooperate
with the government in this task.
</P>
<P>
Democracy will mean nothing unless the government is able to
intensify its efforts towards raising the living standard of the
majority poverty-stricken people living in rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to pay attention to the government's
limitations and available resources while giving vent to popular
desires and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
A multi-party parliamentary system was historically ushered in
Nepal by late King Tribhuvan in 1951 after he overthrew the
104-year-old Rana autocratic regime with the help of the then
underground Nepali Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
But King Tribhuvan himself imposed a ban on political parties
and established the partyless Panchayat legislature in 1960.
</P>
<P>
However, King Birendra, son of Tribhuvan, reinstated the
multi-party parliamentary system in 1990 amid a nationwide popular
movement led by the Nepali Congress (NC) and a united front of
leftist forces.
</P>
<P>
The present coalition government led by Deuba's NC party came
to power in 1995 after the NC and two partners jointly ousted a
minority communist government.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) is still the largest party in the country's
parliament.

<P>
PRAGUE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The industrial development of
the Czech Republic in 1996 slowed down, with a growth rate at 6.8
percent, which was 2.4 percent less than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Bureau said the growth rate of the
manufacturing sector, one of the country's economic pillars,
reached 5.5 percent, and that of the power industry was only 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The production of textiles, clothing and leather dropped in
1996, said Josef Zabransky, the spokesman for the bureau, on
Monday. He said one-third of present Czech enterprises was losing
money.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the industrial decrease to less demand by
Western countries for Czech products as well as a slow-down in
exports.
</P>
<P>
The industrial situation of the Czech Republic has been getting
better in recent years, but production in 1996 was only
82 percent of that in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Prices Soar in Romania After Government Cuts Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The cost of fuel and energy
soared by between 50 and 500 percent in Romania today as part of
the government's economic reform plan which involves freeing up
prices and withdrawing subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The price of gasoline, which was doubled on January 1, rose
again by half to 2,900 lei (41 U.S. cents) per litre and diesel
oil rose by 85 percent to 2,400 lei (34 U.S. cents) per litre. The
price of a ton of crude oil soared from 44 U.S. dollars to 135
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Train tickets rose 80 percent, telecommunications by 100
percent and electricity by 500 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fear of rising food prices has led many people to start panic
buying in anticipation of the increases.
</P>
<P>
A quick scout through the shops by a Xinhua reporter in
Bucharest this week found little food on the shelves, with meat in
particular in short supply.
</P>
<P>
Long queues formed outside bread shops as people tried to stock
up before anticipated bread price rises.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of subsidies and consequent price hikes are
being pushed through as part of a series of economic reforms
launched by Romania's new three-party coalition government headed
by Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea's Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The party came to power on a mandate for market reforms
to try and save the country's economy from collapse. As part of
the reforms, which were drafted with the help of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, the government plans to speed up
privatization, deregulate foreign exchange and restructure
loss-making state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
Salaries of state workers are to be raised by 130 percent
to offset the impact of rampant inflation. The minimum monthly
salary will be increased to 150,000 lei (about 21 U.S. dollars)
from 97,000 lei (about 14 dollars), Ciorbea said.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea also promised to double unemployment benefit, child
benefit and pensions.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes these measures will help to secure some
one billion dollars in loans from the IMF and World Bank who both
withheld credits for Romania last year.
</P>
<P>
A budget bill for 1997 will be presented to parliament later
this month.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sets Up Foundation to Support Researches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said
today it is setting up a multi-million-dollar foundation to update
research facilities in universities, colleges and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"There has been too little investment" in those facilities,
which are "far from what they should be," Finance Minister Paul
Martin said in his fourth federal budget speech at the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Much of our current research infrastructure is literally
unable to handle the kind of pressures required to keep Canada in
the front ranks of the new economy," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Canada Foundation for Innovation will receive 590
million U.S. dollars contribution from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
It will provide 133 million dollars a year over five years to
modernize health, the environment, science and engineering
research facilities, most of which were built in the 1960s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
Operated on the basis of partnerships with the private sector
and provinces, it is expected to trigger about 1.5 billion dollars
over a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
The foundation "is about looking forward. It is about our
children. It is about education," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"In short, it is about investing in the future growth of our
economy, making a down payment today for much greater reward
tomorrow," he added.

<HEADLINE> Italy May Set Mini Budget to Secure Euro Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said today his government was likely to announce a spring
mini budget to ensure the country qualifies as a founder member of
the single currency.
</P>
<P>
It was "very probable" that the government would announce a
mini budget but was "not a big scale adjustment."
</P>
<P>
Prodi, speaking to journalists as he returned to Rome by air
from Germany overnight, said, "it might also be the case that
there is no need for a mini budget but the word 'probable' is the
most appropriate."
</P>
<P>
Italy is fighting hard to convince sceptical partners in the
European Union, and notably Germany, that it can put its finances
in order, and on a lasting basis, to qualify as a founder of the
single currency which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Maastricht Treaty has set five criteria for
membership of European Monetary Union, one of which is that
the budget deficit and national debt of a member country must not
exceed 3 and 60 percent respectively of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The Italian national debt by far exceeds the 60 percent limit.
</P>
<P>
Prodi indicated on Saturday that Italy had already reached
three of the five criteria. He also expressed confidence that his
country would fulfill all five by 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the hotly-debated issue of pension reform, Prodi echoed
President Oscar Scalfaro's complaints about the gross inequities
in the country's pension system.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Scalfaro criticized the imbalance in pension
benefits and highlighted the "golden pensions" of more than 15
million lire (10,000 U.S. dollars) that 2,310 former managers
receive per month, compared with a monthly check of between
279,000 and one million lire (186 and 667 dollars) millions of
other pensioners receive from the National Social Security
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The government could not ask sacrifices only of metalworkers
and be severe only on less favored categories of workers, Prodi
said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi added that there had to be a "minimum of ethics in
politics" and stressed " the problem of conscience" posed by these
hefty pension benefits.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Offer Residence Visas to Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will offer
a residence visa to any foreigner ready to invest 10 million baht
(about 400,000 US dollars) in Thailand as a new way to make quick
money to resolve the country's sluggish economy, according to an
Interior Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
It hopes to cash in on some 5,000 foreigners waiting to apply
for residence visas, expecting at least 50 billion baht (about 2
billion US dollars) in foreign investment to pour into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The number of residence visas awarded is currently limited to
100 a year. Once foreigners get into the country, they have to
wait for three years to be eligible to apply for permanent
residence permits.
</P>
<P>
The source was quoted today by the local press as saying that
the Immigration Policy Committee had decided to ease visa
regulations in line with the government's policy to mobilize
capital and promote investment.
</P>
<P>
A one-stop service center would be set up to facilitate
applications, the source said. It could process applications and
grant residence visas in one day, instead of 14 days as now.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's attempts to attract more foreign investors are
essentially similar to the immigration policies of other countries
such as Singapore, Canada and Australia.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Production Prices Edge Ahead in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Average industrial production
prices rose 1.7 percent in 1996, the lowest increase for 10 years,
the National Statistics Institute said today.
</P>
<P>
The IPP index dipped 0.1 percent in December over November,
giving an annual increase in the index of 0.5 percent over 1995
and showing average prices throughout the year of 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The December fall comes after a 0.2 percent increase in
November over October 1996.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the December decline was the fall in
petroleum products and natural gas, chemicals and pharmaceuticals,
which both fell 0.3 percent. Steel product prices fell 1.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The only significant increase in December over November was in
the electrical energy, gas and water sector which rose 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
ISTAT said production prices of intermediate goods, which carry
most weight in the index, dipped by 0.3 percent and that there
were no variations for capital or consumer goods' prices.
</P>
<P>
The 1.7 percent rise in average industrial production prices in
1996 shows a significant slowdown in growth over 1995 figures
which show in increase of 7.9 percent and is the lowest increase
since the 0.2 percent rise seen in 1996 when ISTAT began compiling
the figures.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices were flat in December over the previous month,
but showed a year-on-year increase of 1.4 percent and an average
increase throughout the year of 3.6 percent, the institute
reported.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks to Be Asked to Raise Capital Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand plans to
ask commercial banks to increase their capital bases to deal with
non-performing loans and strengthen the soundness of the banking
system, according to financial sources.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have expressed support for the plan, believing that
the central bank's move would represent a serious attempt to
bolster investor confidence in the soundness of the Thai banking
system.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, as of mid-1996, non-performing
loans in the commercial banking system had reached 7.73 percent of
the total loans.
</P>
<P>
Among the six largest banks, the non-performing loan level was
6.69 percent of total loans in the same period.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the non-performing loan level rose
only slightly from the mid-year level, a central bank source said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the money market reacted positively toward a strong
statement from the Bank of Thailand on Tuesday that it would not
devalue the baht as the baht is not fundamentally misaligned.
</P>
<P>
It conceded that the recent sharp appreciation of the US dollar
has led to some weakening of the baht against the US dollar, but
claimed that "in real effective terms, the baht remains fairly
valued."
</P>
<P>
After the statement, the baht was traded at 26.02-26.03 against
the dollar in late afternoon, compared to 26.05-26.06 in the
morning session.
</P>
<P>
The central bank quotes its mid-rate unchanged from Monday at
25.99 baht.

<HEADLINE> Peace, Trade Top Central American Agenda With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Regional peace and economic
cooperation will be the top issues Central American leaders wish
to discuss with United States President Bill Clinton during his
scheduled visit here in May.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo announced these
topics here today when commenting on last week's meeting with his
Central American counterparts in Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which was held in preparation for Clinton's
visit, the foreign ministers, together with ministers of
economy and foreign trade, and the Central American ambassadors in
Washington, outlined the agenda they want to discuss with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Among political issues, Naranjo said the ministers would stress
the profound changes which had occurred in the area during the past few
years, in particular the peaceful end of long-lasting civil wars
in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Naranjo said Central America wanted to show the U.S. president
how it was going from war to peace, and how civilian power was
getting the upper hand over military power in the region.
</P>
<P>
As for economic issues, Naranjo said the ministers would be
interested in gaining concessions which would grant them the same
conditions as Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
The NAFTA had created favorite conditions for Mexico to attract
more foreign investments, which was to the detriment of Central
American countries, Naranjo said.
</P>
<P>
He added that they also hoped to discuss the U.S. proposal to
form the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Environment was also a major topic on the agenda, Naranjo
said. Central American countries had established an Alliance for
Sustainable Development to protect the environment, and the
U.S. was the first extra-regional partner of alliance.
</P>
<P>
Central American foreign ministers were expected to meet with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Washington, on April
1, to further prepare for Clinton's visit.

<HEADLINE> Government-Subsized Housing For Residents Of East Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 175,000 households
in China's northern coastal city of Tianjin, which recently
received the title of "advanced housing reform city" at a national
conference, have purchased 11.29 million square meters of
government-subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
Like residents of other big Chinese cities, nearly all
employees of state offices and state-owned enterprises here are
waiting for housing for which they can pay low rents, but the
amount of housing is not sufficient to meet the city's needs.
</P>
<P>
So, in 1992, Tianjin started its housing reform to gradually
stop the method of distributing "welfare" houses and adopting new
regulations to distribute new housing.
</P>
<P>
Since then, many people have gotten new housing at cost or with
preferential pricing, while others live in new housing for which
they pay about four times the original price.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the new housing regulation increased
the commercialization of housing and consumerism, and sped up
housing construction.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's residents have gradually come to realize that they
can no longer get low-rent or new welfare housing, but with
incomes increasing, more people can afford the expense of
government-subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
The annual average salaries of Tianjin employees has gone from
3,118 yuan (389 U.S. dollars) in 1992 to 7,500 yuan (937 dollars)
last year.

<HEADLINE> China To Float One-Billion-Yuan In Dam Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to offer one
billion yuan (some 120 million US dollars) in bonds shortly to
support the massive Three Gorges dam project on the middle reaches
of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The 100, 1,000, and 10,000-yuan three-year certificate bonds
will be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange upon completion of
the public offering and will have an annual interest rate of 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
The China Yangtze Three Gorges Development Corporation, the
major sponsor of the large water control project, will back the
bonds.
</P>
<P>
"Although the dam project has had sufficient funding to cover
construction work over the past four years, the bond issue will
ensure that there is less burden on the central government," an
official with the corporation explained.
</P>
<P>
China plans to put 7.79 billion yuan into the Three Gorges
project this year, about 7.5 billion of which is expected to come
from a special construction fund and credit from the State
Development Bank, a policy bank established in 1994 to finance
large infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyin &AMP; Wanguo Securities Co. Ltd. will be the lead
underwriter of the bond, which will be available to individual or
corporate investors at approved outlets nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Fiat Hires Many New Workers in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian car-maker Fiat announced
today that it will employ an additional 2,000 workers this year,
with the possibility that 6,000 more could find work in the auto
industry.
</P>
<P>
Fiat, the country's largest private employer, confirmed that it
had already begun hiring an extra 400 workers at plants in
Potenza and Avelino, with 1,000 new hires to follow in Turin and
600 in Campobasso.
</P>
<P>
The Turin-based car-maker has taken in new employees for the
first time in six years in the Turin area, which is considered
significant by analysts because of governmental incentives to
stimulate car sales.
</P>
<P>
In a year-end decree last December, the Italian government
granted bonuses to car owners who junked their old cars and
purchased new ones. The move resulted in a 35 percent jump in
orders in January, according to car dealers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Automobile Club of Italy (ACI) announced today
the first figures relating to the incentive program. From January
7 to February 10, the government distributed more than 10 billion
lire (6 million U.S. dollars), and car dealers gave discounts of
13 billion lire (7.7 million dollars) to car buyers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21,619 used cars were junked and the same number of
new ones were bought, ACI said.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders welcomed the news but reminded Fiat to plan for
the future.

<HEADLINE> Finland to see Sustained Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Finland will see sustained
economic growth in 1997 built on a good performance last
year, the Finnish Finance Ministry forecast today.
</P>
<P>
Finland's gross domestic product, a measure of economic growth,
will be about 4.5 percent this year and 4 percent in 1998 led by
an export boom resulting from global economic growth, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports in 1997 are expected to increase by
5.5 percent with imports rising 6 percent. Inflation will remain
around 1 percent. The unemployment rate should fall from last
year's 16.3 percent to 15 percent this year and 13.5 percent next
year, the forecast said.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the national debt will also slow down. This year's
national debt is likely to reach 423 billion Finnish marks (about
86 billion U.S. dollars), 71 percent of GDP, 7 percent up from
last year's 395.5 billion Finland marks (about 81 billion
U.S. dollars), said the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Current Account Deficit Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' current
account deficit jumped 75 percent to 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in
1996 from 2 billion dollars in 1995, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Philippine Central Bank was quoted as
saying Tuesday that the large current account deficit was due
mainly to the trade gap, which grew by 29.6 percent to 11.8
billion dollars in 1996 from 9.1 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise exports in 1996 rose by 17.7 percent to 20.5
billion dollars while imports jumped 22.8 percent to 32.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official said the sharp growth in current account deficit
has gotten the International Monetary Fund a bit worried about the
sustainability of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In the past, growth quickly turned to contraction because of
rising gap in the current account, which records a country's
exports and imports of goods and services.

<HEADLINE> China, Argentina Seek Cooperation and Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China and Argentina have
formed a close relationship of friendship and cooperation since
they established diplomatic relations in 1972, seeking common
development through frequent economic, cultural and political
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Andres Cisneros, secretary of foreign relations and Latin
American affairs, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua on
the eve of the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
relations between China and Argentina to be celebrated on February
19.
</P>
<P>
Cisneros stressed that Argentina is endeavoring to intensify
cooperation with China in every possible area as well as
friendship between their two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries' trade has reached an integral
stage based on the negotiation of reciprocal interests and
focusing on the economic opening which has been successfully
carried out in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The overall bilateral trade value tripled from 298 million
U.S. dollars in 1992 to 894 million dollars in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has become Argentina's second largest trading partner in
Asia and Argentina China's second largest partner in Latin America
after Brazil, Cisneros added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cisneros pointed out, broad understanding for
scientific and technological cooperation has been reached and
exchanges between students and agro-technology institutions have
been carried out.
</P>
<P>
Cultural cooperation has also been promoted. The official
television stations of both countries have broadcast programs of
cultural interest about the two nations. Film festivals and art
exhibitions have also been held.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Hong Kong's return to China, scheduled for July
1, 1997, the Argentine official said that China's restoration of
sovereignty over Hong Kong is of profound significance.
</P>
<P>
He said that Argentina hailed, with affection and admiration,
the return of Hong Kong to China and he wished it a great success.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Sino-Argentine relations are now at a high level of
understanding and collaboration, Cisneros pledged that his country
will continue making efforts to further promote bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> China Producing Ethanol From Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a
replacement for the traditional method of using grain to produce
ethanol that was approved by scientists from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences recently.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Wenying, director of the Dianjiang Natural Gas and
Chemical General Plant in Sichuan Province, told reporters that
with the new technology they produced some 300,000 tons of ethanol
and other organic chemicals with natural gas and some synthetic
gas as raw materials, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Experts on the evaluation panel said the experiments show that
China has developed advanced technology which has many possible
applications and is of great strategic significance.
</P>
<P>
Many countries still mainly use grain to produce ethanol by
fermentation. Because China needs 1.2 million tons of ethanol each
year, that would mean consuming 3.6 billion kg of grain.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that using natural gas resources to produce ethanol
and other organic chemical products fits China's situation, with
its huge population and little farmland, and helps reduce
production costs, simplify production, and saves a large amount of
money.
</P>
<P>
The technology also makes it possible to use coal and petroleum
to produce ethanol, said the experts, who say they believe that
related enterprises and technicians have adequate experience for
wider applications of the technology in industrial production.

<HEADLINE> China To Build More Libraries For Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China intends to build an
additional 20,000 libraries in villages to improve cultural
conditions for farmers.
</P>
<P>
The country has already built 25,000 village libraries, but the
number is far from enough, according to today's "China Youth
Daily".
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers, particularly those in remote and mountainous
regions, have suffered from lack of opportunities to learn more, a
fact that is slowing down economic and social development as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Village libraries were built using money raised by public
donations, backed by a national committee for eradicating
"cultural poverty", the paper explained.
</P>
<P>
Some 65 million Chinese live with extreme financial hardships
and many of them are illiterate.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Introducing More Foreign Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Long-time industrial linchpin
Liaoning Province intends to reap foreign capital this year to
restore its past glory, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The province will capture a larger share of the foreign
investment which is snowballing in developed coastal regions, said
Gu Jinchi, secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Communist Party
Committee.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, foreign investments in Jiangsu, Shandong and Shanghai
exceeded those in Liaoning by a huge margin.
</P>
<P>
This was in spite of Liaoning being home to one-tenth of
China's large and medium-sized State-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
"We must explore effective ways to renovate these colossal
firms with foreign capital on a large scale," Gu said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the firms, mainly heavy industrial ones, have been
choked by high input and low output for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
However, Gu noted, Liaoning still compares favourably to many
other regions in terms of natural resources and industrial
capacity, especially in petrochemical and machinery sectors.
</P>
<P>
"From 1996 to 2000, foreign direct investment is expected to
account for 15 percent of Liaoning's social investment," Gu
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Petrochemical, metallurgy, electronics and machinery sectors
plan to get the bulk of foreign investment to form four pillars of
Liaoning's economy as it transforms itself from the old, centrally
planned system to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
A number of key projects -- steel works, petrochemical plants,
power factories and highways -- are scheduled to be listed on
stock markets to attract 600 million US dollars in capital.
</P>
<P>
Wider application of BOT (build-operate-transfer) and the
establishment of overseas investment funds are two new forms of
soliciting foreign capital to be tried out in Liaoning this year,
Gu said.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 large and medium-sized State firms will be
singled out to form joint ventures with foreign investors this
year.
</P>
<P>
Another 38 key firms will have to set up co-operative networks
with foreign multinational companies to help expand Liaoning's
links with the outside world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Dali Paper
Manufacturing Co Ltd. starts issuing 15.78 million A shares today
to get money for major expansion projects.
</P>
<P>
Dali shares will be issued at 3.75 yuan (0.45 US dollars) each,
collecting 56.1 million yuan (6.7 million US dollars) through the
share issue, according to the company's prospectus.
</P>
<P>
More than 45 percent of the collected funds will be used in the
company's new 74.8 million yuan (nine million US dollars) box
paper production project.
</P>
<P>
The project, with an annual production capacity of 20,000 tons,
is aimed at meeting Yunnan province's growing demands for
cigarette packaging paper.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is expected to need 60,000 tons of cigarette packaging
paper annually by the year 2000. That means the new project can
bring the company 16.7 million yuan (two million US dollars) in
profits annually.
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the collected funds will be invested in an
alkali reclamation project involving 60 million yuan of investment
(7.2 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sales of the company are expected to hit 450 million yuan
(5.2 million US dollars) by the end of this century with after-tax
profits reaching 60 million yuan (7.2 million US dollars),
compared with 17.3 million yuan (2.1 million US dollars) last

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Import Sugar From Vietnam, Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will import at
least 500,000 metric tons of sugar in 1997-1998 crop year to meet
its quota to the U.S. market and fill up a projected shortfall in
domestic production, the local newspaper Manila Chronicle said
today.
</P>
<P>
The planned importation from Vietnam and Australia will fill up
the expected deficit in the sugar production and the country's
commitment to the U.S., Wilson Gamboa, chief of the Sugar
Regulatory Administration, was quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gamboa, meanwhile, said local sugar prices are expected to
further improve between July and August this year because
increased domestic consumption will snap excess sugar supply and
exert pressure on prices to go up.
</P>
<P>
The sugar oversupply caused by over-importation late last year
has caused prices to plummet below the production cost level of
sugar producers, resulting in a sugar crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
But Gamboa said if sugar prices increase unreasonably, the
government will not hesitate to import again in order to protect
the interest of consumers.

RIO DE JANEIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's gross domestic
product (GDP) will increase 4 to 5 percent this year compared with
the 3 percent in 1996, Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso
predicted today.

In a message to congress, Cardosa said that in 1996, "Brazil
terminated the black page of hyperinflation" of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that between 1993-95, the GDP grew an average of 4.7
percent yearly, an increase of 100 percent over the the 10-year
period ending in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He noted that foreign direct investments reached 9.2 billion
United States dollars in 1996, doubling that of 1995, and

<HEADLINE> FIFA Warns Cameroon with Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, February 18 ((Xinhua) -- FIFA, World soccer's
governing body, told Cameroon to pay overdue wages to one of its
former players unless it could be suspended from all international
competition.
</P>
<P>
The suspension threat has been sent to newly-elected Cameroon
Football Federation (FECAFOOT) president Vincent Onana, a report
here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
FIFA ordered FECAFOOT to pay Cameroon's veteran goalkeeper
Joseph Antoine Bell about 37 million cfa (74,000 U.S. dollars),
which it has owed him since the 1994 World Cup in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said Cameroon would be suspended from FIFA-organized
competitions if it didn't immediately pay Bell. That could mean an
automatic suspension from the 1998 World Cup in France.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Experiencing Being Students Become More Considerate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Primary and middle school
teachers in Tianjin get a look at the classroom from the other
side of the desk by taking on the role of their students in a bid
to improve teaching quality and ease students' burdens.
</P>
<P>
These teachers are required to follow students' schedule for a
day, including going to school on time. Once there, these
students-for-a-day attend classes, have lunch break, go to more
classes in the afternoon and finally head home at dusk, an
official with the education administration of Hongqiao district of
Tianjin, neighboring municipality of Beijing, was quoted by
today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
These teachers feel exhausted after one day stint as students,
even though they do not have to do homework or face chastisement
by parents as real students might do.
</P>
<P>
But the exhausting day makes teachers be more aware of what
their students need: understanding and flexible teaching methods
instead of a rigid approach requiring rote learning and cramming
in pursuit of better exam scores.
</P>
<P>
The officials surnamed Zhang said that the method was designed
to improve teaching methods. All primary and middle schools in the
district have included the practice as a regular extra activity.
</P>
<P>
Teachers involved in this activity develop a clear vision of
what steps they should take to cater to students' interests and
abilities.
</P>
<P>
The relation between teachers and students from Xiguanwai
Middle School has become more compatible since the
students-for-a-day practice was implemented, said the school
principal Si Ruiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Si said that teachers are ready to use more effective teaching
methods for the Spring semester starting next week.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Municipal Education Committee said that the practice
has spread to include primary and middle schools in other
districts of Tianjin.

<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia, South Korea and the
Philippines will initially implement the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) business access card scheme in the next two
months.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed Tuesday by newly-assigned Australian
Ambassador to Manila Miles Kupa, the local newspaper Journal
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The APEC business access card proposed by the APEC Business
Advisory Council, is expected to make travel for APEC businessmen
more convenient and efficient since the card will serve the
purpose of the regular visa.
</P>
<P>
Australia, South Korea and the Philippines were the first three
countries which committed to immediately implement the APEC visa
card this year, during the November 1996 APEC meetings in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Kupa said the three countries will test run the APEC visa
scheme for about six months after which it will be evaluated. The
results of the evaluation will be submitted to next APEC
leadership meeting in Vancouver, Canada in November.
</P>
<P>
As envisioned, the APEC business visa card will serve as the
regular entry-free visa and spare its qualified holders the usual
immigration requirements and checks.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the APEC business visa card, Kupa said
applicants must be legitimate businessmen who frequently travel in
the Asia-Pacific region in connection with their regular business
activities.

SAN JOSE -- Exports of Costa Rican ginger to U.S. and European
markets showed sustained growth in the last few months, as a
result of the good prices that are being paid in international
markets, said the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>

According to figures from the National Progam of Tubers and
Root Plants, Costa Rica now has 1,000 hectares of ginger planted
with an annual production of 15,440 tons.

LIMA -- The net international reserves in Peru's Central
Reserve Bank as of February 12 of this year reported a balance of
8.835 billion U.S. dollars, 187 million more than the January 31

<P>
HAVANA -- In 1996 Cuba's Food Industry Ministry increased its
sales of products to tourists and to stores in foreign currencies
by 56 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's products accounted for 40 percent of the
consumption in the country's food supply system which was still
12 percent below the program target. In 1997 they expect it to
increase 50 percent more than the previous figure.
</P>

According to the ministry, the organization generated 1.03
billion pesos in 1996, 8 percent more than that obtained in 1995.
This year it proposes to obtain an increase of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>

announcement made by Brazil's Central Bank (BCB).
</P>
<P>
The entry of capital up to last December of 33.12 billion
dollars compensated for the deficit of 24.347 billion dollars
registered in current transactions i.e. trade balance, services
and unilateral transfers, pointed out the BCB.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments reached 16 billion dollars with an increase
of 217.1 percent compared with 1995. The inflow of foreign

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Orlando Magic sacked
Brian Hill as coach Tuesday and decided assistant Richie Adubato
as replacement for the remainder of this season.
</P>
<P>
Hill compiled a 191-104 record in three-plus seasons, won two
Atlantic Division titles and earned playoff berths each year. The
team reached the Eastern Conference finals the past two seasons
and were swept by the Houston Rockets in the 1995 NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
But Hill suffered the defection of O'Neal, who signed a huge
free agent contract with the Los Angeles Lakers during the
offseason, and extended injuries to three starters, including
Hardaway, who missed 23 games.
</P>
<P>
When Hardaway, Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott returned from
their injuries in mid-January, the Magic caught fire, winning 13
of 16 games prior to the All-Star break. But Orlando has not won
since.
</P>
<P>
Adubato, 59, has been with the Magic since 1994. He served as
coach of the Detroit Pistons in 1979-80 and the Dallas Mavericks
from 1989 to 1993, posting a career mark of 106-228.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
news briefs in Latin America in recent days.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- 164,072 heads of cattle were slaughtered this
January, a figure that means an increase of 17 percent over the
same month in 1996 and the highest number since January 1983.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay's National Meat Institute attributed the increase in
cattle slaughtered to the higher demand for Uruguayan meat from
Brazil and the United States which was 81 and 92 percent,
respetively.
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- The first International Coffee Fair will
be held February 20 through 23 in Pereira, a city in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
New technologies and industrial processes will be displayed at
the fair where contacts will be made and business deals will be
signed to contribute to an improvement in the activity of this
sector. On the other hand, experts will give conferences on the
latest scientific advances and the newest economic proposals in
this sector.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Sales in the cosmetics and perfume industry in
Chile last year reached a total of 460 million U.S. dollars
which means an increase of 7 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
This increase is similar to the ones that has been occurring
in the past few years in Chile, according to studies made.
</P>
<P>
Per capita consumption in Chile reached 35 dollars last year
which puts this South American country on a par with Argentina
and therefore, both countries are tied for first place in Latin
America although they rank far below Western Europe where the
average consumption per person is 150 dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
proposes to disburse between 170-180 million dollars for different
programs to be carried out in Panama in 1997, informed Enrique
Iglesias, the president of this international financial
institution who is visiting this country.
</P>
<P>
The money earmarked for Panama is for potable water works,
drains and sewers and consultation services for training
personnel.
</P>
<P>
LIMA -- Foreign investment in Peru climbed to more than 6.375
billion dollars during the first half of February, according to
figures from the National Commission on Foreign Investments and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
The communications sector is the most attractive one for
foreign investors who placed more than 2.6 billion dollars which
represented 31.4 percent of the total investments.
</P>
<P>
The report explained that nine countries provided 91.3 percent
of the total amount of foreign investment with Spain being the one
providing the most capital followed by the United Staes and Great
Britain, two of the most important contributors. (to be continued)

<HEADLINE> FIFA Approves Rule Change on Penalty Shoot-outs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- International soccer body FIFA
agreed on Tuesday that the penalty shoot-out could be held before
playing extra time if a match is level after 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Extra time will still be played. If the extra time also ends in
a draw, the winners of the shootout will win the match.
</P>
<P>
The referees' committee approved the idea after a two-day
meeting in Zurich. The change does not require the approval of the
International Board, soccer's main rule-making body.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said a national or continental soccer body is free to
implement the new rule in their competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today brought to the attention of the Security Council
a five-point peace plan by his special envoy to the Great Lakes
region and sought the council's acknowledgement and support.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to council President Njuguna M. Mahugu of Kenya,
Annan said the joint United Nations/Organization of African Unity
special representative for the Great Lakes region, Mahammed
Sahnoun, is working on a five-point peace plan:
</P>
<P>
1) immediate cessation of hostilities;
</P>
<P>
2) withdrawal of all external forces, including mercenaries;
</P>
<P>
3) reaffirmation of respect for the national sovereignty and
the territorial integrity of Zaire and other states of the Great
Lakes region;
</P>
<P>
4) protection and security for all refugees and displaced
persons and facilitation of access to humanitarian assistance; and
</P>
<P>
5) rapid and peaceful settlement of the crisis through
dialogue, the election process and the convening of an
international conference on peace, security and development in the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"It would greatly assist the efforts of the joint United
Nations/Organization of African Unity special representative if
consideration were to be given by the Security Council, on an
urgent basis, to an appropriate acknowledgement and support of his
initiative," said Annan in the letter.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for Emergency Humanitarian Aid to Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
appealed today for 120.8 million U.S. dollars to meet the
emergency humanitarian needs of the war-affected and displaced
persons in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the United Nations said that
persistent insecurity combined with natural disasters, including
crop failure and floods in the Sudan, have worsened the plight of
almost all vulnerable groups who are already living below
subsistence levels.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 4.2 million people will require assistance in
the form of medical and health care, basic education, emergency
shelter, as well as agriculture, livestock and fishing inputs.
</P>
<P>
To meet the emergency needs of vulnerable groups including
630,000 children under the age of five, the United Nations is
appealing for 120.8 million U.S. dollars to fund 33 projects
during 1997.
</P>
<P>
The largest request is from the United Nations Children's Fund
which requires more than 46 million U.S. dollars to help improve
the health, nutrition and overall household food security of the
war's main victims -- women, children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Most emergency assistance to the Sudan is channeled through
Operation Lifeline Sudan under which seven United Nations agencies
and more than 50 non-governmental organizations operate to bring
assistance to war-affected displaced camps and settlement areas
around Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
The operation works in close partnership with all the parties
to the conflict including the government of the Sudan and the
southern movements.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Says NATO-Russia Force Proposal Not New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The proposal by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to create a joint
NATO-Russia force is just one option for continuing cooperation
between NATO and Russia, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to soften Moscow's opposition to the planned NATO
expansion, Albright, who is visiting NATO's headquarters in
Brussels, offered earlier today to build a permanent joint
Russia-NATO brigade.
</P>
<P>
"My sense is she suggested this as one type of continuing
cooperation between NATO and Russia," said Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon,
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that "it's one of a number of ideas that's
been discussed over the last few months or weeks for encouraging
more cooperation between NATO and Russia."
</P>
<P>
The idea just grew out of what's been going on in Bosnia with
Russian participation in an American division as part of the
peacekeeping forces, Bacon added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there are no standing NATO brigades. "What we
have in NATO are contributions by individual countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman stressed, "I think that we would find
some way to build on that if the Russians thought this was a good
idea."
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Albright told alliance foreign ministers the
future joint brigade would be part of a package of measures to
assure Russia of NATO's peaceful intentions.
</P>
<P>
Russia has strongly been opposed to NATO's plan to expand into
central and eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is due to fly to Moscow Thursday, said Moscow
would not be able to block the alliance's expansion. "Russia will
have a voice, but Russia will not have a veto."

<HEADLINE> Richardson Says US-UN Relations Enter New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Bill Richardson, the
new permanent representative of the United States to the United
Nations, said today that there is a new era between the United
Nations and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks to reporters after presenting his
credentials today to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"My message is one of paying our arrears, reform, but also to
say that the U.N. is important to the United States," he said,
adding that he is going to travel around the country, explaining
the importance of the world organization.
</P>
<P>
Saying that there is a new era of cooperation between the
Clinton Administration and the Congress in the United Nations,
Richardson pledged support for Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"Kofi Annan has been a reformer," he said. "We intend to
support him. We're interested in quick reform. But at the same
time we are interested in assuring that the U.S. pays its
arrears."
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be difficult negotiation with the Congress.
But I think we will prevail," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this appointment, Richardson was a congressman
representing New Mexico's Third Congressional District, from
1982 to 1996. During that time he also served as a special envoy
to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 he met with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and
negotiated the release of two imprisoned Americans. A year
earlier, two U.S. pilots were freed by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea due to Richardson's efforts.

<HEADLINE> US Government Deplores Kidnapping in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
today deplored the kidnapping of an American oil executive in
Venezuela and called for immediate release of the U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, this is an act that the United States government
deplores," State Department spokesman Glyn Davies told a news
briefing. "We call for the immediate release of an innocent
American citizen."
</P>
<P>
Gerald Shaffer, an executive with Houston-based Production
Operators, was kidnapped Friday in Apure state in southern
Venezuela along with Venezuelan Eilas Barando while on a fishing
trip near the Colombian border.
</P>
<P>
Davies said that the U.S. government has no firsthand
information on the whereabouts of the kidnapped, but the
Venezuelan authorities were trying to find out who was responsible
for the kidnapping. The U.S. embassy in Caracas is working on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Colombian narcotics traffickers stole a
nearby Cessna 301 plane and fled back to their country with
Shaffer and Barando.

<HEADLINE> US Warns Israel Against Road-Building Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
warned Israel not to press ahead with a road-building project
around Jerusalem at least "at this time."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government decided today to speed building of roads
in and around East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim to be
the capital of a future state.
</P>
<P>
"We would have preferred that the action just taken by the
Israeli government not have been taken at this time," State
Department spokesman Glyn Davies told a regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israelis should act in ways to "build confidence
and enhance prospects for future progress" since they signed an
agreement on Hebron, under which Israel handed over 80 percent of
the West Bank city to Palestinian control by pullback of its
troops.
</P>
<P>
"We would prefer to see steps taken now which continue to build
positive momentum," Davies said.
</P>
<P>
According to the road-building project, there will be three
highways linking the coastal plains and Jerusalem. One highway
will run from Israel's coastal plain, through the West Bank, to
northern Jerusalem. A second is to ring Jerusalem from the east,
and a third will cut across the West Bank to a plain southeast of
the city.
</P>
<P>
The road project, Davies noted, was originally approved by the
former Labor government of Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in
1995.

<HEADLINE> R&AMP;D Budget Cuts Create Problems for US Scientists: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- An official from the American
Association for the Advancement of Science today called on the
public and industrial community to fully understand and support
scientific research activities following budget cuts by the
federal government in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Scientific research is so complex that needs a lot of money,"
said Richard Nicholson, executive officer of the AAAS. "The
slowdown of budget support by the government for basic research
has become the major problem for scientists, especially for young
scientists in this country."
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, also publisher of the Science magazine, said that he
believes one of the ways to solve the problem is to draw financial
support from the public and industrial community. He added that is
one of the goals the AAAS has been trying to achieve by organizing
annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
Public and industrial support for scientific research
activities becomes more important following the federal
government's emphasis to balance its total budget, which leads to
less support for basic research, particularly for research and
development (R&AMP;D), Nicholson explained in an exclusive interview
with Xinhua at the conclusion of the AAAS annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
The R&AMP;D budget, the main financial source for U.S. scientists
and researchers, shows no increase in recent years in constant
U.S. dollars. The new budget for fiscal 1997-98 proposed by
President Bill Clinton last week shows that the R&AMP;D share will
decrease 0.4 percent. All these are main factors leading young
post-graduates with PH.D difficult to find suitable jobs in
research institutions or universities.
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is to show the public community what they
can enjoy from the new breakthroughs and new findings by
scientists," Nicholson said, predicting this may bring financial
investment from non-governmental sections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the trends from scientific research activities in
this country, Nicholson said the internationalization is the
obvious one. He said that cooperation between scientists in
different countries is helpful, even important, in the changing
world.
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason we invited foreign scientists to the AAAS
annual meeting," the executive officer said, adding that the
number of this year's foreign participants rises to a little less
than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another trend Nicholson saw from the AAAS conference is the
penetration of scientific research from one science to
multi-science. He pointed to the fact that scientific research
works are connected each other, believing that more sophisticated
scientists are, more breakthroughs they may achieve.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed today, with London and Paris both in the negative
ground on a weak dollar and Wall Street's disappointing
performance, and Frankfurt hitting a new record closing high.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London lost all their morning's gains, with
the FTSE 100 index closing down 5.5 points after Wall Street
stocks failed to make headway in early dealing.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that prices had been underpinned by a public
sector debt repayment of 5.8 billion pounds (9.3 billion US
dollars) in January, the biggest for eight years.
</P>
<P>
The market was also dragged lower by Barclays, which reported
profits at the lower end of predictions, and by growing concerns
about the strength of sterling.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt market, which closed before Wall Street opened,
ended the session at a new record closing high, with the DAX-30
index up 43.59 points at 3,276.16, powered by the continuing
strength of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the index was now set for an assault on the
3,300 threshold.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse also lost their early gains after
profit-taking and a slow start on Wall Street sent share prices
tumbling from record highs, with the CAC-40 index closing 16.96
points lower at 2,617.52.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 5.5
points down at 4,332.3. In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index closed
43.59 points higher at a record 3,276.16. The Paris CAC-40 index
finished down 16.96 points at 2,617.52.

<HEADLINE> US: Ties With India to Move on Despite Mutual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said today that the U.S. relations with India will move on
despite mutual expulsions of each other's diplomats.
</P>
<P>
"It's important that India and the United States move on from
here," State Department spokesman Glyn Davies told reporters at a
regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The United States expelled two Indian diplomats stationed in
San Francisco and Chicago Sunday in retaliation for India's
expulsion of two American officials in New Delhi last month.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the United States expelled the two Indian diplomats
because of their "activities incompatible with their consular
status."
</P>
<P>
He affirmed there was no link between the Indian decision to
expel the American diplomats and the subsequent U.S. expulsion of
the Indian consulars.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. follow-up expulsion was seen here as
retaliation in reaction to India's decision.
</P>
<P>
One of the American diplomats asked to leave India last month
was reported to be the station chief of the CIA in New Dehli, who
the Press Trust Trust of India said had "unauthorized" links with
an Indian official in charge of the anti-espionage division of
India's Intelligence Bureau.
